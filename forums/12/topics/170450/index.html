            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The date is 14 November 2005 and it's a very special day for me. Having finished my N level during OCtober time. I'm basically slacking at home. Then in somewhere ard starting of November i start going to arcade to play some drum games.<br><br>After some time, i notice a few kids playing the drum game also. THen slowly i get to know them one by one. THey were all 12 years old except for 1 same age as me and another 1 who is 14. I became their "big bro" for that time. David is the guy who is the same age as me. And i'm 16 now.<br>At 14 November 2005, suddenly a gal came in to the drum area and find David. Here is how i  felt when i saw her: I'm like a place that is lifeless. A place where is 2 noisy to hear any thing, like someone's drilling the floor that kinda of noisyness. A place where there is no colours, everytthing is black and white. A place that is dark, but u can still see things. When that moment she came, everything changed. It's like a sudden beam of light shining at that place. When she walk past, everything is filled with colours. The noisy place suddenly became quiet, like the time is stopped. Sorry, it might b complicated to understand.<br><br>Anyway i have thoughts of getting to know her.<br><br>At first i thought she is David's gal, but she wasn't.<br><br>THen on 15 November 2005, that gal came and find David again to talk. THis time I went off with them together as a group of 4 including the gal and a kid name Jason. We went to talk at a nearby playground near Jp. Then i slowly get to know her and then she told me abt her life. Her name is  Pei ting, Jenifer.<br><br>At the playground, we talk and joke ard and then Jenifer said she was tired and began leaning her head on my shoulder. WOW man, i fellt great as this is a first time a gal lean on my shoulder. She work in KFC at that time. Then after that we accompanied her to wait for bus. She then asked me for my phone number. Of course i gave it to her.<br><br>Slowly after that, she begin to sms me and asked me to meet her after her work frm KFC at JP. Then we know each other quite well and our friendship began to improve.<br><br>I told my pals i had began to like her and i woo her in a week''s time.<br><br>She told me that she had a abusing life all along. talking abt that her ex and some of her old friends beated her and stuff. Even her older sis hit her 2. Ok i began to pity her life.<br><br>Things between me and her get closer each every day. Then my chalet day has come and it was on 21 November 2005. I asked her over and she agreed. Things became so good that day that we stead on that day. And it was exactly a week. We fell in love naturally. Then she had to leave on the next day as she needs to work. Btw she have already changed her job frm KFC to sales assistant in Fasio cosmetics. SO i ave no choice but to sent her off to her workplace frm my pasir ris chalet to her home in Boon Lay and later on to her work place in CCK. I have no complains because she is ma gal. Well i done the same things for the rest of that week. Sending her off to work and back to home.<br><br>And then, things slowly started to change..<br><br>Quarlled on the 2nd week because i'm not happy that she is with dudes. Some days she told me that i don need to find her during break time because she has dude accompanying her for lunch. OK i asked for the reason and she said " i don wish to spend your bucks". FIne man. Nth to say but endure. Rest of week is a shitty one. AS she know that i would get extremely angry if she told me she is with guys. SO she lied. SHe gave a stupid lie. She said her older sis and her bf came and fetch her home. Didn't make sense at all as she told me b4 that her sis need to work. SO i went to check it out. Indeed man, i saw her at JP with a guy. I went home and give her a good scolding. I forgave her.<br><br>Everday i have to endure something and that were phone calls frm those faggots. I always heard names such as Ck kor kor, Theophirus, Lincoln, Sebastian( this guy is highlighted, tell u why later on) and her "godbros" at Jp. WtF man. Finally i can't take it longer.<br><br>I quarelled with her. Actually shouldn't b using that word. Cause i'm scolded her actually. And she gave lame reason such as " U must trust me!".  To hell with that... I gave her a chance. Let me introduce these lil imps one by one.<br><br>THe first fag: Ck kor kor<br><br>A 26 year old man with a bike ( no big shit man) working in IP zone at CCK mall. Lot 1 actually. Saw my gal as they are working at the same mall. Smiled to her daily when came across her. And eventually, asked for number. He have a lousy hairstyle, and not really that good looking. My gal told me that he is jus doting on her, not after her. CRAP MAN! CK, i jus wanted to say, your plan is exploited by me! You are using lame excuse to date her. DUde, CK kor kor, u are a old man so stop going after a gal who is younger by  10 years. Go suck a dick seriously and stop fucking dreaming.<br><br>2nd fag: Theo<br><br>Age unknown, but definitely not as old as CK. Met my gal at Clementi thru Arcade, asked for her contacts. THis idiot have been disturbing her with calls and SMS(s). Really 1 disturbing dude but not really a major rival or competitor to me. Theo, work harder man! ^_^ Do something else other then phoning and spamming.<br><br>3rd Fag: Lincoln<br><br>Age should b ard 16 to 18. A dude workinng as sales assistant at some Singtel or Starhub shop. Heard frm my gal that he is frm 369. Likes to act gangsterism and talk cocks. In fact a small dick. Again met my gal at CCK mall as they work the same place, asked for contacts eventually. Saw me and my gal outside the mall talking. After that he called her and said that i'm a eyesore. Even more nonsense he said was that lucky it was him, if it was other ppl would already have kick my ass. BULLSHIT!! He's actually a small dick and not  frm some gang. Jus talking crap was his profession. When my gal told him to said that phrase infront of me, he took cover immediately. Lincoln, u are a disgrace to the USA's former president as u bare the same name as him.<br><br>Last fag: Sebastian ( primary rival )<br><br>The major needle in the eye. Age 16 - 20 with dyed hair n wearing specs. Met my gal thru CLementi arcade (again man). He wasn't the major rival in the past but now he is! MOre information abt him will b introduce in the story later on... Btw he is taller then me, abit.<br><br>3rd week is the week where the fate changes. She is transfered to another mall instead of CCK. As u guys may know, she is constantly needing ppl for accompany. So she asked Sebastian for the job. SHe stole a free gift from the cosmetics company she is working in and place it in his bag. They got arrested of coruse and was detained in Cop Station for a night. So Sebas became the hero of the day in her eyes. The next day she jus called and said let's break without a valid reason. SHe said she owned him. Wat shit man.. LAter on she think a while and took back her words. THen she is often with Sebas. She said she wants both me and him. WTF!! Why must i share my gal with this MF!! I don get it. After that i often argued with her and of course, a good scolding for her.<br><br>THen i decided to do something for the sake of the 3 of us..<br><br>I choose to give her up to Sebastian.<br><br>I dunno if this sacrifice was worth it or not, but i rather i sad then the 3 of us suffer.<br><br>4th week is the final week. I saw her with Sebas at JP intimating. My pals saw em and inform me abt it. Details is written in the previous post. I sent her home almost daily regardless of weather. I'm running a fever for 2 bloody weeks and didnt even whine abt it and still sent her home. My family members don like me being with her but i still insist on it. THere are more things abt her. 2 much to say here man. Watever it is, i scolded her everyday during this  week. She bloody deserverd it. ANd finally i can't take it no longer. I have given her countless of chances but she don appreciates it. SO i end everything. NO even friends.<br><br>SO Sebas didn't do shit and reap the fruits. I was mad at her of course. I dunno WTF IS ON HER MIND!! WAS so mad that i hate her to the core and end our friendship ties. But she rejected and insists on it and blackmailing me that she wanted to jump off the building or some sort of suiciding. TO HELL WITH THAT U ASSS!! IF u wanna jump then stop talking and i welcome u anytime to my area and jump!! I hate her now seriously. I'm starting to think that this is a major scam rather then a relationship<br><br>She's a waste of my time and money. Of course her guy now is Sebas. I really feel like whacking his ass to CHina town when i saw them intimating at JP. Actually is Hui ling and Desmond who saw them. THen they inform me abt it. I tailed them and got angered immediately. I can say i almost took some sort of weapons and go whack him. They stop me, then they consoled me. I left Jp with 40 kinds of sadness. I feel like playing jigsaw game (if u had watched Saw the movie..) with them. Yeah i am some sort of psycho killer.<br><br>And after the break...<br><br>Jus like a car that is travelling on a straight road, suddenly it makes a ski on the road while steering to another path. It leaves a mark on the road permanently. Thou the car had already left the road, the mark continue to remain there till weathering or someone who amend the road then it will disappear. This is how i felt right now. Yes she had alreayd left off with another guy but the scar she left behind will always be in my heart. A deep scar indeed. Every moment and then i will keep thinking abt us. Me and her in the past.<br><br>I DON sleep during the nights these few days. The reason? I'm trying to escape from something. And when i sleep when the morning comes, i will sleep till the late afternoon. Because i don want to remind myslef of the sad relationship. Because in the morning i will always meet her for breakfast and then sent her off to work. After all, that was all the past. I jus wanna forget abt the incident but i don think i can do it.<br><br>Went to buy some Tigers yesterday. Beer i mean. So that i can get drunk and forget all abt it. Doesn't works, i drank 3 cans and didn't get drunk. So i went off to Jp for lunch and a walk, hoping that will works. Well in fact it's making it worst. When i saw couples intimating, i think of us again. When i went arcade, the  memories came back again. SO i went to LJS, bought a combo 1 and went to some low seat tables under the MRT railway and eat it. I'm alone, so lonely. WHen she needs someone for lunch during her breaks i will always by her side and right now when i need someone for lunch and she wasn't here. And.. it's TIger time i think. This time i'm really drunk. Went home and lie on the floor in my room and slept for a while. Woke up and use the com till now.<br><br>Now i think i'm additcted to beer. I'm jus sad, not angry with wat she had done.<br></div>
