Only be sad or think about it after the result is out.  Anyway in test and exams, u don't know how to do, look around and see everyone writing, just don't care lah, how u know they writing correct answers, they may be digging their own grave.<br><br>Just clear your mind and take a deep breath, u should be able to do them if u relax.  Don't panic and rush ahead.  Doing them correct is more important then anyhow do and fill in all the wrong answers.<br><br>Because now in uni, in exams out of 4 questions i do only 2 questions and i can still score a B grade, while others say they did 4 but got only a C grade.  It is not the number of questions u answered, but the ones u got correct.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>If i remember i told u before you should trust yourself and your boyfriend more.  If he strays, then so be it, he is not the one for you.<br><br>The more important thing now is the exams coming, u still got a few months more to go, there is enough time for revisions to get a nice grade.  And study smart, not just hard.<br><br>Remember to do timed papers, so u can better manage your time management, if u don't know how to do some questions, skip them and come back later, u must know how much time to allocate to each questions, time management is the number 1 important thing in exam.</div>

At a tender age of 16, i guess you should really think what is your future and not focusing into BGR. Of course i have no obligations or objections for young bgr, but look, if you want a healthy relationship, please have more faith in your partner.<br><br>Or after doing some soul searching, perhaps did he complain to you that you are ugly or he dun like being with you? Sometimes good looking boys does not means he is a chick magnet. If you did what you as a girlfriend should do, and he really leaves you, then no matter how hard you tries, its still pointless.<br><br>Secondly, if you really wanna get good grades, you die die must do <strong>ten-years-series</strong>. Its the ultimately guidebook to olevel success. Plus, if you focus everything in your boyfriend, there's no way your grades will be flying. Its really a double edge situation although i did heard of cases where both study together by motivating each other and score good grades.<br><br>How old is your boyfriend <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

It does you no good mentally<br>and intellectually when you keep thinking frustrated and disappointed over the first slip up at the first station. It's like dropping one egg and fretting over it and forgetting about the other 9 unbroken eggs. Those 9 eggs will get broken easily if you don't focus your mind and attention on keeping the 9 eggs unbroken. It's not about the 1 broken egg to worry about - it's the other 9 unbroken eggs. What's done cannot be undone but what's not done can be done if different techniques, effort and places are necessary. Be confident. Look ahead, not back. Be strong mentally, not worryingly weak.

            <div class='col-md body'>Being an illiterally hadicapped in the Chinese language , if you intend to go to the poly , then chinese is not really a major consideration. Besides , with a D7 , you still can get into a JC provided you meet the L1 R5 requirement.<br>But the problem here is with D7 , you have to retake your O levels chinese in the following year in the JC before progressing on to A levels Chinese.<br><br>I had an ungraded for oral and a D7 for Chinese. To me , I see no point in getting good grades for Chinese , let alone even passing the exam as I wanted to go to a polytechnic cause the JC life did not appeal to me and I can't stand wearing uniforms for an extra 2-3 years.<br><br>It all depends where you wanna go after your O levels.....<br><br>As for the BGR problem , concentrate on your studies first. Get an O level certificate first at the very least then start thinking of BGR. That's what some of my friends eventually did. Super guai kia in secondary school then after O levels graduate liao , become full time player.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  obviously I'm not asking you to go for these type of guys lah , but rather to show you the contrary that's all....<br><br>Good luck in your future endeavours  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Oh by the way , I took my O levels last year</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my advice about study groups is to restrict it to no more than 3 members including yourself.<br><br>Try not to listen to your discman/mp3 or any other listening devices while studying. Chances are your friends will be like ,"eh what song you listening ah?" "oh Rammstein ah!!!! Wha lau eh , their keyboardist and vocalist damn power seh!!!!" blar blar blar and the story goes on....<br><br>I'm not restricting the use of a listening device but I'm not encouraging it.<br><br>Some like to stay back in school and study while others prefer to study in the comfort of their own room. For me , my school always opens it's library doors for us to do our own self study. It's called the Night Study Programme. It helped me a lot because I could hardly spend more than an hour on my books when studying at home.<br><br>So it all boils down to your own self preference.<br><br>Please for the love of God , study hard for your O levels. To tell you the truth , I got distracted from girls during my secondary 4 days and seriously I don't know how I managed to do it , but somehow it came naturally. I guess my books were a source of distraction for me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> .<br><br>But now look at me lah , girl problems blar blar blar....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You can forget about your BGR problems by keeping yourself occupied. This is the time where you will need the company of your friends BADLY (especially your closes ones). Spend as much free time you have with your friends (outings , lunch , pool etc). Ditch that Mofo for a time being and concentrate on your studies. Trust me , after your O levels you will have ample of opportunities to search for BETTER guys IN TERMS OF THEIR HEART AND NOT PHYSICAL FEATURES. if you intend to go to the polys , 6 months is already considered ample time to search for a new guy in your life. If you intend to go to the JCs , then erm......you have to decide for yourself cause I'm not in a JC now...so I don't know what's life like in a JC.</div>

I just wanna shut myself out from everything..<br><br>I hate my life. I think I won't achieve anything big in life.. I worked hard, my results still suck. From pants to skirts, from short hair to long hair, from nerdy specs to cool dark frames, I'm still ugly. My bf is quite a good looking guy, I always think he's out with girls, because he's so good looking, I also think he's embarrassed to have such an ugly gf. I feel bad.<br><br>And I'm having my O this year. I really am afraid.. I've done what I think should be done. Now after my Oral, I think I'm even more screwed up.. I'm scared, I'm stupid, I'm just a nobody.. Haixx..<br><br>What can I or What do I do now... Haixx..</div></blockquote>u are not scre w up coz i hav seen more screw up ppl than u....a group walk abreast when u approaching them then purposely knock on you or act blur look into other direction knock u...but still cannot knock u down nothin they can achieve with the feat and purhaps in life...see more failures out there than yrself..olevel is not the end...even a degree is not the end...if u feel that poor results or no cert is a failure...i no one can help u anymore coz u hav lost to yr low self-esteem oredi <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
