If this were an economics class, I'd liken it to the realisation of a "self-fulfilling prophecy" arising from a made-believed "supply-and-demand" market. I suppose, looking at it holistically, it's such practices which fuel the growth of more guys having the mindset to conduct themselves in an honourable manner even to the most dishonourable women they come across (just so that they'd outdo other guys) that is of greater concern than such guys being exploited...</div>

I've come across average-looking women with a well-to-do job and education (basically, it's degree holders we're talking about since I'm in a top-notch financial firm) who think the world of their own self-worth whose expectations (be it in terms of looks or financial stability) of their partners are nothing short of exceptional. In short, the sort of qualities they expect their partners to possess should dwarf theirs by a long mile (be it the personal income or educational background) - and they're pretty obstinate about not considering anyone who falls short of these expectations. Even then, these same folks would tell me even if a guy who met their expectations existed and were within sight, they wouldn't initiate the first move. In essence, it's a clear reflection of how some - subconsciously or otherwise - price themselves out of the market in the process. I wouldn't blame eligible men (in terms of meeting the requirements set out by such women) not hitting on such women simply because I don't think it's realistic to contemplate having a serious relationship with someone who shows absolutely no inclination to make sacrifices in this relationship and comes in with a profit-oriented mindset.<br><br>Now, isn't that a case of mismatching reality and expectations? Try imagining someone scoring straight C's and actually expects Harvard to make an offer to them and you'd get the drift of how ridiculous some expectations can be...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Equal education opportunities for both sexes does not mean males and females will end up equally intelligent. To be academically smart just shows that the person is capable of memorizing or storing information efficiently. To apply that intelligence to real life is another matter. The tendency for intellects is to analyze and dissect what is fair and not fair when the truth to being successful in ALL aspects of life requires IQ + EQ.<br><br>To my interpretation, EQ is being street smart. To be able to assess situations, make finger-snapping decisions based on a win-win solution by adapting oneself to think and feel like others. Mastering the art of bringing out the best in people and speaking to them on the same wavelengths is a skill that is best learnt by being ultra attentive and receptive to the differences in human nature. It takes years to do that.<br><br>Just because a female receives the same education as a male, that does not mean the female is automatically on par with the male intellectually or vice versa. When it comes to courtesy, like who pays for a meal, it is basically up to the female or male to compromise.<br><br>TS, if your gf make comments about her sister's bf, indirectly she is envying her sister's lifestyle BUT, that does not mean she expects you to provide her the same lavish gifts her sister got from her bf. Take it this way, she is NOT her sister and I believe that's what she wishes - to have the looks, personality and characteristics of her sister. Do you see it now?</div>

When the guy is struggling to make ends meet, will you suddenly back out of the relationship? Is love and relationship all about money now that both sexes can have their own income source? If we observe true love between two reasonable persons carefully, the money problem is not an issue. It's only a problem for women with a monetary agenda.<br><br>Are you saying you want to be a tai-tai and shake leg forever? lol<br><br>I have seen a lot of girls demanding this and that from their bf. Should that be the case? Love should just be simple enjoyment between both parties, instead of suspicion, distrust and unreasonable demands.<br><br>Enough of what you-can-do-for-me ideas.
