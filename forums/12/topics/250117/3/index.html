The irony in this is they expect their beaus(or those courting them) to exhibit chivalry of the highest order(some are ridiculous to the point that even if you asked them out as colleagues after work, they'd actually expect you to pay). I'd liken this example to someone who can't pass his PSLE but [b]expects</strong> to get admitted to Harvard. It's got something to do with the culture as much as anything...[/b]</blockquote>'Cause you must show you are a "gentleman" so you must pay for me. you must show you are a "gentleman" by taking the drinks for me. Everything I ask you to do you must obey because that's what a gentleman is supposed to be. ...somehow the meaning of gentleman has been twisted for those who benefit them.<br><br>I get your point.

We are bound by the rules of the world. Status, fame, wealth, power, etc, etc. The very things that make others envious, but in the end they can be taken away and lost in a split second.<br><br>Fleeting 'accessories'.<br><br>Who wants to marry a poor guy who can't make the ends meet? Who wants to be with someone who is not financially sound? Won't you have to worry about 3 meals a day and a roof over your head? Let alone have spare change for luxury items?<br><br>When our internal survival mindset is based on the rules of the world, we will find someone who can provide well and ensure stability, materialistically. We will focus more on all these stuffs and observe less of other things BECAUSE nothing of this world is for certain. We fear instability, we lack faith, we do not even know our own footing on 'the ground'.<br><br>So for guys/gals/others who know and would like to be with such people who is so obsessed with material 'security', I have a cruel comment for you: You are better off without them. Emptiness in their hearts, fears, insecurities, obsessions, etc, etc.<br><br>In the end when we are all old and about to leave this world, WHAT can we take with us on the way? Money? Power? Status? Fame? What we can take is ourselves only. Our personality, behaviour, manner of speech and thoughts and some others.<br><br>Ya sure, without financial security, how to survive? Its something we are bound and trapped in. Can't be helped. Have to make a living, make ends meet.<br><br>What we can do with our lives, however, is something that is up to us. We may not be able to control the results, but at least we can control our actions.<br><br>(Paiseh abit off track, but I do NOT wanna comment on gender issues.

In many parts of the world, women wouldn't even accept - much less expect - freebies on a regular basis from men with whom they do not envisage a romantic future. In such cultures, if a man offered to buy a woman dinner and she accepts the offer, it's a cue in itself for the man to proceed further. Ironically, in Singapore, I've seen quite a number of cases whereby women would have no qualms accepting freebies repeatedly (on the pretext of claiming the offers are made to them) from men whom they themselves do not fancy, sending out the wrong signals to such men, only to lament about the overzealousness of such men who interpret such acts as a cue to proceed further. Talk about social etiquette.<br><br>It's hard justifying a case to shower excessive chivalry on people who do not exercise social etiquette responsibly...</div></blockquote>well said</div>

However, I would only tell them this when they grow up to be a adult.<br><br>No parents, in the right mind, will want their kids, who is still schooling, to date. Do your parents support you having boyfriend during sec sch or during your poly life? Ok during poly, some parents might be fine with their kids dating but during sec sch? I bet majority of the parents would want their kids steer clear from bgr.<br><br>If the above is true, do you seriously think parents will instilled in their head that they should avoid losers so she will not suffer? Even if the parents do tell their kids to avoid losers, I doubt they are referring to having a loser as a boyfriend/girlfriend but referring to having losers to be their friends, afraiding it might affect their kids' performance in sch and daily life.<br><br>Peer pressure for boyfriend/girlfriend? How about peer pressure for branded items and smoking and stuffs related which is more likely?<br><br>Yes yes, all woman want to have a bf or spouse they can be proud of but when a women chosen a guy as their spouse, aren't they proud of them already, regardless is it status or personality. If not, why do they even choose them in the first place? If you are going to say they don't have a choice, I say that's bull. Why? Like I mentioned earlier, if a women and a guy are not attracted to each other in some ways, do you seriously think they would be together? Even if they are together, they would fall out before they would even think of getting married.<br><br>Yup some humans do behave like animals, but sadly, they are locked up in Changi zoo (for Singapore) and are allowed to be visited by those with humanly soul.<br></div>
