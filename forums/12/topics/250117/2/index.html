Opening doors? I agree. Paying for food/drinks? This is very subjective. Nowadays, girls have their own income. And the guy is still expected to pay?<br><br>lol...This is ok for the first few times. Maybe it's a hidden rule or something. But it cannot go on forever. Why? We don't know if the girl has a hidden agenda under the pretext of a date. Is she making use of free drinks/food/company ? Remember, there are some girls who only go for rich guys only because these rich guys have the financial muscle to entertain the girl. You can say asking a girl out on a date is actually a liability.<br><br>There's a difference between a gentleman and being taken for a fool. Wait, how about we just turn the tables around and expect what the girl can do for you?<br>-She wants you to be a gentleman. Can you expect her to be a lady? I think it's reasonable.<br>-She wants you to do everything for her. Does that smell of a princess who wants to treat you like a maid? Do girls who love their bf do this? What about you expect what she can do for you?<br><br>Don't get me wrong. Try to balance things. Don't make use of girls neither should you be taken for a fool. A girl who gives you a lot of trouble is not worth having. Think about it TS.<br><br>doko</div>

The irony in this is they expect their beaus(or those courting them) to exhibit chivalry of the highest order(some are ridiculous to the point that even if you asked them out as colleagues after work, they'd actually expect you to pay). I'd liken this example to someone who can't pass his PSLE but <strong>expects</strong> to get admitted to Harvard. It's clearly a mismatch of reality and expectations. It's got something to do with the culture as much as anything...</div>
