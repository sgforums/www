            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I kinda of agree with your friends philosophy. If I don't love her with all my heart, why do I bother to love her at all in the first place? Since I have initate the RS I have a responsibility to see it through no matter how it ends. Although personally I doubt I will be the 1 to initate a breakup.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its not to love her becos of responsibility, its to make sure that you when you love some 1 its your responsibility to love her with all your heart. Its really 2 different things to love becos of responsibilty and to love with all responsibility, at least I think its different. One is becos you try to do it for sake of duty while the other is u do the duties becos of love.</div>

It shouldn't be a responibility...forcing yourself to love somebody because of responsibility..then is it still love?<br><br>At least, if he treated me well...yes I will be very depressed for a long long time..coz why...he was so nice to me before..but now, his attitude changed...but be grateful that he did give me the warmth, the love perhaps..the best that he could give..<br><br>if u truly love somebody, no matter how nice or bad he treated u, i think, u are bound to feel hurt.  </span></div>
