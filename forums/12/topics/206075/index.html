            <div class='col-md body'>No offence, but I think I can see why you have high bp - you're giving yourself too much undue pressure.<br><br>If the doctor tells you that you need to take the medication to control your BP, then you need to listen to him on this. Just because your BP is under control is no reason for you to stop taking your medication. If you are given medications, you must complete the course unless the doctor says otherwise.<br><br>In the first place, I fail to see why you should consider yourself 'unlucky' to have high BP. It's true that people with high BP are at higher risk of heart diseases, but it can be controlled with proper medication, diet, exercise, and stress management.<br><br>If you want to know, I have somewhat high BP as well - 134/110. My systolic (maximum) BP is slightly elevated, but my diastolic (minimum) BP of 110 is cause for concern. In other words, even when I'm resting, my blood pressure's high.<br><br>So far I've been taking steps to help control the situation, like regular exercise and proper stress management. You can control your situation too, if you want to make the effort to do so.</div>

So being fat, i have a very high chance of diabetes at young age like all my uncles and my dad. With High BP, it makes it easier. So currently, i am taking the medicine u mentioned, athenolol. Take it as your doctor prescribed, dun joke and act on his advice, like for me, to reduce my weight. for my case, i have to be on medication even if the BP shows up normal...becos only when i truly reduce my weight and manage it and have a healthy lifestyle, its dangerous for me to go off the medication</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi dun panic. Did you take any salty food 1 or 2 hours before you took your BP? If yes, naturally your BP will be high. Dun need to take your BP every 30 minutes. Just do it a few times a day will do if you are really that worried. And dun take your BP so soon after you take salty food, even a few strands of fries made my BP shoot up to 160 so dun worry unnecessary, it does u no good. Take your medication, that should keep your BP consistent daily.</div>

That's the source of your problem: you are panicking too much and giving yourself too much pressure.<br><br>Maybe you don't realise it; but I see a vicious cycle here:<br><br>1. You get high blood pressure.<br>2. You panic as a result.<br>3. Your panicking increases your blood pressure.<br>4. You panic even more because of the increased blood pressure.<br>And then it goes back to step 1.<br><br>Instead of confining yourself to testing with that device, why don't you follow the advice we've been dishing out to you? Take your medication regularly, follow a well-balanced diet, and exercise regularly. Worrying only worsens your blood pressure. On the other hand, stepping out of your house and jogging a couple of klicks will help you feel a whole lot better.<br><br>Trust me on this. That's what I do when I'm under a lot of pressure: I go jogging.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there..<br><br>Dun get so upset over this matter.. Majority of us,singaporean are being diagnosed with hypertension (High BP) / Diabetes / Both.. You are not alone..<br><br>It isn tat u couldn live a normal lifestyle when u're diagnosed with hypertension.. In wat way do you feel tat u can't?<br><br>The onli setback is that you have to be on constant medications.. You reali shld continue your medications, till the doctor deems it fit to stop..<br><br>A fact is that.. Hypertension, same as diabetes, is a lifelong "commitment". Taking medications will help keep your pressure in the normal range..<br><br>In hypertension, our bld are being pumped at a higher pressure, as explained by many of our fellow forumers out here.. Imagine our bld vessel as a rubber band.. As it expands &amp; expands to withstand the tremendous pumping pressure, eventually one dae, it'll weaken &amp; burst..<br><br>When this happens, stroke strikes in.. It's beta to take precaution than regret when it happens.. Think, how much more worst a stoke can cause disruption to ur life, as compared to the daily taking of medication..<br><br>I noe of someone.. He feels fine.. He refused to take his medication.. Suddenly.. One dae, he fainted @ his workplace.. Send to the hosp.. He was diagnosed with partial stroke tat left him weak on 1 side of his body..<br>He was filled with regrets..<br><br>I guess you are unsure, thus worried about your condition..<br><br>Taking ur regular supply of medicaions, u need to go to the doc occassionaly to monitor ur progress, get new supply of medications.. Tak the chance &amp; ask ur doc.. To clear ur doubts.. He / she would be the best person to consult..<br><br>Type online search.. High blood pressure / hypertension..<br><br>You will find alot of information tat might be useful to you..<br><br>Of coz.. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle.. Eat wisely.. Less salt.. Exercises..
