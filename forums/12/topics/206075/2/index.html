Yourself or to be done by some lab tech?<br><br>Do your doctor even know that you're stopping your medication...?

When u take yr blood pressure in the clinic yr pressure is high but when u take it at home its alright, most of the measuring device like omron its quite accurate if you follow the instruction. i last time also liddat watch too much NKF show then worry here n there in the end is me myself who make myself panic thats why when i take the blood pressure in the clinic the reading so high but i measure it myself at home its ok. haha.  But anyway high blood pressure is not that scary, if you can control yr diets and exercise regularly you dont have to take medicine, maintain it at 130/80 for hypertension pple is ok. but if its 140/90 and above then muz take medicine liao dont play play. cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
