It seems a case of battery<br><br>Typically, he'll have to prove 3 things, directness, interference and unlawfulness.<br><br>He can also leave it to the police or he can report it and file this suit against them. It's up to him. But its best that he consults a lawyer before taking any action. Get it quick because the limitations for civil actions regarding intentional torts is typically shorter than those for unintentional torts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By the way, get him to retrieve a copy of his police report. It will cause unhappiness in the station for those in-charge of the reports, but it's essential that his civil action does not contradict his police report.<br><br>Certain things to look out for are provocation and self-defence by either party. Also, if your friend was challenged to a fight and he agrees, meaning he expressly or implictly gives consent, he's done too.<br><br>Basically, it is typically easier to prove a civil rather than a criminal action as the standard of proof is lower in civil action. Go for it if he really thinks it worth it.</div>
