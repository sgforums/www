              <p>I am 27 male, i knew this lady friend for a close to 2 years. I admit i used to be attracted by the way she carry herself, tough  and cool. About 2 months ago we had dinner and i just commented i used to like her and she said she feel the same way 1 year ago.</p>
              <p>Anyway she was attached at that time but  we both are single now, anyway to cut things short. Yesterday we were chatting at msn at working hours, i told her my indian CEO is coming for a visit so basically my company is a subsidiary based in indians. ( i am a chinese btw)</p>
              <p>I think she was in bad mood yesterday, anyway i was chatting with my other chinese colleagues  as we saw the indian boss, his managers and other senior staff are indian too. So we were joking how nice if we were to be indian too.  </p>
              <p>So one of my colleague put in his msn quote: <strong>i wish i am an indian</strong>. Soon about 4 or 5 other chinese colleague put the same quote, i follow suit. Suddenly that female friend keep bombing my msn with this:</p>
              <p> why you want to be indian? You like to dance around trees? Why are you so childish? Can you grow up? Or you want to eat curry to grow up. i was kinda piss off, so i just log off my msn. She immediately sms me, if you are angry do not vent it on me, you better say sorry.</p>
              <p>Maybe i was rude in logging msn but she was rude to me before, she also logged off the msn when there is conflict previously and she like to use the word "WHATEVER". The thing is i do not mind saying sorry but i just do not like the way she practically chased me to say sorry </p>

              <p>her attacks are all based on her narrow stereotyping of bollywood stuffs. maybe she never mix with any real indians before</p>
              <p>and this "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">you are angry do not vent it on me, you better say sorry.</span>" By logging off to prevent continuation of conflict = vent the anger on me ????</p>

              Do you really think you're in the wrong and oughta apologize? Apologizing for sake of keeping peace is not gonna work in the long term.
              
              Anyway, my take is she sounds immature.

              <p>i think immature isn't the right word.. i think self centered is a better word.</p>
              <p>hmm.. saying sorry doesn't have to be because of a moral issue.</p>
              <p>i've learnt that, saying sorry simply means you regret smth that happened, it doesn't really mean that it has to be your fault.</p>

              <p>I am 27 male, i knew this lady friend for a close to 2
              years. I admit i used to be attracted by the way she carry
              herself, tough  and cool. About 2 months ago we had
              dinner and i just commented i used to like her and she said
              she feel the same way 1 year ago.</p>
              <p>Anyway she was attached at that time but  we both are
              single now, anyway to cut things short. Yesterday we were
              chatting at msn at working hours, i told her my
              indian CEO is coming for a visit so basically my company is a
              subsidiary based in indians. ( i am a chinese btw)</p>
              <p>I think she was in bad mood yesterday, anyway i was
              chatting with my other chinese colleagues  as we saw the
              indian boss, his managers and other senior staff are indian too. So
              we were joking how nice if we were to be indian too.  </p>
              <p>So one of my colleague put in his msn quote: <strong>i wish i am
              an indian</strong>. Soon about 4 or 5 other chinese colleague put
              the same quote, i follow suit. Suddenly that female friend keep
              bombing my msn with this:</p>
              <p> why you want to be indian? You like to dance around trees?
              Why are you so childish? Can you grow up? Or you want to eat curry
              to grow up. i was kinda piss off, so i just log off my msn. She
              immediately sms me, if you are angry do not vent it on me, you
              better say sorry.</p>
              <p>Maybe i was rude in logging msn but she was rude to me before,
              she also logged off the msn when there is conflict previously and
              she like to use the word "WHATEVER". The thing is i do not mind
              saying sorry but i just do not like the way she practically
              chased me to say sorry </p>
              <p> </p>
