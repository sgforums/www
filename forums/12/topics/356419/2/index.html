              <p>well,  from what i read, i feel that she think shes the queen, so she is calling the shots and able to throw tantrums around. good old advise, i think you can find someone else better than her.</p>
              <p>its <strong>not</strong> wrong to follow the trans within your colleague, 'i wish i am a indian'. And who is she to say "why you want to be indian? You like to dance around trees? Why are you so childish? Can you grow up? Or you want to eat curry to grow up. i was kinda piss off, so i just log off my msn. She immediately sms me, <strong>if you are angry do not vent it on me, you better say sorry</strong>." - if i were you, i will tell her, you aint my mom, fuck you.you did no wrong.</p>
              <p>is she a mature woman?i bet shes just only 24 or maybe 25? i dont think you'll like a woman nagging and rubbing salt in the wound right? and is she like so anti towards indian?</p>

              <p>This story is real, i also had a shock with her reply thats why i am posting in here to ask whether am i in any wrong by simply just connecting off.</p>
              <p>Maybe the msn quote "i wish i am an indian" harbour some negative stereotypes but this is work life, politics, bootlicking are part and parcel of work.</p>
              <p>I do not mind apologising to her but i do not like the way she sms me straight away as if i owe her a shit. Anyway to end things she sms me last night asking how is my dinner, i have apologise to her but that apology is really just an appreciation of this friendship.</p>
              <p>This means i think i am unworthy to be her friend so i will block her from my msn and ignore her calls. </p>

              <p>Well, racism is built upon stereoypes and generalisation. But it seems that i'm mistaken and i should stick to the status quo.<br><br>Well... Your action was just a really natural reaction to high pressure situations i guess. "Leave to avoid further aggravation."

              <p>Real love is a herenow phenomenon (an existential experience - two beings relating, relationship is a thing. Human beings  change n evolve all the time - to reduce someone to a thing is the ultimate insult.Can one step into the same river twice? Love and Ego cannot co-exist - where it does - it is needs, fear, attachment, fear of loss, ownership, possessiveness masquerading as love, hence the constant struggle n .... pyschodrama and melodrama. Love in its purity is death of the ego.  One who is ready to die will be able to love. If one fears death (of the ego)one surely fears love n one is bound to be on the track of fear, fear of loss, needy!</p>
              <p>It presupposes one is abundantly flowing otherwise it is just another ego trip, seeking another to fulfil, hence the need to quickly possess and make it into a thing( relationship. I m not discouraging marriage or relationships - i m saying fix oneself first  then go into it,</p>
