They actually send teachers to patrol shopping centres like Tampines Mall and century square. And the teachers are equipped with handphone cameras to snap pictures of you--so you cant deny that you did not loiter. Yes. Originally the rationale behind this rule is to prevent students from tarnishing the school's good image and prevent them from not going home. But they have gone overbroad when they started punishing students for buying curry puffs at the mini-mart. How fair is that? And it is also against the school's rule to bring a T shirt to school or wear a T shirt underneath your school uniform.<br><br>We Have to GO HOME and Change into our home clothes before going out.</div>

Educational too. No need to be able studies. Can be after school sports or some handicraft lessons or what ma. Small nominal fee also can what. Most ppl go shopping centre spend money on nonsense anyway coz nothing better to do.<br><br></div>
