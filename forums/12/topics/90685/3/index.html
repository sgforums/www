It is this public perception that students left outside would engage in nefarious activities that leads the conservative elements pressurise the schools to do more to "keep our young off the streets for their own good".<br><br>However, what your school has chosen to do has gone too far: restricting one's movement outside is akin to treating the student like a prisoner on home detention: he isn't free to move about as a normal human being.<br><br>What the school could have encouraged was to allow the students to change to civilian clothes, and go do what they want to do. After all, the school should have no right to interfere with the student's live after official school time. In fact, whenever I went out with my school mates after school, we made sure to change at least our shirts. That way, we could avoid any awkward encounters with any of the teachers we met along the way, and also gives us leeway to get ouselves out of trouble in case we happened to get into some incident. Not that we would deliberately do so anyway!</div></blockquote>I agree with what you said.Well, just to let you know, in school you have no rights. I remember the discipline master saying that last year to the whole school. He insists that school is a privilege and not your "right". This effectively means you have to accept whatever shit the school thinks its good for you. Like I said, the original intention behind this rule is to ensure that students do not loiter and go home,thus, bringing home clothes to school is a no-no as it defeats this purpose.</div>

Is your school really that 'bad' to have such rules implemented...? Or is there something really wrong with your principal..? A new system for all schools..??</div></blockquote>No. Its not "bad". My school aims to be the "PRemier Choice School" so in order to achieve this, they start having lots of praetorian and unreasonable rules. This is an attempt to polish the school's image so that it shines like brass.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> As for the principal, I really dunno how she thinks, all Me and the school knows is that 1. She is a braggart 2.She likes awards 3. She likes it even more if you score A1s for O lvl.<br>My school is currently 5 years old and we have already earn plenty of awards under a dictator.</div>

Since the sch so kaypoh, then might as well set the rule as: "NO LOITERING WHILE YOU ARE A STUDENT OF SASS, WHETHER U ARE IN ATTIRE OR NOT." If students has been smoking or badly attired, gaming in arcade or behaving badly in the public, it's legit to punish the students.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> I've a suggestion. Try violating this rule for once. While going out, look for chances to help ppl out. I dunno... catch some thiefs or wadever, though i doubt u're find tt much chance in sg anyway! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> After u get some commendations frm the police or something, and yr sch kinda wanna busk in the same glory as u, declare tt u broke the sch rules and be punished. Then, get a friend to report the case to Channel 8 Frontline. When those ppl frm mediacorp start interviewing abt u, u rant abt u muz abide to the sch rules despite having done a good deed, and tt u felt tis rule is redundant and punishing students for no legit reasons more than to preserve the sch image and honor. I swear the sch will abolish tis rule completely! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> The character of students lies not in their action, but in their heart. All the sch did is infringing human rights, for it's fame. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
