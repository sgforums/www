However, visiting the library in a shopping centre is allowed for 20 minutes only.It would seem that my school is the only school in Singapore that considers a visit to the mini mart an offence.

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I am sure that the school has a valid concern for wanting to protect its reputation; after all, how would parents think of the school if their students were to be walking everywhere in public places instead of being kept in school or at home? It is this public perception that students left outside would engage in nefarious activities that leads the conservative elements pressurise the schools to do more to "keep our young off the streets for their own good".<br><br>However, what your school has chosen to do has gone too far: restricting one's movement outside is akin to treating the student like a prisoner on home detention: he isn't free to move about as a normal human being.<br><br>What the school could have encouraged was to allow the students to change to civilian clothes, and go do what they want to do. After all, the school should have no right to interfere with the student's live after official school time. In fact, whenever I went out with my school mates after school, we made sure to change at least our shirts. That way, we could avoid any awkward encounters with any of the teachers we met along the way, and also gives us leeway to get ouselves out of trouble in case we happened to get into some incident. Not that we would deliberately do so anyway!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The example of your teacher snapping students with the camera phone can be classified as an offence with might break many rules if you can prove that he is taking photos of a certain group of persons , i.e your fellow students.What I propose is that if your picture is taken, go down to the police station and clarify with them on this issue.The school has no place dictating how its students should behave outside school and there is certainly no law in our Penal Code that prohibits you from wearing your school uniform in a public domain.</div>
