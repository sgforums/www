Life is like a lesson if i don learn my lesson i will repeat the lesson again and again till i learn.to hate her will bring no good to me because with hate in onself . THe onself will alway be trap by her. I am learning</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My opinion is that she is very selfish and bad, she just makes use of you when she feels empty inside and needed someone around her to comfort her and to cherish she. After her love came back, she just drop you off. what a woman...terrible...<br><br>I think you should tell her bf about you and her and what happen between you two for the past two years, especially if intimacy is there...<br><br>If their love is so strong, it should be able to handle that. If not, she may come crawling back to you..but remember don't accept her anymore.</div>
