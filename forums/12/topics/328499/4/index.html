              <p>nah...this happens in real life allright.</p>
              <p>Even poor temple co-ordinator can hook a 14 year old gal when he already has wife, mistresses &amp; sons.</p>
              <p>But changes to mindset and attitude do more then just grumble about real life.</p>
              <p>I saw a old school friend the other weekeng night at my neighbourhood hawker centre.</p>
              <p>She was the fat but rich gal with nothing to look at.  For his brothers, can only say they look dark, fat but prosperous look.  For a female its a disaster.  And she will try to chase after the guys, especially the skinny fellas.</p>
              <p>She is tall too but we often see her 'do tiap' those guys with offered finances, sex &amp; transportation which she has.</p>
              <p>Men just didnt see what she really has, and only aim her for the money, the conveniece &amp; her willingness to be ridiculed or abused by her b/fs.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I saw her clutching a new born baby and she was with a skinny guy next to her and hopefully she has found happiness, at 34 years of age.</p>

              <p>I don't mean to be rude but you should really start by talking less.</p>
              <p>When you meet a person for the first time, how would you feel if he goes on and on and on and on about his life story?</p>
              <p>Everybody has a life story that is unique... but boring.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Listen more and ask spontaneous questions about HER. Don't focus on yourself during the convo.</p>
              <p>Your introduction above looked like a script. I think you have attended too many dating functions and it's starting to become a rountine for you.</p>
              <p>If you are able to keep her talking while making sure that she knew little about you, you'd have done well for the first meeting.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: blue; font-family: Arial;">1. Firstly, can I ask, do you have a stable career. At the age of 30, you should be earning above 50K annual at least. Also becoming a maestro in at least one field of discipline. If you have a good career, how do you balance your career and your social life?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Im working on that.  Should see 50k / Annum or more within the next 2 years. (i just swtich line,  very "green" to this new job, hence the pay is not up to the "standard" yet)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">Being 30 years old, a gross annual income of 50K is the minimum you should have. It will spell you have between $3K to 3.5K a mth, 2.5mths bonus and up to $2K of overseas travel allowance. You cannot still wait for ‘within the next 2 years’. By then when you are 32, you will be based on a different benchmark. Do not forget that money depreciates due to inflation. Perhaps at the age of 32 or 33, you should be getting $55K annually. You will be playing catch up forever.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">By not having this, you have already punctured your eligibility greatly as someone who cannot even support himself, what makes him think he can afford to run a family.</span></p>
              <div style="border-right: medium none; padding-right: 0in; border-top: medium none; padding-left: 0in; padding-bottom: 1pt; border-left: medium none; padding-top: 0in; border-bottom: windowtext 1.5pt solid;">
              <p style="  padding: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">What I can suggest is for you to think clearly on your career objectives. Of course I am not asking you to become a top sales man or a pastor who can psycho people for donations. But think hard about what you want to do with your life in terms of work. It’s either you become a professional (eg. Engineer, accountant etc.) in a foreign MNC or a management level staff. I will greatly recommend you not to work for large Singaporean companies if you value integrity and a life long career.</span></p>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: blue; font-family: Arial;">2. Do you have a pleasant personality? How to gauge?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Im a gentle person, not tough. still boyish looking.  how to gauge? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">people commented so.  ex boss told me i looked like a boy.  never thought im 30.. How? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">Looks for a guy aren’t that critical. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is the charisma behind the ugly face</span>. I have ugly friends who have excellent charisma. The rare type of SAF Military officer whom men are willing to stick with him. My this friend looks like the incredible hulk with a much modest torso. He’s outgoing and enjoys sports. He was ditched by his ex gf and he cried. He called me from HK when he went touring with his slutty ex gf who took advantage of him. I told him to dump that slut and come back brand new. He expanded his social circle when he went for his NUS freshman orientation. Got attached with a very pretty gf within 2 or 3 months. They are still together. It has been since 2001.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: blue; font-family: Arial;">(a) Do you have a lot of people not on good terms with you at work?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">No, im on good terms with the people.  even some ex colleagues.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">You seem to even enjoy a good relationship with the people who are most likely to clash with you. This shows that you have a peaceful and pleasant personality.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: blue; font-family: Arial;">(b) How's the relationship between you and your family?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Not on good terms with Father, treat my mother nicer. gave money to both parents.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">I am not on good terms with my dad too. He’s basically a lazy bum who leeches on my mum and aunts. I also know a few other friends who are like that.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: blue; font-family: Arial;">(c) Can you confidently say you have good friends? And these friends are the sort who will visit you should you be hospitalized, trust and stand up for you should you be maligned?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">A.  I have some good friends (not really alot),  most nice girls that i know are already attached.  There is this female friend whom i liked, and on the verge of breaking up with her bf.  i consoled her and gave her insights to good relationship from books i read.  (I liked her before, expressed my feelings,  but was rejected.  I checked out her friendster,  the BF is much..much better looking.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">There are people who stand up for me. yes( i took some time to think this question honestly yes) </span></p>
              <div style="border-right: medium none; padding-right: 0in; border-top: medium none; padding-left: 0in; padding-bottom: 1pt; border-left: medium none; padding-top: 0in; border-bottom: windowtext 1.5pt solid;">
              <p style="  padding: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">Your friends circle within your comfort zone seems to be quite stable. But you need more than that. You need to build up a more elaborate network of acquaintances.</span></p>
              </div>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: blue; font-family: Arial;">3. Do you have a good social circle? As in having people asking you out or you have a healthy list of people whom you can invite for dinner or outing?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">No, i dont have a good social circle.  most of the time,  i would spend on video games and time at uncle's place where I play with his kids.  occaionally once in every 3 months,  I would be asked to join in karaoke or drinking session by friends.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">This is a lethal killer. You need to spend time outside more. And spend time with friends who bring friends. Join outings organized by friends more often. If they don’t then you can organize outings. For example meeting up for movies in a large group.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">Have you gotten your car and bike licence? Go and upgrade your career first before you buy a vehicle. Regardless it’s a bike or a car. Then join these group outings. You can never underestimate how much magic a car can do with opening up a new horizon of choices. But of course, with an influx of new choices, there will always be good and bad. Be careful on your choices. A wrong move can land you in even deeper shi_t than now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">Amongst all the people I know who rides or drives, I seldom come across people who have never had a gf before. Or perhaps they had but broke off when I met him. </span></p>
              <div style="border-right: medium none; padding-right: 0in; border-top: medium none; padding-left: 0in; padding-bottom: 1pt; border-left: medium none; padding-top: 0in; border-bottom: windowtext 1.5pt solid;">
              <p style="  padding: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">This is because a car is sadly… an icon of wealth or stability even though it may not be true. And the more expensive your car is, the more likely you will attract attention including the wrong ones. But do not rush into buying a car and end up with debts just in order to look good. Manage your finance and buy a car only when you are confident you do not put a strain on your finance.<strong></strong></span></p>
              </div>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: blue; font-family: Arial;">4. Given a day off eg. Sunday, how do you spend it?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Play games or go uncle's place to spend time there.</span></p>
              <div style="border-right: medium none; padding-right: 0in; border-top: medium none; padding-left: 0in; padding-bottom: 1pt; border-left: medium none; padding-top: 0in; border-bottom: windowtext 1.5pt solid;">
              <p style="  padding: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">Please… refer to the above.</span></p>
              </div>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: blue; font-family: Arial;">5. What are the factors you ask for before deciding to know more about the girl?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Attractive.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">Firstly, you don’t have a choice now. Don’t keep in mind that you are going for a matchmake everytime you go out in a group outing of mixed genders. Go with an open mind just with the intentions of making friends. Talk more and make suggestions. Initiate going to certain places, be sporting if your suggestion is rejected.</span></p>
              <div style="border-right: medium none; padding-right: 0in; border-top: medium none; padding-left: 0in; padding-bottom: 1pt; border-left: medium none; padding-top: 0in; border-bottom: windowtext 1.5pt solid;">
              <p style="  padding: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">Therefore the aesthetics of the girl is not the priority for you now. Rather the attractiveness of her inner cultivated beauty.</span></p>
              </div>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: blue; font-family: Arial;">6. Do you fool around with girls? That means never serious about girls before? ie. Active ONS player.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Never fooled around with girls before,  Been to disco less than 10 times in my life.  By the way, i couldnt drink. 1 glass of beer is enough to make me sick and puke.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Im serious in the girls im after, never succeed.  perhaps i picked the wrong ones</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">I’ve seen a show on a dating flop. This man in his late thirties who has never been on a date. Works as a computer technician earning a modest income. The show host matched him up with a girl and dresses him up for the event. Told him to kick all his dirty bad habits and arranged for them to meet at a café.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">The flop lived up to his name and was unable to start a conversation. He was utterly quiet for a long time before he made his debut speech that totally killed the chances. The first and last sentence he spoke was “I may not be a good bf, but I am a good husband.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">The girl was already utterly disgusted by the lack of speech and the first sentence has to be such an atmosphere drencher.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">I am not asking you to start fooling around and hate girls. But start to be open minded and initiate more group outings. Regardless it’s a cycling event, BBQ, group movie cum dinner session.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">Being good looking only secures the first impression. But a good looking jerk will soon be detested by many.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;"></span></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">In conclusion, basically I can figure you out as a replica of some of my friends. A nice guy without looks nor discovered talent earning a below average income. Having a wrong concept about relationships and personality on this aspect. So desperate to rush into any potential opportunity for a relationship. And this desperation led to anguish as the rushing in causes a negative impact on the girls.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">To a man, looks is only secondary but achievements are mandatory. If you want to attract girls, you need to have a reasonably stable and strong career which you lack now. A good pleasant personality which you already have. A sensible and open minded concept on relationships which I think you need to improve. A charisma which shows you as a capable young man rather than a timid mouse.</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: red; font-family: Arial;">I wish you good luck and hope my advise helps.</span></strong></p>

              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial;">1. Firstly, can I ask, do you have a stable career. At the age of 30, you should be earning above 50K annual at least. Also becoming a maestro in at least one field of discipline. If you have a good career, how do you balance your career and your social life?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Im working on that.  Should see 50k / Annum or more within the next 2 years. (i just swtich line,  very "green" to this new job, hence the pay is not up to the "standard" yet)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">Being 30 years old, a gross annual income of 50K is the minimum you should have. It will spell you have between $3K to 3.5K a mth, 2.5mths bonus and up to $2K of overseas travel allowance. You cannot still wait for ‘within the next 2 years’. By then when you are 32, you will be based on a different benchmark. Do not forget that money depreciates due to inflation. Perhaps at the age of 32 or 33, you should be getting $55K annually. You will be playing catch up forever.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">By not having this, you have already punctured your eligibility greatly as someone who cannot even support himself, what makes him think he can afford to run a family.</span></p>
              <div style="border-right: medium none; padding-right: 0in; border-top: medium none; padding-left: 0in; padding-bottom: 1pt; border-left: medium none; padding-top: 0in;">
              <p style="padding: 0in;"><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">What I can suggest is for you to think clearly on your career objectives. Of course I am not asking you to become a top sales man or a pastor who can psycho people for donations. But think hard about what you want to do with your life in terms of work. It’s either you become a professional (eg. Engineer, accountant etc.) in a foreign MNC or a management level staff. I will greatly recommend you not to work for large Singaporean companies if you value integrity and a life long career.</span></p>
              </div>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial;">2. Do you have a pleasant personality? How to gauge?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Im a gentle person, not tough. still boyish looking.  how to gauge?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">people commented so.  ex boss told me i looked like a boy.  never thought im 30.. How? </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">Looks for a guy aren’t that critical. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">It is the charisma behind the ugly face</span>. I have ugly friends who have excellent charisma. The rare type of SAF Military officer whom men are willing to stick with him. My this friend looks like the incredible hulk with a much modest torso. He’s outgoing and enjoys sports. He was ditched by his ex gf and he cried. He called me from HK when he went touring with his slutty ex gf who took advantage of him. I told him to dump that slut and come back brand new. He expanded his social circle when he went for his NUS freshman orientation. Got attached with a very pretty gf within 2 or 3 months. They are still together. It has been since 2001.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial;">(a) Do you have a lot of people not on good terms with you at work?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">No, im on good terms with the people.  even some ex colleagues.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">You seem to even enjoy a good relationship with the people who are most likely to clash with you. This shows that you have a peaceful and pleasant personality.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial;">(b) How's the relationship between you and your family?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Not on good terms with Father, treat my mother nicer. gave money to both parents.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">I am not on good terms with my dad too. He’s basically a lazy bum who leeches on my mum and aunts. I also know a few other friends who are like that.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial;">(c) Can you confidently say you have good friends? And these friends are the sort who will visit you should you be hospitalized, trust and stand up for you should you be maligned?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">A.  I have some good friends (not really alot),  most nice girls that i know are already attached.  There is this female friend whom i liked, and on the verge of breaking up with her bf.  i consoled her and gave her insights to good relationship from books i read.  (I liked her before, expressed my feelings,  but was rejected.  I checked out her friendster,  the BF is much..much better looking.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">There are people who stand up for me. yes( i took some time to think this question honestly yes) </span></p>
              <div style="border-right: medium none; padding-right: 0in; border-top: medium none; padding-left: 0in; padding-bottom: 1pt; border-left: medium none; padding-top: 0in;">
              <p style="padding: 0in;"><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">Your friends circle within your comfort zone seems to be quite stable. But you need more than that. You need to build up a more elaborate network of acquaintances.</span></p>
              </div>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial;">3. Do you have a good social circle? As in having people asking you out or you have a healthy list of people whom you can invite for dinner or outing?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">No, i dont have a good social circle.  most of the time,  i would spend on video games and time at uncle's place where I play with his kids.  occaionally once in every 3 months,  I would be asked to join in karaoke or drinking session by friends.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">This is a lethal killer. You need to spend time outside more. And spend time with friends who bring friends. Join outings organized by friends more often. If they don’t then you can organize outings. For example meeting up for movies in a large group.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">Have you gotten your car and bike licence? Go and upgrade your career first before you buy a vehicle. Regardless it’s a bike or a car. Then join these group outings. You can never underestimate how much magic a car can do with opening up a new horizon of choices. But of course, with an influx of new choices, there will always be good and bad. Be careful on your choices. A wrong move can land you in even deeper shi_t than now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">Amongst all the people I know who rides or drives, I seldom come across people who have never had a gf before. Or perhaps they had but broke off when I met him.</span></p>
              <div style="border-right: medium none; padding-right: 0in; border-top: medium none; padding-left: 0in; padding-bottom: 1pt; border-left: medium none; padding-top: 0in;">
              <p style="padding: 0in;"><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">This is because a car is sadly… an icon of wealth or stability even though it may not be true. And the more expensive your car is, the more likely you will attract attention including the wrong ones. But do not rush into buying a car and end up with debts just in order to look good. Manage your finance and buy a car only when you are confident you do not put a strain on your finance.</span></p>
              </div>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial;">4. Given a day off eg. Sunday, how do you spend it?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Play games or go uncle's place to spend time there.</span></p>
              <div style="border-right: medium none; padding-right: 0in; border-top: medium none; padding-left: 0in; padding-bottom: 1pt; border-left: medium none; padding-top: 0in;">
              <p style="padding: 0in;"><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">Please… refer to the above.</span></p>
              </div>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial;">5. What are the factors you ask for before deciding to know more about the girl?</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Attractive.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">Firstly, you don’t have a choice now. Don’t keep in mind that you are going for a matchmake everytime you go out in a group outing of mixed genders. Go with an open mind just with the intentions of making friends. Talk more and make suggestions. Initiate going to certain places, be sporting if your suggestion is rejected.</span></p>
              <div style="border-right: medium none; padding-right: 0in; border-top: medium none; padding-left: 0in; padding-bottom: 1pt; border-left: medium none; padding-top: 0in;">
              <p style="padding: 0in;"><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">Therefore the aesthetics of the girl is not the priority for you now. Rather the attractiveness of her inner cultivated beauty.</span></p>
              </div>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Arial;">6. Do you fool around with girls? That means never serious about girls before? ie. Active ONS player.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Never fooled around with girls before,  Been to disco less than 10 times in my life.  By the way, i couldnt drink. 1 glass of beer is enough to make me sick and puke.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial;">Im serious in the girls im after, never succeed.  perhaps i picked the wrong ones</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">I’ve seen a show on a dating flop. This man in his late thirties who has never been on a date. Works as a computer technician earning a modest income. The show host matched him up with a girl and dresses him up for the event. Told him to kick all his dirty bad habits and arranged for them to meet at a café.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">The flop lived up to his name and was unable to start a conversation. He was utterly quiet for a long time before he made his debut speech that totally killed the chances. The first and last sentence he spoke was “I may not be a good bf, but I am a good husband.”</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">The girl was already utterly disgusted by the lack of speech and the first sentence has to be such an atmosphere drencher.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">I am not asking you to start fooling around and hate girls. But start to be open minded and initiate more group outings. Regardless it’s a cycling event, BBQ, group movie cum dinner session.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">Being good looking only secures the first impression. But a good looking jerk will soon be detested by many.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">In conclusion, basically I can figure you out as a replica of some of my friends. A nice guy without looks nor discovered talent earning a below average income. Having a wrong concept about relationships and personality on this aspect. So desperate to rush into any potential opportunity for a relationship. And this desperation led to anguish as the rushing in causes a negative impact on the girls.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">To a man, looks is only secondary but achievements are mandatory. If you want to attract girls, you need to have a reasonably stable and strong career which you lack now. A good pleasant personality which you already have. A sensible and open minded concept on relationships which I think you need to improve. A charisma which shows you as a capable young man rather than a timid mouse.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000; font-family: Arial;">I wish you good luck and hope my advise helps.</span></strong></p>
