                                          would a guy reject a girl after her confession</strong></p>
              <p>and why would they have to accept the offer if they arent interested in you? <br>You confess and they have to accept.... It doesnt go this way.... <br>Will you accept a guy if you're not at all interested in him? Please answer this question.</p>
              <p><strong>In this way, i dont have to spend time and tears figuring why i
                                          am rejected and could use the possible reasons for

              <p>The only explanation is, they are not interested, thats it. You dont have to spend your time figuring why A or B rejects you.</p>
              <p>Also, if a person tells you that he/she likes you, it might not be the truth. Whatsmore, over msn?? Words are cheap in msn and it can be done every day. If a person shows interest in you, you do not have to reciprocate your feelings towards him when you doesnt feel something for him because it seems that whenever a guy tells you he likes you (regardless if its true or not) and wants to be your boyfriend you will want to confess or eager for a relationship. Is it like that?</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, there are many characters out there and there is no sure way of telling things if the other party is really toying with your feelings or really interested in you. So I would prefer a common sense and practical approach. Just don't be quick to decide, don't let all the nice things and comfort cloud your judgement. Take your time to decide and since you are the fairer party, always let them initiate. Sometimes I would also advise that you seek advise and opinions from close friends - don't keep them away from your new found joy. For they may have a fairer and objective opinion and most of the time does hold some truth in the views.</p>
              <p>As for revenge, I do not think it is necessary. R/s is either it works out or fall out. I do not mean to be mean here but didn't you feel happy and special when the both of you started off? Just learn from past experience to gain wisdom and understanding. Not malice and vindictive - for these are what turns true and genuine people away. No point hurting other people to gain something you really do not want and regrets. Let others take care of these voyuers and you just take care of yourself. Remember what goes around, comes around.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I think they're just <em>hongsters</em>. They're just in for the thrill of wooing a girl. But when the girl finally falls in love with them.. Fun's over for them. Then they just leave the girl hanging or heartbroken.</p>

              <p>Anyway it's your side of the story we are hearing. We never got to hear their side. Could it be you were fantasizing they want you to be their gf when all they want is companionship? How exactly did they hint to you? Going out with you doesn't mean anything you know.  And you said through action. What action? Got hug-hug you or kiss-kiss you? If got then really their fault lah. If not then you 'zi zhuo duo qing' or 'biao cuo qing' leh<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>Like flirt a little with him, drop a little praises here and there, makes him feel good.  Make good eye contact ('fang dian'), body gesture when chatting with him (tap or hold his arm gentlely and briefly at the right moment when chatting with him) and etc....  get it? </p>

              <p><br>i think via msn is not a good way to confess... cos u have not seen the guy and do not know his body language. Or perhaps you've not seen the guy for quite some time, he may have "shift target".</p>
              <p>Instead, it would be better if u meet up the guy, while both of u are chatting happily and having a great time, drop some hints. If he responds positively, drop more hints, let some silence go by, and see if he would take up from there.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, i firmly believe that the relationship is not meant to be if it goes down the drain like this. There may be a number of reasons. Perhaps u were too insecure, pondered too long and the guy has moved on. Perhaps the guy has some issues himself, opened up to you and then just did a houdini magic disappearing trick. Whatever it is, pick yourself up. Know that you deserved to be in a relationship where both parties adore each other. There's nothing wrong with being cautious, and with each relationship you go through, you gain experience.</p>
              <p>Gal, you gotta be more confident of yourself. Maybe start by living up your life happily as a single? You won't pine so much for a relationship then. And then when love strikes, you were too busy living ur life to realize when it hit you, because you are not pining your life away for it.</p>

              <p>mancha is so right. Be thankful that they left you cos they might not have been suitable in the first place. Look forward. Maybe god wants you to meet a better someone.</p>

              <p><br>If they are toying with ur feelings, they are not worth keeping anyway. Like wat aremeis said, there are many characters out there and there is no sure way of telling things if the other party is really toying with your feelings or really interested in you. So use your common sense to feel them out and don't let your loneliness and yearning cloud your judgement.</p>
              <p>The only solution i see to this would be to go out there, mingle around and make more new friends ba.</p>
              <p>How did you know these guys? Maybe you should try knowing other guys from other channels.</p>
