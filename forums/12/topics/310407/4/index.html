              <p>Maybe you can elaborate how the two guys misled you into believing that they wanted a relationship. I am just concerned that you could have misinterpreted their intentions. Men are sometimes very helpful/ gentle towards ladies, and some ladies can misinterpreted that signal.</p>
              <p>Also, if these men had wanted to just play around with you, they could have accepted you, enter into a relationship, can dump you after they got what they wanted (you know what I mean).</p>
              <p>Undertstand that I am not saying you are wrong. Just want to get the facts of your circumstances correct before commenting. </p>

              <p>LOL you certainly sound angry and irritated with some replies here. How naive can you be? If you think by coming to AA and airing your so call problem or voicing your grievances will get you every single sympathy votes then you are dead wrong.</p>
              <p>You gotta remember this is a PUBLIC FORUM and that means anyone can reply anything they like. So be prepare to face the music however sarcastic the replies were. You must remember we are all strangers to one another. So why should we believe in 100% what you type? Why must we believe you were being play out?  As I've said in my previous posting you could be the one fantasizing about the guys wanting you to be their gf. You could even be the one really initiated the move but in actual fact all the two guys wanted from you was friendship but since you got rejected you retaliated by venting your anger on a public forum. I mean if you tell your friends face to face they might laugh at you and you drop your water face yet you needed an outlet to vent your frustration. Well, you decided to lash it out on a public forum since it's quite safe as no one will know the whole tooth and nothing but the tooth except you yourself.</p>
              <p>So, take everything with a pinch of salt and don't get hostile with replies here. Everyone gets the flak now and then.

              <p>Hmmm vitamin P, you rejected the guy 3 times.. because you didn't like him.</p>
              <p>Why change your mind now ?</p>
              <p>You know men are not going to be at your beck and call anytime you want.</p>
              <p>They are not stupid ok ? They'll know you are treating them as a reserve.</p>
              <p>They got pride one hor. So if you want to keep playing this " play hard to get" game.. you shouldn't be surprise guys turn their backs at you when you have no one else to turn to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since you don't treat them seriously, why should they take you seriously ?</p>
              <p>Learn to accord them some respect, in turn they will do too.</p>
