To right....<br>My hands.... My mind...<br><br>So fast... Is it right....?<br>Head's down!<br><span style="color: red;">Blood...</span><br><br>A little poem I've previously wrote...<br><br>For those who think of suicide as a quick solution out... It's really not, but just a quick way to stop your thoughts and thinking... When your mind is weak or your emotions are stirred and unstable.... So that they can never have the chance to reach a proper and logical solution.. In other words, depriving yourself of a chance for a correct choice..<br><br>If you feel that the thoughts hurt, just find people to help you... Hang around, do nothing... Wait for help to arrive.... Let the others do the thinkings for you 1st until you're sound again....<br><br>Read my poem above... A WRONG STEP can be a FINAL STEP you'll be taking... The magic about life is that you THINK it's given to you FOR FREE and so you've got the RIGHTS to just THROW IT AWAY.... But in actual fact it can as simple or complex... Meaningful or meaningless as you make it out to be....</div>
