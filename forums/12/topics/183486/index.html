            <div class='col-md body'>yep kinda agree with you it's actually the small insignifcant things that actually give the hope. sometimes when i really feel that life has lost its meaning and i'm so useless, i go out alone catch a comedy movie go on a mini retail therapy and then i feel a tad better. lol, somtimes to the extent that i prefer being a lone creature.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One of my best friends took his own life this way. His girlfriend left him, and he decided to end it all by jumping off a HDB block.<br><br>He was one of the most respected commanders in my company. He wasn't like most of the commanders - the other commanders treated me with apprehension and suspicion after I got my three stripes. I wasn't like them - I joined my company as a PTE and only became a 3SG after a year. However, he treated me like a good buddy of his - both before and after I got my three stripes.<br><br>It was a traumatic time for me when he took his life. I couldn't eat, sleep, or study properly and eventually had to seek professional counselling.<br><br>So the answer to the question in the starting post is: no. I will forever never truly comprehend the reasons behind why my friend whom I respected so much would take his own life. To me, to take your own life is the coward's way out; true bravery is about facing up to your problems and not running away from them.<br><br>Besides, no matter what, there are still people who do care for you. You still have your family and friends. If you jump off a building, the pain is momentary for you between the time you hit the ground and the time your soul departs your body. However, the pain you inflict to your family and friends - the people whom you love - is lifelong.<br><br>It was hard enough on me as it is. I wonder how much harder it was for his family.<br><br>As U2 would say in 'Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of':<br><br><strong>I was unconscious, half asleep<br>The water is warm till you discover how deep<br>I was enchanted, but for me it was a fall<br>It's a long way down to nothing at all</strong><br><br>More importantly:<br><br><strong>And if the night runs over<br>And if the day won't last<br>And if our way shall falter<br>Along this stony pass....<br><br>..... It's just a moment, this time will pass.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>not that I'm encouraging chaps to commit suicide, which is about the most stupid thing you can do ....<br><br>but jumping off a block is probably the most stupid thing you can do .... you go splat and your body parts get scattered all over ... maybe the resident population of crows and stray-cats will have a go at your carcass before the police and the morgue crew arrives to scrape you off the sidewalk ..... (hope that scares people off the thought)<br><br>there are so many people on this earth in need of a heart, a kidney, a liver, or perhaps even a pair of eyeballs to have another shot at life .... and people who wants to end it all were still selfish enough NOT to make their organs available for others when they decided to die ? ....<br><br>tsk tsk tsk .....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

It worked (they let me cool down).

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, I did think of suicide. At that time, I really had no idea what was going on in the mind. All I thought was to end it all. I sat at the ledge (school had a nice extended area infront of the parapet which gave me enough space to actually dance around), really just wanting to take a step. But my principal stopped me.<br><br>Now, I'm quite thankful that he did that. Of course, the repurcussions were terrible. People who heard labelled me as "attention-seeking".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> But only if they knew how terrible it was to even think of suicide.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I had a very serious relationship problem 4 years ago and this was the most serious crisis of my life so far till today.<br><br>It was really very bad,I woke up in the morning with a heavy heart and every minute of the day seemed to drag,of course whenever I have nothing to do(like waiting for bus or something) I would think of my problem.Of course,I tried to occupy myself but definitely there would be times when I had nothing to do(as I said previously like waiting for bus).Whenever I thought of it,my heart ached ever so badly...sometimes I would wake up in the middle of the night,and the first thing that came to my mind was that problem again.Then when I tried to go to sleep, I could not.Hence I tossed and turned on my bed till morning(thinking of the problem of course)<br><br>There were times when i felt I would really want to end this sucky feeling.No,I was not saying I felt like killing myself,but I just wanted it to go away lor...And yes,I remember waking up in the middle of the night(once only la) and just started crying...ouch...<br><br>This went on for about a month,surprisely,my studies were not affected.After a month or so,I gradually began to accept the situation and slowly it healed by itself.<br><br>Looking back on,I felt that the whole affair was kinda silly,haha... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Nevertheless,I am glad that I have become stronger since that affair.<br><br></div>
