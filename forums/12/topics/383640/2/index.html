              <p>Hi TS,</p>
              <p>i respect you for your golden heart :) it is rare to see people like u in the financial industry nowadays. u may remember me from previous posts. i would like to share my thoughts with you, and to other financial planners whom may be reading your post and sharing the same situation as u are.</p>
              <p>1) you must always remember, that you are now in a city with 15000 financial planners at least. alot of people are joining this industry after promises of quick money and seeing how their 'financial industry peers' are doing. as a result of which, competition is very very keen. do you know anyone whom has already joined the working society and has yet to be approached by someone wanting to help him with his finances? i dont.</p>
              <p>2) you are in an industry with a very low barrier to entry. lets be frank, anyone with 4 o level credits, and aged 21 with no criminal record can join this industry. look around u, how many of your financial industry peers are selling ILPs as savings plans? why do they do that? cos u noe, i know that ILPs have the highest commission. is it wrong to do so? i leave it up to u to decide. my point is, how many of your peers are product pushing vs proper financial planning? does it seem weird why people shun away from us then?</p>
              <p>3) dont be too hard on yourself. in our industry, it is really not about the product. why did the elderly man not want to work with you? look at it this way.. he doesnt want you to waste your time because he feels he is not going to buy anything from u. but im going to be really frank - he also doesnt trust you to manage his finances for him. our industry is all about 1 word - TRUST. Think about it. look at your customer base. your customers buy from you because they trust you. and this trust is a very intimate level of trust considering the products we are selling - financial products. this trust is NOT EASY TO EARN. so if you follow up dilligently with this man, im sure one day he will start to listen to you and perhaps trust you. Earn the trust my friend.. This is very very important.</p>
              <p>Btw, it is not possible for one to have 2 H&amp;S policies. CPF only allows the 1 person to have only 1 H&amp;S policy at any one time, so there might be some things u may need to clarify there.</p>
              <p>I hope u stay in this industry. It is not easy initially but once u get your customer base u'd be fine. Trust me. Also, if you are looking for fee based financial planning companies, there are a few out there - PromiseLand is an IFA that provides fee based financial planning i think.</p>
              <p>One more point i would like to bring up:- always do equitable business. I know you may not agree with me now, but you must always remember who made u what u are today. Your current customer base. They are the ones paying your commissions. As a result of which, it is your duty to serve them. And you can only serve them by staying in this industry. You can also only stay in this industry if you earn enough to feed yourself. Treat your paying customers the best. Prospects come second. So stop this talk about free this, free that. You may want to do the best for your client. The thing is, do you know which product is really the best for your client? Is there really a BEST PRODUCT out there? All products have pros and cons.</p>
              <p>Take care man. may you hit your MDRT, CRT one day :)</p>

              <p>thats the reason why i want to help the old man so much. cause he does not even know his coverage. when he told me he had 2 hospital plans i am quite puzzled liao. unless 1 of them is a standalone, another is shield plan, then yea he can have 2. thanks max.</p>
              <p>i will always take my paying clients for priority, but in my spare time, i wanna do this for free. financial planning is what i wanna do, not insurance selling nor investment selling.  do something for the community. help those who really need the planning. finding high net worth is secondary to me, what i wanna do is help people who really needs it , people in the low and mid income level.</p>
              <p>but thanks. for the encouragement.</p>

              <p>guys i am sure some of you would have known i am in the financial industry as a consultant.</p>
              <p>i am in this line for the chance to help people who really need help with their finances and not for the promises of high pay and stuff.</p>
              <p>recently , i met this elderly whose family is in need of financial planning. speaking to him a few times, he showed interest. however out of a sudden, he decided not to accept my help. i told him i am really alright if he does not get anything from me, i just want to be able to help him plan for his retirement, as he has 1 disabled child to look after of. yet he for some unknown reason decided to reject my help. he kept saying he feel bad wasting my time, cause he not going to buy any policies from me. however i am perfectly alright with it. i mean , since i am in this line to help people, and from our past few conversations, i know his family is really in bad financial shape. which is why i decided that even if he does not buy anything from me, i am alright, as long as i can help him plan.</p>
              <p>but after his rejection, i feel very demoralized. like i am wasting my time. people do not believe that i just wanna help them and not out to earn their commission. maybe i should just change jobs. i really do not mind planning for others, even if they don give me business. but now, people who needs help, ownself know they need help, but just refuse to accept my help. i see liao, is like feeling so miserable that i am unable to do anything but let them carry on their mistake.</p>
              <p>can someone advise me on what i should do, carry on holding the dream of helping others, or just change job? feeling damn miserable cause i cant achieve my goal for being in this industry. haiz</p>

              <p><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> If you are so easily swayed, defeated and resigned, then perhaps your dream is probably a desire more than a real dream. In every sense of my words, I am telling you that since it is only a desire, then you don't have to achieve them because the conviction you have placed for yourself is not a dream that you will die fighting - at most, it is only a good to have.    </p>
              <p>The difference between people who make it and people who don't is that the former ensures that his thoughts manifest into reality, while the latter's thoughts remain in thoughts forever. People always tell me about their grand plans, but few demonstrated them to me in reality and even fewer had any real success in their decision made.</p>
              <p>I pretty much indulge in things contrary to my surrounding expectation and the first value I learn from my route in life is that you first learn to listen to yourself before you extend that opinion to other people for consideration. </p>
              <p>You must understand that people are not responsible for your gains and falls, so you must learn to pick yourself up and keep walking, even if it means having to cut yourself several times over and over again.</p>
              <p>And you can only do that willingly if you have a cause that you would fight aggressively for.</p>
              <p>If not, just take the safer route in life. You would have an easier time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
              <p>Cheers</p>
