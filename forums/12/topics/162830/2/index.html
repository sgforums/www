            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyoh... this kind of thing. Dun need to argue one lah.<br><br>In today's world, you need both money and love. One must be realistic n idealistic at same time. It's retarded and stupid to be plain idealistic, it's painful and lonely to be totally realistic.<br><br>Women are attracted naturally to men who can give them emotional, physical and financial security.<br><br>Men are attracted to women who look good.<br><br>All this is built into our genes to produce a stronger and better set of offspring. Dun argue over this man. Of course there are exceptions. The key thing is to balance it.<br><br>A pretty girl is not going to just marry a poor man and stick with him when she can deserve better. In SG you need money, no buts about that. Get married.. buy flat... have children.. bills pay this.. pay that. You want to know the power of money? Talk to those men who lose their job for long with children n wife to feed, even though wife can financially support herself, she'll definitely look at the man differently.<br><br>i suppose majority of us here are young and still have not had the experience of running a family and have financial and emotional frustrations. But i watched jack Neo's old show last nite 'money not enough'. Can really understand... That's why i also understand why mroe n more singaporeans not getting married. It's too damn dangerous to just lose your job with a family!<br><br>in short, love and money has to go together and be balanced. Women are naturally attracted to money n power. No matter how much they deny it... In fact there's nothing wrong. just like men all love beautiful women. BUT sometimes an average looking women who know how to be a real lady, to pamper, to sayang n take care of her men are so much stronger points than her looks!<br><br>Cheers!</div>
