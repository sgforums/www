              <p>I am currently attached to one of the sweetest men I have ever known. We are going to register our marriage in a few weeks time but will only hold our customary banquet around a year later.</p>
              <p>The problem is my husband would like to consummate our marriage as soon as possible, possibly after ROM but for me I would like to hold it back for a bit longer, preferably until after our customary marriage. We are both virgins and have not had any intercourse throughout our 3 year relationship, although of course we do indulge in petting every now and then to satisfy our urges.</p>
              <p>Why would I want to wait longer? Maybe this is because I fear that I might get pregnant. Yes, I know there are condoms and all that, but all those can still fail to work at times. I know the percentage is very low, but I would rather be 100% sure that I will not get pregnant before the customary marriage. I am raised in a very conservative family and I know my parents would kill me if I dare to get into this kind of situation before the traditional wedding. And of course it wouldn't look appropriate for me to walk down the aisle in a wedding gown with a big tummy, would I? We are also not really financially stable to have a kid at this moment as both of us are still building our career and we also do not have our own house yet.</p>
              <p>I am afraid if I give in and let him make love to me before the traditional wedding I might break down because I am not ready for it and my mind would be worrying about a lot of things so I would not be able to enjoy it. I really do love him very much and I want to make love with him more than ever but I just have this nagging concern in my mind everytime I thought of doing it before the banquet. Am I being unreasonable? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"> I am afraid of disappointing him yet I am afraid if I give in before I am 100% ready, it will turn out to be a disaster. Sigh. Do give some opinions on this issue. Thanks.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> By now, you have probably realised that sex per se isn't merely about the physical plane - the cultural, social &amp; psychological influences on the individual, in fact, have more impact. Especially in Asia, there is a deep social stigma attached to the notion of pre-martial sex, which amplify anxiety level in the woman before any act of intimacy, hindering fulfillment, even if sex is achieved.</p>
              <p>The most powerful sexual organ is in between your head. If the mind doesn't see it well, then chances are, sex will be bad because essential comfort is missing.</p>
              <p>Intimacy cannot be fulfilling without high level of comfort. This comes certain degree of trust (even in a ONS situation, one generally 'trust' the other to be disease-free before committing the act).</p>
              <p>You see in Love: Man suffers from approach anxiety, while woman suffers from intimacy anxiety. Simply because in an approach, the man becomes more vulnerable to rejection as he has more to invest and more to lose. In the same frequency, woman becomes more vulnerable in close intimacy, as she has more to invest, thus more to lose.</p>
              <p>Hence, the source of anxiety derive from fear and incurring of higher risk.</p>
              <p>Once you ROM - you are legally married in the eyes of the law and you also become 'MRS something'. It's perfectly normal to enjoy and engage love making, between husband and wife.</p>
              <p>Your worries about unplanned pregnancy is reasonable - every pregnancy should be plan, especially in Singapore, where everything is about dollars and cents. But if because of calculated pregnancy, you eliminate love making altogether - you effectively abrogate one major physical component of Love, in a marriage setting. And this is something you might want to review.</p>
              <p>Self awareness is very crucial - if you reckon that customary is the passport to love making (cultural factor), I would have advise that you put the ROM date on the same day or something, so that you won't have to go through a situation of 'Although I bought my car due to cheap COE, but now I can't drive to work because of $6 ERP'. (You can't change much now)</p>
              <p>I am not suggesting that you should have kids in an unplanned fashion; that's why contraception is invented for a reason.</p>
              <p>I will reiterate again: the most powerful sexual organ is in between your head - only by appeasing the mind can intimacy hope to occur.</p>
              <p>There is no right or wrong beliefs - it's all about what you believe in. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              man becomes more vulnerable to rejection as he has more to invest
              and more to lose. In the same frequency, woman becomes more
              vulnerable in close intimacy, as she has more to invest, thus more
              to lose.</p>

              <p>This is very true...maybe it is because this is my first time doing it as well? If you have been a virgin for the past 20 plus years, you would feel a bit nervous about doing it right? Especially when the people around you kept instigating that it is not right to do it now, plus the fear of unplanned pregnancy...all of them just complicate something which should be simple and uncomplicated.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> The problem of intimacy.</p>
              <p>Our society and culture teaches that it's 'wrong' to engage in pre-martial sex, but the education stops right there. (Because the topic is about couple in a marriage settling, I am eliminating the portion about the problem of sexually active young people completely). Our society and culture doesn't teach what's next after marriage because it seemed that sex just comes 'naturally or automatic', in which I will show you that it simply doesn't function as linear and blindly.</p>
              <p>Truth number one: sex life doesn't become fulfilling JUST simply because of marriage. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What you must recognise is that a marriage doesn't change the inner component of an individual - namely the mindset and self belief.</span></strong> Believe you me, there are enough women out there who have been reinforced continously by their environment that love making is 'bad' that it appears almost impossible to reverse this notion even after marriage. You are one perfect example - you are married and your anxiety heightens in face of close intimacy.</p>
              <p>With all that negativity about intimacy, tell me how can one truly enjoy being close? Hardly. That's why many women are unable to enjoy intimacy as much as they would like to because of the self inflicted barriers they gave themselves.</p>
              <p>Truth number two: some people believe that marriage can function without being intimate. In that same line of argument, I can tell you that a marriage can also function without mutual respect or in presence of neglect.</p>
              <p>The biggest question remains: is that the life you want?</p>
              <p>Marriage is but a mere shell. By itself, it is hollow and only by filling it up with representation of the individuals working for the relationship can it take shape. A relationship can be empty, yet the decision to remain together can still take effect. Therefore, In Love, you GROW three dimensions collectively: CloUdiSm states it as the physical, emotional and spiritual plane. You can't just try to grow the pie selectively because it creates an imbalance in the relationship (unless the relationship is spiritually very evolved to override, but this kind of relationships ain't as common).</p>
              <p>My point is very simple: review your situation and try to understand about your own inner workings and decide if there's a need to alter or remove certain barriers, before you can advance to the next stage in Love.</p>
