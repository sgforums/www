              <p>I am currently attached to one of the sweetest men I have ever known. We are going to register our marriage in a few weeks time but will only hold our customary banquet around a year later.</p>
              <p>The problem is my husband would like to consummate our marriage as soon as possible, possibly after ROM but for me I would like to hold it back for a bit longer, preferably until after our customary marriage. We are both virgins and have not had any intercourse throughout our 3 year relationship, although of course we do indulge in petting every now and then to satisfy our urges.</p>
              <p>Why would I want to wait longer? Maybe this is because I fear that I might get pregnant. Yes, I know there are condoms and all that, but all those can still fail to work at times. I know the percentage is very low, but I would rather be 100% sure that I will not get pregnant before the customary marriage. I am raised in a very conservative family and I know my parents would kill me if I dare to get into this kind of situation before the traditional wedding. And of course it wouldn't look appropriate for me to walk down the aisle in a wedding gown with a big tummy, would I? We are also not really financially stable to have a kid at this moment as both of us are still building our career and we also do not have our own house yet.</p>
              <p>I am afraid if I give in and let him make love to me before the traditional wedding I might break down because I am not ready for it and my mind would be worrying about a lot of things so I would not be able to enjoy it. I really do love him very much and I want to make love with him more than ever but I just have this nagging concern in my mind everytime I thought of doing it before the banquet. Am I being unreasonable? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"> I am afraid of disappointing him yet I am afraid if I give in before I am 100% ready, it will turn out to be a disaster. Sigh. Do give some opinions on this issue. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi Tinkerbelle</p>
              <p>Legally speaking, both of you are already husband and wife after your ROM, so I don't see any social stigma attached even if you are pregnant before your traditional wedding. Just bring the wedding forward before your stomach shows. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>
              <p>If you feel uncomfortable, you should talk to your future husband about it and I think he should understand. What's one more year when you've already waited for 3.</p>

              <p>Nope, he said he is willing to wait until after the banquet. Like what one of the forumers have mentioned before, he said if he has already waited 3 years, what's wrong with waiting another year?</p>
              <p>This thread is posted because of how I feel towards the whole thing. Even though he has agreed to wait, but I just feel bad that he can't go the whole way even when we are already legally married. Maybe it is because of my upbringing, what my parents said kept affecting my decisions, especially when it comes to this matter.</p>

              <p>Tinkerbelle, think with reason and logic. The thing about not having sex before the wedding is just because they don't want the guy to walk off and leave you after having sex, but he has already demonstrated that he is committed to this relationship.</p>
              <p>Maybe your parents just think that having sex before the traditional marriage makes you a whore or someone who sleeps around, but again your partner has already shown himself to be committed so the reasoning does not stand!</p>
              <p>If this is what's holding you back, I think you shouldn't let it. It's not about not being affected by your parents, it's about doing what is LOGICAL. If there is reason behind what your parents said, then by all means, but if the reasoning does not stand in this present context, then it shouldn't even be a problem, no!?</p>
              <p>I don't think your parents are crazy, they said what they did because there are logical reasons, but those reasons don't stand in the present context and it serves no purpose.</p>
              <p>Did they tell you specifically not to have sex with him before the traditional wedding? Or do you just think that they are against pre-marital sex? If it's the latter than I think they have actual practical reasons for it, and those reasons don't stand in the current situation. If it's the former... You should try to explain to them why it's not wrong to have sex with him before the traditional marriage, and in the end if they still disagree you should do what YOU think is right.</p>

              <p>Hi Tinkerbelle,</p>
              <p>I know how you feel. The impact of parents' influence to their children's mind, even when grown-ups cannot be dismissed. Mine is a sad story of my mum's impact on my life till now. And No, I'm no mummy's boy and I'm not going to indulge further, so don't ask.</p>
              <p>It's OK that you feel the same way your parents think. There is no need to feel bad about it at all. Tell your future husband, he should understand. And there is no need to justify yourself here.</p>

              <p>You are the man. and Tinkerbell is really a good daughter, she dunno how to lie to her parents. ok how bout this, take a rubber band and stretch until it snaps. and then ask yourself whether a moisten rubber or a dry rubber tears easier. And ask yourself whether does the latex that makes the condom actually is stretching during intercourse. (if you cant picture, take a cucumber and warm it in a 50 deg water. Ard 42 deg, put the condom on, and masturbate to see if it really tears.)</p>
              <p>Or if u wan more experimental prove, you can always (as indicated on durex slips), put the latex condom into water, and put another into oil( i seriously mean Hydrocarbons, like cooking oil or maybe margerine). use your hand(not fingernails, ur temple got no nails de) and seriously wring, rub, stretch the condom in water as well as in oil. you will see that the water one will not tear and the oil soaked will. esp under high friction.</p>
              <p>And vaginal discharge is 90% water.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unless your husband got elephant dick and took a viagra pill. Yes it can cus I have heard of it. Esp those who got gangrene after taking cocaine to have a hard cock, 3 days of unsubsided erection.</p>
              <p>And a standard condom unrolled length is longer than any of the asian dick size, so no matter how your husband wanna cheat, unless he cut a hole through I nth to say la.</p>
              <p>latex is actually hydrocarbon, thats why with the presence of hydrocarbons, the condom will become thinner and thinner until cell penetratable. So I seriously seriously dunno wad are u thinking.</p>
              <p>Unless you like the china case, teeth in vagina then I have nothing to say oso. or your G-spot is made of steel I dunno. as long as i noe condoms have not failed in proper use. if you all do oral sex then go penetrate then dun point your finger to durex company, u have just gotten the darwin award.</p>

              <p>I am currently attached to one of the sweetest men I have ever known. We are going to register our marriage in a few weeks time but will only hold our customary banquet around a year later.</p>
              <p>The problem is my husband would like to consummate our marriage as soon as possible, possibly after ROM but for me I would like to hold it back for a bit longer, preferably until after our customary marriage. We are both virgins and have not had any intercourse throughout our 3 year relationship, although of course we do indulge in petting every now and then to satisfy our urges.</p>
              <p>Why would I want to wait longer? Maybe this is because I fear that I might get pregnant. Yes, I know there are condoms and all that, but all those can still fail to work at times. I know the percentage is very low, but I would rather be 100% sure that I will not get pregnant before the customary marriage. I am raised in a very conservative family and I know my parents would kill me if I dare to get into this kind of situation before the traditional wedding. And of course it wouldn't look appropriate for me to walk down the aisle in a wedding gown with a big tummy, would I? We are also not really financially stable to have a kid at this moment as both of us are still building our career and we also do not have our own house yet.</p>
              <p>I am afraid if I give in and let him make love to me before the traditional wedding I might break down because I am not ready for it and my mind would be worrying about a lot of things so I would not be able to enjoy it. I really do love him very much and I want to make love with him more than ever but I just have this nagging concern in my mind everytime I thought of doing it before the banquet. Am I being unreasonable? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"> I am afraid of disappointing him yet I am afraid if I give in before I am 100% ready, it will turn out to be a disaster.

              lo... since tahan so long liao wait a yr more wun matter...</p>
              <p>even tho everything sounds ok but somehow u might still be
              worrying too much after chinese wedding... + are u saying in 1 yr
              both of u will be ready to handle 'accidents'? something to tink
              abt -&gt;actuali by holding out so much till after marriage it will
              only build up more expectations from ur hubby tat after marriage
              both of u are gonna be doing it like animals in heat[daily? or
              more]... if it somehow things dun go as he has planned/expected,
              then both of u will need some good talking and might lead to
              further headaches if not handled well....</p>

              <p>If it happens 1 year later after our traditional wedding, at least our parents won't have anything much to say anymore, I think by that time they would be pestering me to have kids anyway! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>And I am going to further my studies soon, so this is really a wrong time should an accident happen...because definitely it is going to disrupt my studies plus the fact we are not financially stable at the moment...</p>
              <p>Most people would just say, just do it, what for think until so far? But I believe every action will lead to certain consequences, and if I am not ready for the consequence, I rather not take the risk at all.</p>
