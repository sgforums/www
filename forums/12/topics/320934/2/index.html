              <p>Nope, he said he is willing to wait until after the banquet. Like what one of the forumers have mentioned before, he said if he has already waited 3 years, what's wrong with waiting another year?</p>
              <p>This thread is posted because of how I feel towards the whole thing. Even though he has agreed to wait, but I just feel bad that he can't go the whole way even when we are already legally married. Maybe it is because of my upbringing, what my parents said kept affecting my decisions, especially when it comes to this matter.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I understand ur dilema..u hav ur own ethnic to think abt as well as his feeling.  But since he is willing to respect &amp; wait until after the banquet, then be it.  If u fear tat he cannot take the test &amp; as a result look for flings outside jus becos u r standin at ur own stand, then y shld u ROM with him in the 1st place?  Shldnt trust be the main key for a r'ship to remain strong?  To express his wish to consumate rite after ur ROM is jus...an expression..to try his luck. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">If he said he wll wait, then he wll.  If he doesnt, at least b glad u hv not agree to his suggestion.    Y torture urself over it?  U hav vry strong points as to why u do not want to hav sex b4 the customary, so stick with it!</span></p>

              <p>You are the man. and Tinkerbell is really a good daughter, she dunno how to lie to her parents. ok how bout this, take a rubber band and stretch until it snaps. and then ask yourself whether a moisten rubber or a dry rubber tears easier. And ask yourself whether does the latex that makes the condom actually is stretching during intercourse. (if you cant picture, take a cucumber and warm it in a 50 deg water. Ard 42 deg, put the condom on, and masturbate to see if it really tears.)</p>
              <p>Or if u wan more experimental prove, you can always (as indicated on durex slips), put the latex condom into water, and put another into oil( i seriously mean Hydrocarbons, like cooking oil or maybe margerine). use your hand(not fingernails, ur temple got no nails de) and seriously wring, rub, stretch the condom in water as well as in oil. you will see that the water one will not tear and the oil soaked will. esp under high friction.</p>
              <p>And vaginal discharge is 90% water.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unless your husband got elephant dick and took a viagra pill. Yes it can cus I have heard of it. Esp those who got gangrene after taking cocaine to have a hard cock, 3 days of unsubsided erection.</p>
              <p>And a standard condom unrolled length is longer than any of the asian dick size, so no matter how your husband wanna cheat, unless he cut a hole through I nth to say la.</p>
              <p>latex is actually hydrocarbon, thats why with the presence of hydrocarbons, the condom will become thinner and thinner until cell penetratable. So I seriously seriously dunno wad are u thinking.</p>
              <p>Unless you like the china case, teeth in vagina then I have nothing to say oso. or your G-spot is made of steel I dunno. as long as i noe condoms have not failed in proper use. if you all do oral sex then go penetrate then dun point your finger to durex company, u have just gotten the darwin award.</p>

              <p>Hi TS,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Better read up more on contraception and the human bios....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My ger takes the Diane ( there are other brands) and not only it helps us with contraception, it also irons out all the kinks in hormonal unbalance and reduces possibility of cervical cancer. Oh, it also improves complexion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Down side; some girls may get a little roundier, dry and less horny. Oral contraception also won't prevent STDs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Talk to your gynae or priest. Hopefully they are the same gender as you!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P/S: Oral contraception dun mean fellatio, prish.</p>

              <p>Dear Tinker,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With all due respect, you must know why you do certain things. This is a forum and there are nonsense, fables, hear-say, old-wives tales among the facts...you have to be discerning enough ...</p>
              <p>If you are not ready, you are not ready. You need to read up, talk to specialists, explore etc...</p>
              <p>The last and worst thing to do is to do things sacrificially.  Dun 'I have sex with my husband cos that's only right while I die in pain...' etc...</p>
              <p>It is unfortunate that you are brought up in a society where sex is a taboo but with internet age, that is less of an issue for you....(in fact, there is an opposite problem with kids exposing to too much sex...)</p>
              <p>Learn to share what your hubby enjoys and share with him what you enjoy. Learn about sex together and openly with him. I wish you bliss.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm very sure your new hubby will NOT be overly happy if you are a sex guru with all the suarve moves!</p>
