              <p>I live @ Blk 145 Yishun Street 11, my neighbour living downstair have been creating nuisance noise as and when they like with thier own DIY renovation since more than 1 year + already and I had been tolerating them.</p>
              <p>until recently on 06 June this month they started doing heavy renovation.</p>
              <p>at times, they will start knocking, drilling early morning 8am + and at time late at night 11pm+ and this have been happening withing few days to a week for the pass 1 year +</p>
              <p>I had called the police, called/written letter to HDB, called up town council. seem like nothing working. They still doing their renovaion as and when they like at his own time.</p>
              <p>last saturday, 8:30am they start heavy knocking and drilling i called the police to come down, but accoding to the police they refuse to open up their door to talk to the police thus the police left.</p>
              <p>endured until 1:30pm, I went and bang on their door and question him abt his renovation. His reply was " they are doing renovation and they never do it every day so whats the problem"</p>
              <p>apart from they kocking and drilling, they hav huge Dogs in their home and are constantly barking all day long. so long their dogs hear "others" sound they start barking, when they hav visitor at their door they start barking. ( when their dog bark my Handphone measure 72dp, so u can imagine how nosiy it will be with the knocking and drilling)</p>
              <p>I can put up with their dogs barking, but really cannot torlerate anymore with their own DIY.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">according to HDU “Guidelines for Building Works” heavy renovation need to apply permit and the permit last for 1 month and only from monday to friday 9am - 5pm exculde public holidays and weekends.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The person from HDU called me up and said they can only go advise him, and they are allow to do their own DIY at homes.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Really? as and when they like and especially weekends and after office hours as and when they like?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">This is driving me crazy and these excessive noise really stress me up as i had been “<span style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">accommodating” it. </span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I definitely have <span style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">increased

              <p>Surely, their Long term renovation affects neighbors all around that unit; up, down left right. </p>
              <p>You should go talk to the other affected neighbors and together approach the inconsiderate unit owner.</p>
              <p>Agree on what time they can start and what time they should end. Be reasonable.</p>
              <p>Since it is DIY, you should allow limited after office hours for them to finish what they need to do.</p>
              <p>Do remember that one day, you or the other neighbors will have your/their turn renovating home too, and the table will be turned. So do unto others what you want others to do unto you or your better neighbors.</p>

              <p>Actually only 2 units are affected, coz I living on the 3rd floor corner unit, his is on the 2nd floor coner unit. The other unit affected is the one beside them but it seem to me they rather remain silent and endure it.</p>
              <p>I really hate to go to his house to knock on his door anymore. Well u can say I'm afraid to.</p>
              <p>Coz last saturday, when i go knock on his door, his Dogs already barking non stop. The moment he open the door, his giant dog already leap onto the metal gate and stand face to face to me and keep barking, If not for the gate i already in hosipital.</p>
              <p>I was confronting him and his dog keep barking until he go mad and punch and kick his poor dog to go away. If only u had seen his action toward that poor dog.</p>

              <p>What's the point of being so trigger happy? Hostility only begets hostility. </p>
              <p>Next time when u go talk to your downstairs neighbor, bring a bag of dog treat, make sure it's good quality stuff. Next time the dog see u, it will be wagging its tail instead of barking it's head off.</p>
              <p>Ask when he plans to complete the renovation, and offer your help to hasten the completion. When u help him u r also helping yourself.</p>

              <p>Nope, the police said since they refuse to open the door there nothing they can do and advice to seek HDB/Town council help and left.</p>
              <p>HDU so far only replied saying " they are allow to do DIY provided within the specific time and days and they would go advice them again"</p>
