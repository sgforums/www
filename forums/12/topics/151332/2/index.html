Dad said no cos mum used to give her $400, so must carry on giving the same amount.<br><br></div></blockquote>I would suggest that you go ahead and cut the allowance:<br><br>1. You are not your mother.<br>2. Working people some times get their pay cut as well.  So why should it not happen to kids?  The economic reality these days is that there are ups and downs.<br><br>You should just give her a fixed amount and stop paying for the other stuff like the mobile phone bill.  Let her manage on her own.  It will teach her valuable financial skills.<br><br>By cutting her allowance, cruel as it may seem to some people, you are telling her who is the boss as far as finance is concerned.  If she gets the point, she would have learnt a valuable lesson in life and understand that the world does not owe her a living.  Otherwise, she would likely be fired very quickly from whatever job she gets in the future.<br><br>regards,<br>siginah</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think your sister's being really immature. Either that or she's just trying to ignore the problems in her life by running away from them the way she's doing now. Maybe she doesn't even realize the kind of problems you're facing.<br><br>I respect you for what you've been doing, really. $400 is A LOT. That $400 could so be used somewhere esle. If all she's going to do is just have fun in her life while ignoring everything esle around her, then I think she needs a good talking to. Where's her sense of responsibility and independency? And she STILL expects to be fetched to school! She's not a queen for goodness sakes.<br><br>Do you know of anyone who could come help you out with the house works or stuff, at least until things are more stabilized?</div>
