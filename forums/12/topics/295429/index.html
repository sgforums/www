In fact, it's probably the first finger we often pinpoint whenever promiscuity/infidelity strikes in any relationship.<br><br>But I can tell you these only represent the catalysis.<br><br>The attribution to external causes per se only reveals a distorted truth; it always seeks to blur the real underlying problem of ourselves and tries to besmirch one's perception in Love.<br><br>Our relationship is never stagnant; stagnation is but an phrase we often used to describe the life of a relationship, but theoretically, relationship never stays dormant. A long period of stagnation is often unconscious degeneration of the relationship and before you know it, this degeneration will be revealed upon the introduction of 'catalysis'.<br><br>One must fully understand that relationship is indeed forged by freewill. Nobody is coerced to love another person; we love incidentally and later made the choice to further this love into a relationship. Therefore, you got to weigh your own risk to see if you are still willing to pool the resources to make this investment worthwhile.<br><br>Pull out if you can't seem to forgive - you will save yourself a lot of misery.<br><br>Hardwork never equate to success in love - you merely learn to adapt according to what your cosmic lesson would require and introspect regularly. Never set yourself on the degenerating path no matter what your encounters are - it's sad to know of people who saw the beauty of trust, only to destroy and blind this perception they once to bad circumstances.<br><br>So continue to keep good perspective and definition of love, but work hard at keeping the flame alive, if your decision is to continue. Three years of relationship might be a major consideration why you are still willing to give it a try, but if you are just planning to try-try-see-how, I say don't bother. Either you do your best to make it work, or drop everything altogether.<br><br>I will reiterate again: that would seriously save you a lot of misery.<br><br>If we go back to the golden rule - whatever decision you make, it <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>must </strong></span>eventually bring you happiness. From there, I believe it should dissolve your dilemmaÂ… like sugar to hot water. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oprah's View on Men<br>If a man wants you, nothing can keep him away.<br>If he doesn't want you, nothing can make him stay.<br>Stop making excuses for a man and his behavior.<br>Allow your intuition (or spirit) to save you from heartache.<br>Stop trying to change yourself for a relationship that's not meant to be.<br>Slower is better. Never live your life for a manbefore you find what makes you truly happy.<br>If a relationship ends because the man was not treating you as you deserve then heck no, you can't "be friends".<br>A friend wouldn't mistreat afriend.Don't settle. If you feel like he is stringing you along, then he probably is.<br>Don't stay because you think "it will get better."<br>You'll be mad at yourself a year later for staying when things are not better.<br>The only person you can control in a relationship is you.<br>Avoid men who've got a bunch of children by a bunch of<br>different women. He didn't marry them when he got them pregnant, why would he treat you any differently?<br>Always have your own set of friends separate from his.<br>Maintain boundaries in how a guy treats you. If something bothers you, speak up.<br>Never let a man know everything. He will use it against you later.<br>You cannot change a man's behavior. Change comes from within.Don't EVER make him feel he is more important than you are...<br>even if he has more education or in a better job. Do not make him into a quasi-god. He is a man, nothing more nothing less.<br>Never let a man define who you are.<br>Never borrow someone else's man. If he cheated with you, he'll cheat on you.A man will only treat you the way you ALLOW him to treat you.All men are NOT dogs.You should not be the one doing all the bending...compromise is two way street.You need time to heal between relationships...there is nothing cute about baggage... deal with your issues before pursuing a new relationship.You should never look for someone to COMPLETE you... a relationship consists of two WHOLE individuals. Look for someone complimentary, not supplementary.<br>Dating is fun...even if he doesn't turn out to be Mr. Right. Make him miss you sometimes...when a man always know where you are, and you're always readily available to him,he takes it for granted.<br>Never move into his mother's house. Never co-sign for a man. Don't fully commit to a man who doesn't give you everything that you need.<br>Keep him in your radar but get to know others.<br><br>They say it takes a minute to find a special person, an hour to appreciate them, a day to love them and an entire lifetime to forget them<br><br></div>
