            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I think that at this point of time you need to concentrate on expanding your social group of friends or pick up a new interest. Right now I am hundred percent sure that you are not happy after what has happened to your relationship. By brooding over it will not change the fact that yr boyfriend has strayed and you will live with this fact for the rest of your life.<br><br>It takes time to heal the pain rather than be unhappy why not otherwise. Go shopping, give yourself a treat, do something. your happiness is in your hands. I can totally understand how you feel currently cause 2 weeks ago my girlfriend went out with another guy. Maybe not as serious as yours but the betrayal was done (my post: girlfriend went out with another guy).<br><br>I felt betray, hurt, sad you name it anything negative I felt it. But after awhile I realised that he/she has no right to make us feel this way. None at all cause in a relationship if you care about someone, you dont want to hurt their feelings. So sometimes telling a white lie is better than telling the truth. Seen the Korean show "everybody has secrets"? Who in this entire world has never sin?? But if they have your interest at heart they will prevent you from knowing the truth.<br><br>Seems that you have decided to give this relationship another chance. So did I but from my experience, I have decided not to allow myself to be hurt by my girlfriend again. I have been actively knowing more friends in school and getting penpals through the net. Not that I want to find a new girlfriend but by talking to new friends and people, I actually feel better and realised that there is 4 million people in Singapore. Try talking to one new friend a day and I am sure that you will feel better after a while. As for your boyfriend, let him do the work cause if he really cherish you..... the rest is for you to judge.<br><br>Stay happy, you deserve it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
