As your relationship has gone into the third year stage, he find you bored. Man are made to make love with many female to ensure our mankind has the maximum survival lo. Dun blame the male, blame nature. SO female will have to try harder to catch hold of a male heart. If you are not up for it, forget it.</div></blockquote>Based on your logic, that means it is nature that female must only mate with the best male to ensure highest survival rate for the next generation. Then in that case you and I prob have to die a virgin.<br><br>I also understand your point of view in that "its nature's design" and do agree with you to some point. However, it is self control that differentiate us from beasts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i once read an account from a celebrity. when their husband of bf gaze at other girls or so and started to pay less attention to you.. You can try do some reverse psychology by dressing sexily,Be very confident then go change a new hairstyle and make sure you look gorgeous by putting on light makeup that is your eye area. so that means eyeliner and concealor is good enough. loose powder is not required if you have a very good skin complexion.. As i dun think guys gonna kiss a face that is full of powder.<br><br>And the most important thing is. i followed what she mentioned. and the effects is positive!. my boyfriend got ultimate protective and clings to me all the time even till today. I guess girls should never be complacent! Must pay attention to any beauty advice and keep upgrading.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
