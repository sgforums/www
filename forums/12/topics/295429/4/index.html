In fact, it's probably the first finger we often pinpoint whenever promiscuity/infidelity strikes in any relationship.<br><br>But I can tell you these only represent the catalysis.<br><br>The attribution to external causes per se only reveals a distorted truth; it always seeks to blur the real underlying problem of ourselves and tries to besmirch one's perception in Love.<br><br>Our relationship is never stagnant; stagnation is but an phrase we often used to describe the life of a relationship, but theoretically, relationship never stays dormant. A long period of stagnation is often unconscious degeneration of the relationship and before you know it, this degeneration will be revealed upon the introduction of 'catalysis'.<br><br>One must fully understand that relationship is indeed forged by freewill. Nobody is coerced to love another person; we love incidentally and later made the choice to further this love into a relationship. Therefore, you got to weigh your own risk to see if you are still willing to pool the resources to make this investment worthwhile.<br><br>Pull out if you can't seem to forgive - you will save yourself a lot of misery.<br><br>Hardwork never equate to success in love - you merely learn to adapt according to what your cosmic lesson would require and introspect regularly. Never set yourself on the degenerating path no matter what your encounters are - it's sad to know of people who saw the beauty of trust, only to destroy and blind this perception they once to bad circumstances.<br><br>So continue to keep good perspective and definition of love, but work hard at keeping the flame alive, if your decision is to continue. Three years of relationship might be a major consideration why you are still willing to give it a try, but if you are just planning to try-try-see-how, I say don't bother. Either you do your best to make it work, or drop everything altogether.<br><br>I will reiterate again: that would seriously save you a lot of misery.<br><br>If we go back to the golden rule - whatever decision you make, it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]must </span></strong>eventually bring you happiness. From there, I believe it should dissolve your dilemmaÂ… like sugar to hot water. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers[/b]</blockquote> I agree totally with the moderator, for the advice is practical yet caring and sincere.<br><br>I like the part especially about the explanation of 'stagnation in relationship' and 'hard work never equate to success in love'.<br><br>Take care, TS.<br><br>If you are able to extend that same dedication and care towards people all around you, other just your bf, you would find that the love from others, who you call friends, would be more rewarding in ways which you can only experience for yourself.<br><br>Wish you all the best.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
