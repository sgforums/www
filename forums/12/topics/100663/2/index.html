That may sound great on the surface, getting all sorts of presents and expensive treats all the time.  Most of her guy friends end up falling for her and she couldn't possibly accept all of them.  So she often has to be harsh on them and reject them.  If she rejects them nicely, the guys will still be persistant.  If she rejetcs them harshly, she will lose a friend.  Telling them that she's attached (she was) isn't very effective.  Some guys are just damn persistant.  And because of that, she does not have many guy friends.  She still has got girl friends right?  Not really.  Because of the attention she gets from the guys, some girls get a bit jealous or misunderstood her.  They think she is making use of all the guys to do things for her.  She became an outcast from the girl's group as well.  Her social life is heavily affected.  This dear friend of mine is a bubbly and cheerful girl.  One thing she cannot stand is to be all alone.  And it seem that she is heading towards that direction.  She's a kind-hearted person by nature.

I am totally clueless on what advice to give her, I mean TOTALLY!  Then only thing I can say to her is "poor thing".  Anyone got simillar experience?  Can tell me how you often handle these things?</div></blockquote>Hmmm Don be too stressed over such things... its just a bad experience, and for her... it would simmer down as time goes by. She doesn't have to purposely do something to please her friends, be who she is.. and as time goes by, her good points would be shown. What she ought to do now is to continue living as per normal and be strong.<br><br>For guy friends, go on making new ones.... have a clear cut relationship that not more than friends...unless she is interested in the guy and that, she wanna consider him.... then by all means... However, I feel (maybe, I am wrong.. just a guess) that she probably pass the wrong signal to the previous guys that were around her. She can't be treating them as normal friends.... becoz, guys need to see something in the girl... and that the girl's reaction and behavior towards them before going after her. Simple explanation... if you are the guy, the girl comes in being friendly.. and you feel so comfortable with her around.. becoz, she behaves and really really so close to you... You will think about going after her.. won't you?<br><br>As for girl friends, go and make some new ones..... keep on knowing new friends.. and socialize around.. That would probably help her to better understand how to cope a friendship with a girl.... and how to with a guy... Maybe, your friend is quite young, hence, she needs a certain level of attention now.... so, that gotta depends on herself, her maturity and her values in life.<br><br>So, as a friend...maybe you would want to advise her... and talk to her. Refrain from leading any guys on.. becoz, that makes a bad reputation for her.. and she loses alot of friends... and... the most important of all, that's not RIGHT! Start mixing with new friends, knwing new friends... IN THE DECENT WAY! Go for sport activities... or camping.... or get a part time job to do... widen social circle....<br><br>Girls are very sensitive and emotional gender. Why would they go gang up together and condemn the other girl.. it probably would be anger over the girl, or maybe the girl's too pretty.. but that's a girl's way. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Girls are not meant to be understood.. They are meant to be dote on... and love. They might be crazy and stupid at times, but when they are cute.... it will melt your heart... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I hope that would be some suggestions... erm... sorry if I sound impolite.. but I prefer to go direct and hit the bull eye... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

There too many guys who would pursure their "love" simply because the girl is chio.  When they see a chio girl, their hearts starts to pound faster, blah blah.  "Oh, that must be love!"  Geez!!  But of course, not everyone is like that lah.<br><br>But I do agree to the point that her behavior might be the main reason she attracting more attention.  Like I mentioned, she's a bubbly &amp; cute girl by nature.  To some (including myself), she's like acting cute.  But that's just the character she has.  So sub-consciously, she's getting the attention from guys.<br><br>Under the circumstances now, the best idea is probably to change her own character, maybe in to someone more mature.  But I have come to realise that changing your personality is extremly difficult.  You'll have to try it yourself to see the challenge.  And even if she succeed in doing that, she'll probably attract some other breed of guys (she's chio remember?).  You can't possibly ask her to disfigure herself.<br><br>And by the way, this friend of mine is a super social animal.  She just loves being around with many many friends.  The "girl friends get jealous" part doesn't happen that often, though it is still very much a problem!  But "guys falling for her" happens all the time.</div>

She's not in that kinda situation all the time.  There're times when she's enjoying company from true, no-love-involved friends.

I mean...  even I like to see her nicely dressed too (who wouldn't?)!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>And anyway, even with just t-shirt jeans and ponytail, she's not gonna look any worse.  Sometimes she wears those "just-woke-up" attires outside.  Even that, she can get guys who wants to make friends with her...  not that I'm surprised about it.  Either guys these days are too desperate or she's just too irresistable.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Maybe she is acting cute/flirtatious in front of the guys? Also the way she dresses may be too attention seeking?<br>Girls will gossip abt girls who act slutty or bimbotic<br><br>Tell her not to be overtly friendly to those guys she has no interest in cos she is misleading them.

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I can't really agree on this point. <strong>There too many guys who would pursure their "love" simply because the girl is chio</strong>. When they see a chio girl, their hearts starts to pound faster, blah blah. "Oh, that must be love!" Geez!! But of course, not everyone is like that lah.<br><br>But I do agree to the point that her behavior might be the main reason she attracting more attention. Like I mentioned, she's a bubbly &amp; cute girl by nature. To some (including myself), she's like acting cute. But that's just the character she has. So sub-consciously, she's getting the attention from guys.<br><br>Under the circumstances now, the best idea is probably to change her own character, maybe in to someone more mature. But I have come to realise that changing your personality is extremly difficult. You'll have to try it yourself to see the challenge. And even if she succeed in doing that, she'll probably attract some other breed of guys (she's chio remember?). You can't possibly ask her to disfigure herself.<br><br>And by the way, this friend of mine is a super social animal. She just loves being around with many many friends. The "girl friends get jealous" part doesn't happen that often, though it is still very much a problem! But "guys falling for her" happens all the time.<strong><br><br>Yes.. I agree some guys are really persistent.. but, somehow.. tried once.. tried twice.. by the third time... he would find no point in pursuing.. becoz, he just got "banged on his face" everynow and then.. Maybe, he would be quietly "waiting" for your friend. But, that doesn't disturb her life at all, moreover people has got NO REASON to run gossips about her. Kill two birds with one stone...Hmm... you and your friend can't possibly.. stop the guy from liking her.. but, I think... by hardcore rejecting... does help her to cope all these problems?<br><br>And, er... I think like what you mentioned.... about maturity... It plays a hell big role in dealing with such situations.... She is probably, still very childlike and is unable to handle such situations.... Probably, such bad experiences.. will make her learn. Heard about the butterfly story?? A butterfly trying to breakfree from the 'shell', however, being helped by a kind-hearted soul...which in turn a pretty butterfly into a dead butterfly. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Let your friend grow out of this stage.... she will ..... Don worry too much!<br><br>Ops sorry... again, like I mentioned on the previous reply... No hard feelings about my direct remarks... just want to hit the bull eye.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></strong></div>
