We sometimes have we very normal friends like colleuges, or classmates.  But we still need friends like these. those you see everyday.  And if problem arises between your classmates or colleuges, then you'll be left all alone.  Being "stabbed" is a harsh word.  I'd say that she's just being misunderstood.  I dunno why girls are like that.  No offence to the ladies.  But I realise this very strange girl culture.  They tend to gang up together to go against a single girl (or a few) they "don't like", for whatever reason, leaving this girl all alone.  I'm not trying to take sides cos we won't know for sure who has offended who.  But there's always this sort of pattern going on in the girls-to-girls rivalry.  Guys tend to be more direct about these thing.  You buay song with that guy, you just "kick his ass".<br><br>What I'm trying to say here is, her friends are probably not at fault too.  I mean, if there's someone who's really using guys like that, she probably deserved to be condemned.  But for this case, it's just a major misunderstanding.  And to make things worse, she probably won't be given much chance to "explain herself".<br><br>If you try to explain to her friends, they'll probably think you're just one of her victims.</div>

She wanna be friends with everyone, as much as possible.  Though, up to this point, it's probably a better idea to stay away from the guys.  She didn't know what to do.

Ideally, she wants many friends, guys and girls who treats her like a normal friend, no special feelings involved.  She won't need to get rid of so many guys if they don't fall for her in such huge numbers.</div>

We sometimes have we very normal friends like colleuges, or classmates.  But we still need friends like these. those you see everyday.  And if problem arises between your classmates or colleuges, then you'll be left all alone.  Being "stabbed" is a harsh word.  I'd say that she's just being misunderstood.  I dunno why girls are like that.  No offence to the ladies.  But I realise this very strange girl culture.  They tend to gang up together to go against a single girl (or a few) they "don't like", for whatever reason, leaving this girl all alone.  I'm not trying to take sides cos we won't know for sure who has offended who.  But there's always this sort of pattern going on in the girls-to-girls rivalry.  Guys tend to be more direct about these thing.  You buay song with that guy, you just "kick his ass".<br><br>What I'm trying to say here is, her friends are probably not at fault too.  I mean, if there's someone who's really using guys like that, she probably deserved to be condemned.  But for this case, it's just a major misunderstanding.  And to make things worse, she probably won't be given much chance to "explain herself".<br><br>If you try to explain to her friends, they'll probably think you're just one of her victims.</div></blockquote>you're right, i found out that there's alot of backstabbing and btching among girls..only that we don't see it.<br><br>and some girls are really keen on *just* being friends with guys. 3/4 of the girls i met are such examples <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>anyway, i understand what you're trying to say. but i wanna ask you: how do you know it's just a misunderstanding and not the truth? have you found out from her friends about why they think she's that kind of person?<br><br></div>

If I just keep siding on my friend &amp; tell her that those who condemn her are bitches, it won't solve anything.  So I start from a neutral point.  I believe most ppl have their own reason for doing things.  But since I dun know the reason, I'll just presume that it's a misunderstanding.  And I believe it is so, based on my brief experience on different people's relationship with others.  It's not easy to be impartial...  especially if you're listening only to one side of the story.</div>

Bothered cos no one will fancy you?  I guess it must have been one hell of a life.  But being pretty has their problems too.  I had a friend who's like that.<br><br>Being chio, she naturally attracted all the guy's attention.  All the guys who fancy her treats her super well.  That may sound great on the surface, getting all sorts of presents and expensive treats all the time.  Most of her guy friends end up falling for her and she couldn't possibly accept all of them.  So she often has to be harsh on them and reject them.  If she rejects them nicely, the guys will still be persistant.  If she rejetcs them harshly, she will lose a friend.  Telling them that she's attached (she was) isn't very effective.  Some guys are just damn persistant.  And because of that, she does not have many guy friends.  She still has got girl friends right?  Not really.  Because of the attention she gets from the guys, some girls get a bit jealous or misunderstood her.  They think she is making use of all the guys to do things for her.  She became an outcast from the girl's group as well.  Her social life is heavily affected.  This dear friend of mine is a bubbly and cheerful girl.  One thing she cannot stand is to be all alone.  And it seem that she is heading towards that direction.  She's a kind-hearted person by nature.  But she's now being looked upon as heartless, arragont, teacher's pet, using guys, all sorts of bad things.<br><br>What could she have done?  I am totally clueless on what advice to give her, I mean TOTALLY!  Then only thing I can say to her is "poor thing".  Anyone got simillar experience?

While she keep those closer friends of hers, can have more 'hi-bye' friends...? Go for outings but don't get too near to people... Don't even have to exchange contact numbers...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Try to find more net friends to correspond with...

Agree that guys who are TOO PERSISTENT should be 'keep off'...? Anyway, can give them a formal warning 1st...? Also can serve as a 'warning' to tell the others...?

            <div class='col-md body'>With the girls: The way to handle is to be non-threathening, not to seek out guy's attention by her dressing &amp; behaviour. Girls don't like it when u behave flirty when there are guys around. Sometimes hang out &amp; talk girls' stuff like   manicure, make-up etc.<br><br>With the guys: Treat them as normal frens, don't show favour to anyone in particular cos the guys  can also get jealous. Tell the pesistent ones  she is not ready for r/s. Act serious, talk to them abt sch. work, projects.<br>Don't encourage SMS/ chatting cos give guys wrong idea.<br><br>If she gets gifts from the guys, she shd share with everyone. If the guys invite her to go out, she shd incl. the girls &amp; make it into class outing.<br>This way, she learn to balance- giving both sexes her attention.</div>
