Bothered cos no one will fancy you?  I guess it must have been one hell of a life.  But being pretty has their problems too.  I had a friend who's like that.<br><br>Being chio, she naturally attracted all the guy's attention.  All the guys who fancy her treats her super well.  That may sound great on the surface, getting all sorts of presents and expensive treats all the time.  Most of her guy friends end up falling for her and she couldn't possibly accept all of them.  So she often has to be harsh on them and reject them.  If she rejects them nicely, the guys will still be persistant.  If she rejetcs them harshly, she will lose a friend.  Telling them that she's attached (she was) isn't very effective.  Some guys are just damn persistant.  And because of that, she does not have many guy friends.  She still has got girl friends right?  Not really.  Because of the attention she gets from the guys, some girls get a bit jealous or misunderstood her.  They think she is making use of all the guys to do things for her.  She became an outcast from the girl's group as well.  Her social life is heavily affected.  This dear friend of mine is a bubbly and cheerful girl.  One thing she cannot stand is to be all alone.  And it seem that she is heading towards that direction.  She's a kind-hearted person by nature.  But she's now being looked upon as heartless, arragont, teacher's pet, using guys, all sorts of bad things.<br><br>What could she have done?  I am totally clueless on what advice to give her, I mean TOTALLY!  Then only thing I can say to her is "poor thing".  Anyone got simillar experience?  Can tell me how you often handle these things?</div></blockquote>Okay, since I have only one month here, I think I can help.  What you do is introduce to me and I'll do the complete opposite of what the guys are doing.  I'll reject her right of the bat and treat her badly.  LOL  She can send me home and go home by herself.  Do her a favour she needs something fresh new stuff.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
