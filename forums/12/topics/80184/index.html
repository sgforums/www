            <div class='col-md body'>Dont confess after u know her for a short time(as in few days or wks unless u are sure she is already attracted by u). Instead of asking her out and sending all those flowers and gifts, u shld rather take a look at the mirror.<br>Now dont misunderstand me, what i meant was that u shld change the way you portray yourself in front of her. If you buy all those gifts and such for girls that will only show that u are trying to supplement your shortcomings with those gifts(obviously showing that u need her - which is what girls dont like)<br>What you shld do is to let her feel attracted to you(teasing is a good way). ANd NEVER TRY TO IMPRESS A GIRL. JUST BE YOURSELF.<br>And 1 last thing - girls like to feel challenged. For example if a girl is pretty/beautiful, she is being pampered with attention from lots of guys. If you do the same as other guys do(that is embracing her beauty by buying her gifts) you would be boring to her(becos she gets it everytime). What u shld instead is to challenge her beauty (e.g by forging ignorance about her beauty or feel normal or not attracted by her beauty). She would feel challenged and find you interesting becos u react different from other guys.<br>^-^</div>
