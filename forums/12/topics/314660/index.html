              <p>Sir,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>kopiosatu had given the best advices. I was a volunteer with the Singapore Association for the Deaf. It's not a shame or embarassment to suffer partial hearing impairment. Brace up man!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There's a lady that I know who's hearing imparied in one ear but eventually became a lawyer. Though she now switched line.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Life's a fight sometimes. Jiayou~</p>

              <p>You ought to wear a hearing aid for the benefit of your schooling and social life.</p>
              <p>Don't ever think that the presence of wearing a hearing aid is a source of embarrassment for you. Your peers and teachers ought to accept you for the way you are.</p>
              <p>In addition, there are smaller hearing aids available in the market thats embedded into the ear canal.</p>

              <p>I seen my friend wearing this before, he still so cheerful and open, I know he might have hearing problem but none of us bother to ask him on this. That is because we don't think it is a problem at all.<br>Just wear the hearing aid, come on. It may take you few days or 1 month to get used to it, but will benefit you the whole life.<br><br>If you don't wear it and let the hearing issue disturbed you everyday, you will regret.</p>
              <p>Just a small note, if you are at a extremely noisy environment and don't want to be disturbed by it, you can take down this device anytime, so convenient.</p>

              <p>deja_vu88, I'm also partially hearing-impaired. I have lost the hearing ability of a few frequencies/pitch/tone since young. :)</p>
              <p>I agreed that being partially hearing-impaired does has it's own disadvantages and sometimes it's also quite frustrating trying to figure out what the other person is talking. However, I also learnt to overcome this weakness by being more outspoken. Since I can't quite make out what the other person is trying talking sometimes, I learnt to ask OPEN-ENDED questions to others and myself. You see, most questions encountered in a normal conversation are usually limited to a certain number of replies. So what I did was only to figure out briefly what the other person's reply was and I'll follow up with another opinion+question. I was able to figure out the reply briefly cos I wasn't completely deaf....I could still listen to a song but I would never be able to figure out what the singer is singing without reading the lyrics.</p>
              <p><br>Frankly speaking, I have tried to explain my hearing distress to many of my close friends and sometimes new friends. But they were all in disbelief of my hearing-impairment. Haven't found a single person who could have the empathy to understand and doesn't discriminate against my hearing handicap. Anyway, also thanks to all these people that caused me to find strength within myself to overcome this deficiency.</p>
              <p>I'm not wearing any hearing aids and have never wear any of them and will never wear any of them. I totally dislike the idea of wearing them and I'm happier when my world is more quiet than normal people.</p>
              <p>It's not easy to live in this world without the sense of hearing awareness. But I believed there are always ways and methods that I could find within myself to overcome all these obstacles and live a normal life like anyone else. And I would also encourage you to do the same too.</p>
              <p><br>Good Luck and all the best to whatever decision you decided to take. :)</p>

              <p>Have you watched this Japanese drama - Orange Days? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>Someone recommended it to me and I think it's really ... a good watch. It's about a two university undergraduates who befriend each other in school and find out about the paths they want to take in life, and one of them is nearly completely deaf.</p>

              <p><br>yes yes!! but i can't get it on crunchyroll anymore. :| It's a good show.</p>
              <p>Ts and Parn, i think both of you are very special people. Don't be ashamed of wearing a learning aids. If it helps you to understand what others are talking about, i think you should wear it.</p>
              <p>Have u heard of the special olympics ? I always admire people who overcome their own disabilites. I have a volunteering friend who is blind in one eye but she still help others who are worse off than her. Despite her disabilites, she does not seem to let these disabilites become an obstacle and striveto live her life to the fullest.</p>
              <p>Even people who are healthy does not possess there same cheerfulness.</p>
