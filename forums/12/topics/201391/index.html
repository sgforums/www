Certainly if u keep quiet when in social gatherings doesn't sound anything like that.....Or when u get anxious and present urself in a bad light in front of ur boss...<br><br>I feel that u may have to <strong>fully</strong> accept that u still got quite a bit of it.<br><br>As for how to stop being so self-conscious, may I suggest:<br><br>1) Speak louder (at a normal level though) everytime u r at work or social gatherings<br><br>2) Try to force urself to socialise more often with people ur not comfy with<br><br>3) Keep an open mind and be receptive to criticism. If pple say u r "blur", just smile it off even though u feel u r not<br><br>4) Just remember that it's not the end of the world if even if u screw up and expose ur anxiety<br><br>Hope that was helpful  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Its weird. Sometimes i ask myself, how come others can make mistakes and not be scolded, but when i do something for this 1 time i get scolded?<br><br>I think its my personality... or maybe when i do something wrong i get anxious and react before thinking...<br><br>Hmm. i guess i strayed again. haha. i don't even know what i'm trying to say.~</div></blockquote>Take it easy on yourself...

Then realise that it's ok to let yourself go once in a while when you're within a group.. Others probably won't be caring as much as you do...<br><br>You can even try organising some gathering or event for your friends if you like...? Never mind about the outcome, but just at least have a shot at things to see how it feels like...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

It's social anxiety disorder right???<br>Do you want to chat with me on msn?<br>g_rayz@hotmail.com<br><br>I have some things to share with you that might open your eyes.<br>But first,think of this - For ALL your life....What has this disorder done for you? Has it lead you to any positive things? i mean,there IS a positive in this. There is a very good reason for you to have this so called "disorder".<br><br>Finally,I found someone that writes word for word(what you wrote above)what I wrote before somewhere.<br><br>Hear from you soon!</div>
