Did you ask her what memories does the phone contain? Is it about you and her? If it is, you can try to make it up by showing her your phone, if you kept pictures of her and you together.<br><br>Let her have some time to cool down. Contact her again a few days later. Ask her out for lunch. Ask if she's still angry. Do something to cool her down, like bring her to play or something.<br><br>About education, you can upgrade yourself anytime. Don't be hindered by the difference.<br><br>You can try searching all the shops, but doubt you will get it back. If there are sensitive things inside, make a police report. Otherwise, take it as a lesson learnt.</div>

Its only the phone. I can picture if its something bigger, like her branded bag, or spill coffee over her brand new couch. I'd say let her go. No matter how much the phone means to her, I'm sure you feel very bad &amp; apologetic enough. And she has no need to consent further abuses at you. I mean she can hit and punch you to let it out, but making subjective comparisons among yourselves?<br><br>My gf lost an ipod, a Levis card, an organiser that i bought for her. I didn't raise a tone, only reassure her that its ok and then, just buy new and better replacements for her as per each of the above items.</span></div>

In the end we thought is a big issue and break off for the wrong reason.<br><br>If she really do not love or like you at all trust me she will not even get angry or care what you say. She will be spending time away from you instead of quarreling with you.<br><br></div>
