            <div class='col-md body'>Is this 1st time that she is blew up at you? or is this the dunno how many times le? If its the 1st time, maybe wait for her to cool down before you msg her. As you said the phone means a lot to her, maybe she really was upset. But if she is always behaving like this, I think its time for you to rethink if you still want to be with her.  All people in the world have a limit to how much you can take it, once you breach the limit, then it will be hard to go back.<br><br>So what if you got a degree in sg? You take a walk to orchard and throw a stone, percentage of hitting a degree holder (local or overseas) is very high. If she think that since she is a degree holder and is high up in the ladder, den dump her. This type of girls are only waiting to marry into a rich family and be a full time tai tai. Btw, r u rich? maybe thats why she is with you? jus joking  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Break or wait, its up to you. But if she always blew up on me, I will let her go. Cos its better for a person to be sad then 2 person, if she will be sad.<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I kinda noticed the more you study, the higher you expect yourself to go. Maybe that explains her behaviour but im not saying all Uni peeps are like that.
