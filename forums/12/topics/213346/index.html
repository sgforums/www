            <div class='col-md body'>My friend's beautiful wife<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Bro, please bear with me as I am an inexperience writer. The story is for sharing and when I find time, I will try to complete the story.<br><br>Although this is a real Singapore story, the content is modified slightly and the names changed completely to protect the identity of the people. This story happened in year 2004.<br><br>Both Shawn and me are close friends since secondary school days and we studied at the same junior college, often skipping P.E. lessons together. We will always give all sorts of reasons from stomach ache to leg pain. I think the teacher in charge has given up hope on us and she has been lecturing me about the tough training that I will have to go through in National Service if I donÂ’t prepare myself well. Her favourite line is :Â”Freddy, you are going to suffer big time next year.Â” I cannot be bothered as I feel that P.E. is not an important subject as it is afterall, not examinable. Shawn does not do as well as me in studies but is much fitter than me. He skips P.E. because he finds it a chore to do stupid exercises and partly, to accompany me.<br><br>After the Â“A LevelÂ” examination, we worked on a project to do volunteering work for a home for the aged while waiting for enlistment. In every sense, we are considered good students who excel in our school work but somehow, none of the gals in schools are attracted to us.<br><br>Both Shawn and me were enlisted to National Service in the March batch to the same Tekong Camp and in the same platoon and section. When I was there, it was a cultural shock as the NCOs and officers communicate with us using lots of vulgarities. I answered back and was told that I should leave my Air Level thinking behind and that they will be there to whip me to shape. I would have talked back more with idioms and nice quotes from the literature books, if not being stopped by Shawn.<br><br>During the next three months, I was always picked to appear stupid and scolded for being slow, weak and therefore branded as one who needs more extra duty and extra drill. Being a loyal friend, Shawn is always at my side to support me and encourage me. He did extra drill with me and helped me run errands when he is in mainland Singapore. Shawn is a natural leader and because he helped me, several of the recruits also joined him to lending me a helping hand. Slowly, life in the camp becomes more tolerable as I adjusted my expectations and outlook to the 2.5 years of slavery life.<br><br>Unlike me, Shawn did not get a place in the local universities, although he has very good track record in the area of performing arts, sports and games, including leadership. After BMT, I was sent to an infantry unit as an ordinary rifleman while Shawn is sent to the NCO course. At the course, he became buddies with a polytechnic graduate, James. The two got along very well and they went through an even tougher training. Shawn was subsequently selected for the Officer Cadet Course while James was sent for further guards training. For reasons not known to me, Shawn dropped out of the OCS course and he later became a guards NCO and both guys were in the same camp and platoon.<br><br>The three of us met up and became closer friends. As none of us have girlfriend, we would spend our weekend in Orchard area ogling at pretty gals and complaining about officers in their case and for mine, it is complaining about the NCOs. Nonetheless, over the months, I became physically stronger while Shawn and James remain about the same.<br><br>This routine of meeting up regularly carried on for the rest of the NS stint until we ORDed. I went on to university while Shawn and James pursued a private university degree programme. This time, we would meet up at the private university degree campus to talk about gals and school work, which I often helped both of them. During university days, Shawn and James picked up gambling habits and both gambled quite heavily. Somehow, they were quite lucky a few times and had quite a good windfall from betting in overseas betting sites.<br><br>Shawn bought a second hand car and James found himself a girlfriend. Her name is Joan. Joan is the perfect angel in both Shawn and my eyes and we swore that if we ever have a wife like Joan, we would skip all the physical contact with world to spend more time in bed with her. She is 1.7 m tall, slim and very demure, yet sophisticated in her looks. I cannot described gals well but she is certainly extraordinary. She is certainly a cut above the rest of the gals and when she is with a bevy of gals, she will stand out as the most physically impressive. I was particularly afraid to look at her in the face because she is so beautiful that I imagine to myself that by taking a longer look, I will lose my soul. Some of those gals which forum bros, including seasoned bros praised to the sky as 9 or 9.5 out of 10 is like 4 out 10, when I benchmarked her with these gals. Maybe my standard is very high after seeing one of the best, if not the best.<br><br>Bros, Part 2 of the instalment. I hope bros will like this story. Will try to post more today because I will not have the time next week to write. Recalling the facts and re-construcing it takes sometime as I am a very inexperience writer.<br><br>After graduating, I got a marketing job and that gave me lots of free time but my income is also dependent on my effort. Shawn started to lose quite a bit in gambling and he sold his car. He was luckier as he got himself a sales job with a medium sized company that require him to travel frequently and in short notice, like one day or half day notice. James got himself a junior executive job as the employer doesnÂ’t recognize his qualification because it is deemed as unworthy given it is distance learning degree. Anyway, Shawn's employer recognised him as a graduate while James's employer does not recognise the degree. After about a year, James tied the knot with Joan and bought a new flat from the inheritance he received from his father who passed away not too long ago.<br><br>We were invited to his ROM reception and his wife with make up was even more angelic, more beautiful and more sophisticated than we could have imagined. I think the guests were all commenting on her super beautiful wife. The gown is a tight fitting and Shawn and myself could now guess her figure more accurately. Shawn asked James, when only the three of us were at the table - whatÂ’s Joan statistics? Shawn and myself have been guessing that she is 33B, 24 and 35. James said that he does not know as he has never violated her before, although he would tonight. He added that he finds her so perfect that he feels extremely guilty if he were to violate her before ROM. James and Shawn are hardcore gambling addicts and they started to bet on JoanÂ’s statistics. Despite my protest about not gambling, Shawn pulled me into the picture and I am now one of the punters.<br><br>If we were correct in our estimate James will buy us a good dinner at Raffles City and if we lose, we will invite several of our common friends, James and Joan for a dinner together. We waited for a week before James finally called us and we met up for a drink after work. I asked him what takes him so long for a simple answer. He just said that it is his honeymoon, without revealing the details and said that Shawn and me lost by a small margin of error. From his face, I can see a tired but completely satisfied look. Something that Shawn said he could not see even after they have completed the most arduous mission in NS.<br><br>In the meantime, Shawn betted heavily on the European Cup and lost quite a fair bit. He asked if I could pay me for the dinner in instalment? I told him not to worry about it. I will take care of everything. A week later, we held a catered buffet dinner at a Chalet for about 20 persons, as the list of common friends grew. I have always wanted to give all those who have supported and encouraged me in BMT a treat. Shawn thanked me profusely for paying for the dinner which only added up to about $600, including beers and cigarettes. I am quite a thrifty guy and have saved almost every cent earned. Besides, I have been working very hard for the past one year and my income qualifies me a Gold card, not too bad for a fresh graduate.<br><br>The dinner was good and everyone was enjoying the food and all the horny guys, correction, all the guys were given a treat to their eyes enjoying the sight of beautiful Joan. My fabulous seafood buffet seem insignificant in satisfaction value compared to just sitting there and ogling at Joan. Joan was wearing a big t/shirt and a tight shorts, revealing a good part of her flawless and creamy white pair of legs but not her ample blossoms. During the conversations with the guys, they would stopped their conversations half way whenever the distractions appear. I managed to do some self control and remind myself constantly that I will not get distracted.<br><br>Overall, the guys were happy to be invited and very soon, all left except Shawn, James and myself. Joan has left earlier as James would like to spend some time just catching up with us like the good old NS days where we would talked about gals, about bureaucratic and inefficient government policies, about neigbours, about NS colleagues, about the chioness of any passing gals, etcÂ…<br><br>The conversation just carried on to football and the latest craze of the European Cup. Instead of a peaceful happy evening together, James and Shawn were arguing like crazy. I never have a soft spot for football because I never understand why people can be excited by looking at a screen of several guys chasing after one ball? Since the two were like quarreling, I stepped in stop the two guys by changing the topic of football to fishball noddles. That didnÂ’t help because fishball noodle is not something that interests them. In essence, there is some disagreement about which team will win the next match and both felt that only they know which team will win and no other second opinion will be tolerated. If they are so accurate, I think it is better for them to join the bookies.<br><br>Shawn said that he has just taken a credit line and has some good spare cash. He challenged James to a bet of a few thousand dollars. James was quiet for a while. I knew that James will not have this kind of money to bet with him, given that he has spent a bomb on honeymoon and house renovation. Shawn, taking advantage of JamesÂ’s quietness started calling him names like NATO, coward, etcÂ… This got James really infuriated.<br><br>James told Shawn that he donÂ’t bet a few thousand dollars, he prefers to bet $10,000 if Shawn dares. Shawn shot back and said, show me the money and the bet is on. James said that he doesnÂ’t have the money but will offer a night of romance with his beautiful wife if Shawn wins. Both of us were taken aback by his suggestion. Although we secretly lust for Joan, we know our limits and has always treasured our friendship.<br><br>James is known as a very trustworthy guy with his words. He always claim that his words is as good as diamonds because it is forever and it can be taken at face value. Shawn pulled me into the bet and said, what about 2 nights of romance, one for me and one for him if we win the bet. I told James that he should not be putting his wife out for a bet and what happens if he were to lose the bet. This has fallen on deaf ears, possibly because the guys have a few drinks too many.<br><br>Shawn reminded me that he helped me during BMT, otherwise I may have died from torture and the tough training. He asked if $5,000 was too big a sum to repay him for his kindness at BMT. Basically, he wanted me to be part of the bet. I said okay if this will repay all his kindness and he is not to mention anymore of those I owe him this and that in future. I was rather pissed by him but was quietly happy inside me that I bought a chance to bonk Joan.<br><br>The third and final part of the instalment for today. There is so much more to recap and write. I hope you guys are enjoying the story.<br><br>The result showed that Shawn won the match. James was devastated and said that he needed time to talk to Joan about this bet. Shawn was overjoyed with the opportunity to bonk Joan. I was also very happy with outcome but decided that it is a wrong thing to do, if we really make James pay for the part of his bet. I told James that Joan need not sleep with me and I am a very difficult person to satisfy. It is better not to spoil the friendship. I also urged Shawn to give up his rights in the presence of James but Shawn was very reluctant and said that he needed time to think about it. James thanked me and left.<br><br>Two days later, James invited Shawn and me to his place. When we were there, he spoke to Shawn and me about the bet and offered his apologies that he is unable to fulfill his<br><br>That's alot more, pls give your support thru reply the thead<br><br>To be continue</div>
