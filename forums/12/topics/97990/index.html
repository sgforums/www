According to Singapore's standards , superior must always take junior's credit away. Junior always must kai superior's mah pi by doing his dirty job.  Atm you can't do anything . He is your superior - u can jump to his superior and complain but it won't be good for you either. Eitherway you are stuck.<br>You have to keep your mouth shut about your resentment and wait for a chance to show him up (which prolly will take long) OR look for another job that expands your potential. Or do it like me - I go overseas to work and expand my own potential.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>I don't think it can be blamed solely on his divorce.

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess a single or divorced boss is more demanding cos they are very hardworking &amp; result oriented. Also they lack family life so they are forever in the office.<br><br>U need to have lots of patience in dealing with unreasonable bosses.<br><br>Some don't trust &amp; will also check on u. So learn to keep him informed of every minute details.<br><br>It is alright if he 'steals' yr ideas. Most bosses do that. Just record yr achievements in your yr-end appraisals &amp; remind him of yr contributions.<br>Learn to work with him instead of against him. If he gets promoted, I'm sure he knows who to thank.<br><br>But if he is the type of boss who don't reward his workers, then better to look elsewhere.</div>
