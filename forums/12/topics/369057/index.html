              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>Well what I mean on my Title is this. Very common question to be asked. It about my education and future.</p>
              <p>Firstly, Im 17+ and waiting for my Enlistment for NS. While waiting, im working temporary too.</p>
              <p>My problem is that I have a dream to become an Audio Engineer,Music Composer and I want to work in recording studio and music industry in the future.</p>
              <p>I wanted to go to a private school that is called SAE(School of Audio Engineering)(Diploma Certification) but it requires me a GCE O Level Cert. I have GCE N Level. I have plan to take private O level after my NS.</p>
              <p>(<span style="color: #ff0000;"><em>If you want to know more about that school,go to this <a title="School of Audio Engineering" href="http://www.saesingapore.com/">link</a></em></span>)</p>
              <p>Fyi, Im N level grades is very bad. I did well on some subject except for maths and science and I get "U" for that two subject. If you are wondering why I didn't go for ITE like my other friends/classmates is because of that GRADES and I've no interest in ITE Courses.</p>
              <p>So what should I do? Should I retake on N level for math and science first? It quite late right?</p>
              <p>Btw, I heard some of my friend says that MOE has changed the path of education. So she ask me to just take private O level after my NS. Is that possible? If that so, I think I cannot buck up cos O level subject is much alot different that my N level.</p>
              <p>I think my "path" is kinda <span style="color: #ff0000;">messed up</span><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/confused.png" alt="confused.png">.

              <p>I am not sure about audio engineering course but if its like any other engineering course, maths and science would be an important requirement so you will really need buck up on both subjects.</p>
              <p>If you can't even handle N level maths and science, it might be good for you to study them and clear it 1st before the O's since it would be very difficult if you do not even have the required background as O's maths and sciences do cover quite abit more than the N levels.</p>
              <p>Use to know a guy who studied in SAE audio engineering course but over the years we have lost touch so i'm unable to provide you much info but i do remember him having to work till quite late at nights sometimes to finish his project work etc.</p>

              <p>Yes it is possible. For private candidates, you can take your "O"s without any previous certs or whatsoever as long as you are above 15 years old : http://www.seab.gov.sg/SEAB/oLevel/privateEntry.html</p>
              <p>But on the otherhand, you will have to work extremely hard, as N level is very easy as compared to O level. If you are one of the lucky ones to get a stay-out vocation ( though it is highly unlikely since you are probably joining the mono-intake ), you should either enter one of the private part-time "O"-lvl studies institutes or get a really good tutor to help you out.</p>
              <p>Your path is not mess up, it is just going to be very tough for you to walk on it. But if you are willing to put in the effort and study during your free time in camp, you might just be able to make it.</p>

              <p>MERCU private school is the only one which allows you to do so, and only for its part time course.</p>
              <p>Its full-time course and the packages offered by BMC Academy and City Harvest are the same - you must take 5 subjects.</p>
              <p>The reason why they made it this way is because you need at least 5 "O"-lvl subjects to enter local polys.</p>

              <p>You already have a goal in mind for your future.</p>
              <p>That itself is great enough, for there are even U grads who still know not what they want even working in a dream job after years in it.</p>
              <p>Now that you have that goal, you will have to give it what it takes to reach that goal. Nothing is ever easy in life. Nothing. You will have to work hard in it. The day you give up is to give up on your hopes and dreams. Let nothing deter you from your goal.</p>
              <p>Maths and Science is important along your path. They are not obstructions. They are only obstacles to either confront or cicumvent. To circumvent is to become an apprentice to someone who is willing to teach and sponsor you, and will take a longer time, but if your interest is strong, just by keeping at it daily, your goals can be attained, provided you DO have the talent for it.</p>
              <p>The other way is to confront and brush up on your maths and science. Each time you get bored, just tell yourself why you have to do it. They are obstacles, but not obstruction that you must surmount in order to live your dream.</p>
              <p>NS is but only 2 years, and no matter how tough it may be, there will ALWAYS be free time avaliable. Even if you cannot take up a course, you can always SELF STUDY by practising maths or science in the field, during slack times, or nites off. Practise makes perfect, and it will help sharpen your mind when you complete NS, as well as give you the maturity most suitable for your studies in a school and your career.</p>
              <p>Just do not be distracted by your dreams. Not by gf issues or guy friend issues. Only you and you alone can make that dream come true. There can be no other way. </p>
              <p>Good luck and may your talent shows. Our country needs more people like you, who dares to dream and am prepared to do what it takes to make it come true. </p>

              <p>Not to worry. Being slow is NOT a sign of stupidity, but could be due to either the way the lessons are taught in a large group, for no human is of a similar speed to grasp understanding, or it could be just that you need more time to absorb and comprehend what is being taught, espacially if it is something new.</p>
              <p>Now that you know where your issue lie - laziness = which could be that because as no one cared enough about your work, you no longer believe in yourself, and allow yourself to rot and get distracted by other issues.</p>
              <p>Take your time, as you do have many more years ahead of you, but most important of all, do not rush but get it right, then your time would have been worthed it.</p>
              <p>Your dream awaits to become a reality. You will most certainly have my prayers and well wishes, as well as looking forward to the display of your talents one day.</p>
              <p>Cheers. </p>

              <p>Its not really a real change but just that after 2 yrs of not studying, its abit harder for someone to pickup the books again especially if the person has not been touching his books throughout the 2 yrs.</p>
              <p>If u constantly revise and study your work, it won't happen to u.</p>

              <p>Haha...then your friends must be some rich men sons whom need not look for jobs after NS.</p>
              <p>Think about it - after NS, thousands of young men every year had to look for jobs, and do you seriously think their mind would be become lazy again? Work isnt brainless, more so if one needs a higher paying job to secure a future. Even a clerk needs to learn about a company filing system.</p>
              <p>The mind never stops to learn. Your friend's philosophies are without any truth or simply borne out of boredom or plain idleness.</p>
              <p>Singapore's greatest resource is its people. Because we had never stop to learn and adapt to our ever changing environment. This is a reality you can see daily, a philosophy grounded in truth.</p>
              <p>And you are a fellow Singaporean as well, fully capable of great things, but only if you try and work at it, to turn your dreams into realities, as many of us did.</p>
