              <p>Rooney, my parents didn't thought that I was useless. It's just me, feeling inferior when you see others doing better than you. Always being at the bottom, I just slowly build up a lot of low self-esteem.</p>

              Ts,
              U are indeed whining lah- however, considering your age it is understandable lah.
              The solution lies in understanding that you are blaming, comparing and that is something that has to go.
              
              It is a mental habit that can only be dropped or done away with when u understand and that understanding will make u see that u are actually not bad as you perceive urself to be.
              
              Comparing oneself to another - is misery and understand that one's energy can be spent whining away or it can be used to understand and take it from there.
              Self-esteem is that which emanates from onself - if it comes from another valuing or praising or having things - it comes from the outside. It is not self-esteem at all but others-esteem!
              
              The folly is assume/misconstrue or misinterpret self-esteem with that of ....

              <p>U'r only 16, don't feel so frustrated, it never too late to start to do something.</p>
              <p>Find out what you'r interested in and work hard on it.</p>

              <p>You should have a positive mind. And you do have talent. It just you need to do something about it instead of just feeling low</p>

              <p><br>16yo, frankly, with a blink of an eye, you can be 61yo already, life is short, dun take thing to hard, learn to relax and do what you like most, do the thing with a future, dun go do something that end up with nothing but only add more frustration in life because you can do nothing about it and find is a waste of god damn time and money and effort. Go learn highway code first</p>

              <p>Its not your parents' ffault.</p>
              <p>When they were born, they were also as naked as you were, with nothing but mucus in the noses.</p>
              <p>Everything came afterwards, most of which they got hold of it themselves.</p>
              <p>You have it much better than them, yet you are whining and not being grateful. Thats because you want it easier, you want things to fly to you. You want your parents to serve you like they are waiters.</p>
              <p>You have it easier than your parents, and if you don't know how to seize the opportunity, you are really useless, with no skill, and a loser.</p>

              <p>the reason for god making man is to let men walk the life, but some choose instead to dwell and hybernate - come on god cannot be ther eto explain to everyman the meaning of life. but if he choses to be a dweller and whiner with no boner in life, god will never forbid becuase he had chosen his path, and god respects everypath every men chosen.</p>
