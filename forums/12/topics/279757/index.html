Because if you are good looking, then you won't have such plight.<br><br>Then you stopped there - thinking that it must be true and believe in that notion. A complete stop. No movement. No nothing. Just acceptance and halt.<br><br>All heart, body, mind and soul will behave according to your mindset - therefore thinking that you are a failure in love, your mindset will reverberate an aura to the universe and it beget back the same response - you will then shape a destiny of a failure in love (or in any social settings) and it transform and become a reality for you.<br><br>If you think that to win in love is to have looks, you are probably flipping the wrong text.<br><br>Let me revert you a truth - most guys <strong>ain't </strong>good looking. In fact, in the looks aspect, most are just hovering around the average benchmark.<br><br>But there are many pretty ladies - I have always believed that for every 10 chicks around, there's probably only one good looking lad.<br><br>That's exactly how nature functions - in conventional school of thoughts: the feminine energy will exhibit a pull influence (passive), while the masculine energy will bring forth a push influence (active). An analogy I always use - flower and the bee.<br><br>A flower waits, but it doesn't sit and idle - it uses all subtle attractive powers (its scent, the colours, beauty, etc) to draw the bee towards it. A bee doesn't need to have the same quality, because the bee initiates, it doesn't attract.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You don't have to pray for good looks to change your situation - your mindset has become so wrapped that even if I give you the best looks ever and believe me, you will still fail terribly with your mindset.<br><br>Have you ever seen a successful person with a failure mindset? Oxymoron isn't it?<br><br>Let me paint you a likely scenario:<br><br>Virtually, you rant here - claiming how much of a failure you are in love and your relationship with females in general.<br><br>Reality - you do nothing to improve.<br><br>Result - What kind of change do you hope to see then? To play as victim of love and pray that God will eventually pity you and send his Angel down as a gift?<br><br>Next? (probably a few months later) You come back online and rant once again.<br><br>Reality - no change from previous situation - no change in current situation.<br><br>Result - *refer to previous result*<br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Love will wait for as long as one learns to grow up and work on him/herself. If it means forever, then love will wait forever. It would be the day when you look yourself in the mirror and tell yourself that you are going to get out of this cycle forever and vow to change your destiny.<br><br>If not: your destiny is pretty much fixed - just refer to previous result. I donÂ’t need astrology to tell you that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what can i say, looks are important in the world today. The impact of this extends beyond chasing girls.<br><br>It is insidious and pervasive, simply because it's human nature that people want to associate themselves with other good looking people. Conversely people tend to be less kind to others who are not good looking. <span style="font-style: italic;">Everyone</span> does it, most dont realise it. And everyone will experience some form of discrimination in their lifetimes.<br><br>Know this: people may not like you because of how you look, but they can't help it! It's not really their fault, cos humans are programmed as such. They don't even realise that they're discriminating against you.<br><br>The problem isn't you, it's not really other people as well. It's just cos humans are designed to be lan jiao lang.<br><br>What's the solution to this fcuked up situation? You can't change the world, so you have to change yourself. It's all about your expectations.<br><br>There is room enough for everyone on this earth. And where there's a will, there will be a way.<br><br>People will try to limit you and stumble you, but you, at all times, possess the power to help yourself. It's all in the mind. Discipline your mind and your emotions.<br><br>Focus on your strengths, develop them. Know that you are talented and disciplined enough to continuously improve yourself. Celebrate all victories at work, and in life.<br><br>Never allow yourself to spiral into despair, in which case you cause hurt only yourself and the people who love you no matter how to look. It's not worth it.<br><br>Surround yourself with people who love you, and care for you regardless of how you look. Return love and support to these people. They should be the foundations of your life.<br><br>Before even thinking about getting a girlfriend, the more important task is to fix yourself first. Fix your 'insides', your heart and your mind.<br><br>We are all born with different amount of, as i like to call it, 'resources'. Make full use of what you have, instead of lamenting about what you don't have. At the very least, live a life without regret knowing that you have tried your best. It will be alot more satisfying that living a life full of self doubt and self pity..<br><br>You are actually not as helpless as you think, and not alone in facing this sort of thing. So take heart in that. It's not as bad as you think it is.<br><br></div>

At least the girl i like dun really keep a distance from me, but they rejected my love though... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>At least now, u still wins me... u are not a loser in that sense. The thing u wins over me is your belief that love still exist. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>For me, I am totally numb to r/s matters.... to the extent i dun even bother who i will be with in the future...<br><br>My advice: if u think u are ugly, go do something about your look. Try to look better each day... may ur destined one be with u one day. Gd luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I'm neither particularly good looking nor abnormally hideous in any way, in fact my physical appearance has certaintly nothing to do with what happen..<br><br>I'm jus so pissed with myself from all the accumulated failures and with another minor incident last nite that prompted the outburst...<br><br>I guess i just needed something to <span style="font-style: italic;">blame</span> precisely because i know there's nothing grossly wrong with my looks or personality, and yet i feel so rejected in love<br></div>
