              <p>His emotional dependency is beginning to shift because there seemed to be more stability outside his relationship.</p>
              <p>Well, his calls getting more isn't it?</p>
              <p>It's not so much about you being the 3rd party - possibly more of him needing you to get out of his current status quo.</p>

              <p>Gettin to know the person more is not being a 3rd party.</p>
              <p>U can still get to know him better without havin him to divert his focus on his gf, now a fiancee - if only u know how to do it.  It's a human nature to b near / with someone that we like.  Just dun spend too much time with him, draw ur lines.  It's hard initially, but eventually, the feelin will ceased. </p>
              <p>Dun hav to force urself to listen to his woes abt his gf, it wll onli make u worst.  It'll make u magnify her faults, thinking tat u r so much better than her &amp; u shld b the one by his side instead of her.  Those are all misconceptions.  All guys hav problems with their gfs &amp; vice versa.  Probably those are onli minor problems, but when he complains, those problems seem major, which are in fact, diminished after he has let them out.</p>
              <p>Love him if u must - but do so purely as a fren.</p>

              <p><br>I'm glad you thought it through.</p>
              <p>From a guy's point of view, I think guys sometimes like to have other female friends as soulmates because the additional perspective is refreshing and the companionship is rejuvenating, particularly if, like Yunhaier said, their gf/wives have left a void there.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, establishing such an emotional connection is the first step to generating sparks (not the National Day type) both ways.</p>
              <p>It's the same the other way, a girl confiding in another guy her r/s problems.</p>
              <p>It's up to the involving parties's responsibility to manage these connections. (Like you have just did, superbly).</p>
              <p>If one cannot manage, it's better to sever the connections.</p>
              <p>In my humble opinion, there is no such thing as a truly platonic close friendship (at all times from beginning to end) between the opposite sexes.  Romantic feelings are/were sure to have developed one way/both ways at one point of time or another. Very often these romantic feelings are fleeting, and once that romantic feeling is gone, the status of that "platonic close friendship" would have taken a plummeting.</p>
