              <p>Cleft lips, are sadly and unfortunately, not something found on all humans. It is something that happens to a rare few. BUT that does not mean you are abnormal in anyway.</p>
              <p>You live, breathe and bleed like anyone else, capable of the most dastardly deeds or the most noble of works mankind can have the priviledge to see. In other words, you are human, nothing more, nothing less from the next living breathing guy.</p>
              <p>For another person to demean you is absolutely downright despicable. He may presume that he is perfect, but perfection in humanity DOES NOT exists.</p>
              <p>Each and everyone of us will have some flaws, some covered, some uncovered, some within our character that would take time to discover, and some traits evidently seen like a piece of white paper.</p>
              <p>To demean you, or make fun of you, is only to make fun of himself to those who are more discerning. Therefore, you have absolutely nothing to fear or be insulted, for he only insults himself, and makes a fool out of himself wih his own silly antics.</p>
              <p>And you would be even sillier if you were to react to his taunts. Let him, and if others follow his beliefs and ways, they are equally fools, never to be taken seriously.</p>
              <p>More important is for you to be yourself, a person whom others can trust and depend on. Prove yourself always, that you are worthy of that trust, and you will win over friends who will accompany you on your journey of life.</p>
              <p>You dont need quantity friends, only quality ones who will look beyond our natural flaws and see the real person, an open book, inside. That is, if you are the ideal person whom you think you should be, a man others can depend on. You too, would prefer such persons as your friends, so too must you be one to others.</p>
              <p>Relax. Stay calm. Let that silly idiot dig his own grave by his own actions. You have a life, a better life to live than worry, fear or care about him, for he and his friends brings and offer you totally nothing worthy to be concern over.</p>

              <p>you can always post his number, name and personal info in EDMW + the screen shots and tell your sob story to the people there in the 1st post. Don't let him off so easily by just reporting him to the authorities. He is underaged, so at most he will get is probation and will be asked to remove his hate FB account set up for you.He won't be jailed just cos he set up an FB account to mock you, esp when he is only 17.</p>

              <p>do not do the same thing he has done to you. ( like insults and putting his number on toilet doors etc.) This will only give him the chance to prove himself he is stronger than you. By doing the same thing he do, he will call you a "dog", following his examples.</p>
              <p>if you have friends backing you up, thats a good thing. Stay with them and try to avoid the bully. But not too obvious, like.. he walks to you, you siam. that will only make him MORE want to make fun of you. so ignore him is the best.</p>
