              Hello,
              I am 15 this year, and I know I shouldn't be asking much from my parents, but I want something really bad, I even saved up for one whole year, spending only $1.50 a day and going out with my friend only once a month.
              
              I have enough money to buy the thing I want, which is a new fishing reel and rod, total adds up to about $400, I currently saved $550. But how should I approach my father about this? He has been really busy lately, and I see him only in the morning, he comes home for dinner only 3 times a week, by the time he reaches home I am already in bed. 
              So I have pretty much not conversed with him for over 6 months.. 
              
              How should I å¼€å�£ to him? I know you guys will say, save and put in bank bla bla bla, my bank account is not short on funds,  and I want to get the feeling of spending my own money, after eating biscuits for lunch for a year.. 
              
              Thanks in advace, 
              P.S. (Dont see me as a spoilt kid, I earn money by helping my mom clean the house every weekend, $5 an hour, xD).

              I like how fishing de-stresses me, sometimes if you find good spot, can enjoy the peace, birds chirping, wind blowing and the sun shining. 
              Good reels and rods come at a high price, im looking for one that is around 180.. 
              
              Fishes caught by me are going back where they came from btw.

              <p>tmarcus - i been there , so listen to my advice .</p>
              <p>Same like you suddenly feel like fishing - went out to send $400 + on fishing reel and rod .... <br>yeap good equipment - after 1 year fishing all over - catch big fat nothing !!! <br><br>End up most time i caught the most fishes and the best catch - it is just the cheapest rod !!!! - a bamboo pole with  fish line tied to it !!!!</p>
              <p>My advice to you is tmarcus  - just spend about $100 + you can get some very decent reel and rod set already . Save the rest .</p>

              <p>Those money in your bank are NOT yours... because you never EARNED it with your own two hands.</p>
              <p>Those money belong to your parents.. excess allowances that you never did return , but siphoned to your bank account.</p>
              <p>Just because the bank account is in your name does not make those money legally yours.</p>
              <p>When you get a job and a first paycheck, then you can claim you are buying stuff with your personal money.</p>
              <p>$400 for a fishing reel is an expensive purchase.</p>
              <p>How many fishies must you catch in order to break even that $400 you spend on this reel ?</p>
              <p>It seems your ability to mange finances is sorely lacking.</p>
              <p>Your father will probably flip when he finds out how ignorant his child is </p>
              <p>#1 To think his parents money belongs to him.</p>
              <p>#2 Think it's ok to spend $400 on a hobby when his income is ZERO.</p>
              <p> If you want to know what you need to do with those money you saved. These are the few categories your parents will most likely approve of.</p>
              <p>1. Courses to upgrade and better yourself.</p>
              <p>2. investments that return more money</p>
              <p>3. Small items that are hobby/entertainment related, cost not above their threshold. Your parents wants you to be happy spending their money.. but they also hope that you are prudent enough to not splurge on frivolous items.</p>
              <p>4. Daily necessities , food, transport, health, well-being related activities.</p>
              <p>5. Books and other educational materials.</p>
              <p>I suggest you ask your parents.. how much is too much to spend on one item in the hobby/entertainment category. Once you know their threshold.. you can budget your purchases accordingly.</p>

              <p>Hello,<br> I am 15 this year, and I know I shouldn’t be asking much from my
              parents, but I want something really bad, I even saved up for one
              whole year, spending only $1.50 a day and going out with my friend
              only once a month.</p>
              <p>I have enough money to buy the thing I want, which is a new
              fishing reel and rod, total adds up to about $400, I currently
              saved $550. But how should I approach my father about this? He has
              been really busy lately, and I see him only in the morning, he
              comes home for dinner only 3 times a week, by the time he reaches
              home I am already in bed.<br> So I have pretty much not conversed with him for over 6
              months..</p>
              <p>How should I å¼€å�£ to him? I know you guys will say, save and put
              in bank bla bla bla, my bank account is not short on funds, and I
              want to get the feeling of spending my own money, after eating
              biscuits for lunch for a year..</p>
              <p>Thanks in advace,<br> P.S. (Dont see me as a spoilt kid, I earn money by helping my mom
              clean the house every weekend, $5 an hour, xD).</p>

              <p>Why can't you buy the fishing reel &amp; rod?</p>
              <p>Why do you have to seek your parent's permission for this purchase? Are they the sort to kick up a ruckus, confiscate the purchase and ground you if they found out?</p>
              <p>Are they disapproving of your fishing hobby?</p>

              <p>Whoa! 400 for a rod is indeed kind of expensive, at 15yo, guess you do not need such an expensive rod, for me, I use any rod also can, as long as it can satisfy me, it should be ok.</p>
              <p>In fishing, the trick is not the rod, but the patience and skill in fishing, you can buy a 1000 dollars rod to display by the beach or boat, but someone with a handheld reel can catch the fish bigger and more than you.</p>
              <p>Just like going after a gf or bf, it is not about the looks or the fashion, if the character and attitude suck, you wear Gucci or look like Aston handsome look, it is also no use.</p>
