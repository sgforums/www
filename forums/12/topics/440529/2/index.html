              <p>Hello,<br>I am 15 this year, and I know I shouldn’t be asking much from my parents, but I want something really bad, I even saved up for one whole year, spending only $1.50 a day and going out with my friend only once a month.</p>
              <p>I have enough money to buy the thing I want, which is a new fishing reel and rod, total adds up to about $400, I currently saved $550. But how should I approach my father about this? He has been really busy lately, and I see him only in the morning, he comes home for dinner only 3 times a week, by the time he reaches home I am already in bed.<br>So I have pretty much not conversed with him for over 6 months..</p>
              <p>How should I å¼€å�£ to him? I know you guys will say, save and put in bank bla bla bla, my bank account is not short on funds, and I want to get the feeling of spending my own money, after eating biscuits for lunch for a year..</p>
              <p>Thanks in advace,<br>P.S. (Dont see me as a spoilt kid, I earn money by helping my mom clean the house every weekend, $5 an hour, xD).</p>

              <p>Dude as others said it is too much for a rod.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then again don't tell your parents you have 550. They will take it back. Find something cheaper and buy it. Don't ask for permission.</p>

              Okay, looks like I received negative feedback, this plan is on hold until I receive my first paycheck. I have fished for almost 4 years, thus the interest to upgrade my setup..
              
              Its okay, save money for other stuff, emergency or bank in, we are shifting house soon, so maybe also can use for my own furniture, like study table, or TV. Can lessen Dad's financial load. 
              Thanks for all the replies.

Broke my piggy bank and went to the bank to change those coin to notes, bloody bank do not allow me to do it, said that I am a junior, need guardian to accompany me, so I asked my maid for help, cos my granny is sure to object it. Maid changed and bought for me the skate, I give her $10 for helping me, she said not enuf for taxis, so i gave her $20, she said not enuf for lunch, so I gave her $50, shit maid, sacked her after I turned 13yo.</p>
              <p>Then my Dad asked me, who bought the skate for me, it look expensive, I told her my best classmate went to china for a family holiday, she bought for me, it cost only S$20, fake nike.

              <p>Okay, looks like I received negative feedback, this plan is on
              hold until I receive my first paycheck. I have fished for almost 4
              years, thus the interest to upgrade my setup..</p>
              <p>Its okay, save money for other stuff, emergency or bank in, we
              are shifting house soon, so maybe also can use for my own
              furniture, like study table, or TV. Can lessen Dad’s financial

              <p>Lol. You can upgrade your rod. but are you able to upgrade your fishing spot?</p>
              <p>I believe that $400 rods are meant for catching bigger fish out in open seas, from a boat, where you need stronger, lighter and longer rods.</p>
              <p>There is no point if you are only restricted to coastal waters, fishing from piers and jetties where the fish are small.</p>
              <p>Well, as for cash management, it's very good to save money, but I think you might be too tough on yourself. spending only $1.50 and eating biscuit everyday? That's not healthy nor sustainable.</p>
              <p>There are 2 ways of saving money.</p>
              <p>1) Sit there and scrimp on whatever meagre pocket money your parents give you.</p>
              <p>or</p>
              <p>2) Go earn your own money. I believe it should be school holiday for you now. Go find a holiday job. You should be able to make close to $1000 in 1 month. And it would be more justified for you to spend your hard-earned money.</p>
              <p><strong>and lastly</strong>, word of advice. Try not to buy any big ticket items yet. While something might seem very "worthwhile" (e.g. fishing rods) at the moment, you might regret spending the money in the future, when you could have used it for something better.</p>
              <p>Maybe you would like to learn driving when you turn 18, go for a backpacking holiday with friends when you graduate, getting a girlfriend, buy a car/motorcycle etc Just some suggestions.</p>
              <p>Take some time, and figure out where and what you would be 5 years down the road, and den evaluate whether its worth it to make the purchase.</p>
              <p>If you have good reasons, go ahead and buy it. No one will fault you when you have strong valid reasons, and its your life, your money anyway. Your parents care about you, and will only scold you when they think that you are wasting your money on frivolous "toys". If you have solid reasons, I'm sure they will support you, since its your life, your money.</p>

              <p>@Darkness_hacker99 No.. I don't feel the "love" a mother will provide to her son, instead it's more of a close friend kind of thing. I know I shouldn't be saying this but, she is really excited to bring her 3-year old son into Singapore for good, she will ask my Dad stuff like "Where will he sleep?",  "What about his studies?" and "You should buy a bigger car!". I now worry about the stress my Dad have to face man.. It's one more mouth to feed and provide for. Really tarnishes the image I have of marriage..</p>
              <p>@deathmaster I mostly do fishing in ponds, have you seen the sizes of the fishes in there? Anyhow.. I couldn't really justify why I have to buy them in the first place! Fortunately I posted my dilemma here, otherwise I could be regretting my decision by now..</p>
              <p>@angel7030 Thanks for the detailed replies. I will take them into further consideration to prevent any rash decisions, perhaps it's just a sudden temptation, work of the devil, haha!</p>
              <p>Once again, a big Thank you for everyone who bothered to take time in writing such detailed solutions!</p>
