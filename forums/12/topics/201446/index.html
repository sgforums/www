            <div class='col-md body'>$$$ is a source of MANY troubles. Do not let $$$ control you. YOU control the $$$. Lone, if your friend can get what this sentence means, she may not have so many problems as she has now.<br><br><strong>She has to find smth besides monetary engagements to see the value of life</strong>. Volunteer work, counselling are just some ways to let her see there is more to life than meets the eyes.<br><br>Your friend lives in an enviornment of $$$. As a friend, you can try to get her to do smth where $$$ is not an important issue: like people do not see her for her rich background but as the person who she is.

Let her see da enviornment there. Bring her to nice places and listen to her talk, BUT you oso have to talk abt yourself. Its how you build trust. Open up to her and she will feel comfortable to tell you too. Coz itf you oredi done dat (I tink you done dat...) You perhaps can tell her more abt scenarios dat happened to your frens dats "similar" to hers and share with her.<br><br>Nice places not as in couple places, but those with good views dat make ppl soothing in da heart. MacRitchie reservoir is one, Esplanade, Marina Sq da food court non air con section also good choice. Even simple parks or nature reserve can do wonders.<br><br>You can also introduce friends who are "not bothered by $$$ or status" when she is ready and comfortable. You will need all the help you can get.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
