            <div class='col-md body'>There are sadly lots of guys who acts like aunties in this world. I have 1 friend who like to spread rumors of any girl who are close to me is my potential gf. Granted I do like some of them and tried to court 1-2 of them but I got rejected. I tried to move on from these failures but the 'friend' just keep linking me to them. Now even our co-workers in the company we both work at got the mistaken idea(yes he told them) that I am still trying to woo them. Personally I got the feeling he is interested in 1 of the girls himself since he keep in contact with her more often than me. Not sure what he is trying to do but getting sick of it. Sometimes I really feel like beating him up.</div>
