Doing things like this makes you lose ground in attempt to chase her, especially when you are trying to make her fall for you (not applicable if she has good feelings for you)<br><br>At least you didn't fell for your own blunder and make things worst. React normally and be your same self in her presence. Treat this like a small issue and act like one. Pray hope that it shouldn't be much of a problem.<br><br>Cheers</div>
