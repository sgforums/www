            <div class='col-md body'>Consult a professional marriage councilor.. Ask her/him to be the middleman to negotiate for better living conditions.. If things deterioate, You can always move out to your parents' house temporally, till her gives in to your demand.. If not, Against his decisions, go and work, earn your own keep, till he knows that you have your own rights. Hes trying to put you down by disallowing you to work. From the way he keeps going out to drink at nights, he might be having more flings than you ever thought. darn him. Hes a bloody jerk. Hes spoiling your life. You should learn to enjoy life more. Your children? Yeahz, they gotta learn to cope. Discuss with your children about their dad. If they share the same sentiments as you. Divorce is AN option. Find a better guy, Im sure your children won't mind. In the worst case, they will be with their dad. Hahz. Less troubles.<br><br>Well. Thats just an alternative. YOu dun wanna be blackmailed in the future, when your husband turns bankrupt, and you well off with another guy, and he comes back and demand cash from you, children from you, and mess up your "perfect" marriage.<br><br>Talk to him. He might be suffering from much stress from work and can't find an outlet to de-stress. Try to make him smile more often with simple surprises like a fabulous dinner, sharing wine with him etc. More communication is the critical point in this case.<br><br>Will i, ever see you smile again<br>will you, ever kiss me gently anymore?<br>will love, turned up when the moon shines<br>will us, ever become like the past<br>or will you not.<br><br>Lah~ =D Tis poem's for you.
