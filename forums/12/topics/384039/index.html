              <p><br>While I have no experience in a case such as yours, I can assuredly inform you that in drug cases, your annonymity is strictly kept, and only certain officers have access to it, as you are classified as an informant, the critical kind of people that help them solve their cases.</p>
              <p>If they dont keep it confidential, no one would have stepped forward to inform, and they would have a mountain of unsolved cases till today.</p>
              <p>You did the right thing. It may be a terrible secret you hold, but must bury it deep down, NEVER EVER to reveal it was you, not even to your child one day. Categorically deny at all costs with your life if even a whisper is mentioned by others, attempting to fish for information.</p>
              <p>I know you are an honest person, and have no wish to lie, but for the sake of your brother's precious life, you did not have a choice. It is a moral dilemma, but one that you can live with, for rehabilitation, love and concern is the only way to save him.</p>
              <p>He is your blood kin, your brother, a precious life that needs to be saved from the ravages of drug addiction, and the hurt it would do to your family, relatives and friend.</p>
              <p>Heros are not super immortals from comic book realms. They are only ordinary people who do extraordinary things under extraordinary circumstances. You are saving him and others around him from a real and present danger. I am honoured and priviledge to know the hero you are that had made this difficult choice.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Hi I m possible,</p>
              <p>It is highly unlikely that they will reveal your identity, due to witness-protection policies. However, even if they do, the most important thing which you must realise is that you have just saved your brother's life. </p>
              <p>Some forummers have kindly suggested the alternative of seeking private practitioners for help, but your parents are unwilling to let anyone know of your brother's condition and thus will be unlikely to take this step.</p>
              <p>Hence, what you have done is a very brave thing, and you should not worry too much about it.</p>
              <p>Cheers. </p>

              <p>They just need to test  your brother and they would get him for consuming controlled drugs. How the CNB zoom in on your brother would be a mystery for all.</p>

              <p><br>Please DO NOT ill advice if you are not familiar with such cases where precious lives are involved. This is a serious thread.</p>
              <p>There are procedures for arrests, but where informants are involved, these are only tip offs and easily up to CNB to just pick the drug addict up. No necessity for the informant to testify at all, or any other interview at home or whatsoever. Information are either by phone or at CNB offices, or public places in plainclothes by 1 or 2 contact officers with the necessary security clearance.</p>
              <p>A simple 'arranged' routine pick up by normal police officers based on suspicion of drug abuse to send the addict for urine test would suffice to get the addict go into rehabilitation. But of course, CNB must not stop with a drug addict, and would need to go to the root of the problem - his suppliers, the evil ones whom there is no words to decribe the harm they had done to societies. TS brother could cut a deal with CNB, serve his time in confidentiality, and turn informant too as well.</p>
              <p><strong>TS have nothing to fear, for confidentiality is assured</strong>, similar for anyone who wishes to turn informant. As his brother is only a drug abuser, it is highly unlikely that he is a drug peddler himself. No drug lord would trust an abuser with his stock, and furthermore, the abuser is constantly in need of money, his profile is thus an abuser and requires rehabilitation.</p>
              <p><strong>TS had done the right thing, for his selfless, brave and difficult decision may have save countless amount of civilian fellow citizen lives from the destructive harm of drugs when an entire network is bagged and tagged.</strong></p>
              <p>Our society owe such persons - the informant - the unknown heroes, a huge debt, one that is of honour, more precious than money, which can only be repaid by everyone of us  with our responsible actions for the welfare and betterment to our society - our families, relatives and friends, which link us all as ONE.</p>

              <p>Hi guys, thank for the constructive advises.</p>
              <p>The CNB came last night, and unfortunately, my brother wasnt at home. My parents told them that he has not been home for 1 week and is uncontactable. They look around and left. They did ask him to report to the nearest Police HQ.</p>
              <p>Of course, my brother was informed and did not come home at all due to fear.</p>
              <p>The CNB just said that they had an informant and that's it.</p>
              <p>The thing is, I think they'll come back and my brother is planning to stay away until he's 'clean'. I doubt that he would after a few days due to his addiction.</p>
              <p>Should I call them again and give his work place address? How long does it take subutex to leave the whole body system.</p>
              <p>My parents are concocting a plan to let him be 'clean' 1st and then report for testing.</p>

              <p><br>Nope. My parents think that one of his 'friends' pau to him. Coz his 'friends' has been coming up to our house to pass him those stuff. Witness by few of our neighbours.</p>
              <p>They knew that I knew abt his addiction a long time ago. So if they think it's me, why report now, why not before. Currently the situation is like this.</p>

              <p><br>I did some research and the worst cold turkey days will hit during the 4th-11th day. depending on his body condition and addiction history.

              <p>What i read is people prefer to use reduce amount to slowly get rid of the addiction and not a total cold turkey to avoid the withdrawal symptoms which is obviously not going to be an experience anyone will want to go through if possible</p>

              <p>One thing about suspicion is that - a belief without proof. There is no way that there is ANY evidence of your finger in it. No way.</p>
              <p>They may suspect, but as long as you deny, dont give yourself away by admittance or guestures, they may even belief someone else did the job.</p>
              <p>This belief would be stronger, as drug is a capital crime in Singapore. The authorities are always monitoring and following leads, for the danger it poses to society. More so recently with a drug bust where the wife of a child murderer was involved in a drug network bust. The police and CNB are only following leads.</p>
              <p>Play the game all the way, and if possible, delete the traces you leave behind, espacially sgforums site from your history cache of your home or laptop.</p>
              <p>No fear, play it all the way. The best way to convince others you are not the informer is to STRONGLY BELIEF you arent the one. The police are only following leads. WALK AWAY NOW and let CNB do the rest, seriously.</p>
              <p>You are doing a good cause out of love for your brother and to society.Take care and good luck. </p>

              <p>Hi I m possible,</p>
              <p>This may sound like something which is wrong, but you should give CNB not only the details of your brother's workplace, but also information regarding all the places where he could be hiding at. </p>
              <p>Your parents are only letting your brother walk down a path of self-destruction, and you are the only one who can help him right now.</p>
