              <p><br>Stay away from her. No point meeting her, haven't you learnt enough from your past experiences? You dont cherish until the end, that's why you feel this regret. Begging for forgiveness means you have made a mistake, when she doesn't forgive you and come back means she is taking it as an excuse to break up with you and go with a better guy(which she has done). She has walked away from you because she doesn't love you anymore and has found a better guy more worthy of her love.</p>
              <p>If you don't love your current gf, please do dump her. You're only hurting her and I don't give a shit whether you hurt yourself or not because if you can't cherish this girlfriend then you don't deserve her.</p>
              <p>I have come across this situation just 2 months back. New girlfriend; miss the old one(we broke up 4 months ago, or 2 months before I got a new one). Swallow it like a man. If you can engage you can terminate.</p>
              <p>You are not mentally/spiritually matured. Grow up, cherish this one or risk losing her - i.e if you even love her. Don't keep her by your side just for company or be a substitute for the last.</p>
              <p>I don't care what you say - "I LOVE MY CURRENT GF BUT JUST CAN'T FORGET THE PAST", shit you.</p>
              <p>I never forget, I still remember, but I have learnt that regrets are caused from not cherishing the moments together. Take things for granted and you shall face the wrath of Karma.</p>

              <p>And what does it serves to meet with your ex?  are you going to tell her you continue to hope she will come back to you?  She's already moved on, don't add more confusion to her life.  Its best to adjust your feelings and calm your mind down, let the past be in the past and move on.</p>

              <p>By still holding to a past love and then continue to go out with a new girl. Its using the new girl to forget the old but being unsuccessful about it. Then its as good as betraying the 2nd girl. Isn't it the past now repeating itself now with the new girl. Not cherishing her and then when she finds you distant because you are thinking about the old flame. She might also want to find a better man to love. Then it f**king LPPL isn't it.</p>
              <p>Past is past. Nothing can change it, no one can travel back in time. What matters is the present. If you do not take care of the present, then in future, you will lament how you did not cherish this present and therefore creating issue that you experience in future. Don't you see you are just creating an endless cycle of suffering for yourself and others?When will you learn?</p>

              <p>thanks all for your answers... precisely that's why i am here</p>
              <p>i need advice because my mind is in a state of confusion and i have no one who can guide me</p>
              <p>let me say this for the record: I want to get over my ex and not forget because i will never forget. I don't want to hurt another girl. I do love my current gf but it is not like what i feel for my ex. If that is the case, am i suppose to dump my current gf because i cant love her completely? If i can never find that one person to love completely again, does that mean i should be single for the rest of my life so i dont hurt anyone anymore?</p>
              <p>Goso, your comments did jerk me up and i thank you for that. To answer your question, i dont really know what you mean by internet-based relationship... you mean something like e-relationship? If thats what you mean, my answer is a VERY BIG NO. How i wish it was that simple. Else i wouldnt be here</p>
