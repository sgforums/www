              <p>Oh wait.. he already thanked the people ahead of us for the advice
              and will start concentrating on his current gf now. So... NO thanks to

              <p>oh btw, i only however disagreed with you on that point alone. About the man of justice and wisdom stuff.. and the hate part. Thats pretty much it. U know, not everyone HAVE to agree with whatever u think  right ? U may like it in the ass does not mean i like one in my ass too.</p>

              <p>Well, i am not really telling him to do. I am just responding to
              your post. Maybe shed some light on my perspective. Like i said, i
              said like most ppl and his close friends telling him to focus. I am
              explaining in my perspective of an alternative to 'hate'. I can
              give advice in an alternative point of view yes? This thread isnt
              about me. Its what I think. Based on what I think. It is up to TS
              to believe, but it is a genuine advice under the circumstances.Why
              are you so agitated?Aren't u also trying to force your views on
              him?Are i doing exactly what u are doing?So you think that 'hating'
              is the only way? how did u come withit? its not about u right? I
              can ask these same questions to you. How would u answer them ?</p>
              <p>I already explained my reason why i think he can use other ways
              instead of hate. Pls read my post carefully. I wrote mostly about
              self awareness. And the possibilities. I am laying out the cards.
              Laying out the alternatives. Laying out what could be the reason. I
              am laying it out for him, cause he is the one that really knows
              whats going on. Every single action he see's can help him in my
              intepretation and hopefully allow him to rationally think that
              'yeah.. wtf i was thinking!'</p>
              <p>There are reasons why some people give the advice they give.
              Because some people may have experience something similiar. And
              sometimes the reason we give our advice has to be slightly
              explained so TS or whoever that is being advised on can consider
              whether my advice is sound under those circumstances. I pretty much
              only bothered to explain in more detail in Threads like this.
              Others i really cant be bothered. So if u like long explaination
              posts, feel free to, 'attack' my views. But i prefered it after u
              read more carefully what i wrote.</p>
              <p>I can ask u very simple question . Why hate ? why ? Why cant u
              just..forget. Since u say ppl with wisdom and sense of justice will
              naturally get frustrated ... n then hate. So, if TS did not hate at
              all does that make him a person with no sense of justice and a
              person extremely lack of wisdom ? I'm just saying.. i can ask these
              questions too.</p>
              <p>Why? Arent i telling him something different from the rest of
              the people here including u ? So.. whats so same about it ?</p>
              <p>Explain your reason why u think my advice is a load of crock and
              bull, and is not going to help TS to let go of his reamining love
              for his ex-fg and allow him to better appreciate his current gf,
              and if you can convince TS that you're right, then i'll agree with
              YOUR advice.</p>

              <p>I have advised HATE but you have suggested forget, so why are you now embracing HATE instead of forget?</p>
              <p>You have already shown me, you have subconsciously agreed with me.</p>
