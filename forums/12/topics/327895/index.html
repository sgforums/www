              <p>Previously I have an account here with 900+ posts but forgotten my login details and this post marked my first thread with a new username. ;)</p>
              <p>Lately, I'm torn in between a relationship coming to 4 years and a new friend, lets call him G in this unsettled mess..</p>
              <p>I knew G in this company that I'm with. He is one of our working partners whose office is nearby and every few days in a week will pop by for some work related issues. We weren't that close when we first started off to be in this project that both of our companies are in but appear to be only communicating over work matters. Sometimes personal but not very frequent that type.</p>
              <p>We only hit it off to be rather close friends about 2 months back when we went for an outing together and constantly would msn for hours everyday and chatted on the phone afterwards. He appeared to me as someone with very witty comments, mature yet humourous and knew how to carry himself well. I was very attracted to his attitude and easy-going personality that I couldn't pull myself out from developing some sort of liking towards him. I knew it was wrong from the start.</p>
              <p>After hearing from a mutual friend that G may have like me, i went ahead to tell how i felt towards him. It was real silly of me as it turned he was stunned and did not know how to react to this situation that he had never imagined it to be. There was no direct answer from him and sensing that this is not going anywhere. I lied to him that I'm mistaken about my own feelings and I only liked him as a close friend.</p>
              <p>There was a few outings with our same clique but I couldn't really bring myself to start off a conversation with him.</p>
              <p>Somehow, this act has really jeopardized our friendship and we weren't as close as before. Feelings of awkwardness still lingers when he pops over once in a while. I tried to striked it off but I still feel very demoralized deep down. Upset and can't seem to focus on any other thing. Really, really lost..</p>
              <p>What should i do ?</p>

              <p>Is this a weighing machine between 4 years Relationship and a new G-string?</p>
              <p>For many other forumers who is from sgSexforums will say go for a fling with G-string then puppy back to the 4 year relationship?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, whichever path you get to choose, you get to live it once and learn from it.</p>
              <p>Everyone have different paths to choose. At times when you let your own judgements cloud you, don't be clouded by other's judgements.</p>

              <p>It's rather clear cut. Why are you in dilemma mode ?</p>
              <p>Your
                      new interest G may have lost his respect for you .. because you
                      confessed to him while you are still IN a relationship with another MAN.</p>
              <p>Now how does that reflect on you ? He probably thinks you are a unfaithful slut now. The last thing on earth a wholesome guy like G wants .. is get labeled as a GF stealer.</p>
              <p>You shoulda cut your 4 years relationship <strong>before</strong> you confess to G.</p>
              <p>Anyway.. it's water under the bridge.</p>
              <p>If you can't deal with the awkward visits.. simply get yourself outa the situation.</p>
              <p>Either you quit or you transfer to other position that does not require interaction with G.</p>
              <p>Re-evaluate your current 4 year relationship with your boyfriend. Don't let the 4 years be the purpose of you hanging on.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you may stand a chance again with this guy G..
                      once YOU have cut yourself clean from old baggage. But that's just a
                      MAYBE.</p>
