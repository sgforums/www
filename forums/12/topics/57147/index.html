            <div class='col-md body'>I was once in your position.. many years back...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I understand that it is easy to say when i am not the party involved... but this is sound advice<br><br>I feel that if she is indeed treating you as your serious BF then she should respect you. I am not sure abt ur age but you both sound rather young. PPL at this age are usually out to have fun.. not looking to settle down yet (generally speaking) so, just approach and ask her nicely to see what she thinks that your relationship with her is heading... do not mention about the issues u saw about her with the guys...<br><br>Sometimes it is not worth speculating and making yourself angry over the 'could have beens...', if you do and confront her, you would make her want to leave you even if she did not feel like.... Just give her the benefit of the doubt and show her your best concern and make sure you have not let her down. If she wants to leave you even after you did your best, then there is also no choice (we cannot force ppl to like us)...<br><br>One final advice, don't do anything rash (like confront her) or slacken off (showing her less concern)... just be true to urself so that even if this relationship does not work out *touch wood* you would not look back when you are in the future to have regretted that you could have salvaged it....<br><br>Hope this helps and all the best mate</div>

Possessiveness and self absorption is the top ten killer of couple relationship. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Sand in hand, held too tightly loses all.<br><br>You don't even need guys to come over and mingle to lose her - even if nobody would come around, if she desire and wants to leave you, she would just do it. <strong>Love cannot be bounded by any means apart from willingness</strong>. Your sense of insecurity probably stem from the roots of your gf's friendly character and probably of your inferior nature.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>This is your first relationship and there are many things for you to learn. Even if I were to tell you all your possible cosmic love lessons, you wouldn't know what I am talking about unless you experience it yourself. Regardless, my warning was issue in the first paragraph of my post. Check it out. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Lets face reality and get real - you sure your first love gonna be your happily-ever-after-marriage kind? Don't kid yourself - chances are, its very slim. Why worry about unneccessary things when you could and should be enjoying all the fruit and passion of your love? If you don't release your narrow-mindness, pessimistic outlook and improve yourself - its not others that made her leave you - its you yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
