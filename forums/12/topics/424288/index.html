              <p>This is midlife crisis if you are in the thirties/forties.</p>
              <p>If you are in the twenties, start doing something before it really becomes a midlife crisis.</p>
              <p>For starters, you can plan about what to do and where to go next. </p>
              <p>It need not always be about career or love life. Some people plan to travel to all countires of Europe, others plan to climb all major mountains in the world. Such aims will steer you forward, and give you something to look forward to. While you are working, you will be planning almost everyday after work what to bring along, what hotels to book, what you will need...etc.</p>
              <p>Do not plan something just for the sake of planning though. For those who I mentioned above, they will feel a sense of satisfaction after visiting another country or successfully scaling a mountain. If you are just doing something for the sake of completing it, you may end up feeling even more hollow afterwards.</p>
              <p>I believe there are forummers here who even planned to travel to certain countries in the world and try out some of the best delicacies which they have been looking forward to.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  May you bounce out of this soon. If one has already reached the lowest point, he can only move up next. Take good care and reflect more about the meaning of life based on your own perspective, for it is your life. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hey don't give up. I oso got rejected n flamed at my times. But I strive on, I told myself to keep on going, neva giving up. Tell myself that I am the best and I can do it. Now I met one interior designer and we r going out.</p>
              <p>I neva let negatively get to me. I keep on improving n if I fail using one method, I will go for another method. Keep on reflecting. Neva feel guilty about wat u did, u r a guy so only natural to act like a guy.</p>

              <p><br>In the mid of your life, you face a crisis, but the fact that in 1/4 and 3/4 of your life, you also face crisis, but a different crisis altogether, at young age, you got school examin crisis, at teenage, you got hormone change crisis, at youth stage, you got relationship and money crisis, then at 30s, which i hv not got thru, you got career and family crisis, then at mid life, if you still have crisis, than i think for the first part of your life, you learnt NOTHING!</p>

              <p>There 2 types of crisis, the natural and the self make, many peoples make their own crisis, just by getting older is a crisis to them, that is a psychological problem, not a crisis, you may see this and that as crisis, but actually, there is no crisis, but merely a self make crisis.</p>
              <p>I urge those feeling their own life in crisis to look at people sufferring from natural crisis, the like of earthquake, flood, fire, malnutrition, lack of food, drought and so on...you will find that you are actually living in heaven</p>
