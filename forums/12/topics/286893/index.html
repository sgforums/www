Thus, we are not entitled to receive any returns from them unless they want to. In love, we give because we love them. However, whether or not they reciprocates our love, it is up to them. We cannot expect them to give their love back to us because in the first place, they did not ask us to give.<br><br>Just like secretly admiring someone is sweet and doing things that you think will touch the person. So long as the person is happy, you will be happy too. However, when you become greedy, things changes. It is when you expect the person to reciprocate your feelings and that person does not do the things that you expected, you become sad and frustrated. In this case, aren't we forcing our Will on that person?</div>

Your friend is chasing her? Or, are you just disappointed with your friend? But, you have to know that, there may be other guys that have been chasing the girl all along, but its just that you dun know any of them. It doesnt change the game at all.<br><br>And, through your story, it seems that you are the only one who has been trying hard to keep the "relationship" going, what about the girl?
