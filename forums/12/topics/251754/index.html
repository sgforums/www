            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah.. that's why I looking for room to rent.<br><br>My dad will scold me for doing that. He look down on me in everything. That's why I have to do these myself. My younger brother O lvl 9 pts and got work so he very satisfied with him but not me. My plan was to work only after I finished my NS as I know how boring and dull working is. After ns = work for life until retirement which is very sad imo. So I didnt really go out to work and hope to enjoy life with my father's 'donation' until Im done with my ns(And I'll start working with the cert/hobby/wadeva I have). And I'm eligible for Poly too, Im in ITE becuz I failed my Eng the 1st time, and after retaking it, I manage to go off with D7 and L1R4 20pts and I can get into poly. But I didn't as I dunwan to stop smthing halfway and its possible to proceed to poly from ITE too.<br>Too him no wrk + ITE = Leech sucking his money and wasting time away.</div>
