He look down on me in everything. That's why I have to do these myself. My younger brother O lvl 9 pts and got work so he very satisfied with him but not me. My plan was to work only after I finished my NS as I know how boring and dull working is. After ns = work for life until retirement which is very sad imo. So I didnt really go out to work and hope to enjoy life with my father's 'donation' until Im done with my ns(And I'll start working with the cert/hobby/wadeva I have). And I'm eligible for Poly too, Im in ITE becuz I failed my Eng the 1st time, and after retaking it, I manage to go off with D7 and L1R4 20pts and I can get into poly. But I didn't as I dunwan to stop smthing halfway and its possible to proceed to poly from ITE too.<br>Too him no wrk + ITE = Leech sucking his money and wasting time away.</div></blockquote>Don't lie la! you miss us, cant bear to leave us to Poly, so u decided to stay in ITE with us!

            <div class='col-md body'>Little brudder, your aunt sounds very lonely.. seems like got alot of other personal problems.  Maybe she cry not just coz of ur actions, but also coz of other problems / relationships in her life that she can't solve rite now.. when u argue with her, she feel u are ungrateful &amp; dun respect her... it's like adding to her problems so she got upset &amp; cried.<br><br>It's not your fault if she has other probs, but since she's helping you by letting you stay with her, just tahan lor... be nicer to her once in a while, earn her respect ... small things like ask her whether she eat oredi, smile more, laugh at her jokes (even if they're not funny), da pao food for her, apologize... it's a sweet deal - if you make her happy, she will try to make u happy.<br><br>Relax, dun let urself get angry.. learn to forgive &amp; forget.. Wad u learn from handling your family members now, u can apply to your future career de <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Trust me, it's an important lesson...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes you gotta learn.<br><br>Learn to keep quiet AND LISTEN. Dont think that this world revolves about you alone. Being an angry kid brings you nowhere.<br><br>I want to talk some sense into you. I thought I could. I thought if everyone else couldnt, I could. Because I am (was, if you insist) your gf. But I guess I cant.<br><br>--<br><br>This is the only way I can communicate with you without having any arguments. So many things to tell you yet I have no choice but to do this.<br><br>( And on another side notice, look at the way you are treating me now. )<br><br>If you wana tell me that I dont understand how you feel right now, then I guess you are wrong. Do you remember the times I complained that my family members always picked on me for being rude? There was once,my bro even slapped me. I hated the family so much I wanted to leave. That night, I would have really walked out of that damn door and never go back if you agreed to come out and meet me yet you told me to stay and go to bed. You added that if they came to picked on me, stay silent.<br><br>I did. And now I am telling you the same.<br><br>I know you tried. Everytime I was at your house, I never left without hearing you people scream at each other. You told me it was a form of communication, yeah fine. Then all the more you ought to have been used to the high decibels.<br><br>Your dad placed you in that house. Surely he has a reason for it. Have you ever thought of it? He could have just rented a one-room flat and allowed you to stay there by yourself like you told me before. But he cared for your food, laundry etc. He knew you couldnt take care of yourself. He entrusted you into your aunty. Since then, she played that role of being your 'parent'.<br><br>You think its easy. Its like having another mouth to feed all of a sudden. Worse still, not even her own child. Her brother's child. She could have disagreed to let you stay with her. She didnt. She cared. Even if it was for the money that your father gave her each month, she could have just taken the money and ill-treat you. Afterall, your dad wouldnt know.<br><br>She didnt. You stayed in her house for how long? 5 years?<br><br>Moreover, like what spinsugar has mentioned, your aunt could be vexed about something else before arguing with you. If you have the rights to be angry, then she has the rights too.<br><br>By trying to venture out in that comfort zone of yours, dont you think its just mere stupidity? You are actually living a house that has practically everything. Food, Computer, Ps2, moral support etcetc...Best of it all, you have all the freedom you ever wanted.<br><br>Compare your situation with your brother's. You told me that he has little freedom and is forced to study. Which will you prefer? Being free to do whatever you want or forced to do what you hate?<br><br>I know I might be repeating myself here because I told you this before. But I guess some things need to be emphasized.<br><br>I dont look down on you. And I wont. Because I love you.<br><br>I know you have the ability to multi-task. But I dont want you to stress yourself up between work, studies and then income. You will be too tired to do anything else and your life will be even more mundane. You mentioned somewhere in this thread that you know how dull and boring working is. Then why not enjoy yourself now rather than make a decision that will totally oppose your initial plan?<br><br>WHY MAKE YOURSELF SUFFER?<br><br>And it is not as if your aunt took a broom and chase you out, kept your clothes in a luggage and threw it outside the house or even change the padlock right.<br><br>I am sure those words she said are just anger words lah...<br><br>If you are really hard up on leaving that house, then do it only when you are an adult. Not physically, but mentally. Afterall you know that you will leave that house one day. (And then we will fly to CHINA and leave happily ever after. Teeheehee  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>But the time aint ripe. Wait for me k! next time I stay with you =x<br><br>Imagine returning to a house when you know there's only you? Imagine having problems yet no one to talk to? Imagine having to settle your food all by yourself? Imagine going to sleep without anybody in the house and then knowing it will be the same when you wake up?<br><br>I've gone through all that. You know it. There was one period, my bro and dad were barely at home. My sis and mum were overseas. Returning home from school was one of the saddest thing to do. I hated it.<br><br>You havent even reached the legal age for renting a house. So what?...You gona stay with Amos? Wont you feel bad for putting up at his house? Somemore he is just a friend..(Heheehe we are not hor.) How long can he take you in? Until you are 21? Without charging? I doubt.<br><br>The purpose of this is not to further continue our argument. I dont plan to insult/embarress you in any way. And I am just speaking from a neutral point of view.<br><br>I am not totally against you. (If you think I am) I just think its not the right time ok..<br><br>I will stand by your side for any decision you make.<br><br>But since there are more advantages than disadvantages + the people here are asking you to learn to forgive and forget. What for continue doing the wrong thing?<br><br>Seriously...Go think about it. I guess the majority cannot be wrong.<br><br>If there was one thing that your father ever wanted from you, I bet he hoped that you did well for your studies.<br><br>Bye. The best thing I ask from you is at least listen and accept what I have to say. Rather than insist that I am against you. Sadness.<br><br>(PS : I created this account SOLELY for you ok. I never posted here before, if this turns out wrongly, I am sorry.)</div>
