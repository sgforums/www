Two, makes her feel comfortable with and around you, like a good friend does... Three, its much easier this way, you wun get hurt... Fourth, you rather be a good friend then lose her as a friend right? Fifth, there's many other reasons, these 4 reasons should suffice!<br><br>Now, go to the trip with the intention of being a good friend only, have fun with her and her friends(be it whoever)! Get closer to her and just be good friends with her.<br><br>I mean time has passed, she might have changed, you might have changed as well... so relax take it easy, enjoy your holiday, dun worry too much!<br><br>Bon  Voyage!<br>Tell us the details when you get back!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I do not see the problem of falling for her.<br><br>To fall in love with someone is a very normal thing.<br>Do not resist this feeling because we all are going to die eventually at the end.<br>In this life time just do what you think it is right.<br>But of course not doing bad things.<br><br>As for falling for someone is a good thing.<br>Express your feeling for her again.<br>And she how she feels about you.<br><br>The chances are 50/50<br></div>
