              <p>hello all. this is my story.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i don't know whether the problem lies with me or her.  <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em></em></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #000000;"><em>problem lies with both of you. One is hitting and the other is willing to bear the hits, yi ge yuan da, yi ge yuan ai</em></span></span></p>
              <p>i still doubt her somehow. i don't know why she gave me the
                  feeling that she's doing something else behind my back. my mind
                  always run wild, thinking of the impossibilities. is it because
                  of her past doings which made me into this state now?<span style="color: #000000;"> <em></em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>patterns are telling. Believe your instinct.</em></span></p>
              <p>here's the one of the incidents which happened recently.</p>
              <p>about a month ago, i found out about her
                  online conversation (chat log) with a guy which she denies it
                  and told me it was her friend. i won't discuss the content of the
                  conversation (if you know what i mean) and both of them had
                  webcamed together... and i chose to believed her for one
                  more time and forgave her. <span style="color: #000000;"><em></em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>major red flag already, you knew it, if not you wouldn't be posting it up here</em></span></p>
              <p>and then just recently, she was chatting online as usual and i
                  was doing my stuff (don't really wanna care who she chatting with
                  but my heart wanted to know). but on that night, somehow i had this
                  curiousity, and i turned my head to look at her conversation (with
                  a guy) and on webcam, she quickly closed the window.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>there's a fine line between respecting others and getting respect for yourself. If she abuses your trust and acts suspiciously, why should you continue to give her the same level of trust anyway?</em></span></p>
              <p>why did she want to do that?</p>
              <p>sometimes she will tell me, this guy that guy tried to woo her
                  and said wanna marry her for just knowing her 3 days and blah blah.
                  i was proud of her cause i told her if she isn't nice, no one
                  will wanna woo her. but why does she give other guys chances to woo
                  her? why don't she just tell them she's attached? i mean if she
                  tells them that and they try to woo her, im okay with it. she has
                  the right to choose. but since we are together now, she did
                  not tell them about me. and speaking of that, i was named as
                  'friend' infront of her friends and not 'bf'. when her friends
                  called, she will tell them 'im going out with my friend'. i was
                  like 'huh?'. <span style="color: #000000;"><em></em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>she is leaving options free for herself so that she could be introduced as single when she goes out with others</em></span></p>
              <p>there are other incidents and i don't know how to continue..</p>
              <p>i mean does she respect this relationship at all? or am i
                  putting in too much effort? <em><span style="color: #000000;"></span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #000000;">she clearly does not demonstrate respect</span></em></p>
              <p>i understand that a relationship should have mutual trust and
                  respect. but my trust for her is depleting. is it me or her? am i
                  thinking too much?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>you are definitely not thinking too much. She is too much</em></span></p>
              <p>p.s. we are both about mid-20's already <span style="color: #000000;"><em></em></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><em>she should then be mature enough to know what she is doing, she is clearly toying with you. Find someone else who would not do that to you and I'm sure there are other more decent women out there</em></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Clearly, there are a lot of question marks in your mind all along already. Do you think a serious relationship should make you feel this way?</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, she has already intiated a break with you, although i wouldn't say it was sudden, because all signs were there already as you had described. However, do open up your eyes the next time. As much as you like her character of being carefree and playful nature, unless faithfulness is a quality you can forgo, there is a limit as to how your girl should behave herself. Or maybe try to loosen up yourself a little? I suspect the reason you like her character is because you're too uptight for your own liking yourself. When you are more comfortable with yourself, maybe you will be less attracted to those wild sort of girls.</p>

              <p>thanks all for the advise. all is good.</p>
              <p>yes. it's only one side of the story but i did my best.</p>
              <p>i posted this topic last midnight and my eyes were twitching. i
              guess this is it. i just broke up with her early in the afternoon.
              she initiated it.</p>
              <p>she called and i was glad to receive her call. but she just said
              'let's break up'. i really can't accept the fact that it happened
              so fast. i never knew it would happen now. i mean i wasn't prepared
              and now this happen.</p>
              <p>i asked her for the reason for breakup, she told me saying she
              can't stand my character. i was like.. i mean it happened too fast.
              i did not do anything wrong to her. i really do not know what to do
              now. my mind just went blank.</p>
              <p>now, we do not even have the chance to even sit down and have a
              heart-to-heart talk together. i don't know. i just can't pick
              myself up now. everything seems to happen too fast. im lost, can't
              concentrate on what i am doing now. my heart seems to hurt, tears
              just roll even when im typing this. most of my time i spent was
              with her and now, i do not know where to even start. i know you all
              will tell me to be a man and move on.</p>
              <p>i asked her if we can spend time together for one last day. she
              agreed. i hope to leave a good memory behind.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>you are lost because you have commit far too much of yourself even before she has prove herself to be reliable of your trust. Trust once broken, need concrete actions to make up for, which she didnt. In fact, it got worse with all her suspicious acts.</p>
              <p>i understand your desire to see her again. I hope this helps. When you meet up with her, enjoy all for good times sake, BUT OBSERVE and LISTEN carefully this time, and WATCH OUT for all signs of inconsistencies but keep quiet about them. Then, after your wonderful day with her, go home and REFLECT.</p>
              <p>Take the time by yourself to realize what kind of person she is and how she is NOT worth it.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>i don't know whether the problem lies with me or her. i'll just try to summarise.</p>
              <p>i've been with her for almost 8 months already. she's a nice lady, been nice to me and everything. but as time goes, she seems to change. not drastic change but different from what she used to be when i knew her. she has been lying to me about almost everything since the start of the relationship, and i forgave her everytime and start afresh cause i want this relationship work out. now she tells me everything willingly without me asking her, but i still doubt her somehow. i don't know why she gave me the feeling that she's doing something else behind my back. my mind always run wild, thinking of the impossibilities. is it because of her past doings which made me into this state now?</p>
              <p>at first, i wasn't possessive because i thought it won't work out. as my love grew for her, i was somehow possessive because of her playful nature. and then she told me about my wrongdoings. and ok, i changed, gave her freedom, let her be wild and everything. i like her because of her character.</p>
              <p>nowadays she treats me like a 'ball'. when she needs me, she will call me. when im not needed, i won't receive any msg/call from her. she doesn't inform me where she is or anything, and i don't ask about her of anything. so, we are just like 'friends' with title of 'bf and gf'.</p>
              <p> </p>

              are describing...except it is much worse...whereby my gf would
              party outside and come back home in the morning...when i offered to
              drive her back home after party..she even refuse it...saying that
              as she is partying outside....it is only right for her not to
              mention that she is attached as she wun be getting free meals and
              drinks.....End of the day, to go thru such a relationship is quite
              simple...First of all, the last thing u want is to stress over the
              things she does behind ur back. Coz whether u can accept the
              things she is doing now or not....She is going to do it all the
              same.....U might as well, ask urself....What is the limitation u
              expect her to be at. And if end of the line, after discussing out
              with her...She either wun accept or she accuse u of being
              oversuspicious...U just have to choose whether to move on with ur
              wife or just continue on. If u continue on, dun expect to change
              anything about her...you just got to live with it. End of the day,
