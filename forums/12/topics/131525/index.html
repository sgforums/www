You'll have to understand that your bf is probably serving a different purpose in his communication with the girl?<br><br>Of course to be fair, I won't know what his real intention is... But shouldn't we just let him have the benefit of doubt for now? One thing I should mention is that though he might be genuinely trying to help a broken-hearted, he shouldn't be neglecting his own relationship?<br><br>On this point, Bear is right about the gentle approach to remind him of things..<br><br>Try to re-look the situation? As in you and him having quarrels and such...? Often 'things' happen in a relationship because of 'bad links'... Don't just happen for nothing... Keep an open mind about things...?</div>

Such common advantageous plan man often put into implementation, which is born out of a mixture of male chauvinist, mistrust, flirt-proof and controlled security in the relationship. When that happens, you are forced into compromising emotionally because it seemed reasonable on his side to deal with a gal friend's problem, yet having to coax yourself into believing that trust is the main essential ingredient here and you ought to have it. However, when the table is turned around, you are expected to drop whatsoever immediately, for your doing endangered the trust of the relationship.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Double thinking - you are forced into two sets of thinking when placed into either-side of the scenario.<br><br>He was a flirt; when he lingered with the ladies, it activated your insecurity. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This insecurity came with the birth relationship</strong></span> - you recognise and knew it long ago. Entering into this relationship is accepting the insecurity as part of the package. Of course, a big effort of yours is to avoid triggering this insecurity during the course of the relationship because you are seeking for a long term fulfilling relationship.<br><br>Believe you me, you will never stop triggering your own insecurity as long as:<br><br>I) You refuse to acknowledge your present and future of your man &amp; relationship AND chose to believe the previous him. Whether he has change or not doesn't matter. Remember, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>you chose the man you wanted for a boyfriend</strong></span>, if he is a jerk; you still made that decision to be with him. IF he is a jerk and he plays with your love - who's to blame ultimately? You isn't it? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You allowed him to be with you</span>.<br><br>Place effort on <strong>something </strong>you could work around with (the future of your relationship) and <strong>not </strong>dwell in his unchangeable past.<br><br>II) As long as this advantageous plan of his is in effect, you should not find security. It forces you into double thinking (if you wished to continue the relationship) and trigger insecurity that came with the relationship.<br><br>P.S: You may probably need to communicate about this. If trust is the issue here, fine - both of you are eligible to mingle with friends from the opposite gender (provided it is as simple as friends). If it's about the insecurity part of you, fine. Work out a viable solution where both of you could accept and still lead the relationship comfortably. (E.g. He could do wth he wants, but negligence to you is NONO). If it's about both issue, fine. Speak them out tactfully and see where it lands.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
