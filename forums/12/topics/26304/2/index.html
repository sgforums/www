That was why we have to understand the thinking of girls before we can classified a guy as being nice to girls.<br><br>A guy may think that he treat the girl very well with lots of concern and care. He can give gifts to her and bring her out for romantic dinner. But that does not mean that he is being nice to her. Most importantly, a girl will need guy to understand them more than anything else. Understand them and cherish them without the intention of asking anything in return. And that is true love.<br>Are nice guys able to do that in their mind? Or they treat the girl well because they have other intentions?<br><br>If a nice guy can say that he treat the girl well without any intention, but why would he think that he is losing out to other guys in the first place if he doesn't even have any other intentions? This is a question that all the nice guys have to think about. On whether they are being nice to girls naturally, or deep in their mind, they already intend to win the girl's heart?<br><br>I do not know if any of you can understand what I am trying to imply here. To all the nice guys here, just be yourself. There is no need to compare yourself with other guys. Girls will appreciate you eventually.</div>

I also don't have any GF b4.Not even a date witha any gal b4. I not handspme either. It is also not something to do with height (I'm 187cm). I think it is because your so call "Duo Qin Ren" are more skillful in term of communication. They are more fun and thrilled to be with as quoted by some gals in the newspaper. Your so call " Gui Ju" guys are more "dull in thinking. All the things we can think of to say to them are say to be boring or even places to go. But Singapore is so small, what fun places can we come up with.<br><br>So don't be too bother with issue like this. Just let nature take its course.

'Self confidence.' that is so essential to be placed within at all times. It appears that you seemed to spend most of your time with this preception error... and never really did much of a reflect on yourself to see why is things happening. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>Come on... everything happens for a reason... what I am trying to say is that making assumption and comments is easy, but is that useful? Its their life, not yours and all they could do is just one sentence and you would hold your tongue... 'What does it got to do with you?' Bastard guys are good are expressing themselves... they have self confidence and make woman feel good being around them. Some are fun.. others are interesting... regardless... they either make woman feel special, first-love, different or simply win them over totally. First time when they got into a relation... they ain't that good... but hey... this method works. He will try again... and it works again... they confidences grows within them.

            <div class='col-md body'>Nice' guy or 'bad' guy? Basically there is no such crap... it is only a definition to categorized what kind of lovers guys are. 'Nice' guys always hate 'bad' guys because they don't understand why these 'bad' guys are treating their woman like shit - but those girls are still sticking to them like glue. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>HEY YOU... those who presume that you are under the 'nice' guy catergory...<br><br>Two of you have individual luck, have 24 hrs a day, same time, same days, etc.... therefore all those crap is not the problem.<br><br>What about looks? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>You stroll the streets and look at 'bad' guys... most of them don't fall under the category of good looking... so good looks is left out.<br><br>Money? Perhaps?... Rare few species of woman would sacrifice their pride and dignity in exchange for enjoyment of monetary gains from the 'bad' guy... but those are *THOSE* cases - and I know you gonna start another tread saying Rich guys are bastard guys... PRECEPTION ERROR... *enuff said*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You are left with character... so whats the difference between a 'nice' guy and a 'bad' guy?<br><br>Dear, Yunhaier<br><br>*Hey... I am a 'nice' guy, and I just DON'T understand why she would rather stick with him THAN to give me a chance to me and herself on how much better I would treat her*... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Reply<br><br>Mr 'NIce' guy... you are nice... so define 'nice'. And because you are so 'NICE', this major character, sort of, occupied alot of space in your character crate, which you most likely have miss out the important goods of 'Etiquette', Charm',  'Humor' and most important of all... 'Self confidence.' that is so essential to be placed within at all times. It appears that you seemed to spend most of your time with this preception error... and never really did much of a reflect on yourself to see why is things happening. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>Come on... everything happens for a reason... what I am trying to say is that making assumption and comments is easy, but is that useful? Its their life, not yours and all they could do is just one sentence and you would hold your tongue... 'What does it got to do with you?' Bastard guys are good are expressing themselves... they have self confidence and make woman feel good being around them. Some are fun.. others are interesting... regardless... they either make woman feel special, first-love, different or simply win them over totally. First time when they got into a relation... they ain't that good... but hey... this method works. He will try again... and it works again... they confidences grows within them.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Don:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi all, just got some questions to ask.....well, been inside my mind for quite long. Sometimes, I really wonder....is it really true that only "Duo Qing Ren" will then get to be noticed by females out there. My "Duo Qing Ren" here meant normally, playboys. Sometimes... these people are not very handsome, how come they still managed to get some many victims to bed?? I am not trying to ask how to get females to bed, I am just want to know if that are good guys nowadays not being appreciated by females? Why?? Is it that they lack of experience or what? To me, I admit lah huh, I never went on date before, I don't know why, maybe because I was shy when in secondary and too indulge in my schoolwork when I am in Poly. But now, I am 21++ liao. But leh....it seems that although, I am not those kind of "Duo Qing Ren", and also, I am quite "gui ju", how come no one seems to notice me huh?? Is it because I am too short, say around 1.63m? Or is it because nowadays, females prefer to go for flirtish guy?? I really don't understand how come they are so willing to give themselves to those jerks and eventually kenna ditched?? I mean what's the rationale behind it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  Some hope someone can answer this, is it true that REAL NICE GUYS on the street are never appreciated and if you want to get one of the girl of your dreams, never put in 100%, 20% is enough since you should ditch her after you are tired of her?? Funny question, though I used to tell myself, never mind someday I will be appreciated, but I think it is time to ask myself again, is it really worth it to be a nice guy? Who knows if you are nice or not, even a wolf in a sheep clothing might be having a life much better than mine. Basket them..... N do ppl really appreciates the good things you do or rather they will start stepping over you once they know you can be stepped all over without retailating? If this is so, I am really tired of being a good guy, as the saying goes, "Hao Ren Nan Zhuo", being a "Hao Nan Ren Ge Jia Nan Wei"..... Females out there, hope to get your response...... you need lah, at least need to find out where the problems lied in me or rather is there really any.</div></blockquote>similarily, is gd gals being appreciate also?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  i guess its juz a matter of ur luck, whether u will get to meet the one who really appreciates u...but mind u, even if gd guy n gd gal gets together, if no effort is put in, both will take each other 4 granded over time...so do count ur blessing...</div>
