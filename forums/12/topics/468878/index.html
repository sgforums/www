              <p>Thanks all for your advices.</p>
              <p>Like what @FireIce have said, I do not have enough information to determine. But it is this 6th sense/gut feelings that I am having which is why I am looking for signs. I don't seem to have this gut feelings for other married male colleagues :P</p>
              <p>Come to think of it, I also don't know how I would react if it is true and I may not treat him the same way as I did now (probably will try to avoid him etc). Knowing less may just be the way to go :)</p>

              <p>@Xiaopipi999, I guess the most important question is whether you are interested in him...</p>
              <p>I believe it would probably be so or he would not occupy your mind.</p>
              <p>All women have their natural beauty and men are easy to seduce.</p>
              <p>What you want to know is whether he loves you or lusts for you?</p>
              <p>The answer could also be "Neither".</p>
              <p>Sometimes in life when you need to make a clear decision, it helps to go inside yourself for some soul searching.</p>
              <p>To do this effectively, I have written a free ebook to help guide people through the process. </p>
              <p>You can download Journey Of The Mind from this link. <a href="http://book.lancism.com">http://book.lancism.com</a></p>
              <p>Hope it helps you clear your thoughts and free your heart from this confusion.</p>
              <p>Namaste. </p>

              if you know he`s married, i think you should consider if your actions are proper..
              i know you cant control your feelings (assuming you like him), but breaking a family up is another thing altogether..
              
              i believe you are able to find someone better..
              the forbidden fruit is always the sweetest, but often, you have to pay a great price for it.
