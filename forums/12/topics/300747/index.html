            <div class='col-md body'>The girl should let him go, seriously. There is no point of getting him back when his heart is no longer with her. If the guy and the Thai girl are serious on the relationship, then all the more she needs to move on instead of getting stuck in one place.<br><br>If the relationship disintergrates, the girl should learn not to look back. If he can do it to her one time, he can, and will do it a second time. In either way he doesn't deserve her, not even if he feels sorry about it. He needs to be taught a lesson, and she should get a guy who will truly love and appreciate her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Please dun mess with thai pub gals here, most of these gals are going for a comfortable stay here, get a singapore guy protection, get visa, permit,  money, fun, h/p and nothing else, he will regret. Please ask him to think carefully. I also hv one worker here who give up his family to be with a thai hostess, he end up with an empty bank account, buy house for her and even her family, give her room to stay, alway absent from work with no ot contribution. We give him a lot of chances to change, even his wife come to the company crying and looking for him. He went to thailand a few times with this gal, and in the end the thai gal dumped him for another bf once he was broke.<br><br>We terminated his services, his wife already file for divorce, his childrens hated him and his own parents also wanted to disown him. I heard he went back to see the thai gal and was beaten up by her new bf who is much younger and can even speak thai. So dun be a fool, give up now before it is too late.</div>

U should know what is a pub gal in Golden mile, dun know how many men hv her already and yet there is a faithful local gal only mend for him and he dun want, if this is not lust or fatal attraction, i dun know what is it. There are many sgmen that fall prey to pub gals, because it is their profession, seducing sgmen, once she got u, she just serve u, dun hv to serve so many men, just con you and get all the money and hv stablility here, why not?<br><br></div>
