Please ask him to think carefully. I also hv one worker here who give up his family to be with a thai hostess, he end up with an empty bank account, buy house for her and even her family, give her room to stay, alway absent from work with no ot contribution. We give him a lot of chances to change, even his wife come to the company crying and looking for him. He went to thailand a few times with this gal, and in the end the thai gal dumped him for another bf once he was broke.<br><br>We terminated his services, his wife already file for divorce, his childrens hated him and his own parents also wanted to disown him. I heard he went back to see the thai gal and was beaten up by her new bf who is much younger and can even speak thai. So dun be a fool, give up now before it is too late.</div></blockquote>a similar thing happened to my friend with a china girl, except the china girl seems to be paying more in the relationship.<br>ended with a divorce with his wife though.<br>if you still want to be friends with the guy i have to say its best not to interfere, he probably can't think very well now, talking him out of it is useless since if he can listen he probably won't get there in the first place.</div>

Aren't  these foreigner gals family destroyers?<br>Taking the advantage that men go for lust, they exploited sg Uncles without a remorse feeling for his wife or gf?<br><br>I do agree that relationship cannot be interferred, but we must always voice out to our fellow countrymen/women about the danger of such relationship, we must promote awareness of money minded foreigner gals taking our men, husband, bf, relatives, frens and even colleagues.<br><br>If my bf falls for another gal who really love him, care for him and willing to be with him forever, tho i will be sad, but i dun mind and wish him good luck, but if he fall into the hand of money sucking foreigner gal, i will raise my voice at him, not because of lost of love, but to let him know the consequences of the aftermath, in another words, to enlighten him.</div>

Anyway, when 2 people are in love, they do not look at each other but look in the same direction.</div>
