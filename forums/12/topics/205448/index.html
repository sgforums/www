            <div class='col-md body'>I can understand his predicament, for I'm facing a similar situation myself.<br><br>The first thing that your friend should do is <strong>NEVER TO LOSE HOPE OR GIVE UP!</strong><br><br>It's a <strong>FACE</strong> issue. Perhaps the parents have a bad impression of girls who had only secondary education.<br><br>Perseverence is the answer. If the girl is virtuous, filial etc, try highlighting the strengths of his girlfriend to his parents.<br><br>Ultimately, your friend is the one to spend the rest of his life with the girl, not the parents.

            <div class='col-md body'>I went to this job agency at international plaza, the job agent ask me what is my qualifications, i reply poly diploma (at that time i just ord).  Then he ask me what is my job criterias, i said anything is fine but i cannot pick those jobs that require me to go overseas as my mom is stricken with cancer. Then all of a sudden the job agent become black-face keep saying i am choosy. So after a few days that job agent call me and arrange an interview, i went down only to find out that the job require me to go taiwan for 4 months then come back to singapore for 2 weeks and back to taiwan again. I politely refuse the job offer and after a few hour the job agent call me and scold me. He scold me words like calling a "crap" and a "loser". Finally i lose my temper and f@uck that guy through the phone. Now i am working night shift and i am so glad i get this job through company not just some crappy agencies. I wish your friend good luck and hope he need not use the help of any job agenices.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, a good relationship does not only depend solely on love, but also communications and understandings between two being. It is true that a girl who has higher qualifications does't mean that she has a good attitude. The level of education isn't a yatchstick for one's success in life. I actually known a girl, who is a medical student, has actually slept with more than 10 guys less than 2 years time. Moreso, she indulged in guilty plaesures,eg. smoking drinking, and promiscuity. Not to tell that she actually leads a pathetic life.<br><br>I think his parents are concerned for his marriage maybe because they think people with highr education have good attitude for sure, and as one member mentioned before, sian chi liang mu, Not to forget that your friend is from poly, which is only1 grade higher than O-level.  His parents might want a girl who has higher qualifications so that she can help her husband financially. It is a well known truth that without a degree, it is difficult to find a average paid job. This occurs in every corner of the world.  Tell your friend to know more about the reasons she did not continue with her studies. There is always a solution. Never give up if she is a nice girl. No one is to be blamed here. i really sympathize your friend. If the girl is good, then continue. I always believe in love. Never give up</div>

Since this is the case for your friend's parents' expectation, all you can do is to tell your friend to encourage his gf in upgrading herself. He has to tell his gf what's going on regarding his parents' disapproval. If she's understanding and wise, she'll be willing to upgrade herself and work towards being somebody.<br><br>Moreover, both of them are still so young. Don't get so tied down and uptight about this whole relationship thing. Beside spending time together and enjoying each other's company, maybe they could just slowly work on their relationship such that they become closer and more loving <strong>if they make a decision to be together for long-term</strong>.<br><br>Since they're not getting married, they don't have to please the parents right now. Just focus on building their relationship and start working things out and knowing each other even more. When the time is ripe, and if they're still together by then, then seeing the parents wouldn't be a problem.<br><br>I'm sure by then, they'd be more mature as a full fledge adult, and both their parents will be more accomodating and accepting.</div>
