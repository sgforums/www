What you deem 'right' might just not be so in the eyes of your friend or even others...? Sometimes the line of 'right' and 'wrong' might be a little blurrish... Just like you would not like someone who just step into your life and tell you that you should be doing MORE DONATIONS just because they think it's 'RIGHT' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>If you're really strong on your stand and you're not really affecting your friendship or irritating your friend through the things you wanna tell her, I suppose it might be okay to just talk about it sometimes...?<br><br>But if you really respect your friend with her life, I suppose it's better to just have her own authority over decisions in her life... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>
