            <div class='col-md body'>Has a girlfriend for the past 3 months. She live very far. So normally i will either meet her up at central or go to school which is at west side to see her. No matter how tired I am I will still travel down to see her once a week. Sometime even just accompany her for just 4hrs looking at her doing her project make me quite happy. Even though sometimes she don't want to go out on Saturday (actually is most of the time. She want to stay at home and watch Tv. By the way her parents don't know about our relationship.) I also never really say anything. Yesterday wanted to meet her up, But she told me she wanted to watch tv becos last episode. So I say ok loh, if you wanna stay home just stay home. So she say since we meeting on Saturday. Then ended up she came home at 11pm and told me she was having fun with her friends and forget about the time. I really sometime don't understand her. I  never been spending much quality time with her since she doing her school project. After she finished her project, the first thing she want is to watch tv or go out with her friends which she see almost everyday. I feel frustrated, she say i am didn't concern about her and just want to see her only. I think she taking me for granted. I feel i'm more inferior to a TV. She rather watch TV at home then to meet me up.  I seriously don't know what goes wrong. What is wrong of wanted to meet her up which i almost meet her up sometimes not EVEN A BLOODY 1 once a week. I have been with her for 3 months. I meet her only like 12 times. I can EVEN COUNT. WHAT THE HELL. Seriously why do girls sometimes like to take things for granted. All the girls around me since to be like that. Is it because I'm always give in in things that they see I'm quite tasty to eat. By the way this is my 1st girlfriend. So please advise on that. Thank you.</div>
