            <div class='col-md body'>The reason for local anesthetic is because it's safer for the surgery. the anesthetic is only needed around the area, in this case it's your leg? so there is no point risking other part of your body like your heart, brain, stomach, etc. Why I said risk? because your nerves are practically "sleeping" during that, and "sleeping" nerves are not good. When cell is 'idle', it doesn't really have enough energy and enough oxygen. The risk? the cell can die. Well,.. every second there are some cells of our body die, but imagine if you have to bring down the whole body?<br><br>There are cases where without proper anesthetic, after the surgery the patient couldn't wake up, hence they are in 'coma' condition for ages. Some died. Why? because the dosage that is given is the standard, which is safe to almost all people. But it is "almost all" and not "all". Some people are unique, they body will react in unique way and totally different from the majority. Hence it is fatal to assume.<br><br>So,.. local anesthetic is your best option.<br><br>If you are really scared, tell the doctor. If he tries to make fun of it and try to kid around.. say that you are serious (with a very serious face like you are going to eat him).<br><br>When you lie down, you can ask them to cover your upper body and head,.. or simply close your eyes. Try to think about something else, or sing a song in your heart. If you are Christian, then I would say prayer and worship will be very comforting. And just keep one thing in mind during that: the doctor is the expert! he has been facing the same cases for so many times, he is so familiar with it. do you have any idea how many people go for surgery in one day? how many patients he's dealing with in one month? you are just one of many, he will be easily taking care of you.<br><br>About your study,.. as you recover, you'll be able to catch up. Everyone knows first few weeks is the basic of the entire semester's material. You can also ask your friends to assist you in catching up. and if you are still worried, you can talk to your lecturer (if they are 'ok' type) about your concern BEFORE the surgery. Why before? so it doesn't sound like an excuse to fail, and some more it will make you sound like a hard-studying student who is concern about the academic performance.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by bluecom:</div><div class="quote_body">The reason for local anesthetic is because it's safer for the surgery. the anesthetic is only needed around the area, in this case it's your leg? so there is no point risking other part of your body like your heart, brain, stomach, etc. Why I said risk? because your nerves are practically "sleeping" during that, and "sleeping" nerves are not good. When cell is 'idle', it doesn't really have enough energy and enough oxygen. The risk? the cell can die. Well,.. every second there are some cells of our body die, but imagine if you have to bring down the whole body?<br><br>There are cases where without proper anesthetic, after the surgery the patient couldn't wake up, hence they are in 'coma' condition for ages. Some died. Why? because the dosage that is given is the standard, which is safe to almost all people. But it is "almost all" and not "all". Some people are unique, they body will react in unique way and totally different from the majority. Hence it is fatal to assume.<br><br>So,.. local anesthetic is your best option.<br><br>If you are really scared, tell the doctor. If he tries to make fun of it and try to kid around.. say that you are serious (with a very serious face like you are going to eat him).<br><br>When you lie down, you can ask them to cover your upper body and head,.. or simply close your eyes. Try to think about something else, or sing a song in your heart. If you are Christian, then I would say prayer and worship will be very comforting. And just keep one thing in mind during that: the doctor is the expert! he has been facing the same cases for so many times, he is so familiar with it. do you have any idea how many people go for surgery in one day? how many patients he's dealing with in one month? you are just one of many, he will be easily taking care of you.<br><br>About your study,.. as you recover, you'll be able to catch up. Everyone knows first few weeks is the basic of the entire semester's material. You can also ask your friends to assist you in catching up. and if you are still worried, you can talk to your lecturer (if they are 'ok' type) about your concern BEFORE the surgery. Why before? so it doesn't sound like an excuse to fail, and some more it will make you sound like a hard-studying student who is concern about the academic performance. Lecturers love them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div></blockquote>thanks alot... but however...the only 2 fears i have are<br><br>needles and knowing someone is cutting me up. those 2 barriers are enough to scare me. i knw i dont have a choice...but i really am confused.</div>
