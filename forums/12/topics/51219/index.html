I'm thinking that since she's not willing to talk now, she has her reasons. give her some time too 'cool off'. Come later, she may be able to talk to you again and may be able to tell you what happened. If she is seeing someone, her bf may not like the idea (just suggesting)<br><br>Hope you are better. It's not so much about you. Perhaps she needs some space so give it to her lor. If the friendship matters to her too, she'll make effort once again.

I'm thinking that since she's not willing to talk now, she has her reasons. give her some time too 'cool off'. Come later, she may be able to talk to you again and may be able to tell you what happened. If she is seeing someone, her bf may not like the idea (just suggesting)<br><br>Hope you are better. It's not so much about you. Perhaps she needs some space so give it to her lor. If the friendship matters to her too, she'll make effort once again. You can know if this means anything to her..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>I am pretty sure she is not seeing some one cos she just broke off with her bf not long ago and she stil likes him alot. i know his bf as we are campmates during army times. So i think it couldnt be tt someone does not like the idea.<br><br>I am not so sure abt making the effort. She is those stubborn type of ppl and i guess most of the times, her effort is tranfered to hoping and thinking tt the guy will go back to her though she noes its impossible. I hope tt wat u say may come thru as in she will make the effort again. Saying "I dun widh to tok" is not anything like making the effort to me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
