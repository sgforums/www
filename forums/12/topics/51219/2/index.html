I helped her get thru her sad times when she broke off with her bf some time ago. We used to tok almosy daily or sms. We are just frens, nothing more. Recently, i have not heard fr her for more than a week. I asked her is there anything wrg, she said she just dun wan to tok, tts all. I feel very unfair cos bcos u dun wish to tok, then u dun contact others or reply others calls. Wat if ur fren needs ur help? And i feel tt this stubborness is also not good. For guys who noe stubborn gers, u will one wat i mean. Any opinions on this?<br><br>2nd case: I got to noe a new fren thru my fren some time ago. This new fren is also a ger. We were getting along well. She will also reply my calls when she missed it. Once again, we are just frens, nothing more. Then one day, when i called her, she asked who i am <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> I was shocked to hear tt. I manage to let her noe who i am. BUt after tt call, she nvr reply my call again. Duno wats wrg. I din do anything wrg. She once told me she also cut off contact wif another nice guy fren of hers. Duno the reason y. Any opinions on this?<br><br></div></blockquote>Ok, currently in school now replying to this thread.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Alright dude, there is one thing I wished to comment about your case one. Firstly, when you helped her get through her difficult times, DOESN'T mean that she has to be there for you when you are undergoing the same thing. Helping someone is volunteering without expecting anything in return. If she doesn't want to contact you, she has her own reason. Probably in my opinon she wants to calm herself down and ponder over herself for a moment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Its good to lend a helping hand, but its criticial to understand when someone needs some time for his/her own.<br><br>Now onto the next case; your second case doesn't involve you personally, its more about her. I mean if you take it so personally about she not knowing who are you, then it will be personal. Frankly speaking, if I were you, I wouldn't think so much. Afterall, even though you have fancy for her - in status, you are just her casual friend.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Its good to take steps in trying to understand and get to know her better before committing yourself into thinking that she is a potential.
