I may be just jumping to conclusions, but some things could be coming to light.<br><br>When a girl seems to be having problems, and she puts a nonchalant attitude and says "no problem" whenever asked about it, that usually means there <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span> a problem and the problem has got something to do with the person asking the question.<br><br>Could your closeness to B be the cause of the rift in your relationship with A? Relationships are a very tricky business -- what you may think of as mere friendship may not be interpreted as such by the other party. I do not know how things stand among the three of you, but I do not discount the possibility that envy or jealousy may have a hand in this.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by granny goose:</div><div class="quote_body">i am currently torn between 2 friends. one of them used to be closer to me (let's call Friend A), the other is my very good friend (let's call Friend B). but recently, Friend A seems to be rather nonchalant in my affairs. each time, i told her stuff, she would give uninterested and non-committal answers. i have tried talking to her regarding this matter, saying that i wish she can show more concern with my life but we always end up quarrelling. this makes me very frustrated to the extent that i decide to minimise contact with her.<br><br>on the other hand, i feel totally at ease with Friend B. we had since grow closer during this period (after i quarrel with Friend A, i find myself seeking the company of Friend B). Friend B is very understanding. she is always able to make me feel very comfortable in her presence. she is interested in my affairs and she always try to make me feel valued with the little things she does / said.<br><br>fellow forumers, what should i do? i don't wish to give up on Friend A but we seem to be drifting further apart each day. further, i also find myself drawn towards Friend B. please help.</div></blockquote>Hmm...I don't see anything wrong with it. Your Friend A and B is behaving according to what they usually does...just because you think that Friend A is becoming bo chap towards you and you wanna dump this friendship? What kind of friend are you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Remember this...Friends don't force each other to commit towards the friendship relationship. And you certainly sucks at that...being a Friend A's friend.<br><br>If you truly desire a healthy friendship with Friend A, do not dwell on her action/behaviour...friends don't do that. If she really does something bad towards you or your loved ones in the future, then dump this friendship and make her regret for losing you as a friend...take revenge if you want. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>In fact, you shouldn't worry about her behaviour if you truly desire a friendship with her. But I think you wanted more out of this friendship...well...in that case, go after her openly and get out of this friendship umbrella. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Another thing though, make up your mind who you like and wanna be with. You might find yourself falling for Friend B because she is providing emotional shelter for you whenever you are feeling stormy.<br><br>It is still true that being loved is somehow better than being in love. However, that theory applies to different people. For me, I will always choose to be in love and hope to be loved...cos I only lived once and I wouldn't wanna run my life like a second-hand shop with second-hand decision throughout my life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Think through and make your next decision at your own time. Don't lived your life with regrets hor...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
