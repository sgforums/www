            <div class='col-md body'>come on. Lets see it in this perspective.<br>No matter how advance technology can be. How much couples can interact thru medias like Webcam, ICQ, IRC, E-mails, Snail-mails etc...It still couldn't be compared to seeing you loved one in person and giving little gestures, smiles, cuddle and hugs.<br>Of cos not to forget those kisses and gifts.<br>Moreover, webcam is good. But once the cam is off...no one knows what's going to happen on his/her side or your side.<br>ICQ? Even if the person is online...there's still a Invisible option mode.<br>E-mail is just a read and click "delete" away.<br><br>Ok i'm not trying hard to discourage LDBGR<br>But no matter how much two person love one another...<br>No matter how they missed each other.<br>Each have their OWN lifestyle.<br>Culture and social influences does affect a person's mindset. (TRust me)<br><br>Imagine a place where there are new friends, new homes and new pastimes with new friends.<br>Would he/she still spend time on the PC waiting for his/her other half(presume in SG) to wake up, or come back home to meet up online?<br>What if the other half(in SG) was still having a great with his/her friends outside???
