            <div class='col-md body'>Well, if you wanna know the truth, maybe you can get a friend or a fake ID to check up on him...however, you gotta be mentally prepared..the truth hurts sometimes..<br><br>It's not surprising when guys go around hunting other girls when they are in a r/s...some are only into making friends, others wanna "widen" their cirlcle of female friends... "the more the merrier mah"...in other words flirting..coz they find sticking to one gal is really boring...and they are those adventurous kinda people who wanna try to mingle around with new girls..etc..<br><br>May it be male or female, even in thie modern society, i bet there are still lotsa us who are uncomfy with our partners going around making friends with the opposite sex (even though it's merely friendship).I understand it's not about whether if we're giving them additional personal space...coz in this competitive society..we're just afraid of losing our other half to another party...<br><br>f i were to put myself in your shoes , since he changed quite a bit after getting together with me...and he loves hunting for new girls online...i guess..it's very hard for me to carry on with this kinda person. A relationship without trust and faith will never be long lasting..esp when that fella proves you right... there are many better decent guys out there...</div>

Even if he/she thinks that they were juz joking, playing, dun mean business..but then the person who tried to flirt with him/her may have other intentions, and take advantage if he/she dun mind.
