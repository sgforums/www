It's the mentality of yours that proves to be a barrier, by saying you cannot study, it already underline the pessimism in your thinking. Perhaps the way you are studying isn't productive.

It's the mentality of yours that proves to be a barrier, by saying you cannot study, it already underline the pessimism in your thinking. Perhaps the way you are studying isn't productive. Try other ways like studying with friends who can help you in academics and not other stuffs or seek help from your teachers. I'm sure your teachers would be more than willing to lend you a helping hand if they sense sincerity and determination from you. Think positively. You are not the worse off.</div></blockquote>got to fully agree with this.<br>psychological barrier.. u kept telling yourself u can't you can't.. thats why u wont' be able to succeed.. have you ever tell yourself u can do it? you're still young.. with lots of energy and drive.. then those elderly people? they are old.. but they still can learn.. there's nothing such as i can't i can't.. its whether you put your heart into everything you do anot.. furthermore,its not about the amount of time u study.. u can don't touch the comp for a year..<br>and u study.. if u bo xim study.. no matter how many hours u put in also useless..<br><br>if your teachers don't help you, why not u help yourself?<br>since you're good at telling yourself u can't.. why not u use this to rules like.. yes i can study.. yes i can do it.. yes i will be able to succeed..<br><br>cause afterall its your attidute that counts..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Where there's a will, there's a way! its only U have to tell urself dat U CAN do it...<br><br>ITE also if i am not wrong offer courses in motor vehicle to train u up as a mechanic so maybe since u like this area u might want to explore. Then from there work ur ways toward a poly diploma in mechanical engineering.<br><br>Never give up hope on urself. I am 30 this yr with only a dip to my name &amp; i am proud to say that sometimes i make more than a lawyer or doctor. However, many a times i wished i could have studied harder to get my degree then my job opportunities would have been wider range.  If u are hardworking, u can succeed in life, u just need a positive mindset.<br><br>sorry for being crude but!<br><br>GO GET UR FIAKING "O"s. It's like a passport to a PR in ur career path. So Wake up &amp; start studying. Get tuition if need, Get any help if possible!</div>
