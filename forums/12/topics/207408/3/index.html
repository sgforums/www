            <div class='col-md body'>Well, firstly I'm too lazy to read through all the suggestions but it is a good thing that you have started to think. That is the first step. Next is to put your thoughts in action because you won't achieve anything just by thinking and not doing anything.<br><br>If you like playing and tinkering with bikes or cars, it might be a good thing to take up some form of apprenticeship with some mechanic shop and slowly learn your keep as a mechanic. It's something hands on and if you have the interest I believe you will try to improve your skills by reading up etc<br><br>That maybe a way to start off instead of doing something you don't like.<br><br>You will have to be able to take hardship though but it is a portable skill. Think about it<br><br>But at least finish your O's and go to ITE as they give you a strong foundation in mechanical skills which you can apply in your job in the future.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>First, I suggest you continue study and graduate first, why? Because if my following advice fails you, at least you can still come out to work or study, as a backup plan. Always have a plan B, if you fail, at least you don't go bang your head against the wall.<br><br>Secondly, I think you should be your own boss. Yes, because if you're the boss, nobody cares about your paper qualifications, what is important is your ability. I started doing my web business for fun and it started generating a few hundred dollars every month, wonderful thing about business is that it still generates money even if I don't work on it anymore. It was tough at the beginning when money is hard to come by but once you see the money coming in and increasing every month, your determination grows very quickly.<br><br>To be your own boss, you need to be very determined, that's very important, you cannot give up easily at small/big/very big/super big setbacks. You need to have some "mentor" friends to guide/help you, who have done business before so you can learn from them, and you need to read alot and read widely. Reading teaches you things from professionals that are not taught in classrooms. And then, you need some products/services that you can provide value to the customers, that's where your ability comes in. You know, a couple days back on TV channel 5 i think, there is this reality show but I don't recall the name, but it's not important, what is important is that it proves one thing. These bunch of people from different backgrounds, not purely sales though, they were challenged to sell stupid things, like reusable toilet papers (you use it, wash it then can reuse the toilet paper again!) and useless carb spray, it's so damn stupid (and unethical which I truly dispise) but yet one team managed to rake in profits of US$400+ in 1 day, the winning team got about US$800 in 1 day, both teams selling crap and unethical products. The issue is not so much about paper qualifications or the products/services, it's your ability to do something. Singapore educational system is kind of screwed up really, it only makes people think about paper qualifications rather than something that truly matters, the ability and capability of a person. The reason why I ask you to study and graduate first is because the society is like this and will be like this for some time, so like it or not, if the market wants apples, you better be selling apples. You need the market to survive, they dun need you.<br><br>I seriously hope you can be a successful boss some day, if you truly believe in yourself, I don't think anyone can stop you. Likewise, if you dun believe in yourself, nobody can help you. You're only 16, I heard of people who are bankrupt at 40s and still manage to become millionaires by 50s, you need to think how they can do that, what you can learn from them. You're 16 and you're not bankrupt, so you're still ahead of them in some way, so why feel so useless?</div>

While you are right on your habits, trying hard not to be distracted, but that's not the way.<br><br>There's always a time to play and study. Studying too much for a period of time will make things worse. It would be better to study a few chapters per subject, then take a short rest. The rest would allow you to recap better. Make a cup of Milo or something to drink. After this, see if you can recall what you've learnt, especially the main points. Look at the summary at the end of the chapter and see how many points can you recall.<br><br>Learn when to play and study. After studying for a few hours straight, bring your bike out. It needs sunshine too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>As for quitting school and enrolling into ITE, I'm not too sure if that's possible, as MOE has a set of guidelines and there's a minimum age you have to reach before you can enter.<br><br>There will be lots of time to learn a new skill once your holidays start. Think about your interests. Since you love biking and driving, how about learning how to repair bikes from the uncles in bicycle shops? You not only can do your own repairs, you can help others too. And if you do it well, they might consider let you help them as a part-timer. It's a win-win situation for both parties.</div>

If you keep giving yourself excuses instead of finding the solution, how do you expect the problem to be solved? Go learn about efficient learning techniques and stop finding excuses. I am being mean to you but you'll find that giving excuses when it comes to problems will bring you nowhere, you need to become someone who kills problems for a living. Every problem you kill makes you a better fighter for the next problem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To those who think an o level student is capable and can study, you are wrong lor.<br>My PSLE result is actually super lousy one,<br>and primary school wasnt so stress.<br>I tried studying and forgetting everything else except study<br>But after trying to memorise the points,<br>I forget it totally the very next hour.<br>Thanks to those who encouraged me on to take my O levels.<br>But know what, i studied for my end of year exam so hard, never touch computer, never play any games, go home straight after school, study and read alot, do alot of revisions too. But in the end, i only pass english, and it was a borderline pass, other subjects all fail.<br>It is not that i am not determined, but i just cannot remember what i learn, because i have got no interest in what i am studying now. Ya, some may think english very hard to pass, but my school standard already so lousy and i only can pass english and fail all the others, i really don't know what to say lor.<br>And what more, i told my teachers i was interested in studying, and now, NONE of them believes me, because i haven't really put in enough effort to show them,<br>Physchogically, i keep on hoping that i could pass, although i am a pessiminst, i do try my best and put in my hardest effort.<br>Don't say my attitude in study, because teachers are not helping me, i hate tuition teachers, most of my friends are those never study also can pass very well type. and as i already mentioned, i cannot remember anything i studied.<br>And enrolling in ITE, i do wish to do that, but how ?<br>I am not sure how can i enrol in ITE, and i don't look down on ITE, i actually want to enter ITE now... Shatec actually also can. Hope ppl here can help me find little bit information on this.<br>And i do not want to waste my precious time and money to take the o levels knowing that i would fail terribly...<br>I'd thought to be my own boss before, but CAPITAL, who is going to support me, i am not good in IT, i am a complete stranger to the business world too.<br>And yes, i do take physics, but i always fail badly because i cannot memorise the formulaes to solve the problems.<br>And i do know how to repair bikes, i even know how to build them up piece by piece, but many fellow bikers also know.<br>Some think cannot study is complete bullshit, but i cannot remember everything i study, and whenever i study so hard for exam, my mind will just go blank.<br><br>PS, i am a pessimist, and that had been affecting me too.</div>
