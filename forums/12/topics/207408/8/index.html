But in the end, i only pass english, and it was a borderline pass, other subjects all fail.<br>It is not that i am not determined, but i just cannot remember what i learn, because i have got no interest in what i am studying now. Ya, some may think english very hard to pass, but my school standard already so lousy and i only can pass english and fail all the others, i really don't know what to say lor.<br>And what more, i told my teachers i was interested in studying, and now, NONE of them believes me, because i haven't really put in enough effort to show them,<br>Physchogically, i keep on hoping that i could pass, although i am a pessiminst, i do try my best and put in my hardest effort.<br>Don't say my attitude in study, because teachers are not helping me, i hate tuition teachers, most of my friends are those never study also can pass very well type. and as i already mentioned, i cannot remember anything i studied.<br>And enrolling in ITE, i do wish to do that, but how ?<br>I am not sure how can i enrol in ITE, and i don't look down on ITE, i actually want to enter ITE now...
