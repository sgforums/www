You don't want people to look down on you, but what have you got to prevent people from doing that?

            <div class='col-md body'>rathcycle, you better wake up your idea. Dun think ppl must take pity on you all the time, have you ever consider other ppl's feelings too? whack ppl up, cause trouble etc. you are making the ppl ard you more troubled than yourself! Have you ever wondered why ppl laugh at you? Even though you are capable of standing up for yourself, but still, ppl laugh at you? why?<br><br>Can't pass a single subject? I dun believe it...english, ok, at least you pass, than maths, just need to practice your ten yr series..the ten yr series really help me a lot man, you shld do that.<br><br>All in all, you are taking n levels now right? N levels is quite easy..just need to know the basics and ta-da, you've passed. For o levels, the markings kinda strict so have to wrok harder than n levels. N levels, you just need to write the basics out, they will just close one eye and let you pass.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is not meant to be insulting, but my honest opinion. I read your original post and it comes across as 'I give up'. The moment you have that mentality, all is lost. From what you have written, it is all in your mind that you cannot perform or study in school. However, it is good that you realise the consequences of your future life if you do not work hard now.<br><br>Best is to use that fear of being useless as the main driving force to push you to work harder. Everytime you want to slack or feel lazy, just contrast a picture of a successful man vs. someone who has to toil and slog just for his daily mean.<br><br>Everyone can be lazy. No one wants to work hard if they don't have to. The main difference between someone who works harder is usually because they feel the pressure to succeed and know the what-if consequences if they do not achieve.<br><br>The truth is, no one can help you. No one at all. Only yourself can make the change. No point coming here and whine, to complain to the forum. Only you can make the difference in your own life. Either you start now or 10 years down the road, you be regretting the what-if's. Just keep reminding yourself of that taste of pride, that taste of success after that hard work. Perhaps, you have never savoured succeeding before and feel how delicious it is. Just imagine, doing well in school and to make your mom proud and you feel good knowing you have a good future. Just keep that vision in your head and pressure forward.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You've got to <strong>CHANGE</strong>. This is Singapore , even very basic jobs require at least some education, when you start working you'll want to study and that might be too late, you still have your opportunity now, why not seize it.</div>
