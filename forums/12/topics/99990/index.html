This sometimes happens to people getting cold feet on the verge of marriage.<br><br>On your part I think you shouldn't complicate things. Such a ger if marries for money and marries an ex-divorce guy somemore for the wrong reason, can she ever makes you happy knowing your own current earning ability? Such a ger never satisfied. better find someone else less complicated for your own sanity.</div>
