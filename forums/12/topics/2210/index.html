If you think that the fact that he've admitted his LOVE for you is making you NERVOUS, try to loosen up a bit..? Perhaps you'll see a CLEARER picture from there...? In 'Supressed Rejection' I meant that you could be making a SUBCONSCIOUS REJECTION feeling for him because his LOVE or CARE for you is making you LOST or NERVOUS....<br><br>It's ok for you to just remain friends with him and see how things go if you're not certain of things and in fact, it's VERY ADVISABLE to do so for the time being...?</div>

It is like, if he ask you to be his gf, you'll immediately say YES. If you hesitate, that means you are not ready.<br><br>How about get to know him better as a friend first without thinking so much, without avoiding him, without being cold to him? The way you react are rejecting him unconsciously. Or you want him to stop asking you out, is that what your HEART wants, and how would you feel then?<br><br>[This message has been edited by raingal (edited 19 April 2002).]</div>

Often they will not ignore guys who are chasing after them. They like to be pampered, be treated sweetly, showered with gifts. But what the poor guy don't realise is, she is just simply clueless about it. She will continue to behave the same way, without telling him yes or no.If she likes you, then its obvious. Either that, she is not ready for a relationship/committment. There's a feeling that i can't really describe in words. It's like you know the guy/girl likes you. He's not disgusting, so you don't get turn off. You enjoy the attention and get excited. Somehow you think you will like him/her, because he/she likes you so.<br><br>Listen carefully to your heart, dats all I can say, and please...I know most nice guys get hurt.

            <div class='col-md body'>There're far better ways to boost my ego <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> No need to resort to this. I tink i like him BUT not sure whether as a fren or a bf loh. Dun wanna cross the line probably coz i'm not ready for the commitment yet. Still happy n contented being single. Another reason might be ...he dun exactly fit my criteria of an "ideal" bf thou hes pretty close to it..hehe..i know such "criteria" are nonsense but jus duuno why its holding mi back. He is being very patient to mi.. as many of u have mentioned.."dun hurt nice guys" ... n tat makes mi even more guilty. Guess the whole thing might "fade off" if i'm still clueless n he will 4get everything?? *shrugs* hope i can feel the "spark" soon..else i guess..tats it.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I dun dislike him..n i like going out with him coz he has lotsa "surprises" for mi.

            <div class='col-md body'>don't.<br><br>u don't like him. he doesn't measure up to your standards. these are the facts you have to come to terms with, like it or not.<br><br>why?<br><br>Looks<br><br>you did not have a crush on him, tats a fact. if u did u would only be too happy to jump into the relationship with him. is tat important? are looks necessarily everything u might ask? unfortunately tats a brutal fact. i read an article long ago suggesting tat out of a scale of 10 (on looks), partners should try not to go for those who are rated over 2 points above or below them for looks compatibility reasons. this is impt, cos in your case if a better looking fella comes along u will find it hard not wishing to drop him and go for the handsome guy instead.<br><br>is tat being shallow? no. its a fact tat many people take looks as an important consideration in choosing partners. one may say we should go for character instead. but come on, just like looks, character is just another characteristic of an individual. like looks, character change too.<br>recognising one's need to look for a partner of compatible looks is definitely not a sign of shallowness.<br><br>amidst my free time and crap sharing with my guy frens i've come up with 3 theories i'd like to share. after posting these perhaps some pp might know who i am. (HI! guys! =) maybe i should post my economic opinions here too hehe..)<br><br>Theory 1: Accessory Theory<br><br>Gals and Guys choose their partners in line with the accessory theory. one defines the partner in line with the other accessories one has, like cars, jewellery, pretty dresses etc. one's potential partner is to a certain extent, an accessory too. if one's potential partner is handsome, rich, drives etc, he/she will be more likely to accept the accessory so as to show off and be envied by frens. this is in line with Cooley's theory of the Looking Glass Self.<br><br>2. Vanity Theory<br><br>Do not believe for a moment when one chooses to say he/she does not go for looks. Everyone, to a certain extent, puts in effort to look good before he/she steps out of the house. along this argument, it doesnt make sense tat one later claims tat looks of a potential partner is not impt as if tats the case, one would not have spent tat effort on him/herself. we usually impose our judgment on others as harsh as we impose judgment on ourselves.<br><br>3. He-should-have-chosen-me theory<br>I've mentioned this last time. Frens of gals with bfs usually like to criticise these bfs. why? cos they are silently angry with them for making the wrong choice. their innermost thoughts include "hey! im prettier and nicer then her(the female fren with the bf), why did he choose her and not me? wat does he see in her anyway?" How is this possible all the time? yes. its amazing but it seems despite wat they see in the mirror, most gals do in fact think they are beautiful.<br><br>Ugly thoughts? but very true. am i being mean? yes. hate me now? go ahead, im a natural cynic and im just being frank.<br><br>lastly, i think love is a barter trade. double coincidences of several aspects are necessary to secure a good start, including factors like intelligence levels, interests, physical attraction etc. in this case obviously he didnt measure up so dont kid yrself and think u will eventually accept him cos u will have regrets.<br><br>[This message has been edited by userid (edited 23 April 2002).]</div>
