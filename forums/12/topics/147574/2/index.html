It started in my 1st semester in campus till now. But the problem is, I feel this relationship is going nowhere, it is rather stagnant as a matter of fact. Gone are the days where my spirits used to lift up where I see her face. Now, everytime she sees me, its like 'oh, normal' kinda look. She dont seem so energetic as before as well. To be fair, she is a wonderful gf, who looks after me, cooks, for me, etc.<br><br>I did my part to revive the relationship. She did wanted a break in Feb but I told her to stay on and did what I could to save the relationship. I think I did my best, now looking back 6months ago, I think maybe its just time to let go. I think its best to break it off quick then let it drag on and on, because it will cause more suffering. I dont really want her to go throught that pain. Right now, I want to be single, to find my direction in life and have a degree of freedom that I cant have when in a relationship. I would like to break the news to her on Monday, but the thing is, her best friend is coming for a visit from Japan (my gf is japanese). She is excited to bring her friend around and I cant bear to break the news to her on Monday, because she will be sad about it but will put on a brave face for her friend. It breaks my heart for her to suffer like that, but life is tough and Im at loss what to do next. On the other hand, her friend can offer her some comfort as she is here. I thought of breaking the news to her after her friend is gone, but I decided against it. haih~<br><br>Oh well, I guess I need to do some serious thinking and decide what is best thing to do.
