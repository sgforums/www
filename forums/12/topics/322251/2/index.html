              <p><br>Well, the problem is after obeserved that gal actions with other guys are the same as him and he found that he is not special one,</p>
              <p>he will start to post here again whining about his love for her and why she like this and like that again. The problem with guys is they like to make love out of themselves, that is my most worrying part when going out with them. One outing only, he thinks he got gf and love already. Sg guys, sometimes, they really suck to the bone.</p>

              <p><br>Wah! So scary! Aiya. No matter what, it's always our fault... Even when we try not to do it they make us feel guilty anyway!</p>
              <p>Heheh! I've seen similar signs and I've deliberately ignored the person doing this just in case they were genuine signals. I got my friend to be on the lookout for me too just in case... We have been watching the situation for a few weeks now and the lookout is all clear, so I think it's safe for me again.</p>
