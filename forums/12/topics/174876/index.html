            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, I would like to think that you are a good bf for having this concern. Keep it up!<br>Whatever you do, do not force her to put on make-up. It will makes her think that you think she looks ugly withot make-up and you prefer girls with make-up on. Let her regain her confidence in looking good. What you can do, maybe, is walk around in shopping centres especially in the cosmestics sections. Lots of free samples for your gf to try on. Maybe you can ask her to try some stuff and maybe say this or that colour suits her. If she don't like it, tell her can always wipe away. Do it slowly and keep the praises going. It would definitely boost her confidence to know that you like her wearing certain make-up and all. At the end of the day, tell her frankly that you are willing to help her gain her confidence in wearing make-up, but you still would not mind if she choose not to put on any make-up. After all, natural beauty is still the best.. Good luck man.. Update us if there's any change in her confidence..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
