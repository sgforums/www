            <div class='col-md body'>I'm from human resource dept., that why I can know every staff salary. Our pay adjustment is from Aug.  Apppraisal is always fall in mid Jul, so the result already confirm and pass to our dept. for processing.<br>Then, I found out that my boss is very unfair in the pay adjustment. I don't know why one of the staff does not contributed much and she's NOT busy at all (I always see her surfing net during office hours &amp; chatting with another dept. colleague).<br>Whereas our another collegaue is always busy &amp; responsible person, yet he don't have such a good pay raise like her? Is the mangement cannot see or what???<br><br>I felt that our company is very unfair to this colleague of mine. He work so hard for the company yet he don't get what he should have. I pity him but I cannot tell him company treated him so unfair lor.  HR dept. suppose to kept everything we knows PRIVATE &amp; CONFIDENTIAL.<br><br>What can I advise him?? I pity him, I want to indirectly tell him don't have to work so hard, but I don't know how? No point for him to work so hard yet management don't appreciate him ma.<br><br><strong>Any suggestion for me to help him?? </strong><br>Put yourself in my shoes, if your colleague have been working so hard yet mangement don't feel anything, don't you feel bad for your colleague?? He don't do anything wrong just that mangement don't see how hard working he is. I'm in no postion to let the mangement know this matter, so I need advise from forum......<br></div>
