              <p>wow...just be sounds like me...i totally understand your situation</p>
              <p>the difference is that i choose to be alone...haha...i used to have so many friends, and many of them in one way or another hurt me emotionally. also, i see so many people everyday that sometimes i get sick of talking to people. of course, a few years of such a policy in secondary school has affected my socialising skills a little; i find it kind of hard to meet new people now.</p>
              <p>So, sometimes, i do get frustrated when i see people with so many friends walking down Orchard Road, or at the sports complex. However, since i entered JC, i really changed in a way that I started my life afresh. I made friends, i don't want to be alone anymore...still, i don't really like meeting people outside school and on weekends.</p>
              <p>My advice is that if you really don't want to be a loner, start socializing. It really is up to you. If you're shy, get a close friend to help introduce yourself to others. You've got one life, so live it.</p>

              <p>Is there anybody who has no life outside school, which also
              means school is the only place where you can actually socialise
              with others? Even at school, it's hard to make friends because of
              the introverted personality. Well, I'm one of the very rare sad
              cases where I find myself alone and lonely wherever I go. It
              doesn't help that I don't like the course that I'm taking at school
              but I'm already into my final year of polytechnic. Every day I go
              through the motions of waking up, eating and sleeping and even look
              forward to the same routine(except for school of course) to
              suppress my anxiety in life. I've absolutely no passion in life
              whatsoever and I'm finding it increasingly hard to get my work
              done. Has anybody felt this way?</p>

              <p>no big deal.</p>
              <p>I have friends who are loners too. In polytechnic, he is always alone and come to group projects, always nobody wants to do with him and the lecturer has to force any group to accept him.</p>
              <p>Even now at work he is always alone. Alone eat lunch, alone go home etc</p>

              <p>Hey, thanks for all the replies. I'm a girl BTW. I'm not fat or ugly even though I don't do sports. Maith is right about this topic being self-pwnage and I could definitely use the time to sort out my problems. How I wish I was still having my school break! When I was working, I actually talked to people and almost become friends with them but we didn't have an excuse to meet after the work is done and everybody is back with their own lives!</p>
              <p>I don't cycle, go bowling, play pool/DOTA and I guess friendships are formed through such common interests. I used to enjoy being in my own company and I wish I could stay that way but reality has caught up with me and I realise what a weirdo I must look like in the eyes of society doing everything alone....Other than that, I might even seem normal to you until you realise that I've life. &gt;.&lt;</p>

              <p>No offence meant but as TS mentioned in the very first post, she is inclined to the more Introvert side, which pretty much dismissed the ideas you all gave like find someone to go shopping etc..</p>
              <p>TS: Like some wise people here mentioned, no one die from loneliness. To me, it seems that you take time to make friends and maybe in a year's time, when you stepped into the workforce, you will be working in the same environment (more or less) everyday and thats where you can start making friends. In the meantime, rant in forums if you wish to, do not bottle it up.</p>
              <p>I used to have a lot of friends and like to open up. Slowly, i realise some are just putting up a facade and I got kinda pissed at them so yup...snap..lesser friends now but happier..so having more friends doesnt mean happy yea..</p>

              <p>it is true that no one die from loneliness. the people who advise her to find people to go shopping, do sports etc isn't wrong at all. if she is truly happy being a loner, she wouldn't have created this topic.</p>
              <p>what the other people suggested are ways she can find or open up to people which she should be doing. so either way, I think all the comments and advices are valid. however, just by saying loneliness don't kill is not helping much.</p>

              <p>I can totally understand how u feel, TS.</p>
              <p>I was once shy and don't really open up to people, but now I'm more sociable and ppl will naturally come and chat up with me.</p>
              <p>If you are an introvert, maybe u should try to initiate a chat with someone u know.</p>
              <p>From my experience, if u choose to be a loner and not do any socializing, ppl will tend to leave u alone. Likewise, if u are more sociable, friends will come to u naturally.</p>

              <p>Is there anybody who has no life outside school, which also
              means school is the only place where you can actually socialise
              with others? Even at school, it's hard to make friends because of
              the introverted personality. Well, I'm one of the very rare sad
              cases where I find myself alone and lonely wherever I go. It
              doesn't help that I don't like the course that I'm taking at school
              but I'm already into my final year of polytechnic. Every day I go
              through the motions of waking up, eating and sleeping and even look
              forward to the same routine(except for school of course) to
              suppress my anxiety in life. I've absolutely no passion in life
              whatsoever and I'm finding it increasingly hard to get my work
              done. Has anybody felt this way?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Hmm.... you said you dislike your course? Then do you know what you want to do in the near future?</p>
              <p>If you know, it's good because you know what you're doin and where you're goin. Work on that, think of where to go after grad, pursue what you want to do. <br>If you doesnt, start thinkin already since your graduating soon. Passion is very important in life and if you lack of it, you lack motivation. Because passion drives you. <br>For eg. "I want to make it big in the xxx industry" (xxx is not sex, whatever job fields you're interested in i mean)<br>Without passion, life will be boring. <br><br><br>I'm not a loner but from young, I <strong>tend to</strong> <strong>like</strong> to approach the loners if i see one in my class because im ALWAYS curious what their mind is thinking bout. Why dont want to talk? What happened? Like exchange some conversations with them. From my experience, some chose to be one (loner), some dont. Maybe im an aquarius, who likes to make friends from all walks of life. But not all loners i met i can relate well because of too much differences involved between us so there isnt anything common to talk bout and some really chose to be alone so yea.<br><br></p>

                                      friendships are formed through such common interests. I used to
                                      enjoy being in my own company and I wish I could stay that way but
                                      reality has caught up with me and I realise what a weirdo I must

                                      than that, I might even seem normal to you until you realise that

              <p>It's true that friendships are formed through common interests because there are much things to talk bout if a group of people have interest in a particular thing, for eg. similar  taste of music genre. I think you should find out what your interests are and from there, try to find friends with similar interests as you. But if you <strong>choose</strong> to be alone, then it's your problem already. If you doesn't, it's time to break out of your comfort zone and start being initiative, but dont appear to be too desperate.<br></p>

It made me understand that socializing skills is really important it helps you to builds up better network in yur life. You need to learn to make the 1st move if you really cun think of a reason to go out witrh yur classmate, you can always ask yur classmate if they would like to join you for a cup of coffee no harm trying. You need not a bunch of friends to brighten up your life then a friend that understand. share some common views with u to brighten up yur life and dun waste yur school life it always the best opportunities granted to know more friends as they can become yur wonderful memories when u get older. No one is asking you to change yur character if you are uncomfortable with it, but ppl need to grow up by leaving their comfort zone.   </p></div>

              <p>it is true that no one die from loneliness. the people who advise her to find people to go shopping, do sports etc isn't wrong at all. if she is truly happy being a loner, she wouldn't have created this topic.</p>
              <p>what the other people suggested are ways she can find or open up to people which she should be doing. so either way, I think all the comments and advices are valid. however, just by saying loneliness don't kill is not helping much.</p>

              <p>You don't ask people to become an extrovert by asking her to find people, she is passive not proactive. More meaningful will be how to make people want to approach her will be better?</p>
              <p>Its not helping her much? People need a self fulfilling prophecy or at least not to think she is a weirdo and stuff. Don't take things as it comes, read beyond the lines. In a way, Im asking her to be who she is</p>

              <p>you're a girl,sorry about that. But its even more weird,i thought girls always have a group of friends to hang out with?</p>
              <p>Anyway u said "we didn't have an excuse to meet after the work is done and everybody is back with their own lives!" and i dont think that is true.</p>
              <p>What im trying to say is you need to ask ppl out,dont wait for the other parties to ask. They are probably thinking about the same thing too,like "if got someone ask me to go out with him/her,i will. But if no one ask,then i'll just stay home alone lor"</p>
              <p>you should,like what some of the post said,take the first step instead of waiting for others.</p>
              <p>U said u're neither fat nor ugly,then dont be afraid! Ask one or two friends out together and just window shop,study or just have fun!</p>
              <p>N btw,there's no such thing as friendships are formed through common interests. U dont need friends to have the same interests as you to be friends! Heck it would be even better if u dont have the same interests as ur friends! I mean,u could like share ur hobbies and stuff to them and they can share their interests with u as well!</p>
