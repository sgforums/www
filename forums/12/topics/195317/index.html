            <div class='col-md body'>be very careful, health wise and money wise. People staring at her might really mean those poeople seen her in her work place and might have used her service. Don't always think she's pretty and therefore people look at her.<br><br>Is she here to study or make a quick buck. She didn't get her focus right.<br>Are you getting your focus right. Thailand has lots of good schools as well. Why did she need to come over Singapore? I find it strange. Some of these overseas 'students' are here on student pass to work as escots/geylang and try to marry into Singapore. Using this its a stepping stone to bring their families out of their country.<br><br>How old are you and do you know the issues of going on in these kinds of relationships?<br><br>Whatever you choose. Don't regret your decision. And similar to most normal thinking, most men don't take it well when their girl had been sleeping with men for cash even if its for survival. And know that you are giving up lots of other good women for one who had worked in the world oldest profession, seen lots of unsavoury things and done more with men than you dare to think.<br>Love is good but are you blind, is the more correct question.<br></div>

I think it's high salary that she's looking for.. see her spending pattern, it's hard to ask her change suddenly.  But I have frens working as waitress in pubs, they get quite good salary also.  Of course, pub is also not a gd suggestion, but at least she dun have to sleep with men.<br><br>We cannot condemn or look down on people bcos of their job because they are also earning a living.

Why do you want to have a relationship with her? Why not just treat her like a prostitute and sleep with her? You see, you naturally understood that sex and love goes together. That if you separate sex from love, then what you get is prostituition, a pervasion. Ask yourself why you don't just treat her as a prostitute and you have the answer to your own question.</div>

As far as God is concern, her prostitution is no worse than you telling white lies. If God condenms her prostitution then God will similarly have to condenm you for telling white lies.<br><br>So I suggest that you do not condenm her just because she is a prostitute. What you must understand though is that prostitution carries many risks of sexual diseases and also AIDS.<br><br>If by fate is cruel you mean why must you fall in love with a prostitute and why can't she not be a prostitute. If she is not a prostitute you would probably have never met her. Is that what you want? Never ever have met her?<br><br>Or do you mean that fate should have stopped you and her from falling in love with each other? Then where does it stop? You want fate to live your live for you? The decisions that you make is what makes life meaningful for you. You do not want to be a slave where your master makes all the decisions for you do you?</div>

I admit there is body contact between us because we walk close to each other but not to the stage of holding hand.<br><br>I can see she really treasure this friendship. She show me the URL of the private school and even give me her login name and password to check her student details.<br><br>I still remain friends with her but getting into a relationship....I guess something must be done on her part...<br><br>Come to think of it... Fate is cruel....very cruel <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Curious to ask...<br><br>Why so many people condemm prositute? I hint to my friends if they have friends who works as a prositute and will they stay far away from the her and most of the reply is yes...</div></blockquote>i don't condemn prostitution though i admit i would have problems with my girl being or having had been a pro. its more of distaste rather than disapproval though.<br><br>so do you have prob with her having been a pro? if she stop doing it can you accept?</div>

I believe she is here as a student, not supposed to work right?  You may try to ask her to change a job, for her own sake.  She might get the wrong idea that u look down on her bcos of her job, so explain to her slowly and tactfully.<br><br>At the same time, help her find another job?  I think it's high salary that she's looking for.. see her spending pattern, it's hard to ask her change suddenly.  But I have frens working as waitress in pubs, they get quite good salary also.  Of course, pub is also not a gd suggestion, but at least she dun have to sleep with men.<br><br>We cannot condemn or look down on people bcos of their job because they are also earning a living.  I'm not referring to loan sharks etc.  But she is really a spendthrift leh. Is she working as a prostitute because she wants to earn money for her school fees or her shopping expenditure?  </span></div></blockquote>Hmm...</div>

Recently i got to know a girl, a very beautiful thailand girl...She brought alot of clothes in my shop, have a great time with her because she seems so friendly. She spend one hour in the shop and in the end she spend over $700 on clothes.<br><br>Somehow, before she left the shop we exchange phone numbers. We chat every night, she told me that she is studying in singapore and she is doing her degree. She did work part time but she doesnt want me to know where she work. As times goes by, from normal friend to close friend. We being going shopping together, watch movie, eat together etc etc. I am a very normal looking guy, walking with her, guys will give a second look at her, i confess to her that i love her after we being together for 3 months. She say she wanted to but she can't. I told her what is blocking our relationship and she say it's her part time job.<br><br>She need money to support her studies and end up she works in geylang. I am shock, speechless.. She cried and she told me she really love me.<br><br>Please guide me...<br><br>This 4 months, time spend with her we always on dutch and i am too poor to let her cheat...<br><br>I love her for who she is<br><br>Please advice...<br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Before you allow your emotions to overrun you, I suggest you read through what I have to say before you make any decision.<br><br>I) Her job isn't exactly glamorous, albeit you are able to accept it now, it is largely because of the intensity your Love (Uranus-fueled) has weaved, which caused you to overlook any negative aspect about her.<br><br>How certain are we to know that this is substantial and not transitory? Probably only God knows, before time would tell.<br><br>II) She mentioned that she has financial issue and had to sell her body in order to fund her school fee. But this completely contradicts her extravagant spending. There are two possible reasons: (1) there are things unknown/kept for you and I sense treachery. (2) Materialistic nature/Money hungry.<br><br>You may think that I am paranoid just because she works in this line; lemme tell you I used to know someone who prostitute for a living (don't ask me how I know her; everything is due to fate and affinity). And every woman who sells their body willingly have point II in their depressing tale.<br><br>How you thought of her is purely due to how she wants to portray to you. She is ambiguous and nobody else could confirm her abstruse background. This is an extremely high risk investment that could change your life. You are too poor for her to cheat? Or excuse to venture into this high risk instrument?<br><br>III) Your Love could accept her for who she is (I), and even stomach that sort of adverse risk (II), but how are you going to lead the relationship? Are you going to tell her to stop selling herself? Then who is going to fund her school fees (as claimed) and her sort of lifestyle?<br><br>If you are going to lead her to the 'path of enlightenment', how are you going to do that? This is RoHC (Relationship of Higher Complication) and Love itself is not suffice to do the dirty work for you.<br><br>Think carefully before you execute any decision. You make rash decisions, you live/die by it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
