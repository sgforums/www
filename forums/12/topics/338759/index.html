              <p>Have you forgiven yourself for whatever happened between the two of you?</p>
              <p>If you have answered "YES" to the above questions, then you are already in the correct mindset and READY to meet up with her.</p>
              <p>As long as you have forgiven her and yourself, you must understand that the ball is now in her hands. She needs to forgive you and herself for whatever happened in the past between the two of you.</p>
              <p>Don't worry too much about how she is still feeling towards you if you have already done your part and have already forgiven all those that need to be forgiven in order for you to move on with your lives.</p>
              <p>You cannot control how she have decided to perceive you based on the past, but you can show her how you perceived yourself in the present. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>i so agree with the bear! if u still want to keep this friendship.. dont be afraid to make the 1st move! <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">this isnt a matter of who give in to who 1st. its about who treasures this friendship more!</span></strong></span> if she dont appreciate that that u are making the 1st move(eg ignoring u/ fu yan u) dont be disheartened! try again when time has sort of washed of the misunderstanding/damage done. time heals all wounds right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but if she consistently dont appreciate ur moves.............................i suggest u reconsider keeping this friend of urs. obviously she doesnt treasure the friendship that the both of u shared. plus i think its not v healthy to have one party constantly making the effort to patch up and the other party not appreciating at all(UNLESS U DID SOME MAJOR DAMAGE TO THE OTHER PARTY LA) </p>
