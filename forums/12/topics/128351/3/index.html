It's all in the mindset of both parties... Somehow similar to your previous 'conversation' example, but just a different step and approach...<br><br>At which point she would be considered to be leading the other party on is really subjective.. It would also depends on how 'friendly' she is.... Her background culture and such... Some girls can hug guys just like that, like they're just hugging a normal friend... While others might just touch you CASUALLY... But judging from the past threads in AA, many people would often think of such more... Trying to read into 'body language' especially digging into personal biased belief.... These 'actions' CAN mean something or almost as easily means NOTHING...<br><br>To me, unless she strips in front of you, make sexual advances on you or is telling you directly in your face that she's interested in you... The other actions have the priviledge of remaining at a ZERO value.</div></blockquote>Yup i understand with what you say.But you have not experienced it real life with the same person to know whether the person is really interested with me.What you have written is just based on your opinion and you are not her and thus you do not know excatly why she did not give me her number.Anyway i thank you for ur opinion and even if i want to chase her also no use because i cannot meet her again.</div>
