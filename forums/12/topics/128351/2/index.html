Got fate would certainly meet again... No fate, meet a few more times also nothing would come out of it.... Got fate, maybe can be together... Can be together, doesn't necessarily means that both of you would be happily together..... That's life....<br><br>So sometimes when you think of her... Just a chat... Perhaps just a smile...? But it was just that moment.... How lovely can simplicity be....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
