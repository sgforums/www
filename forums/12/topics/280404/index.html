Mayb u both just hard to be togehter.. both also hot-tempered .. fire there , fire here..<br><br>A bit hard to be together if no one can be understanding or tolerate..<br><br>But honestly, TS, i think you should really control your temper if anything happened also.. for your ex, if shes what like u said, then its not right also.. but mayb she behaved like that cuz u behaved the same... then you think she behaved like that, so you think its the same..<br><br>Actually not to blame anyone also...<br>But u did promise to her not to yell again rite? Yea i know its hard to control... its been with you from birth till now.. habit is not that easy to change in one day..<br><br>Nvm let her go, right now.. just focus on how to upgrade yourself and your income or study .. its better that way, and also by that way, u'l begin to think mature. We all used to throw temper to anyone de la.. but when you grow older, you'll know whats right or wrong..<br><br>Let her alone liou.. mayb let you both chilled out and one day you both might be together again.<br><br>My friend be together with her ex again after 4 years separated lor..<br><br>Right now just focus la.. slowly u 'll realise your weakness..</div>
