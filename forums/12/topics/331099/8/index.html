              <p>i agree with this "Some never get over it and try to find back the child, but to no avail."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>read on chinese newspapers before also..parents sought the help of print media to search for their kid whom they abandon at childbirth cuz they can't afford to raise the kid etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And..vice versa..kids who are looking for their biogical parents..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>moreover..some foster parents might not allow the kids to look for their biogical parents also..</p>

              <p>Personally I am against abortion, only see it as a last option. But there must be a reason why she choose this rather than giving up the child for adoption. I just think we should respect her decision rather than saying it is easier for her to give birth to the baby and won't feel that much guilt.</p>
