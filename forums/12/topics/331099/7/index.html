              <p>"here are 2 main types of abortion procedure, depending on the gestation of the pregnancy</p>
              <ol>
              <li>For early pregnancies <strong>3 months (12 weeks) and below</strong>, the procedure is called <strong>vacuum aspiration</strong>.
                  This usually involves being put to sleep for about 10 minutes, during which time a small tube
                  is placed into the womb via the vagina. An attached vacuum will then remove all the pregnancy contents of the womb.</li>
              <li>For pregnancies <strong>3 to 6 months (13 to 24 weeks)</strong> , the procedure is known as Mid Trimester Pregnancy Termination (MTPT) which is a more complicated affair.
                  Hospitalisation is usually required for a day or two, during which medicine
                  is inserted into the vagina to induce natural expulsion of the pregnancy. After the
                  foetus and placenta are aborted, the process of evacuation of the womb
                  follows. This is basically the same procedure as used in <strong>vacuum aspiration</strong>;
                  it ensures that the womb contents have been thoroughly evacuated.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The second method takes a little longer and is messier, so it is far
              preferable that an early decision for abortion be made, before 3 months
              if possible."</p>
              <p>So better get her to go for it soon, still need to go for counselling de before the process can be completed...will delay more and more...</p>
              <p>Abortion is never 100% safe..there will be some risks involved no matter how early it is conducted cos you are messing with her body...</p>

              <p>The guy told her to go for abortion straight away &amp; she
              refused..She just told the guy that why should she go through the

              alone?</p>
              <p>The guy told the girl that his mother will not want the child

              fees..hence..he don't have the cash to get married either..</p>
              <p>The girl told the guy that since they created this trouble for
              themselves..shouldn't they share the responsibility tgt? The guy
              objected to the idea agressively &amp; even asked the girl if she's
              going to pay for all those fees (in maintaining the child) if they
              got married, as he doesn't have any savings at all..</p>
              <p>He kept co-ercing the girl to go for abortion in b/w the
              conversation..</p>
              <p>He even told the girl that if she wants to keep the child..so be
              it..and, that he will give a "monthly maintenance fee" for this
              child &amp; they shall go their separate ways from there..</p>
              <p>The girl requested to meet up with the guy to have a chat...the
              guy told her : "what's the point of meeting up when he has already
              made up his mind?..since there's nth to talk abt..we just break up
              over the phone immediately..."</p>
              <p>he even blames the girl for calling him up to tell him about
              this issue as he was out for a gathering with his friends..</p>
              <p>he even said : "that's y..i hate answering calls in the middle
              of an outing..."</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>what kind of f**king attitude is that?..make her pregnant &amp;
              run away? is that the kind of responsible SG guy that exist
              nowadays?..should the girl really go for abortion &amp; start
              afresh? both of them are in their mid 20s..</p>

              <p>Abortion just needs around 3k at most to settle the problem once and for all. But caring for a child is a lifetime responsibility. Not that I am advocating abortion, but a lot of things need to be considered before bringing the child to the world.</p>
