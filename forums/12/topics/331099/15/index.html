              <p>1. I admit, she could be so blinded by love she becomes stupid temporarily and agreed to abort the child so that the guy can continue to be with her (this is proven through what she told her friend, xiaostarry)</p>
              <p>2. Even if she knows that the child belongs to the guy, it is hard to prove when the baby is still inside her womb. There will always be people like you who will assume that the baby belongs to someone else until it is born and a DNA test is carried out.</p>
              <p>3. Too many legal complications. Will definitely need to let her parents know, which is something she doesn't want (I admit this is yet another silly thing). Plus might need to hire lawyers to fight it out and once all this happens, she can forget about staying together with the guy, which leads back to point number 1 again.</p>

              <p>Adding up all the plausible suggestions the girl can do within these 15 pages how much can one girl do it all alone without mentally breaking down?</p>
              <p>That is also the reason why I didn't sue my ex for maintenance and I know of another divorcee with kid who don't too. It depends on the attitude of the fathers really. If they're really irresponsible and you're time and money-strapped, they know they can get away from it all. And even if you do want to go after them, they'll just play along with you until they wear you out.</p>
