              <p>Er... actually I had no money to go shopping then, and for a period of three months right after my confinement, I survived on one meal a day while watching my colleagues going out for lunch. I had a nanny to take care of my baby overnight then so I don't have the hassle of minding my baby while doing chores. That said, I don't get to see my baby everyday either. Maybe all that working so hard, having no life nor friends nor ample money, nor time to relax and bond gets to me and that is why I only managed to start to want to bond with my child only after several years. The threat of wanting to harm my baby when he was a crying infant was very real and I'm glad that I've not succumbed to that even though I felt very down and blue.</p>
              <p>As for clothes, my nanny had been very helpful and I'm glad that she's helped out so much and is trust-worthy. She had also help out to source for new places when my tenants told me I'd need to move out due to so and so circumstances (My tenants are people like gamblers and there was this one particular tenant who is a "PRO", came home late at night and at times I heard her husband bashing her). Without her, I do not think it is possible for me to survive till today.</p>

              <p>crimson, things aren't usually as easy as it seems most of the time. Life's like that, formed up by an intricate web of infinite number of factors that we have to take into account. It's not easy to bring up a child really. Being a single mum isn't that easy. The financial burden is a lot easier to manage compared to all the other things that a single mum and her child has to face. That itself  is frightening considering that the financial part isn't very easy too.</p>
              <p>No matter what the girl's decision is we have to respect it. I believe none of us can actually fully understand the turmoil that she is going through at the moment. No matter what her decision is, it would be a very hard one for her to make. Whether abortion or not, it would certainly leave her scarred deeply in her heart. What she needs now is her friends and certainly her parents need to know about this so that they can all stand by her. What she needs most now is understanding and support now.</p>
              <p>If she decides to abort her baby, we shouldn't criticise her for that. Do you think she want it? No. It may be partly her fault that she is in this dilemma now but don't you feel that she has already suffered much and do not deserve any more unfair fingers pointing at her. A mother always has a very special connection between her and her child even when he is still not born yet. This bond is forged at the moment this little life is created. We won't feel the pain that she has to go through if she has to go through the abortion. It is like giving out the decree for the killing of her own child. Who hurts the most if she goes through the abortion? Her. We as bystanders can't even imagine the pain and what rights do we have to criticise upon her actions? Which mother in her right mum would ever want to harm their own child?</p>
              <p>Abortion may be the taking of an innocent life but life isn't as simple as A,B,C. There are far too many factors to take into account.</p>
              <p>Whatever the decision the girl makes, i'll support her.</p>

              <p><br>I hope I have terribly miscomprehend your messgae. With this 30K ring crusade, you are not only going to filter the wrong guys. You are also inviting the wrong men into your life. I have friends who can easily afford the 30K ring for their gf but choosed not to. Because such girls are nothing more than a materialistic girl who gauge feelings with wealth. Stays in a owned landed property with no loan, easily afford an Audi TT, works as a senior manager in a bank in Raffles Place and in his 30s. We hang out together on motorbike outings and I sometimes feel weird as he is not able to 'get attached'. It was only later when we got closer in the brethrenhood that he revealed he reluctance to get involved in a relationship. Most of the girls he has got attached to were only with him because of his stable career. The girls were unwilling to share the burden of caring for his sick parents, minded the fact that his dad is a cancer strickened patient and he'd much prefer a family member to care for him rather an employed nurse. Anyway, his dad has passed away and he has never regretted his decision to stay single all these years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are plenty of men I know out there dumped by girls who found them too poor. Too lowly educated. Not presentable as a trophy bf. etc etc... Sometimes my heart goes out to these men while they frantically try to please they hard to please gf. Splurging their pay on something with only aesthetic value for their gf. Absolutely an icon of folly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Surrounded by the surrealism of 'love'... They think they will make their gf love them more. But little did they know they were being treated as a spare tyre.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No doubt, I know there are guys who goes around playing with feelings. I have even accompanied one guy to visit 3 girls in one night. Little did I know he was using me as a form of shield in case the girls' brothers or friends beat him up. All 3 were impregnated by him. And all 3 were visited in one night in order to make a settlement. An utter jerk.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But do take into consideration for some of the guys out there who are truely interested in looking for a relationship and love. Even though they can only afford a $300 ring.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Different girls/guys have different expectations for their partners, because they can afford to demand / or provide for their partners.</p>
              <p>A poor guy may want to find true love with a girl for $300 ring. But if the same guy strikes lottery and won $30 million dollars, then he would like to give the girl a ring that is worth more than $300 just because he is able to afford it after winning his lottery.</p>
              <p>We have to understand that nobody is the same in this world, and to be able to find someone who shares the similar values, expectations would be a very good reason for people to get together and get married.</p>
              <p>So I wish whichever guys out there that are looking for their love to make sure that they find the girl that shares the same values, expectations as them in their lives, before declaring that she is the one for him.  <img src="http://www.sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>4) what do you define as "little luxury"? most families are alr very spartan with what they get for babies, since it is impractical to buy any unnecessary items for a baby, as a baby outgrows everything quickly.</p>
              <p>5) you think you want baby clothes, you can confirm get them meh? baby clothes of fitting size and gender may not be readily available when you need them. also, where in singapore can you still find 5 for $10 baby clothes?</p>
              <p>6)  not all parents are free to look after their grandchild, esp if the mother is young and the grandparents are still working. also, childcare center dun care for infants so young.</p>
              <p>7) you are saying that you can feed solid food to a month-old infant? as i last recall, 1 month old babies still take milk, breast milk or formula. formula milk is definitely not cheap. not all mothers are able to breast fed either, so formula milk will have to come in at some point of time.</p>

              <p>Whether TS's fren chooses to abort, give birth and raise herself or send for adoption, it's really up to her.</p>
              <p>Whichever way she chooses, she does need the strength and willpower to get through it.</p>
              <p>But, there is a possibility that giving birth and raising on her own is much harder than d other two options.</p>
              <p>Abortion - it's painful and torturing initially, but time does heal wounds; I have gal friends who went thru a down period for a period of time only, thereafter, they were pretty ok.<br><br>Adoption - So far, I haven't had a fren who sent her child for adoption, but I have been to the female shelter for gals who live there till labour and will be sending their kids for adoption. Counselling will be provided to the gals to cope, and will be carried on till they are more able to accept and live on. I went there with a friend who was planning on living there until her bf (now hubby) fetch her back home and married her.<br><br>Raising on her own - Finance is a big factor, along with emotional support. But, to face a child whose father had left both the mother and child is never easy; at times it can be a constant reminder of how the father left the gal. Things sometimes are made worst if the child's appearance resembles the father. It really depends a lot on the gal's determination and willpower.<br><br>Just some cost factors:</p>
              <p>Raising a baby in sg may not be easy, but it may not be hard either. It depends on hpw much one is willing to sacrifice.<br><br>Good cots can be purchased at 80 plus; while a branded one may cost hundreds. A child doesn't need a good one, as long as the cot is play safe, sleep safe.<br><br>Babies grow very fast; clothes should be minimal at the initial stage to prevent 'wastage'; at most have to wash pretty frequently.<br><br>Diapers can be used in the nights, so as to save costs; cloth ones can be used in the daytime. There are even diaper liners to line the cloth so as make washing easier; e.g. if the baby poo, the stain will be mostly on the liner, rather than on the cloth diaper. Liners can be thrown away or re-used after washing. Liners are sold in 100s per box, price is less than 10, I think it's a few dollars.<br><br>Washing can be done when the baby is sleeping.<br><br>There are day care centres who take care of babies, alternatively, nannies are also available. Day care centres normally offer cheaper pricing to working mothers, while for nannies, a monthly salary of roughly 600 - 700 SGD.<br><br>I have a friend who asks her neighbour for help; her neighbour upon seeing her situation, agrees to help at 150 SGD a month.<br><br>Milk - If adhere by nutritious meals etc, a mother can give breast milk up to at least 6 months - saving on milk powder. At 8 months, the baby can take liquid food like porridge and fish slices; but have to be cooked till they are very soft and easily digestiable.</p>
              <p>Stuff like stroller, toys etc - there are always cheap ones out there, just depends on whether one is willing to look.<br><br>Alternative finance, there are always helplines and organisations to turn to for counselling, help on single parents who have chilldren before marriage and also finance.<br><br>For schooling, schools don't stop or blacklist children born in single families, even if the parents are not married. Every child enlisted is given the same opportunity.<br><br>A baby is for life, as a parent, we will always worry about our kids, it's a long term commitment. But, watching your own kid grows up, is an enjoyment, a type of fulfilment, especially after they learnt to talk, their first word of 'Mummy', their first step, their first tooth etc.<br><br>Pros and Cons of each option i.e. abortion, adoption, raise on her own, available should be weighed; there's no re-winding back. No regrets on the decision made.</p>
              <p>Single mothers won't be exactly looked down upon, more on gossip.<br><br>But, a fact does hold, a single mother who braved through things is definitely respected; I saw it from a fren; anyone who knows her, before her pregnancy or after, respects her for what she did. It's true she does send tongues wagging at times, but to choose this path, is her decision, she said she never regretted it; if time goes back, she will make the same decision again. <br><br>Maybe getting married is not an easy task, but as I mentioned in my previous post here, there are still guys who goes after these single mothers, and can even get along well with the kids. <br><br>Many friends chose abortion, partly cos of finance, but the major reasons are actually they aren't able to get thru the possibilities of many things. Many things like tongues wagging, finger pointing, ppl whispering when they walk past with their kids, the possibility of no guy wanting them, the possibility of being tied down by a child, the possibility of losing their social life etc. <br><br>To be a single mum, be prepared, one has to learn not to be too disturbed by what others said, and stand by your decision that raising the child is a decision one will never regret.<br><br>Quote a friend's saying, we asked her if she ever regretted her decision, especially when she missed out a few good guys along the way:<br><br>"It is my responsibility to give birth and raise my child. The father may have backed out and abandon this child, but that doesn't mean I have to be the same as him. I have to bear the consequences, maybe I won't be a perfect mother, but I will always try my best to give my child the best. In others' eyes, it  may not be the best, but it doesn't matter, as long as my child understands that I have done my best."<br> <br> She gave birth at the age of 19 when she was still a student, she gave up all her social life, for those who didn't know, thought she was being anti-social, but she rather spend her money on her baby than to go out with friends for dinner, movie etc. In terms of maturity, I guess I can only put it as 'Circumstances have forced her to grow up.'<br><br>Her family was conservative, but she 'fought' her way thru.<br><br>She was just a student at that time, financial wasn't good in her family as well. She had to juggle between part time work and school. Her determination to provide for her child actually posed as a strength for her to get thru things. The child, is in actual fact, her source of strength, rather than a 'burden' in her life.<br><br>Actually, I wrote so much, there's only a point to bring across:<br><br>If one has the determination to go thru, one will definitely be able to. But if one is easily or can be 'disturbed' by outside factors, then that person may have a lower chance to get thru.</p>
              <p>Whichever path that TS's fren chooses, it's her decision; as long as she doesn't regret. For most things in life, there's no turning back. The day one chose a path, the day one should have made a weightage of the pros and cons and the consequences laying before them, especially when the decision does involve a life.<br><br>Actually, to put it more bluntly, we can be arguing here about the issue to abort or not to, to send for adoption or raise on one's own, ultimately, the decision is still TS's friend's. <br><br>I guess the forumers who posted here, just hope that TS's fren can make a decision she won't regret, and that whatever path she chooses, things do turn out well for her.<br> <br>Besides, as for 'starting afresh' with the guy, a last chance thing, I do have friends who start afresh after abortion with the same guy and are now happily married with kids, but these type of situations are slimmer in chance as compared to 'things don't turn out well'.</p>

              <p>Nobody here is saying abortion is child's play and nobody's saying it's the convenient option in every single case. People on both sides don't like it and agree that prevention is better than cure.</p>
              <p>But we have to realise the varied instances when abortion is a much wiser move. Cases of women being raped, should they conceive anyway beause if they don't, they are erm, 'murderers'?</p>
              <p>What about the mother, isn't she human too with the right to choose? You want to prolong her trauma by 9 more months and possibly marr the rest of her life just because you <em>think</em> abortion is murder. Some forumers need to take a step back and review their sweeping remarks and utopian views on the girl's plight.</p>

              <p><br>ok =D</p>
              <p>just login back this morning &amp; read one of the comment that u left "crimsontactics has said that she deserved to be teased. I want to know, if someone really deserved to be teased" &gt;&gt; so true..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that's why i mentioned in the previous posts that he is haughty &amp; thinks that he is Mr Know It All.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Save those sarcastic &amp; snide remarks to yourself if you haven't gone through it. Be sympathetic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U mentioned that you are a single mum..How did you react to those gossips? Ignore? It confirm must be very tough bah..Imagine everyone bad mouthing abt you behind ur back...</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">~crimsontactics has said that she deserved to be teased. I want to know, if someone really deserved to be teased just because all she's trying to do is to attempt hard to find a love she can rely on albeit in misguided way (no one in her family taught her how, but instead berate her for all her mistakes big and small and ignore her when she needs their presence), got misled by a guy who thinks more for himself than her welfare (even though he will be telling her he loves her etc things that she NEEDS so badly because her family has not been able to provide for her this emotional safety), because all along she has not been cherished, loved and looked after?~</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">First of all, I want to highlight that the social stigma which is connected to pre-marriage pregnancy had been in our society for generations. I'm sure that the couples, especially the lady, should be fully aware and prepared of the outcome of their actions.</span></p>
              <p>Secondly, I'm sure that the lady, being 25, should be mature enough to differentiate between love and sex. You don't give sex to gain love, neither the other way around. Both of these two aspects are of a different calibre. They don't work together before marriage. So from your argument, are you telling me that just because she is foolish enough to give her body to her bf in exchange for attention, she is totally innocent? Shouldn't she be at fault too for the lack of sexual discipline? Isn't piaking before marriage considered cheap? And where are the protections? Ask these questions to yourself 1st. Misjudging is your own fault, so does being foolishly lured into doing something.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, she even got the guts to consider abortion. What do you think she is? God? Having fun at the sake of another's life? This is Sg my friend. The government have been actively promoting married couples to have babies. I don't believe that she will not be able to bring up her child in this country, though it would be a tough struggle. Purposing abortion as a solution is hanging a "TEASE ME" sign around her neck. So shouldn't she be teased?</p>
              <p>There is no free lunches in this world, everything have a price. Want to play, better pay.</p>

              <p>Ever heard of Maia Lee? Famous single mum in SG..Are you really unaware of what some ppl commented abt her? For being a single mum? And, how she got herself pregnant again?</p>

              <p>If you want to be your holy priest..just go..EH wait..since you are such a holy person..perhaps..you can start up some kind of foundation to provide for single mum =) In that way, you can earn all the RESPECT that you want =)</p>

              <p><br>consider yourself to be in the shoes of the child. would you want to grow up in a broken family, plagued by poverty, not being able to live the life of an otherwise normal child?</p>
              <p>there are cases where the children themselves blamed their parents for bringing them into the world and yet unable to provide for them.</p>
              <p>yes, simply living is a blessing, but do you want to live a life of agony? é•¿ç—›ä¸�å¦‚çŸ­ç—›.</p>
              <p>yes, these children may grow up to contribute to the society in some ways, but their potential to contribute is hindered by their backgrounds. if the mother is from a well to do family and can afford to keep the child, so be it. but what about those single mothers who <strong>cannot afford</strong>  to keep the child? they would barely eke out a subsistence if the mother decides to go ahead and bring the child into the world, to suffer along with her.</p>
              <p>in the developing countries, like india and china, most of these sort of children will fall into position of abuse, due to their fanancial backgrounds. girls are exploited in the sex trade while young boys are made to work long hours in sweatshops which involve child labour. e.g. the carpet weaving industry in Turkey, India etc.</p>
              <p>while that sort of extreme scenario may not happen in singapore, it is highly likely that children with single mothers grow up under negative peer influence. Drugs abuse and gangsterism are serious youth issues in singapore. As the mother is the only one supporting the family, the child may be left unsupervised most of the time. thats where you start to see youth loiter around in void decks, arcades, at hdb stairwells sniffing glue etc.</p>
              <p>isn't it better to spare all these from a child? if anyone really want a child, they should at least set up a family, provide a decent background for the child. provide the best opportunities they could for their child.</p>
              <p>if the single mum goes for abortion, she stands to have a higher chance to remarry and have a child with a normal family with both father and mother intact. that, i think is THE way to bring up a child.</p>
