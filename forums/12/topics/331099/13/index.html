              <p>"End of the day, TS's fren has to ask herself, which path can she be more able to adapt and accept? Which path is she more able to face herself more truely?" &gt;&gt; she has already chosen her path..which is Plan A..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She is the one who has got to bear responsbility irregardless of whatever decision that she made..So instead of passing snide remarks to her decision..why not just respect her decision?..(I am referring to "holypriest" &amp; another person")</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cuz she is the one who knows for sure if she have the time to bring up the kid (what's the use of dumping the kid to a nanny after you give birth to him/her while you work)..if she have the financial ability to pay for the child's basic neccessities? Education? And, the amount of $$ to be spent doesn't just stop here...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For Maia's case..yah..she can take the remarks..but my friend knows that she can't..what if she suffers from depression becuz of this? How is she going to even take care of the kids?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Abortion is also an alternative for women should they know that they don't have the means to bring up a kid in the 1st place. Why bring the kid to this world to suffer?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think of it this way : The girl gives birth to the kid..Suffers from depression..Commits suicide..What's gonna happen to the kid?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The girl gives birth to the kid..Suffers from depression..She's not in the right mental mind to take care of herself..Moreover for the kid?</p>
              <p><br>"there is a rise in single mums nowadays" &gt;&gt; I agree with this. But, the main issue still boils down to : There's still prejudice to single mums till this date</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It all bowls down to how the child is being brought up." &gt;&gt; Provided the mum has to have time to guide the child. For this case, she can only leave the child with the nanny (another finance prob also) or leave it in childcare? (yet another financial issue)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It still comes back to the initial point : She knows that she don't have the means to take good care of the kid..Be it financially or mentally..So..She opt for Plan A..Which is deemed as the best alternative (For herself)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another impt factor to look into will be her kid's emotional feelings.. how will him/her feels when they are older?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Child : "Am I detestable? Why did Daddy abandon me since young?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some of you might said that my friend deserves all the tongue wagging..but what abt the child? Have anyone stop to think of the gossips that the child have to suffer when he/she grows up? Think of the emotional turmoil that they have to go through?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, like what some of you commented..she should take responsbility for what she did. She is doing that now..So respect her own decision &amp; stop passing lame remarks..Esp "HOLY PRIEST" who commented that she is cheap or whatever..What makes you think that you are really that saint?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And also to gigabyte (YES..i am pointing out the names directly now)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Precisely is tongue waggers like you who made these women fear..Gossipers who pass random remarks..Who think that they are Know-It-All..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Emphatize with people..And, NO ONE is a saint..Unless you truly NEVER EVER made a single mistake in life..ALL human err..it just boils down to how great the sin is..</p>

              <p>If she don't even have the willpower to stand up against the gossips and lead a meaningful life, even after the abortion she is bound to end up as a failure. Cause gossips will be there no matter if you were to abort or not.</p>

              to face herself more truely?" &gt;&gt; she has already chosen her
              path..which is Plan A..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She is the one who has got to bear responsbility irregardless of
              whatever decision that she made..So instead of passing snide
              remarks to her decision..why not just respect her decision?..(I am
              referring to "holypriest" &amp; another person")</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cuz she is the one who knows for sure if she have the time to
              bring up the kid (what's the use of dumping the kid to a nanny
              after you give birth to him/her while you work)..if she have the
              financial ability to pay for the child's basic neccessities?
              Education? And, the amount of $$ to be spent doesn't just stop
              here...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For Maia's case..yah..she can take the remarks..but my friend
              knows that she can't..what if she suffers from depression becuz of
              this? How is she going to even take care of the kids?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Abortion is also an alternative for women should they know that
              they don't have the means to bring up a kid in the 1st place. Why
              bring the kid to this world to suffer?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think of it this way : The girl gives birth to the kid..Suffers
              from depression..Commits suicide..What's gonna happen to the
              kid?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The girl gives birth to the kid..Suffers from depression..She's
              not in the right mental mind to take care of herself..Moreover for
              the kid?</p>
              <p><br> "there is a rise in single mums nowadays" &gt;&gt; I agree with
              this. But, the main issue still boils down to : There's still
              prejudice to single mums till this date</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"It all bowls down to how the child is being brought up."
              &gt;&gt; Provided the mum has to have time to guide the child. For
              this case, she can only leave the child with the nanny (another
              finance prob also) or leave it in childcare? (yet another financial
              issue)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It still comes back to the initial point : She knows that she
              don't have the means to take good care of the kid..Be it
              financially or mentally..So..She opt for Plan A..Which is deemed as
              the best alternative (For herself)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another impt factor to look into will be her kid's
              emotional feelings.. how will him/her feels when
              they are older?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Child : "Am I detestable? Why did Daddy abandon me since
              young?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some of you might said that my friend deserves all the tongue
              wagging..but what abt the child? Have anyone stop to think of the
              gossips that the child have to suffer when he/she grows up? Think
              of the emotional turmoil that they have to go through?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, like what some of you commented..she should take
              responsbility for what she did. She is doing that now..So respect
              her own decision &amp; stop passing lame remarks..Esp "HOLY PRIEST"
              who commented that she is cheap or whatever..What makes you think
              that you are really that saint?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And also to gigabyte (YES..i am pointing out the names directly
              now)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Precisely is tongue waggers like you who made these women
              fear..Gossipers who pass random remarks..Who think that they are
              Know-It-All..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Emphatize with people..And, NO ONE is a saint..Unless you truly
              NEVER EVER made a single mistake in life..ALL human err..it just
              boils down to how great the sin is..</p>

              <p>Jus wanna highlight a few things.<br> <br> Apologies; couldn't help pointing out some things.</p>
              <p>There is a 'foundation' for single mums - not exactly a
              financial assistance kinda thing, but more towards emotional
              support. It was formed by a single mum herself. Being a single mum,
              finance is a factor, but not as big as compared to emotional
              support.<br> <br> It's true that Maia Lee got bombarded when news were released that
              she is a single mum and that she was pregnant again.</p>
              <p>But as I have mentioned before, the day one decided to be a
              single mum, one has to kinda be 'immune' to verbal abuse. It's a
              tough route, but one has to have the determination to go thru
              it.<br> <br> From what I know, Maia Lee wasn't much affected by the 'verbal
              abuse'. Even if she was, she did manage to get over it.<br> <br> My guess - abortion was introduced initially not as an option for
              gals to use when they are pregnant and didn't want to give birth,
              it may be more towards cases where the baby has been diagnosed with
              health problems or in cases where the gal's health is not good
              enough to carry the baby to full term. In a way, SG does discourage
              abortion, else there won't be a neceeesity to undergo counselling
              and a video screening session.<br> <br> Single mum - one who is divorced but with a kid is viewed
              differently from one who has never married but has a kid.<br> <br> The latter is being judged far more worse than the former.<br> <br> It can't be a definite answer that SG cannot accept single mums -
              in fact, according to statistics, there is a rise in single mums
              nowadays - but be it divorcees or real single mums, I can't
              ascertain - apologies.<br> <br> When this thread was started, there are bound to be ppl who support
              and ppl who don't and some who will react very strongly.<br> <br> Different individual views things differently, whatever their point
              is, end of the day, to put it bluntly, it will be TS's fren to face
              the harsh facts of to abort or not to. She has to face the
              consequences herself.<br> <br> But, although finance is a factor, it's not a major one, the major
              issues are stated in my previous post.<br> <br> I have seen kids in poor family conditions, but they are very
              sensible. They appreciate all that the mum did.<br> <br> It all bowls down to how the child is being brought up.<br> <br> There's no right or wrong here; it's more of a decision of one's
              own.<br> <br> We make decisions in everyday of our life, minor ones, major ones.
              But whatever the decision may be, stick by it and no regrets.<br> <br> In a way, if a gal wants to get married, wants a life of her own,
              doesn't want to make sacrifices, not able to face 'verbal abuse',
              tongues wagging, finger pointing - it's a high chance abortion is
              chosen.<br> <br> It's not always true that children born in proper families will
              turn out better; in my line of work, I have seen abuse by fathers
              to the extend that the kids contained a deep hatred towards their
              own fathers. To them, the fathers don't exist.<br> <br> I have seen too, how children from single parent families are
              sensible, independent etc.<br> <br> Most posts are, somehow all general comments, perception etc; no
              right or wrong.<br> <br> End of the day, TS's fren has to ask herself, which path can she be
              more able to adapt and accept? Which path is she more able to face
              herself more truely?<br></p>

              <p>&gt;&gt; YouDontKnowMe did mention in one of her posts
                      that she have to go through the gossip period..That's 1 real life

                      affirmed that there are no gossips on single mums at
                      all?</p>

              <p>Tongue waggers are all around. Anyone here can talk freely
                      as this situation does not happen to them. Just like some of
                      the forumers here..can call her "cheap" etc..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or have no one ever saw any forum threads on Maia Lee
                      before? Or did no one else saw the newspaper reports
                      before? People commenting on her tattoos..her status as single

              <p>If she don't even have the willpower to stand up against the gossips and lead a meaningful life, even after the abortion she is bound to end up as a failure. Cause gossips will be there no matter if you were to abort or not.</p>
