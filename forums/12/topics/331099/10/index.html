              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">~crimsontactics has said that she
              deserved to be teased. I want to know, if someone really deserved
              to be teased just because all she's trying to do is to attempt hard
              to find a love she can rely on albeit in misguided way (no one in
              her family taught her how, but instead berate her for all her
              mistakes big and small and ignore her when she needs their
              presence), got misled by a guy who thinks more for himself than her
              welfare (even though he will be telling her he loves her etc things
              that she NEEDS so badly because her family has not been able to
              provide for her this emotional safety), because all along she has
              not been cherished, loved and looked after?~</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">First of all, I want to highlight
              that the social stigma which is connected to pre-marriage pregnancy
              had been in our society for generations. I'm sure that the couples,
              especially the lady, should be fully aware and prepared of the
              outcome of their actions.</span></p>
              <p>Secondly, I'm sure that the lady, being 25, should be mature
              enough to differentiate between love and sex. You don't give sex to
              gain love, neither the other way around. Both of these two aspects
              are of a different calibre. They don't work together before
              marriage. So from your argument, are you telling me that just
              because she is foolish enough to give her body to her bf in
              exchange for attention, she is totally innocent? Shouldn't she be
              at fault too for the lack of sexual discipline? Isn't piaking
              before marriage considered cheap? And where are the protections?
              Ask these questions to yourself 1st. Misjudging is your own fault,
              so does being foolishly lured into doing something.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, she even got the guts to consider abortion. What do you
              think she is? God? Having fun at the sake of another's life? This
              is Sg my friend. The government have been actively promoting
              married couples to have babies. I don't believe that she will not
              be able to bring up her child in this country, though it would be a
              tough struggle. Purposing abortion as a solution is hanging a
              "TEASE ME" sign around her neck. So shouldn't she be teased?</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Then who are you? God? Because you can just judge her as cheap simply because she has premarital sex? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>It is not totally her fault that she became pregnant, cannot rule out that the guy is responsible too. Some girls find it hard to differentiate between love and sex, for us both of them are the same and she might believe that her bf thinks the same way as well. So shouldn't the guy be responsible as well for misleading her?</p>
              <p>The government has been campaigning for MARRIED women to get pregnant, but unwedded mums are still very much looked down upon. So you can't use this to say since government is encouraging women to get pregnant and give birth, she should also do the same, irregardless of her situation. In my opinion, it is even more cruel to bring forth a child when you are not ready to do so, esp when you do not want him to begin with.</p>
              <p>I know of people who are passionately against abortion when they were
              not pregnant, but the moment they did, the first thing they did was to
              book an abortion appointment with the nearest clinic.</p>

              <p>Yes, i agreed. By getting pregnant she is already suffering from the consequences of her action. So if she brings her child into the world, then ppl like him will still view her as cheap and ought to be teased. It is them who caused unwedded moms-to-be to think twice about carrying to full terms.</p>

              <p>Thank you for responding to my take on this matter crimsontactics <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Like I said, I am a single mother myself. I have chosen not to abort my baby and am glad that I didn't because he has turned out to be such a wonderful bright child. That is not to say that things have been rosy. There is some long period of years whereby I couldn't connect with my child at all due to some subconscious resentment that I feel of him. I couldn't play with him, couldn't bear to talk to him, and even habour the thought of harming him. And whenever feelings of love start to well up within me for him, pangs of guilt would strike me as I did habour the thoughts of aborting him and that killed off pretty much any love I could have used to bond with him. It has taken me a long while to accept all of my feelings and to realize instead of denying my own feelings which caused me more grief, it is more helpful to acknowledge my pains and to work on them.</p>
              <p>I have married the child's dad and have divorce him in the end. He was never responsible even though he actually SEEMS like a responsible, caring guy at first. How shall I put it, it is something like getting a person to try out a new flavour of coka cola when in reality it's actually a drug. You get unknowingly hooked in the end even though drug-taking is not your intention. To date, he never pays his maintenance and just going through divorce is hell for me enough. I could sue him for this of course, but factor in the paper work, agony and time, it's just plain not worth it. What about all the time he has painted in the young impressionable child's mind that you're the bad guy when in actual fact you've been doing all you could to keep the family afloat? What about him fighting for the child's custody when you know he's simply not equipped to support the child? You know you need to deal with living expenses as well as the well-being of your child, and to fend off this guy and his tactics. Nope, family's not been giving any support. I'd be thankful if there's no drama that'd cause me further grief or to deal with tantrums from my child due to such chaotic circumstances as well as that of my own.</p>
              <p>As to the issue of age, the more I've come into contact with people, the more I realize that it's a subjective issue. Some young people can be very mature and some older ones can be very childish. What about family background and education and support from family and loved ones? What if you have very little of them all or worse, none? Let me give an example so that it is easier to picture. Everyone knows disability right? Example, someone who has lost a leg would find it very difficult to walk. That is clearly obvious to everyone as everyone can see that he has lost a leg. But what about emotional disability? What if this lady had not been emotionally equipped to handle what life has dished out to her? Emotional disability is something that is not easily visible to the eye. I'm not saying that she should not be accountable for her actions, but what I'm saying is that not everybody has the awareness of what is right and wrong straight away and perhaps it takes time and supportive friends to show her that. Just like there are still unfortunate children and people out there in poorer parts of the world and they don't choose to want to grow up there. Everybody needs a chance.</p>
              <p>She thinks about abortion because there is such a thing as abortion in this world. The media has been talking about it, it's in the newspaper, magazine, radio and well, even here, we're talking about it. Who can don't even think about it? Picture a piece of yellow lemon in your mind. See yourself sinking your teeth into it, eating it and drinking all that sour lemon juice. Now stop thinking about how sour is that lemon, forget about the lemon now. Are we able to do it?</p>
              <p>I believe, it is not her intention to want to abort a life or not. No
              girls go out with a guy with the picture of abortion in case if there
              is a baby. Maybe you could say it's a lack of maturity to think far,
              but I would rather put it as her current priority then is to seek love.
              It's like a kind stranger giving you food after you've been starved for
              3 days while lost in a jungle during military training. When you are
              that hungry and thirsty, what are the chances that you would pause to
              debate whether the food is poisonous or not before eating and
              especially when the stranger looks like a kind, genteel and vulnerable
              old auntie?</p>

              simply because she has premarital sex? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>It is not totally her fault that she became pregnant, cannot
              rule out that the guy is responsible too. Some girls find it hard
              to differentiate between love and sex, for us both of them are the
              same and she might believe that her bf thinks the same way as well.
              So shouldn't the guy be responsible as well for misleading her?</p>
              <p>The government has been campaigning for MARRIED women to get
              pregnant, but unwedded mums are still very much looked down upon.
              So you can't use this to say since government is encouraging women
              to get pregnant and give birth, she should also do the same,
              irregardless of her situation. In my opinion, it is even more cruel
              to bring forth a child when you are not ready to do so, esp when
              you do not want him to begin with.</p>
              <p>I know of people who are passionately against abortion when they
              were not pregnant, but the moment they did, the first thing they
              did was to book an abortion appointment with the nearest
              clinic.</p>

              <p>Those people are have a weak mentality and are easily swayed in the face of problem.</p>
              <p>The government wants people to have more children IF they could afford it. Apparantly she seems to be financially unstable, thus i don't think she fall into this category. Unwedded moms are being looked down upon is due to our Asian culture and also due to the fact that many are so irresponsible to seek abortion as a way out.</p>
              <p>Its not totally her fault. I agree with you. But is she fault-free? Shouldn't a lady of 25 have some form of sexual discipline, like I've mentioned earlier? Being misled shows that she is not mature enough to have a child, yet she had one and planned to have an abortion. Does this shows that she is totally innocent?</p>
              <p>I'm not God. However,  i judged her to be cheap because she had premarital sex which she can't afford to have, had a baby and planned to abort it. Thats why she is cheap.</p>

              <p>abortion is the best choice to a pre-marital pregnancy, provided if the guy did not marry the girl. (even a short term marriage would do).</p>
              <p>if the guy agrees to marry the girl, and give legitimacy to the birth of the child, it would be better for both the child and mother. they would not have to suffer from gossips e.g. "the child is born out of wedlock", " the mother is a loose woman" etc.</p>
              <p>but in the above case, where, the guy refuses to marry the girl, the next best alternative is abortion, instead of adoption. yes, you may save a "soon-to-become-a-living-being" by not going for abortion, but do you want  the child to be condemn to gossips about his or her backgrounds for the rest of his or her life?</p>
              <p>the child will be scarred and branded before he/she even steps out into the world. our society isn't very forgiving towards this sort of pre-marital pregnancy, nor are we very tolerant of it, being an Asian country. Spare the child this cruelty.</p>
              <p>also, it is also noted that children from single parent families do fare lower is life as compared to individuals from complete families. in addition, having a child with you also effectively lowers the girl's chances of remarrying and getting a new life. it would ruin her hope of having a happy family.</p>
              <p>as for adoption, it is cruel for both the child and the mother. the child would most likely grow up hating his mother for giving him away, and on the other hand, the mother would most likely regret her choice of giving up her child. When you put up a child for adoption, you can't take him back even if you want to. do you want to suffer the angst of parting with your child, and living knowing that he may never get to know you, or worst still, hate you for giving him away?</p>
              <p>and regarding the definition of life, how do you define life? does a clump of cells, the fertilise embryo, counts as life? note: embryo =/= foetus.</p>
              <p>if some clumps of cells count as life, so do you call eggs and sperms "half-a-life"? so do all those wanking guys out there, are they killing millions of "lives" whenever they masturbate? or are women killing a potential life when they go thru menses every month? and with cloning technology, even your skin cells can be made into a clone of you. so do you classify your skin cells as separate "lives"?</p>
              <p>clearly, life does not begin upon conceiving. and to clarify, i am against abortion after the first trimester.</p>

              crimsontactics <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>Like I said, I am a single mother myself. I have chosen not to
              abort my baby and am glad that I didn't because he has turned out
              to be such a wonderful bright child. That is not to say that things
              have been rosy. There is some long period of years whereby I
              couldn't connect with my child at all due to some subconscious
              resentment that I feel of him. I couldn't play with him, couldn't
              bear to talk to him, and even habour the thought of harming him.
              And whenever feelings of love start to well up within me for him,
              pangs of guilt would strike me as I did habour the thoughts of
              aborting him and that killed off pretty much any love I could have
              used to bond with him. It has taken me a long while to accept all
              of my feelings and to realize instead of denying my own feelings
              which caused me more grief, it is more helpful to acknowledge my
              pains and to work on them.</p>
              <p>I have married the child's dad and have divorce him in the end.
              He was never responsible even though he actually SEEMS like a
              responsible, caring guy at first. How shall I put it, it is
              something like getting a person to try out a new flavour of coka
              cola when in reality it's actually a drug. You get unknowingly
              hooked in the end even though drug-taking is not your intention. To
              date, he never pays his maintenance and just going through divorce
              is hell for me enough. I could sue him for this of course, but
              factor in the paper work, agony and time, it's just plain not worth
              it. What about all the time he has painted in the young
              impressionable child's mind that you're the bad guy when in actual
              fact you've been doing all you could to keep the family afloat?
              What about him fighting for the child's custody when you know he's
              simply not equipped to support the child? You know you need to deal
              with living expenses as well as the well-being of your child, and
              to fend off this guy and his tactics. Nope, family's not been
              giving any support. I'd be thankful if there's no drama that'd
              cause me further grief or to deal with tantrums from my child due
              to such chaotic circumstances as well as that of my own.</p>
              <p>As to the issue of age, the more I've come into contact with
              people, the more I realize that it's a subjective issue. Some young
              people can be very mature and some older ones can be very childish.
              What about family background and education and support from family
              and loved ones? What if you have very little of them all or worse,
              none? Let me give an example so that it is easier to picture.
              Everyone knows disability right? Example, someone who has lost a
              leg would find it very difficult to walk. That is clearly obvious
              to everyone as everyone can see that he has lost a leg. But what
              about emotional disability? What if this lady had not been
              emotionally equipped to handle what life has dished out to her?
              Emotional disability is something that is not easily visible to the
              eye. I'm not saying that she should not be accountable for her
              actions, but what I'm saying is that not everybody has the
              awareness of what is right and wrong straight away and perhaps it
              takes time and supportive friends to show her that. Just like there
              are still unfortunate children and people out there in poorer parts
              of the world and they don't choose to want to grow up there.
              Everybody needs a chance.</p>
              <p>She thinks about abortion because there is such a thing as
              abortion in this world. The media has been talking about it, it's
              in the newspaper, magazine, radio and well, even here, we're
              talking about it. Who can don't even think about it? Picture a
              piece of yellow lemon in your mind. See yourself sinking your teeth
              into it, eating it and drinking all that sour lemon juice. Now stop
              thinking about how sour is that lemon, forget about the lemon now.
              Are we able to do it?</p>
              <p>I believe, it is not her intention to want to abort a life or
              not. No girls go out with a guy with the picture of abortion in
              case if there is a baby. Maybe you could say it's a lack of
              maturity to think far, but I would rather put it as her current
              priority then is to seek love. It's like a kind stranger giving you
              food after you've been starved for 3 days while lost in a jungle
              during military training. When you are that hungry and thirsty,
              what are the chances that you would pause to debate whether the
              food is poisonous or not before eating and especially when the
              stranger looks like a kind, genteel and vulnerable old auntie?</p>

              <p>I'm honoured to be able to chat with someone who had gone through pre-maritial pregnancy and chose not to abort. I can't judge things for you but to me, I'm sure you made a right choice and is living a life free from any guilt connecting to a child's death.</p>
              <p>The media has its good and bad points, its all about the people watching them to have their own opinion. For my case, I oppose abortion unless its is for a medical condtion.</p>
              <p>Your given example is rather interesting, however, what you showed is that the trouble surrounds only you. You can choose whatever way you want to solve it, even self-cannibalism. However, abortion is the subject between both mom and child. The mom may want to survive, but the child would want to live to right? This idea maybe too simple to be impressive, but i that you get the idea.</p>

              <p>abortion is the best choice to a pre-marital pregnancy, provided
              if the guy did not marry the girl. (even a short term marriage
              would do).</p>
              <p>if the guy agrees to marry the girl, and give legitimacy to the
              birth of the child, it would be better for both the child and
              mother. they would not have to suffer from gossips e.g. "the child
              is born out of wedlock", " the mother is a loose woman" etc.</p>
              <p>but in the above case, where, the guy refuses to marry the girl,
              the next best alternative is abortion, instead of adoption. yes,
              you may save a "soon-to-become-a-living-being" by not going for
              abortion, but do you want  the child to be condemn to gossips
              about his or her backgrounds for the rest of his or her life?</p>
              <p>the child will be scarred and branded before he/she even steps
              out into the world. our society isn't very forgiving towards this
              sort of pre-marital pregnancy, nor are we very tolerant of it,
              being an Asian country. Spare the child this cruelty.</p>
              <p>also, it is also noted that children from single parent families
              do fare lower is life as compared to individuals from complete
              families. in addition, having a child with you also effectively
              lowers the girl's chances of remarrying and getting a new life. it
              would ruin her hope of having a happy family.</p>
              <p>as for adoption, it is cruel for both the child and the mother.
              the child would most likely grow up hating his mother for giving
              him away, and on the other hand, the mother would most likely
              regret her choice of giving up her child. When you put up a child
              for adoption, you can't take him back even if you want to. do you
              want to suffer the angst of parting with your child, and living
              knowing that he may never get to know you, or worst still, hate you
              for giving him away?</p>
              <p>and regarding the definition of life, how do you define life?
              does a clump of cells, the fertilise embryo, counts as life? note:
              embryo =/= foetus.</p>
              <p>if some clumps of cells count as life, so do you call eggs and
              sperms "half-a-life"? so do all those wanking guys out there, are
              they killing millions of "lives" whenever they masturbate? or are
              women killing a potential life when they go thru menses every
              month? and with cloning technology, even your skin cells can be
              made into a clone of you. so do you classify your skin cells as
              separate "lives"?</p>
              <p>clearly, life does not begin upon conceiving. and to clarify, i
              am against abortion after the first trimester.</p>

              <p>I think at the point where the woman is consious about her pregnancy, her baby would be more than a "lump of cells". Whats worst, living a life of shame or not living at all? Yes, its tough to live a life of shame, but you can work for and achieve respect. There are many adopted kids in the world who had been saved from the clutches of abortion and given the chance to life. They processed more fighting spirit and many are now successful people in their own field and contributing to the society.</p>

              <p><br>yes. but isn't it best to bring a child into the world with the best you could offer? why make the child suffer unnecessarily?</p>
              <p>being a young single mother, the child not only has to endure the shame of being a child born out of wedlock for the rest of his life,  the mother most probably is also unable to provide financially for the child.</p>
              <p>what more reasons to not go for abortion?</p>
