              <p>Yes, but I think she should still tell her parents la. No matter how angry, they will still side her de. And they have the right to know in case anything bad happens to her after the abortion. Otherwise if some complications come up, who is going to take care of her during her hospital stay? They will find out somehow...</p>
              <p>And at least the guy will get what he deserves...otherwise he might try to do the same thing on her again next time...I know of a girl who already aborted 3 times...all with the same bastard...</p>

              <p>First thing first, they have sex and had a baby, thats their fault, no one forced them to do it, they are both willing parties, so they got to pay for what price taht will be coming up.</p>
              <p>Second,she will be, and deserved to be, teased. This is a no-brainer question. Actions have consequences. They wanna have fun, they have to pay the price. However, I'm sure she would be spared the shame and may even be respected if she stood up to the problem and struggle to bring her child up. By then, she will earn the respect of others. But now, to me, she is nothing but a cheap girl.</p>

              <p>Hi there, it's been a while since I last log on, but I just saw this article and thought I strongly need to provide my point of view here.</p>
              <p>I am providing this view from the point of a single mum myself, where I was facing the same dilemma 10 over years ago.</p>
              <p>I'm going to make a lot of assumptions here based on what I've been through so bear with me. Ignore them if you think they don't apply.</p>
              <p>Yes, she may be a coward, or a more appropriate way to put it, she is extremely fearful/resentful/dreads of her parents to know of her pregnancy. But yes too, it's ALMOST like they are going to kill her. Sigh... not everyone understands because not everyone has parents who neglect to care for their child all the while yet want the control and face should anything involving their parents' ego happened. And yes, this would also mean that they do not really care for their child's well-being anymore than their pride that comes first. My dad wanted me to abort my baby when I was 5 months pregnant. And yes, not every parent will accept and provide or help to want to look after your child when your baby is due. So even if you spill the beans about your pregnancy, their first reactions would almost be to literally want to "kill" you. Also, I may be just assuming here, they might think it's too troublesome to call up the guy's parents and feel indignant that since such a thing happened, it should be the guy's parents who's going to call them up. Everybody's pushing their own views, their ways unto the poor girl, nobody does anything concrete. Who has ever thought of her feelings here? Who sincerely cares for her? In view of all these, what is the poor girl to do alone?</p>
              <p>As someone who's been through the journey, I can see very clearly that the guy is completely not worth it now. If she goes for abortion, I hope that she would have nothing to do with the guy anymore because the guy is clearly stringing her along for the sex and a guai guai companion for a partner. Someone who adores him and really puts her heart into loving him just because he happened in her life where she feels negated and unloved by her family. He will appear to her as the hero to save the damsel in distress when he croons her with promises of love. And in order to win his approval to continue receiving this love that she has never felt in her family, she will continue to do things that pleases him to invoke the loving attention (she needed so much) from him.</p>
              <p>Sex may just be one of the ways she felt loved and cherished by him. Loneliness makes her extremely vulnerable (perhaps she don't feel cherished and loved by her family anyway). Though this poses a big problem for the girl biologically as well, because when you have sex with a man, your body releases oxytocin during orgasm. This "bonding hormone" (also produced when you're nursing your baby and childbirth), coupled with the female hormone estrogen, produces a powerful bonding effect, blinding her to be attached to him, instead of seeing him for who he really is. On top of all these, if she's really a sweet, unassuming, and more importanty, a sentimental girl, she might actually feel bad to terminate a relationship if she's someone who thinks that perhaps it might be her who had not tried hard enough in it as opposed to her passive family who may have constantly put her down regardless of what she does. Little does she knows that she has done far far more than any other girls would have ever given in a relationship and that it is not healthy for her to give anymore in such a flawed relationship, in the "hope" that the love and stability she craves for will be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">finally granted to her</span> through her <span style="text-decoration: underline;">blind hard work</span>. Adding on to this, the guy she dearly loves with all her life would be encouraging her to give more by giving her a hint of his "love" here and there, and then withdrawing to make her work even harder. It's a no-win situation even though she doesn't know it. The harder she works, the harder she falls.</p>
              <p>As what I can see from here, she really needs VERY supportive friends to break her out of this trance. Ironically, the relationship she's in would try even harder to isolate her from the company of friends (expect to be bad-mouthed by the guy when she's with him in private). Friends need to be extremely understanding and handle her delicate feelings with care and respect, for she would hide back into her relationship for comfort and not come out at all if she feels the slightest put down or shamed. As much as she might find certain sense in what her friends say (about her bf being a jerk), she is also looking inwards to reproach herself what else she could have been doing to make it all better, and since she's already in this relationship, she's gotta "do all to make it WORK". She doesn't realize that she is ENOUGH. She doesn't realize that she DESERVE to be loved for who she already is. At this delicate time, no matter whether you are very close friends to her or not (since she might isolate herself), friends need to spend every possible time with her, decreasing all the time she spends with the bf, depending on his "love" and company. She might refuse (remember she feels unworthy and ashamed?) out of politeness, but someone a bit more thick-skinned out there should just pull her along to some gatherings whether she says yes or no.</p>
              <p>I think it would be helpful for friends to know that even if perhaps whatever you've done may not seem to be working and feel disheartened, all the things done are actually registered in the girl's mind, and when she's in trouble again and don't know who to turn to for help, all the previous helpful advice (no matter how resisted she was to those ideas then) will be remembered. Everything done were not in vain even if she seems adamant on sticking to her boyfriend currently.</p>
              <p>crimsontactics has said that she deserved to be teased. I want to know, if someone really deserved to be teased just because all she's trying to do is to attempt hard to find a love she can rely on albeit in misguided way (no one in her family taught her how, but instead berate her for all her mistakes big and small and ignore her when she needs their presence), got misled by a guy who thinks more for himself than her welfare (even though he will be telling her he loves her etc things that she NEEDS so badly because her family has not been able to provide for her this emotional safety), because all along she has not been cherished, loved and looked after?</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hi there, it's been a while since I last log on, but I just saw
              this article and thought I strongly need to provide my point of
              view here.</p>
              <p>I am providing this view from the point of a single mum myself,
              where I was facing the same dilemma 10 over years ago.</p>
              <p>I'm going to make a lot of assumptions here based on what I've
              been through so bear with me. Ignore them if you think they don't
              apply.</p>
              <p>Yes, she may be a coward, or a more appropriate way to put it,
              she is extremely fearful/resentful/dreads of her parents to know of
              her pregnancy. But yes too, it's ALMOST like they are going to kill
              her. Sigh... not everyone understands because not everyone has
              parents who neglect to care for their child all the while yet want
              the control and face should anything involving their parents' ego
              happened. And yes, this would also mean that they do not really
              care for their child's well-being anymore than their pride that
              comes first. My dad wanted me to abort my baby when I was 5 months
              pregnant. And yes, not every parent will accept and provide or help
              to want to look after your child when your baby is due. So even if
              you spill the beans about your pregnancy, their first reactions
              would almost be to literally want to "kill" you. Also, I may be
              just assuming here, they might think it's too troublesome to call
              up the guy's parents and feel indignant that since such a thing
              happened, it should be the guy's parents who's going to call them
              up. Everybody's pushing their own views, their ways unto the poor
              girl, nobody does anything concrete. Who has ever thought of her
              feelings here? Who sincerely cares for her? In view of all these,
              what is the poor girl to do alone?</p>
              <p>As someone who's been through the journey, I can see very
              clearly that the guy is completely not worth it now. If she goes
              for abortion, I hope that she would have nothing to do with the guy
              anymore because the guy is clearly stringing her along for the sex
              and a guai guai companion for a partner. Someone who adores him and
              really puts her heart into loving him just because he happened in
              her life where she feels negated and unloved by her family. He will
              appear to her as the hero to save the damsel in distress when he
              croons her with promises of love. And in order to win his approval
              to continue receiving this love that she has never felt in her
              family, she will continue to do things that pleases him to invoke
              the loving attention (she needed so much) from him.</p>
              <p>Sex may just be one of the ways she felt loved and cherished by
              him. Loneliness makes her extremely vulnerable (perhaps she don't
              feel cherished and loved by her family anyway). Though this poses a
              big problem for the girl biologically as well, because when you
              have sex with a man, your body releases oxytocin during orgasm.
              This "bonding hormone" (also produced when you're nursing your baby
              and childbirth), coupled with the female hormone estrogen, produces
              a powerful bonding effect, blinding her to be attached to him,
              instead of seeing him for who he really is. On top of all these, if
              she's really a sweet, unassuming, and more importanty, a
              sentimental girl, she might actually feel bad to terminate a
              relationship if she's someone who thinks that perhaps it might be
              her who had not tried hard enough in it as opposed to her passive
              family who may have constantly put her down regardless of what she
              does. Little does she knows that she has done far far more than any
              other girls would have ever given in a relationship and that it is
              not healthy for her to give anymore in such a flawed relationship,
              in the "hope" that the love and stability she craves for will be
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;">finally granted to
              her</span> through her <span style="text-decoration: underline;">blind hard work</span>. Adding on to
              this, the guy she dearly loves with all her life would be
              encouraging her to give more by giving her a hint of his "love"
              here and there, and then withdrawing to make her work even harder.
              It's a no-win situation even though she doesn't know it. The harder
              she works, the harder she falls.</p>
              <p>As what I can see from here, she really needs VERY supportive
              friends to break her out of this trance. Ironically, the
              relationship she's in would try even harder to isolate her from the
              company of friends (expect to be bad-mouthed by the guy when she's
              with him in private). Friends need to be extremely understanding
              and handle her delicate feelings with care and respect, for she
              would hide back into her relationship for comfort and not come out
              at all if she feels the slightest put down or shamed. As much as
              she might find certain sense in what her friends say (about her bf
              being a jerk), she is also looking inwards to reproach herself what
              else she could have been doing to make it all better, and since
              she's already in this relationship, she's gotta "do all to make it
              WORK". She doesn't realize that she is ENOUGH. She doesn't realize
              that she DESERVE to be loved for who she already is. At this
              delicate time, no matter whether you are very close friends to her
              or not (since she might isolate herself), friends need to spend
              every possible time with her, decreasing all the time she spends
              with the bf, depending on his "love" and company. She might refuse
              (remember she feels unworthy and ashamed?) out of politeness, but
              someone a bit more thick-skinned out there should just pull her
              along to some gatherings whether she says yes or no.</p>
              <p>I think it would be helpful for friends to know that even if
              perhaps whatever you've done may not seem to be working and feel
              disheartened, all the things done are actually registered in the
              girl's mind, and when she's in trouble again and don't know who to
              turn to for help, all the previous helpful advice (no matter how
              resisted she was to those ideas then) will be remembered.
              Everything done were not in vain even if she seems adamant on
              sticking to her boyfriend currently.</p>
              <p>crimsontactics has said that she deserved to be teased. I want
              to know, if someone really deserved to be teased just because all
              she's trying to do is to attempt hard to find a love she can rely
              on albeit in misguided way (no one in her family taught her how,
              but instead berate her for all her mistakes big and small and
              ignore her when she needs their presence), got misled by a guy who
              thinks more for himself than her welfare (even though he will be
              telling her he loves her etc things that she NEEDS so badly because
              her family has not been able to provide for her this emotional
              safety), because all along she has not been cherished, loved and
              looked after?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">~crimsontactics has said that she deserved to be teased. I want

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">First of all, I want to highlight that the social stigma which is connected to pre-marriage pregnancy had been in our society for generations. I'm sure that the couples, especially the lady, should be fully aware and prepared of the outcome of their actions.</span></p>
              <p>Secondly, I'm sure that the lady, being 25, should be mature enough to differentiate between love and sex. You don't give sex to gain love, neither the other way around. Both of these two aspects are of a different calibre. They don't work together before marriage. So from your argument, are you telling me that just because she is foolish enough to give her body to her bf in exchange for attention, she is totally innocent? Shouldn't she be at fault too for the lack of sexual discipline? Isn't piaking before marriage considered cheap? And where are the protections? Ask these questions to yourself 1st. Misjudging is your own fault, so does being foolishly lured into doing something.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, she even got the guts to consider abortion. What do you think she is? God? Having fun at the sake of another's life? This is Sg my friend. The government have been actively promoting married couples to have babies. I don't believe that she will not be able to bring up her child in this country, though it would be a tough struggle. Purposing abortion as a solution is hanging a "TEASE ME" sign around her neck. So shouldn't she be teased?</p>
              <p>There is no free lunches in this world, everything have a price. Want to play, better pay.</p>
