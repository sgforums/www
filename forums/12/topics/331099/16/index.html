              <p>What if his payments stopped again? Repeat the above drama A-Z all over again?</p>

              <p>Looking back at this topic now, I suddenly wonder, with the rise of pre-marital sex these days, how many guys are really prepared to marry the girls they are farking around with once they are test pregnant? Don't tell me about contraceptive, it's not 100% effective, condoms, pills whatever. I have a friend who got pregnant in spite of measures.</p>

              <p>one point to note, the court can't make an unemployed man to pay maintenance. maintenance is based on a certain portion of the guy's pay.</p>
              <p>in the case of pre-marital pregnancy, where both parties are probably students, it is unlikely that the guy will have any pay for the girl to claim maintenance.</p>

              <li>who will stand up for the girl when she needs help the most.</li>
              <li>He will be there to comfort her when she asks for it.</li>
              <li>He will show concrete actions by ACTING on what he says.</li>
              <li>He will be consistent.</li>
              <li>He may have all the reasons not to do something for you but you will see him trying to overcome all the "no"s by working hard just for you.</li>
              <li>He will not make you feel insecure or lost.<br></li>
              </ul>

              <p>Looking back at this topic now, I suddenly wonder, with the rise of pre-marital sex these days, how many guys are really prepared to marry the girls they are farking around with once they are test pregnant? Don't tell me about contraceptive, it's not 100% effective, condoms, pills whatever. I have a friend who got pregnant in spite of measures.</p>
              <p>Alright, assuming precautions have been taken and the girl you had s*x with still got pregnant and she wants a status...</p>
              <p>would you marry her?</p>

              <p>I think u should just leave it to ur friend to deal with it. Judging by the character of the guy, i do not see any clear indication of any future in terms of a marriage life with kids with the girl. Giving the benefit of the doubt maybe after financially able to support a child he then decides to do so, may not necessarily be with the girl, and women who has gone through abortion tend to have child bearing problems in the future because of the process of forced abortion that will injure the internal organs of the girl. Overtime mentally it will affect not only the girl but also any future kid she bears.</p>
              <p>Since decision is made already, u can only just watch from the sidelines and with the variety of 'advices' here u will be able to see whose insight was of more sound then others.</p>
              <p>Crimsontactics may have strong views about taking another life, but when we talk about life, where does the life begin ? What is considered human life ?  Embrio stage ? Fetus stage ? During insemenation ? A disabled kid is definately a human life regardless of the disabilities, even if without a brain. Its been subject to debate for centuries man..  whatever discussed here about life or not is only but a shallow view of things to come.  Crimsontactics views are just more aggresively conservative thats all. I wouldve said the same thing... minus the teasing part. I dont think they 'deserve' the be teased.. but they no doubt brought this upon themselves. And hopefully through thier case we all learn a thing or two. Simple.</p>

              <p>Just some general info~~<br><br>I have friends who abort their babies cos of 'abnormality'~~<br><br>Down syndrome, spinal bifida are jus some of the cases of 'abnormality'~~ These kids normally go for operation at the age of One Day~~</p>
              <p>There are mothers who actually chose to gave birth to them, hoping that there will be a day of miracle~~<br><br>Just like single mums, there are support groups for these mothers to pull one another through~~ E.g Club Rainbow - A club for parents whose kids are down with spinal bifida~~</p>
              <p>Some didn't; it's not because they don't have the courage~~<br><br>It's cos in general circumstances, the kids don't live past the age of 5, as deduced by my friends' gynae, and the medical fees for these 5 years could range to hundreds of thousands of dollars~~ In a way, she chose to abort, save the hundreds of thousands and try for another child, provide for that child in a more comfy way~~</p>
              <p>If, my friend did gave birth to the baby, and also another who is 'considered normal', she felt she will have difficulty in finance as well as the worry of neglectance towards the 'normal' one~~ Rather than everyone in the family feeling sad, she chose to abort~~ <br><br>It's never easy to take care of a kid with 'abnormality', cos each visit to the doctor will only make ur heart pump faster as u have totally no idea if it's good news or bad news~~<br><br>Some kids are even paralysed waist down for the rest of their lives~~<br><br>Very frankly, mothers who chose the path of abortion when they found out that their babies have 'abnormalities' aren't feeling very 'good' about it~~<br><br>They are mothers who want the child, who has carried the baby into the second trimester already~~ Imagine when they went for the down syndrome test and the doc told them, yes, ur baby is diagnosed with down syndrome~~ How would they feel? <br><br>To want a baby in the initial start of pregancy, the bond has already started, much more than a mother who didn't want a baby at the start of pregnancy~~ To make a decision to abort or not to abort at the second trimester cos of 'abnormalities' is not easy at all~~ </p>
              <p>The stuff which I posted here, all my posts, are things which I have been through and seen~~<br><br>Kindly don't compare how a mother with an 'abnormal' kid with one with a 'normal' kid~~ cos the former will definitely have more worries and fears than the latter~~<br></p>
