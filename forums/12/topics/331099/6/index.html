              <p>I know of someone who's gotten pregnant even though they had taken measures. Contraceptives are not 100% fool-proof. May I ask in such a situation where precautions have been taken and yet pregnancy has occured, what is to be done and who shall take the responsibility?</p>
              <p>I feel that schools should incorporate some form of sex education. Not the ones I had 10 over years back then obviously (I do not know what are the schools teaching now), very theory-based. I feel that all secondary school kids should be exposed to videos about abortions and classes should be held to talk about marriage, family and responsibility. In fact, classes conducted should not be too theory-based, reading whatever is from the textbooks, but open up to the class floor for participating debates.</p>

              <p>A few issues to address.</p>
              <p>Singapore is currently opened to a lot of foreigners, but deep
              down, being a single-mum is still not accepted by all. Be it
              discrimination or gossip towards the mother or child, it just boils
              down to how the mother is able to handle, as well as take the
              'verbal abuse'.</p>
              <p>To abort or not to abort, depends on how strong your fren
              is.</p>
              <p>Logically, many would say that w/o finance, w/o a proper family,
              the birth of a child should be ceased. Others may said that the
              child is innocent and that responsibility of the consequence should
              be beared. It's not rightfully right to 'take away' something just
              because you felt you don't have the ability to do so and will bring
              it more harm than good. Ever think from the child's view? <strong>A child
              may blame you, but he/she may not either; it boils down to how you
              bring and teach him/her up. </strong></p>
              <p>Just like before 'Divorce' was ever introduced, it's a <strong>taboo </strong>in
              the olden times for a wife to leave their husbands no matter what
              the husbands have done. But now, 'Divorce' is pretty common as it
              serves as an 'alternative' to 'solve' things just like the word
              'abortion'.</p>
              <p>The day one started having pre-martial doings, one should
              have expected there may be a day the girl will be pregnant.</p>
              <p>Yes, counselling sessions and a video tape are things a girl has
              to go through when she decides to go for abortion; and<strong> it's not
              easy.</strong></p>
              <p>To give birth - either send for adoption or raise on your
              own.</p>
              <p>To send for adoption, some girls may feel that the adopted
              parents are more capable to provide for the child; but she will
              have to be able to bear the '<strong>pain</strong>' of being separated from her own
              fresh and blood, a child she has in her womb for 9 months plus, a
              child who can start kicking her at 6 months plus.</p>
              <p>A thing which most guys can never understand is the feeling
              of something growing inside you; the happiness of seeig
              the ultrasound scan, the happiness of feeling the heart beat,
              the happiness of seeing the ultasound pic which the doc will print
              out for u at each visit, the happiness of shopping for baby clothes
              (shop at cheaper stores if finance don't allow), the expectation of
              seeing the child at first sight, the hearing of the child's
              first cries, the pain and long hours a girl have to go
              through during labour etc.</p>
              <p>Your fren has to weigh the effects of giving birth (raise on her
              own/adoption) or abortion. Effects as in the consequences she has
              to face, be it mental or physical, and whether she will be
              able to take it.</p>
              <p><strong>Once aborted, there's no 'rewinding'; goes the same for sending
              for adoption or raising on her own.</strong></p>
              <p>I have frenz who went for abortion; ironically, she seems pretty
              at ease with things as she's a pretty practical person.</p>
              <p>I have frenz who are single mothers; they gave birth when they
              were still schooling. Now they are working, finance is much better,
              but obviously, during the initial years, it was pretty bad. They
              have to save and be thrifty on every single cent. Initally, they
              practically have no social life, life is devoted to the babies,
              because there's only one of them, no father, to care for the
              babies. Only when the kids are older, do they get a social
              life. </p>
              <p>Sort of 'Ku jing gan lai'</p>
              <p>Lastly, not all guys are not able to accept a single mother; my
              single-parent friends are getting married, and throughout these few
              years, they don't have lack of suitors, in fact the guys still went
              after them despite knowing they are single mothers.</p>
              <p>But obviously, my frenz took a very long time to walk out of
              their hurting past and, in addition, the day they decided to give
              birth, they have given up hopes on marriage. Now, they just
              felt having a husband is = a bonus. (",) </p>
              <p>Actually, the most important thing is how strong is your friend?
              The route in the future is, in a way, unpredictable.</p>
              <p>*I understand that u mention that the guy 'offer' to pay for
              maintenance, my advise if ur friend wants to give birth, don't take
              the maintenance, but <strong>do get the guy to sign a official lawyer
              letter stating that the guy willngly gives up all his rights to the
              child.</strong> No single mother would want to see a 'sudden
              appearance' of a guy saying that he wants back his
              child after e.g. ten years. He has a right to, if he has
              been supporting the child financially and in addition, he's the
              rightful father. -- Just a precaution. (",)</p>
              <p>Oh, besides, as for the kids, I watched them grow up, they are
              good and sensible, I guess it boils down to how my friends taught
              them. They did ask for their fathers, but knowing that when
              they ask, my frenz would feel sad, they rather chose not to. They
              seldom ask when they are older, my frenz did more than they could
              to cover as a mother and a father. It may be difficult and a father
              may never be able to be replaced, but a kid can feel and see, feel
              and see a mother's LOVE.</p>

              <p>There are many ways to seeing this situation, I'll advise your friend to abort.</p>
              <p>It's very straightforward. Why would she want to give birth for a man who clearly does not love her, does not want the child and leaves when the going gets rough?</p>
              <p>I assure you all 3 options will bring her regret. Regrets are one thing, we all have regrets. But her having to pay for everything at the expense of a better future is another. I think her next move is very crucial, I will abort if I were her.</p>
              <p>1) If she gives birth and puts her newborn up for adoption, she will hanker over the what ifs, and she will be made to endure the separation.</p>
              <p>2) If she gives birth and keeps the baby out of love for the man (hoping one day he will come back for her), if she thinks she may find joy 20 years down the road after the kid is all grown up, she better be prepared for 20 tough years ahead. She better be equipped both emotionally and financially for it. It may be less painful if she has a supportive family unit behind her.</p>
              <p>3) She aborts. Forgets him completely, and try to walk out of this old life, build one for herself and then mate with a guy who will shoulder the responsibility, marry her and make a family with her.</p>

              <p>Leave that jerk &amp; I hope she can keep the baby.  It's a mistake tat both parties made &amp; it's upsetting to know that jerk can actually be so selfish as to push all the burdens to the gal alone to bear.  He made her the <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">murderer for her kid</span></strong>, can she still be with him?</p>
              <p>And also do please bear in mind that abortion will have bad effects on future pregnancies.  Is she really goin to derive her child the chance of coming into the world, put her health &amp; her future pregnancies at risk?? </p>
              <p>Abortion takes courage, keepin the child also needs courage.  Tho' all the situation now is against her now..if she still decide to go for abortion, she'll probably be living in regrets for the rest of her life.  They werent being responsible while havin sex, but at the very least, they shld b responsible for the life that they have created.</p>
