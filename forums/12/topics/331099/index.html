              <p>I agree with your real incident, I also got a friend who also got the same thing from her bf. He was super sweet to her while persuading her to abort the baby, and I kept asking her not to abort the baby cos I'm quite sure her bf will leave her once the baby is aborted (Her bf was secretly going after me behind her back, and so I know). So my dumb but pretty friend went for an abortion believing in the love, trust that she valued so much in her bf, and got dumped 1 week after the abortion.</p>
              <p>My friend till now still doesn't know the truth why her bf dumped her and still blames herself for causing the breakup. But anyway, she's now living in Japan and starting a new life there.</p>
              <p>And yes, such SG Guys exists in SG. So with my minimum 30k ring policy, such SG guys will be thoroughly filtered out and they won't stand a chance at all.</p>
