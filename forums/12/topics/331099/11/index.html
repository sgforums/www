              <p>Would ending his life solve the problem? Wouldn't the mother be mocked even more than if she was to give birth to the child? Rest of his life? You sure? Respect is earned, people may gossip about you, but if you are a people of great value, they will show you great respect. Also, I think many people also experienced being gossiped before, so its not a big deal.</p>

              <p>That is where the exception comes in, like I had said earlier. Regarding this question, I think the mother have the rights over her child's life in such a situation and who I were to save would depend on her decision.</p>

              <p>Those people are have a weak mentality and are easily swayed in
              the face of problem.</p>
              <p>The government wants people to have more children IF they could
              afford it. Apparantly she seems to be financially unstable, thus i
              don't think she fall into this category. Unwedded moms are being
              looked down upon is due to our Asian culture and also due to the
              fact that many are so irresponsible to seek abortion as a way
              out.</p>
              <p>Its not totally her fault. I agree with you. But is she
              fault-free? Shouldn't a lady of 25 have some form of sexual
              discipline, like I've mentioned earlier? Being misled shows that
              she is not mature enough to have a child, yet she had one and
              planned to have an abortion. Does this shows that she is totally
              innocent?</p>
              <p>I'm not God. However,  i judged her to be cheap because she
              had premarital sex which she can't afford to have, had a baby and
              planned to abort it. Thats why she is cheap.</p>

              <p>We must first understand that the it is her responsibility to bare her burden. Second, in Sg where there are many organisation providing support, I'm sure that if she has a job, the minimum financing of the child and her would be secured. It wouldn't be a good life with lots of luxuries, but its life nonetheless.</p>

              abortion is good for everyone, just want you to see that bringing a
              baby into the world will definitely cost even more than just the
              700 once off.</p>

              carries the child to full term and then give up the child for
              abortion?</p>

              <p>The cost depends actually. The cost for gov hosipitals will range above a thousand dollars. Those below should be from those women's clinic.

              <p>Why is it that they are still looked down upon if they bring the

              a woman aborts, but if she brings the child into the world, society
              will keep focusing on them and they will be the target of gossips
              no matter what.</p>
              <p>And yes, she might be immature. So do you think she will be
              ready to handle the child? She might have made that decision based
              on what she thinks is best for her life. Do you truly know what is
              best for her? Just because it is your principle to be against
              abortion doesn't mean that everyone should also uphold the same

              <p>I understand what rainee is trying to get at. Because when you have a child, he or she is physically present with you (unless you choose to give your child away) and you cannot deny the fact the he/she is your child, whereas a lady who aborts her child is able to choose to divulge this part of her past or not. She could go on a date and progress to even a marriage with another guy without mentioning this part of her past at all, hence she is absolved of being the target of gossips.</p>
              <p>Now that all the focus is on the mother, I would like to bring in the issue of the father of the child. Why is he absolved of all responsibilities just because he chooses to walk away from it all? Also, he is not faced with the possibility of being wounded physically through abortion, so why should the social stigma lies mainly on the woman?</p>

              <p>Talk is cheap. I think we should empathize more with the current situation of TS' friend rather than calling her cheap and forcing her to give birth to the baby when she is apparently not ready for it. Doesn't mean that it works for others it will also work for her. The cost of having a baby can add up to quite a lot rather fast, within the first month you suddenly realize you need to fork out a lot for diapers, baby clothes, baby cot, strollers and a lot of little things which don't seem to cost much, but when they are added up, they may be a bit hard to be settled by a single mom who is recuperating from child birth.</p>
              <p>I am against abortion personally so I am not saying that it is a better option just because it is cheaper and easier. What I am trying to say is that both options also suck for her, and only she knows what is best. It is a tough decision to be made but only she knows what is best for her own life.</p>

              <p>I knew of a child who died while her mom was going on doing her stuff in the kitchen. Cause of death: Scalding. Apparently the child has been crawling around, grabbing everything within reach, just as children would normally do and he pulled down a kettle and the boiling water fell all over him. He was a relative of my mother. The mom was devastated and felt guilty and blamed herself for years for not being able to take better care of her son. She was divorced from the husband shortly before the son was born so the mom was a single mom at that time.</p>

              <p>However, I would also like to bring in the aspect of emotional stress this girl might be facing. Whether she decides for abortion or not, I respect her decision, but what I cannot stress enough is the care and concern friends need to shower on her, to let her know that she is not totally alone in this and that there are people out there who are genuinely concerned for her.</p>
              <p>If the threadstarter really feels for her and wants to help, then I must say keep in touch with her in spite of whatever that may happen and respond to her asking of help as soon as possible whether you have the solution or not. Chances are, it's more of a cry for a need to be heard and understood rather than anything else. As we know, people tend do "foolish things" in the heat of a moment and where no one gets to hear their pains but are quite okay once they've passed that "moment". I am more worried that she might fence herself in out of fear and shame. Try to get the girl involved socially and open up her options of where to seek help.</p>

              <p>I knew of a child who died while her mom was going on doing her
              stuff in the kitchen. Cause of death: Scalding. Apparently the
              child has been crawling around, grabbing everything within reach,
              just as children would normally do and he pulled down a kettle and
              the boiling water fell all over him. He was a relative of my
              mother. The mom was devastated and felt guilty and blamed herself
              for years for not being able to take better care of her son. She
              was divorced from the husband shortly before the son was born so
              the mom was a single mom at that time.</p>

              <p>Lodging can rent room. Cook and wash is the extra burden she has
              to bear due to her responsibility. Washing and cooking put baby in
              sarong or nearby in baby chair. Last time when i was young,
              whenever my grandma cook i would just crawl around the living room.

              <p>It's not easy to rent a place with baby. Many tenants do not like to rent rooms to people with kids. I know because I've shifted house 10 times during a certain turbulent 2 years.</p>

              <p>How you know it is in the minority? A lot of such neglect cases that lead to the death of infants have been reported over the years. You can't deny that as a single parent she would have lesser time to spend with the child as she has to multi-task. If he manages to escape all the calamities due to neglect, he would soon come to blame the mom for not spending enough time with him. Is that a good environment for a child to grow up in?</p>
              <p>I believe that women should not give birth unless they are truly ready they are able to cope with it. So unless she can convince herself that she is ready to be responsible for another human being, the child is going to end up in a bad state when he grows up and the mother will still feel guilty for not being able to provide adequately for him.</p>

              <p>We can only suggest but in the end the final decison belongs to her. And no matter what it is, I don't think we deserve the right to criticize her for making it. She is the best judge to the situation and she has to be convinced with her own decison. Otherwise she will just live in regrets from then on.</p>
