In this instance, if the bf is the complacent sort, and likes simple things in life and wants an easy life, it maybe alot to ask of him to ask him to upgrade himself all the time albeit upgrading oneself is a good thing.  If the person wanna change, of cos it should be encouraged.  If the person doesnt want, shouldnt force him to become someone he isnt, rite?<br><br>Sometimes in life, some things are just not mean to be.<br><br>Plus, TS already does not love him anymore.  Love is crucial in a relationship at that stage, no?  They are not married and they are still so young, and love is no longer there, would you wanna force them to be together for the next 50 years of their lives in a relationship without love?<br><br>The bf also deserves to be with somebody who loves him.</div>

Yet, you are wondering if you should hang on for fear of not able to find someone who will love you as much and perhaps, out of commitment.<br><br>Love, is a very strange thing.<br><br>When one is young, physical attraction plays a major part. As one grows older, other factors like ability to provide becomes important. When these needs are satisfied, then, loyalty becomes important.<br><br>Also, does he have habits like cheating, gambling, drinking, smoking or becoming violent? These are factors that might help you to look at relationship objectively.<br><br>Most importantly, you know what you want out of a relationship, and I think being aware and taking the necessary steps to have a fulfilling relationship is important.<br><br>I take it that both of you are still young. Indeed, if the love is not there, frustration would slowly grows into resentment, and one day, things will erupt.<br><br>I think the question is perhaps, if he were to take his 'O' level and continue on his course at Shatec, would you still love him or it does not matter anymore?<br><br>The truth hurts, reality bites, and life goes on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everyone here is rite. To summarise everything dat has been discussed: juz leave him since u no longer love him. Both of u will experience the pain now but it will all be over soon, juz like when u wake up frm a nightmare. Dat way, u can find someone better by your own standards, and he can find someone hu loves him a lot more than u loved him. Dun ever lead him on by allowing him to cling on to sth dat does not exist. Dat wld hurt a lot more, believe me.<br><br>By the way, juz curious, since u say u stopped loving him already, then why do u say dat your heart is dead(frm your thread topic name)? I thought u haf moved on already?<br><br>All the best.<br></div>

I've told him to save up, not splurge, take better care of himself and quit smoking. All that he gave excuses not to try to achieve. True, he cut down on smoking- but only when I'm with him. whenever he goes clubbing and starts drinking, he starts chain smoking again.<br><br>I expressed my desire to help him achieve things but he turned them down with excuses.
