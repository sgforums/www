I think most probably after X mas and a few more fights. Place would be void deck. Line used would be, either one of these:<br><br>I'm a sl*t, dump me please. I cheated on you not once, twice, but THRICE.<br><br>We're better off as friends. I don't want to marry you.<br><br>I appreciate all that you've done for me but I've come to realise you're not the one I want to live with for life.<br><br>Your friends were right all along. I'm a materialistic B*tch. Dump me. PLEASE.<br><br>Let's break up.<br><br>Any better ones?</div></blockquote>Why don't you tell him this line? He will surely dump you.<br><br>"I used to be a guy, I tried to keep it from you, but I can't live with it"<br><br>Haha</div>
