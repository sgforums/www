Yet, you are wondering if you should hang on for fear of not able to find someone who will love you as much and perhaps, out of commitment.<br><br>Love, is a very strange thing.<br><br>When one is young, physical attraction plays a major part. As one grows older, other factors like ability to provide becomes important. When these needs are satisfied, then, loyalty becomes important.<br><br>Also, does he have habits like cheating, gambling, drinking, smoking or becoming violent? These are factors that might help you to look at relationship objectively.<br><br>Most importantly, you know what you want out of a relationship, and I think being aware and taking the necessary steps to have a fulfilling relationship is important.<br><br>I take it that both of you are still young. Indeed, if the love is not there, frustration would slowly grows into resentment, and one day, things will erupt.<br><br>I think the question is perhaps, if he were to take his 'O' level and continue on his course at Shatec, would you still love him or it does not matter anymore?<br><br>The truth hurts, reality bites, and life goes on.</div></blockquote>He is not that good looking. The only reason I loved him because he was sincere and nice. Until later when I got to know him better did his habits surface. He smokes, drinks and lied. His reluctance to upgrade is a problem since a long time ago. If he upgraded, as in he is WILLING to change and improve himself, I would still be with him.</div>

Call me a jerk or what, I don't farking care alright. But think with your head, not your heart.

But if you are lookin at the long-term, 5-10years or even longer, don't bother. You want to end up just going to ROM to register your marriage and then full-stop? OR do you want to go out and be the bride everybody envies, the star of the day even if its for one day only? What is love?

My ex's friends have been talking to me bout the ex having problems with the guy she's with because he's an ITE dropout and working in the retail line. And this guy can't help her with projects and all that, only know how to go out with her. Thing is as a couple, it is to help and complement each other not suck the soul out of each other. Also Quincy, why stay committed when you know the crack is only going to be wider? Go while you still can. When we guys are desperate, any last ditch method we have we will use. Act cool,beg, threaten its all in the bag of tricks. So you might as well just move on since you feel you deserve better. There's nothing wrong in wanting to protect yourself. Totally nothing wrong in that.</div>

Sometimes, a person will also change when something drastic happen.<br><br>Time revealed the truth, and that was how you got to know him better.

She juz wouldnt want to worry about basic things like utilities and school fees of the kids, or worry about being able to foot the medical fees involved when giving birth to the kids or should anyone fall sick.</div>
