Remove all the noise, about him loving you, you always in hiding, your parents don't like him, financial future, etc.<br><br>After that ask yourself, if you love him, what is it that causes you to want to break off from him? Is it becoz he does not wish to improve himself?<br><br>If that's the case, then tell him honestly why you wish to break off with him, you can give him 6 months (time up to you) to prove himself, if he doesn't learn how to improve, then ask him to ship out. Love is not just words. Love is action. If he knows that to be with you, he must be stronger, he will work hard and show it to you. If he doesn't, its all humbug.<br><br>Of coz, if you do not love him, then break immediately.</div>

To all ladies out there whom say that I don't mind feeding a xiaobai or that you are a professional. Imagine this too, when you got important functions to attend, you bring him along. The guys there are talking about economics, the development in the market, technological advances and what will he be talkin about? He will be so damned lost! If he opens his mouth, he will embarrass you, if he doesn't people will think you issued a gag order or he's being arrogant.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>alright perhaps everyone of us has a different perspective of what love is. well at least to me, love is about both parties accomodating to each other. what's really happening now is, from what i've read so far, the guy is nothing but a PITA to TS. and the guy claimed tt he wants to be a cook, right? talents are inborn but its still all about hardwork and determination in the end. you may be a talent child but you will never be a great cook if you never try.<br><br>IMO i don't see a point in you trying to sustain this relationship anymore. go ahead and move on. currently all you can think of is probaly all the bad points against him. you're already drifting towards the biased side of things. if that's so, just be the bad guy and break things up. yes true that you might have had your honeymoon months way back but it isn't going to be honeymoon for the rest of your life. in poly i bet there's at least a bus full of guys that's of your type. don't hold back the forest just for a tree. <strong>don't let your heart rule over your head</strong>, remember this.<br><br>perhaps to make things easier, just ask your boyfriend to read this thread. perhaps he might be able to figure things out himself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
