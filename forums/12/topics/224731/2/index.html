Duan Zhu Bu Liu Si. Drag around.... you hurt everyone. and Whats the deal..? he damn good to you thats why u dont wan to leave him? you are very selfish aren't you? even when staying on, you seek other men... do you even know what is commitment? sure u have marry him.... lets put it this way... on such a low level phase of a r/s u cant even commit. what makes u think u can later on? you will only see smarter guys, richer guys, funnier guys, sexier guys. so what happens then?<br><br>My advice to you, leave that sorry fucker. let him hurt.... if you care for him, leave him for good. let him hate you. which i know wont last forever. seek out yourself. seek out what you really want. he wants you. and you cant decide. this will drag forever. and its a mental torture. trust me. i've been there... i practically attempted to dig my eye balls out in one event when i flew into a rage right infront of my parents. i hated myself for being so blind loving such a person similar to you. i know u care for him. so leave him and dont be selfish.<br>sorry if i sound emotional, but its only because i know how he feels because i've been thru it. and my r/s was 4 years. and she two timed me.</div>

Education level shouldn't even be a problem at all especially if the guy have the intention to upgrade himself.<br><br>Education level is a different matter compared to age. If you have a big ego and your bf/gf is much higher educated than you you can always upgrade your education level to that of your bf/gf but for age if you are younger than your GF there's nothing you can do about.</div>

Regardless of however he tries to win you back, stand firm on your decision.<br><br>How would you feel if your boyfriend was with you ONLY because he is obliged to and feels sorry for you. I dont think you would appreciate someone being with you only because they feel guilty.<br><br>If you dont want to hurt him anymore. Let him go. Let him find some other girl who loves him back just as much. He deserves that chance. Trust me, its a lot easier to break if off now then drag it along and having to seperate later. Both of you will be more deeply hurt.[/b]</blockquote>I TOLD him to go look for some other girls and that I no longer love him. He knows. But he's just clinging on.</div>
