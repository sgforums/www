It depends on whether you wanna do anything about it. At least, put in effort for your studies, if not for him, at least for your own sake. And you know that the society is cruel, you gonna be independent and can't always depend on your BF.<br>You are still young, as I can see from your age.<br>Everyone make mistakes. Try to learn from your mistakes.<br>It's how you can improve yourself and be a better person.<br>Nobody can help you if you don't help yourself.<br>As for your BF, I don't know about him.<br>He really sound like my buddy.<br>If your BF is really someone like my buddy, most probably he's doing this for your own good.<br>To make you realise not to take things for granted and want you to work hard for your studies.<br>His main priority is not for you to save the relationship. He just want you to study hard, that's all.<br>If it's true, then you gonna work hard and prove it to him.<br>If not, you got nothing to lose.<br>Coz you realise that he's not the one for you, but you still get your qualification.<br>Please take note of this.. Qualification is not <strong>required </strong>in a relationship.<br>Just think about it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
