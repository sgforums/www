            <div class='col-md body'>Chances are always there if u know how to grasp it properly. about the numerous trees notion, it is rite that one should not be too narrow and then miss out someone important , maybe much more than the former one. But then it all depend on ur sense of love for him...how deep u think ur love is for him. It cannot be answered clearly with juz mere words of assurance....prove it to him that ur love is real and convert these flaws to strength. Uncertainty is always there, regardless of how hard we deny or even harder we try. AT least we can brave it and say i haf try my best and haf no regrets...the rest is up to fate and maybe him....be stronger and unleash the power of one's faith. Sorri for the long post...life is like tat ..i too encountering problems tat things we hoped for doesn't come out as expected.....but i believe everyone haf too.....</div>

You as a guy works hard for the money for your gf to spend. You see your gf always wan to win, childish, speak without thinking and slack in her studies. You ask yourself why my gf be someone who cannot take care of herself and I always have to worry for her. Once, twice and so many times I have asked her to change for the better but she just refuse to change.<br><br>Soon you feel tired and lost hope in your gf. The worst part is that she even bug you to meet up when you are working and she even dare to ask if about the future when she cannot even do well in her basic studies.<br><br>Since your role now is your bf what would you do ? Keep saying your gf will change and hope for the best? Come on be more realistic. Will you ever chose a girl like that if you will the guy?<br><br>I am not saying you cannot slack in your studies. Is your choice in life to do that but your bf has chosen that unless you improve yourself he will not take you back. Your bf is actually helping you see the road ahead. He knows if you continue on this path it will only led to a worst future for both of you.<br><br>So if you ask me what your chances are, this is my answer.<br><br>1) If you put in effort to show him that you are willing to work hard, your chances is around 70%<br><br>2) If you continue to slack or always want to win, your chances is 0%<br><br>Is your choice in life, so chose carefully and wisely.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you are emotionally triggered by something a person does, the two of you are probably mirrors for each other. It may appear that you have opposing viewpoints, but internally you are probably very similar. One of you is acting out one side of the internal conflict, while the other one plays out the other side.<br><br>For example, one person may want more commitment in a relationship while the other wants more freedom. They become extremely polarized on this issue and truly believe that they want opposite things. However, if one person suddenly switches their position (the one who wanted commitment suddenly wants freedom) the other person almost always swings to the opposite polarity. The reason for this is that they are attempting to resolve an inner conflict they both have-the desire for closeness and security and the fear of entrapment.<br><br>Once people look inside and become more aware of their feelings, they often recognize that they have simply projected their inner conflict onto the outside world so that they could recognize and deal with it. If a person truly and unequivocally wants a committed relationship, he will simply attract another person who wants the same thing. If someone feels completely clear about wanting to explore being with many partners, he simply does it. By using the mirror process, you can recognize what you really feel and learn to be more honest with yourself. Once you recognize an internal conflict, you can ask the universe for help in resolving it and integrating your feelings.<br><br>Seeing the world as your mirror also gives you wonderful opportunities to receive positive feedback. Think of everything that you like and enjoy about your life right now. You created these things-they are also your mirrors. Think of the people you know whom you love, enjoy, respect and admire. They are your mirrors. They couldn't even be in your life if they didn't reflect you: you would not be able to recognize their positive qualities if you didn't have similar ones. Think of the people and animals that love you. They are a mirror of how you love yourself. If you have a home that you love, or a particular spot in nature that is very beautiful to you, it is a mirror of your own beauty. When you see beauty anywhere, it's a reflection of yourself.<br></div>
