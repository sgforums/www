            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, there's this girl I've seen around a few times before sitting on the Bus and MRT since she stays around the same area as me and goes to the same school too (just different course). All I can say is I find her attractive. Anyways I saw her again on Tuesday on the way to school in the bus and later sat next to her on the MRT. Since I'm hopelessly single and really bored a thought popped through my mind somewhere halfway in the journey. Why don't I get her number, since well...that's what people to to express interest right? But I'm kinda shy so I didn't not in front of all the people in the MRT and especially not in front the the Ah Pek in the seat across that kept staring at the girl.<br><br>Anyways I thought of it a while and then finally decided what the heck. The adrenaline could do me some good and what have I to lose? So we got off and then after walking to the school I caught up with her and asked her for her number. Well she gave it to me told me her name shook hands and I asked her if she would like to meet for lunch sometime. She said not a good idea since she's always hanging out with her friends. I smiled and said ok, we took our separate ways since she seemed quite in a hurry and I was late for class too.<br><br>Since I'm a complete idiot when it comes to these kind of things. I didn't do anything that day. I was pretty much still in shock that I would so such a thing and that she actually gave me her number. A pleasant shock nontheless. To tell the truth now I don't know what to do. In the past I've always had the luck to have girls take the initiative so ha I have no idea how to actually get to know this person. I was too shy to call so I messaged her the next day to say hi and so she got my number too. My friend scold me for being an idiot and I shouldave called her the day before.<br><br>Now it's 2 days past and no reply from her. So yeah, I'm feeling quite stupid right now. Feel free to comment on how silly I am or what I should do.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You can try calling or more sms? I'm not exactly sure what she's was feeling back then when she was giving her number to you... But it could have been just a friendly gesture?<br><br>But at this point my guess would be either she's currently kinda busy and occupied, or she's not interested at all.. Besides.. You gave it a lag time in between.. Which some girls might view it as a form of insincerity...<br><br>From surface analysis, your chances are not good... You might stand a better chance if you see her again IN PERSON and try to strike up a better conversation..?</div>
