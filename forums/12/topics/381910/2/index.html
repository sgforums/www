              <p>Your first sentence is already a bald lie.  You weren't
              thinking at all - as you've done many a time before, you were just
              spewing the first bit of crap that occurred to you and hoping that
              nobody would notice what crap it really was.</p>

              <p>TS, this character above is a perfect negative demonstration if
              you're thinking of achieving things.  He's so busy fantasising
              what he would be if he had the capability that he's failed to
              appreciate what a complete waste of skin he really is.</p>

              <p>honestly speaking, you should talk to your parents or friends instead of posting on this forum. We can't really help you.  I assume that you are in your teenage years and life will be better when u reach 30....I hope...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
