              <p>Only babies are born and nobody is born a failure, it is only the things that happen in our life, the choices that we make that leads us to <strong>think</strong> that we are a failure.</p>
              <p>Who you are trying to satisfy or please truely depend on <strong>who</strong> much you put in significance of your work. Many times we are trying to gain acceptence from the people closest to us, the sign of approval and trust..</p>
              <p>We tend to put our significance on the things we have done, the things we own, the approval from the people, and how people think of us. But little did we realize that all we need to do to put ourselves out of this <strong>"failure" </strong>mindset is to approve of ourselves and <strong>acccepting who you are. </strong></p>
              <p>You are not the handsome hunk at the Mr. World contest</p>
              <p>You are not Bill gates the multimillionare</p>
              <p>You are not the sibling that seem to achieve more then you</p>
              <p>You are not the person that your parent <strong>hoped </strong></p>
              <p><strong>But in fact You are who you are! </strong></p>
              <p>maybe it is time to rethink of who to put your significance in.</p>

              You are the one who determine your success;

              <p>It's not an indirect post at all.  If you missed the VERY direct point that you need to rethink that bullshit conclusion, you need to check what's stopping your lift from going to the top floor, junior.</p>

              <p>Your first sentence is already a bald lie.  You weren't thinking at all - as you've done many a time before, you were just spewing the first bit of crap that occurred to you and hoping that nobody would notice what crap it really was.</p>
