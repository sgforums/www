            <div class='col-md body'>My gf and i have been together for 1 yr while now (her parents know i'm with her) she is in Aust studying for her degree. Along with her are 2 guys from her poly tagging along with her. (staying under 1 roof). 1 of them has been waiting for her for the past 5 years. (sorry guys/gals if u heard this b4)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Just last week something bad happen. M guy (Starts with his surname) fell off the balcony from the 3rd level where they stay together in the hostel. Ever since my gf Y has been blaming herself for his accident. My gf didn't tell M's family abt it until the next day when M needed to have an operation (in Aust). She called them, soon enough M's family flew from S'pore to Aust. M's family blame her (indirectly) for not informing them earlier. But from wht i heard from my gf is tht it is M who doesn't wish to inform his parents. And yet when M's family saw him lying in the hospital, he did not clarify with his parents abt the reason behind the delay. (R maybe he wasn't aware) Anyway now my gf withdrew herself in self pity.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Micheal another guy who tag along with them for studies, didn't help out with the registration of hospital and ambulance during tht day of incident. (What an asshole)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> My gf did the procedure of registration, calling the ambulance, inform M's parents and guide them around from hospital to their hostel and back. All this while she didn't have the time to study for her papers which is due 2 weeks later.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> We spoke on the phone yesterday (i called her after she msg me, she in Aust, we spoke for 1 hr. My hp bills gonna be damn ex) She was crying on the other line telling me she was stress up, can't focus, can't concentrate to study...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> My plan to her was to cut short her studies and cum to S'pore to study. She can stay in my house if her parents starts to nag at her.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Am i being to selfish to ask her to stop studying in Aust since she is so stress up with studies there and cum back to Spore to work n study with me? She get to stay in my room if she wants. At least in S'pore i m here to support her, a shoulder to cry on, help her in her studies. Provide physical n emotional support. She said no.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> Her reason, her parent paid $40 000 for her studies, she would be letting them down if she were to quit now and study in Spore. She told me i wouldn't understand of the consequences lies ahead if she were to quit her studies in Aust to study in Spore. She couldn't stand the pressure tht her parents would gif her if she cums back. Would her parents forced her to study without knowing it could lead her to commit suicide? Would her parents allow this to happen?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> Instead of the 1 1/2 year in Aust now she is dropping a few modules which could mean 2 years in Aust to study. Wht the fuck the more time she spend in Aust the more $$ she would hve to spend to stay there. And yet her parents support tht.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> My gf told me to be prepare if I didn't hear any news from her no more. She told me she would commit suicide if she feels to stress up and pressurise. What am i as a bf ought to do? I working 4 jobs to study my degree next year hopping she would be back by the time i get enough $$ to study. I told her to think b4 i hang up, i would sacrifice anything for u to cum back to study with me. But if u wish to sacrifice everything to see God earlier, by all means go ahead. I told her to think abt it.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  Guys u tell me, if u were in my situation wht would u do. Abandon her to her own downfall r stay by her hopping she would turn round and be back with me?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> Gals u tell me would u sacrifice ur studies and ur parents to be with ur bf who is willing to support u n b by ur side throughout working n studying together? R would u face the death, running away from studies and ur parent's face. Would u go ahead and study n force urself to study to save ur parents face?<br>I <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> 'm actually quite pissed with her thinking abt going to die as an easy way out. Is it so hard for her to drop her studies in Aust to cum n join me working n studying in Spore. She told me i'm being immature and it wouldn't work out. But wht would? Me working n studying and she forcing herself to study under pressure from parents and her trauma seeing M falling off the balcony, in time she would commit sucide?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Help me i felt like breaking up with her, I'm taking 4 jobs is hard enough for me physically and now this emotional drag by her. I'M GOING CRAZY!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Usually, gals who keep saying they are damn stressed out and feeling like life has no other meaning just need a sympathy ear. a ear that just LISTENS to her and not to give any form of solution.

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree.. i think maybe you should try your best to talk to her as often as you can... lend her an ear.. try to make her happy... send her some flowers or some stuff to cheer her up... all this goin to cost you, but if you think she's worth it then, cost shouldn't be a problem.<br><br>i mean this kinda problems happen all the time to a lot of people, though not as extreme as this... you must understand that if she does come back, her parents are going to be EXTREMELY pissed with her, i mean it would be totally irresponsible of her to just drop her studies halfway and come back, rite?<br><br>so let her finish her studies, but in the meantime, you should give her strong emotional support, call her more etc etc ...<br><br>just my 5 cents worth...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
