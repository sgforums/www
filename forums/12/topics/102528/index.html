            <div class='col-md body'>Lets start with something small then, hopefully other people can be encouraged into posting some more tips in thread.<br><br>Although small talk may seem insignificant, it is one of the best ways of introducing yourself to a complete stranger. Many might say that in singapore it is hard to make small talk simply because singaporeans don't seem approachable enough. However, you'll be surprised to know that alot of Singaporeans are more then happy to engage in a bit of chatter now and then. The tips in here aren't enough to make you proficient at small talks though, its the practice that you are willing to put yourself through that counts.<br><br>How to Make Small Talk<br>Small talk can be a big challenge, but a little preparation and confidence is all you need.<br><br>Steps:<br>1.   Practice. Converse with everyone you come across: cashiers, waiters, people you're in line with, neighbors, co-workers and kids. Chat with folks unlike yourself, from seniors to teens to tourists.<br><br>2.   Read everything: cookbooks, newspapers, magazines, reviews, product inserts, maps, signs and catalogs. Everything is a source of information that can be discussed.<br><br>3.   Force yourself to get into small talk situations, like doctors' waiting rooms, cocktail parties and office meetings. Accept invitations, or host your own gathering.<br><br>4.   Immerse yourself in culture, both high and low. Television, music, sports, fashion, art and poetry are great sources of chat. If you can't stand Shakespeare, that too is a good topic for talk.<br><br>5.   Keep a journal. Write down funny stories you hear, beautiful things you see, quotes, observations, shopping lists and calls you made. That story of the long-distance operator misunderstanding you could become an opening line.<br><br>6.   Talk to yourself in the mirror. Make a random list of topics and see what you have to say on the subjects. Baseball, Russia, butter, hip-hop, shoes ... the more varied your list, the better.<br><br>7.   Expand your horizons. Go home a new way. Try sushi. Play pinball. Go online. Paint a watercolor. Bake a pie. Try something new every day.<br><br>8.   Be a better listener. Did your boss just say she suffers from migraines? Did your doctor just have twins? These are opportunities for making small talk.<br><br>9.   Work on confidence, overcoming shyness and any feelings of stage fright. Remember, the more you know, the more you know you can talk about.<br><br>10.  Ask the person questions about themselves; however avoid personal ones. Begin with a question that will get you a simple reply and go from there. Most importantly, though, is to be yourself.<br><br>11.  Keeping in mind that not all of us possess the quick of wit nor the glib of tongue, it would be good to start off your small conversations with a few of your practice lines. Getting involved in a topic that you are more familiar with allows you to more freely manipulate where you want the conversation to head.<br><br>12.  Stretch your comfort levels, if you find small talk with strangers uncomfortable, try starting small. Say for starters you are waiting at the busstop, give a brief comment on the weather and check for their response. Repeat with different situations till you feel comfortable enough to proceed with the next step. If you feel uncomfortable starting conversations with the opposite gender, try starting with a conversation with someone of your gender to gather confidence.<br><br>13.  Smile. Bear in mind all small talks are supposed to be friendly, people are much much more receptive to conversations when there's a smile on your face.<br><br>14.  If the idea of starting a conversation with a stranger scares you, try going online.<br><br>Tips:<br>Be yourself. Keep in mind that confidence and humor are superb substitutes for comedic genius or wit.<br><br>Remember, you never have to do it alone.<br><br>Keep a few exit lines in mind too. For example, "Thanks for the wonderful chat, but I must make believe I'm interested in everybody else. Tee hee."<br><br>Warnings:<br>Keep your fellow chatterers in mind; naughty stories and loose language will be frowned upon in many circles. By the same token, your French quips and scientific discourses will be wasted on some.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think  most people here are just very shallow and conformed. They only wanna talk with whoever it is they USUALLY talk to, and if anyone new comes into the picture, they give u these "wtf u doing here" looks and they ignore u and only focus ont heir existing friends. Its just very shallow of people here, sorry for being candid.<br><br>The only counter arguement would be sgforums, which is why i am inclined to maybe go for an outing.. but trouble is.. perhaps the same thing happens in real life? i dunno. I see it in adults too.</div>
