You are upper sec student and she is lower sec student. Solely based on this fact alone, get your priority straight. Finish your education first and you won't go wrong. Why?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> In your conversations with her, there are more craps than substance. If both of you can talk about career, finance, marriage, future, etc., then you can get serious about starting a romantic relationship. Still, I against it if you are still a student in primary, seconday school, junior college and university.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You are limiting your interaction to her only instead of interacting with the rest of the gals. Get socially active with everyone, be it guys or gals, so that you are able to understand different social setting. Come handy when start to work.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You are creating more financial burden to your parents. Remember, the SMS and internet connection are not totally free of charge? If you pay the bills, then ignore this point.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Your relationship would not last long. Why? Refer to my first point and your own statement, "<span style="font-style: italic;">in reality, not much interaction yet.....</span>". It can get serious unless she is very timid or quiet type.<br><br>Let me apologise to you beforehand for being frank with you on such matter.<br><br></div>
