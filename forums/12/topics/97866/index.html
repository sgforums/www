She told me to choose to be lyke now and bond the r/s frm here or keep a distance and start as friend.. she let me choose..<br><br>she is the who lead me on and now come lidat and sae dunwanna hurt me more and didn't reject me either.. dun get it.. she dunhave anyone in mind either.. im confused</div>

Sometimes, its better to be frens than be attached.. You don wanna go into a r/s and when things don work out, you 2 seperate and than things get worst and you can't even be frens with her and worst not able to call or ask her out??
