              <p>Sorry to hear you feel that way about love.</p>
              <p>'I Love You' is one of the most abused phrase in humanity. Take a look at Planet Earth's divorce rates. Even spoken and vowed under oath, can this phrase be broken. You realized now, do you?</p>
              <p>Yet it is one of the most cherished and treasured phrase any human would long and even die for, if it is meant with all honesty and taken seriously. Which is why there is more married couples than divorcees.</p>
              <p>Know then the importance and value of this phrase. We all make mistakes, but will learn, just as you learnt how you felt when such phrase was not taken seriously.</p>
              <p>Therefore be sure that when you next utter it to someone else, you mean every word of it. Change begins with us.</p>

                  <p>well, it's long distance so i can't be sure 100%.  but somehow i keep getting that impression.  maybe it's due to her past when she did the same thing.  that created an impression in my mind which i try to overlook, but which keeps getting validated by her actions and words.</p>
                      <p>i'm also trying to understand why i feel this way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
                      <p>perception is reality.  what could have caused that perception ?</p>

              <p>hmmmm i can't answer this cos i also dunno.  she says a lot to assure me, but the fire in my heart always get poured cold water the next minute with something she said/did.
              
              it's not that i can't forgive and forget.  just that the past has made a very strong imprint on my subconscious.  often i respond instinctively and this association is made instinctively.  
              
              on the other hand, maybe the perception is true ?  haha i dunno lah</p>

              <p>The only way to know is to be aware of how much she places value on her words to others. Does she often say one thing to someone then do something else?</p>
              <p>Watch her character, acknowledge her flaws. A leopard does not change its spots, so all the more easier for you to assess her. What she can do to others, she too can do to you.</p>
              <p>Knowledge is power. Power to effect the necessary changes, for the truth will set you free and drop those blinkers from your eyes. Either that,or  it may change your misplaced perceptions about her and be reassured in a relationship with her.</p>
              <p>The keyword is character. Some can hide for one day, one week, one month. But before long, the mask will eventually fall, as sure as the rain falls down to earth and not the other way around.</p>

              <p>desensitivity to the words of love may do u good in the long run my dear friend.</p>
              <p>afterall, we live in modern times, in the age of un-innocence. bonds are formed, promises are made and broken faster than a full moon's run, sometimes you gotta just roll with it without looking in too deep. don't take things, human beings, girls, setbacks and victories too seriously before due time. </p>
              <p>life can be long or short, depends on how u look at it. u'll meet many more after her, like u've met many before her. sometimes it helps to acquire a certain sense of indifference to survive unscathed, some call it self preservation, others find better words.</p>
              <p>me thinks love urself first, u can't go wrong with that.</p>
