              <p><br>Sms may get you to a certain level, but the sincerity is still not there, and do you know the within we gals, when a guy sms, we alway share with other gals and laugh over it, then we play game with the guy who sms us, then another gal got sms, then we giggle and discuss what to send back. You may become a laughing stock ok.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But by calling it is privacy, one on one, more direct, sincere, clarity and most importantly, it show the guy commitment and guts to call us and date us out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If u got a hp to call, why SMS?? SMS is mend for cases where you cannot get the person, he or she is engaged, or you have no intention for a reply, or you are in a meeting, very busy or just passing an information like no eating tonite etc etc...</p>

              <p><br>For mature lady, you need to call or meet up, sms is going fail you on the spot, like my beautiful auntie 28yo, she got so many sms that she dun even bother, sometime i peek at her hp and found stupid uncles sms so long for what??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mature one dun play play around, they dun like noisy places anymore, they like well dressed, well cleaned and mannered guy who respect them, of course when the topics of discussion will be very much different, they talk about career, family, future plans and life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As far as i am concern, for mature gal like my auntie, you dun chase them, you make fren with them as any ordinary fren, then you date them often and get to understand each other more...the most important thing is that you need a car to pick them and try to call them often. Their analysis of a guy a take longer time then a XMM like me, cos now is not play play time, and usually they consult other as they have experience enuff to make the decision, but once they decided to go for you and love you, you better dun disappoint them. When my auntie last broke with her bf, she dun spoke to us for 3 days lor.</p>
