Then life began seriously boring, no one in my cls shared the same interest as me. That probably could be understandable, but when i tried to engaged them in current affairs... their next setence is, "ok, we understand, tt's enough" So my clsmates can ask some ?????? qns such as "What is SAR (when they saw Hong Kong SAR)?" and "what's G-7?"<br><br>Aside from tt, i usually crack some lame jokes for entertainment, but my clsmates didn't like tt, so i tried not to talk alot.
