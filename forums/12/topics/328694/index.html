              <p>I think in many things in life... it's quite similar also rt?</p>
              <p>E.g. 1 - New job: first few months, very on the ball. After a while, slack. Years later, backside itchy &amp; look for new job.</p>
              <p>E.g. 2 - New car: first few months up to a year, every day sayang car. Check for scratches every day. Some time later, sian liao... wanna change car.</p>
              <p>Of course, some things are more impt than others. In a relationship, the challenging part is to rekindle the relationship with new excitement. Can u think of any examples?</p>

              <p>Pardon me (my next few questions might be thought-provoking), so does this also mean an ok-to-do gf means an ok-to-do relationship? In time, when passion dies down, will you accept it as an 'ok' process instead of truly examining why? Will you try your ass off to re-ignite the fire or would you think it's silly to even try any 'antics' at all because it has never been heard of and will make you look funny? Do you think the girl you like would want to have such an 'ok' relationship?</p>
              <p>And when an 'ok' relationship is not 'ok' (we all know that it's common for men and women to have differences and conflict), are the men and women going to have roving eyes for other people out there, extreme dissatisfaction in a relationship, <span class="results-bar"><strong><em>unexplainable </em></strong></span>anger and boredom at each other, even without physically straying away from the relationship?</p>
