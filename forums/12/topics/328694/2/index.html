              <p>Singaporeans are generally complacent. The danger of this is
              that it affects us not only in our career advancement, but also in
              terms of our romance i.e. our bgr.</p>
              <p>Example:</p>
              <p>In the world of work, a lot of big companies lose their
              competitive edge that comes from hard work, research, planning,
              taking risks, because they become too comfortable and and stop
              looking for innovative ways to stay ahead of competition.</p>
              <p>In a relationship, a couple loses that spark they get when they
              first started off a romance because they get too comfortable as
              time goes by. They stop wanting to get to know each other better
              and stop trying out new things, hence their relationship stale and
              instead of looking into their relationship, they mistakenly think
              that the "pasture is greener on the other side." Therefore, the
              vicious cycle of unfulfillment no matter what relationship they
              land themselves in.</p>

              <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">In a relationship, a couple loses that spark they get when they first started off a romance because they get too comfortable as time goes by. They stop wanting to get to know each other better and stop trying out new things, hence their relationship stale and instead of looking into their relationship, they mistakenly think that the "pasture is greener on the other side." Therefore, the vicious cycle of unfulfillment no matter what relationship they land themselves in.</span></em></p>
              <p>There are always two sides to a situation; won't you agree that familarity may also breeds contempt? The spark get doused by new discoveries of a less combustible element in your other half. the world gets dimmer. then you realise that the <strong>spark that evolve from curiousity takes the backseat after confirming your curiousity</strong>. Relationships don't stale when you get too comfortable. No. relationship stales when one/both of you is comfortable enough to say "no" to each other. <strong>rejection stales relationship</strong>, not comfort.</p>

              <p>But the spark has to be sustained by other elements which require effort, commitment and respect. All relationships will have their fair share of <strong>rejections</strong> when both parties are in their comfort zone. A relationship thrives only if it can withstand the rejections and achieve an understanding between both parties.</p>
