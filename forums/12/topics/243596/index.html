Once she agree then go for her friend.<br><br>2) The safe  way<br><br>Call your gf friends and ask her out ask a friend, know her, understand her as a friend and see that if she is suitable for you. You may find her attractive at first but when you know her friend better then you may realise that she may not suit  you.<br><br>3) The mean way<br><br>2 time your gf by going out with her friend. But before you used this method you need to be cunning, lots of free time, lots of cash and handsome enough. Or else you will fail so badly that you end up losing the 2 girls.<br><br>By my experience I can predict what would happen<br><br>You will find your gf's friend to be  much more attractive than current your gf cos you are sick and tired of her. If she can stand your picking on her, the relationship will go on but if she cannot stand she will break up with you.<br>But be warn if you do not break up properly she may bad mouth about you in front of her friend and you still end up losing both.</div>
