            <div class='col-md body'>Hi.<br><br>Nowadays, I find that I'm always in a dilemma -- that is, I always feel that personal free time is very scarce and needs to be fully-utilized, but yet I've trouble finding and deciding what exactly to do in order to convince myself that it is time well-spent and making myself happy and satisfied.<br><br>You see there is a strange contradiction here. On one side, I feel that there is not enough time for myself. Yet on the other side, it seems that I'm bored and doesn't know what to do, and usually people only feels bored when they have too much free time on their hand, which I feel I've too little instead.<br><br>For example on weekends, sometimes I feel like going out for a movie or window shopping in some shopping mall. But after visiting a few different malls, I feel that all the malls are the same, selling more or less the same things, with the same outlets and nothing new to see or get excited so I suddenly will feel I've wasted my precious weekend personal time. A movie usually will take up 2 hours or so, and counting in travelling time to the theatre, purchasing tickets and some lag time for waiting etc., at least 4 hours would be gone, and if go out with friends, more time is spent on socializing and having meals and the whole day is gone just like that.<br><br>So now, not that I'm anti-social and doesn't like friends. But feels that the time for myself has become zero and usually won't invite friends out. And I feel that Singapore doesn't seem to have anything new or exciting to offer. Everyone seems to be doing the same thing and living the same kind of life. I'm even comtemplating finding opportunity to go abroad and live for a while so that I can experience new things and perhaps come back with fresh perspectives on everything.<br><br>Currently, I've become a drifter, studying and working hard on weekdays but aimlessly letting life goes by on weekends. And I feel I've lost control over what I want to do in life. While studying and busy with projects and assignments, I feel that what I'm doing is not for myself, but to satisfy the whimsical academic fetish of some professors (I'm currently  in university).<br><br>Do you think I seriously need to see a psychiatrist or speak to a counselling officer?</div>

Sometimes people do think about their own life... Such reflections... You're only one of them...?<br><br>Your concerns.. Think about it as spiritual over logic... Living sometimes is not only about getting what accomplished and the maximal use of life... Even heard of people who always do routine things and wondering where their life has gone to...?<br><br>Sometimes it's good to think of how to live a more meaningful and to fully make use of your time efficiently... Other times, don't forget to LIVE... Afterall, isn't that what life is really all about? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

All these are making your current life miserable right now.<br><br>Don't think and worry too much over it. Instead call a few friends out or at least get one of your friend to go out with you. If you imagine the outcome of the outing by yourself, it will become bored to you as the uncertaincies factors are not there anymore. So for once, let go of your worries and go hang out and accompany your friend.<br><br>You are probably too stress with your daily routine life and needed a good rest. If there is time, go and sleep then. More sleep and rest will do you good psychologically. Having 3 proper meals a day will also contribute to your own personal well-being and you will be feeling much better.<br><br>Just don't forget to give your friends a short call once in a while to maintain contact and also it will boost your personal confidence level.<br><br>Good luck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
