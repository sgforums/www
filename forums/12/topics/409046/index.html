              <p>No point losing sleep over sucking job. You are lucky, I am underloaded and job is boring. I try to ask and even hint that I can be more useful to the company but nobody cares. I brought it up to the big boss, he makes fun of me because he has too much ego, cannot accept a more junior staff letting him know that he can do more for the company, instead the big boss misconstrue it as an attack on his pride because he thinks the staff is instructing him but actually the staff is letting him know he can do more to help improve the company. You see? People ego is</p>
              <p>Very hard to find a job that makes us happy. You can move to the 10th job also you won't find a good one. But I can assure you, some jobs may turn out better than the last. Move if you can but only after some time at your job so you can show that you are not a job hopper and you can work at a place, given a period of time.</p>
              <p>My friend at a prominent MNC IT company moved after 3 years. He told me he had enough of the work there. He movde to another MNC company. People tell him grass is not greenier on the other side. But I say hey he made the right decision because he tried to do his best at his last place and now he is trying out a new one. At least he has 3 years to show to his new employer that he can do the job and he can stay. So the previous employer have no excuse to say that he bow out early and can give a decent feedback when employer do a reference check.</p>

              <p>if this is a problem with your specific company, change the company you work for. if this is par for this type of job, and you cant manage it, change career.</p>
              <p>but based on general knowledge, you will find all companies have some level of this sort of behaviour/mis-management. and yet they still manage to stay in the competition. however, some companies are better than others, and you might be able to find one that you can handle.</p>

              <p>what if AugSky change job and turns out new job even worse than the current one? Truth is, grass may not be grenier but the shit may be shittier. AugSky should learn how to handle stress in current job then when ready, and there is no progress at current place, time to make a move. So in case if AugSky end up in the same kind of company AugSky know what to do or at least know how to access the company and potential boss during interview.</p>
