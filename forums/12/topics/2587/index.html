            <div class='col-md body'>First of all.<br>Affairs.<br>Why do they happen ?<br>Usually, its because a guy or girl gets bored of his current relationship(r/s for short) with his or her partner.<br>Or it could be that the guy or girl..(usually the guy) gets enticed or seduced by another female, even thought the female knows that he's married ... with the reason being ... "I like mature guys."<br><br>It might also depend on how many times the guy sees the girl ... if they're working together its worse ... and so on.<br><br>And on the topic of r/s being fragile today ... i think it's true. Relationships have always been very fragile. People nowadays only want the BEST for themselves... Usually neglecting others in their persuit of eternal happiness. Yet this can hardly happen ... in normal r/s' ... quarrels can happen, and more often then not, the guy will see his fellow colleagues or fall for another girl more easily ... It's all psychological and depends on the feelings. Yet if the guy is determined enough NOT to breach the vow he made during the marriage ... he should be able to refrain.<br><br>What i'm saying is ... When two people decide to become one, They have best be prepared to overcome many obstacles to make their r/s a nice one ... Never take a r/s lightly and try to place your partner's welfare above your own ... or there will be more and more divorces and break-ups ...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've read in a newspaper article before where they did a little survey on married man. More than half of them will have affairs. It's so common. Some say they feel bored making love to the same woman all the time. Find a woman outside satisfies his sexual fantasy. And in some other countries, having a mistress is a common thing. In those countries, man still think they are the superior ones. My parents are Taiwanese and many of my relatives have a second wife. Even my grandma is a 'xiao lao po'. My cousin's mom used to be a night hostress, now she sticks with my uncle with no name in marriage and that has affected my cousin's growth as a normal individual. He suffers from a lot mental problems. He looks normal but actually his behaviour at times isn't. He did not see or known his father's existence till he was around 12 years old. It was only then his father's wife in marriage allowed him to acknowledge his other 'family'. Alot of times, children are the ones who suffer when affairs happen. They are truly the innocent party. And as our society progresses, people become more well-to-do, they become more self-centred, more selfish and do whatever they please without thinking that it may hurt someone they love or hurt those who love them. It's really a sad thing to see how our society has become. I really hope people will become more sensitive to others and be less selfish and be more truthful and responsible towards their life partner and not do things to betray their love and break their wedding vows.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There're simply too many type of people in this world... Like I'd always said... You don't see OR you don't know DOESN'T imply that they don't exist.... And sometimes things can be much more COMPLICATED than you think...? Alot of time I would urge you not even to think about it... Afterall, alot of things ESPECIALLY when it comes to relationships don't always boil down to 'A' or 'B'... The WRONG or RIGHT.....<br><br>Like what's mentioned above in the other post, humans tend to think 'selfish' (in my case, I would rather like to put it as know how to think for themselves...)... In relationships, you either learn to reach a mutual agreement OR you don't.... When you DON'T, you either TOLERATE, BREAK or ESCAPE.... Extramarital relationships or ADULTERY being one examples of the 'ESCAPE'....<br><br>Due to MORAL VALUE, many would LABEL some of the options carried out as WRONG or SELFISH.... ESPECIALLY when the situation BENEFITS them to have it LABELLED that way.... But PARDON ME if I have to say this? Sometimes CHOOSING an 'ESCAPE' isn't really as BAD as having 'TOLERANCE' - which might lead to FURTHER DESTRUCTION or 'BREAK' - which might lead to TOTAL DESTRUCTION and 'DAMAGE' to innocent individuals.... That OF COURSE, would have to depends on the SITUATION? Which seems a BAD IDEA still can be a 'better idea' at times when really compared to the other options available... Though I have to admit that many a time people just THOUGHT that it is a 'great idea' at moment of OVER-SIMPLIFYING the situation and having situation really running out of hand.....<br><br>Last but NOT least, in order for AFFAIRS to happen, I MUST say it USUALLY don't take ONE HAND TO CLAP.... Partner might be SEDUCED or TEMPTED (mainly 3rd party's fault); partner might have NEGLECTED the other partner OR WORSE STILL been TOTALLY SELFISH (mainly 1st party's fault); partner might be wildful, playful or flirtious type (mainly 2nd party's fault... But still... You CHOSE him/her? ~Shrug...~ Plus &amp; minus I guess..?).... In other situations, things might even be MUCH MORE COMPLICATED.... In situations like those it's USUALLY BETTER NOT to dig into a BOTTOMLESS HOLE and have the matter dragging on like FOREVER..? Better to just SEAL things up and get on with life than to waste your hormones, energy and time....<br><br>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT. FOR what I AM is CUT so DEEP inside of ME.<br>I LIVE my FLESH and SOUL ONLY to BLEED for the OTHERS.<br>FEAR ME NOT. FOR I AM YOUR 'MASTER'. GIVE YOU STRENGTH. FOR YOU ARE MY 'ENEMY'.<br>DEVIL PHRASE I<br><br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....  DEVIL PHRASE II<br><br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>
