From your questions of whether would he treat her well to if he would bed her is completely IRRELEVANT to you. Why? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Are you her boyfriend</strong></span>?<br><br>Then? It seemed that you are more affected by the thought of her being in someone else's embrace, not so much about HER, individually as a person. And what if EVEN she did went bed with him... what makes you think it's TRICKED and not willingness? What if it's your dream girl who initiated the sex? (And don't come and tell me its impossible because you are not her. Nothing is impossible and this is absolute).<br><br>Don't be naive. Your sour jealousy is because your mind tells you that you have 'lost' something, when in fact, you didn't have to preceive this way. Will she 'seemed' different just because she ended up with someone else and NOT with you, regardless of what 'they' do prior in the relationship?<br><br>Facts are thrown into your face; she is taken, you are so much slower or, again, irrelevant even if you are on time (Meaning, no chemistry no feelings from her).<br><br>Learn acceptance.<br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> And Ayukat, you can keep the fighting spirit and die without knowing why.

You can fight a thousand battle and lose that thousand battle because you don't even phucking know what a battle is all about. Please lar, you think in a war, it's all about fighting melee, range or whatsoever sh!t that would induce bloodshed?<br><br>Pester her until she gives in? You reminded and reinforced the old Psychology, Astrology and AOS theories in my mind - about how we would revert back to the attitude in our childhood whenever we faced robust difficulty, stress, rejections or objections.<br><br>You <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>don't </strong></span>have the ability to make her love you.<br><br>And if she doesn't love you, you can <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>never </strong></span>make her happy.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Quit deluding as if you could actually create an impact</strong></span>, by doing what you are doing.

But please refrain from trying to convince her of the aforementioned, it will compromise your integrity.<br><br>Until proven that her boyfriend isn't right for her, just be gracious, wish her all the best &amp; let go.
