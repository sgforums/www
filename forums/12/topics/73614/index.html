Took out discman, pluck the earphones into my ear and waited patiently for my stop.<br><br>In front of me, I saw this lady and beside her was this little boy. Boy age check: about 6 years old. Facial check - both of them are related by blood - One mother one child. Checking body language revealed the woman currently annoyed or silently pissed over something. Position not defensive, but was visibly irritated.<br><br>Finger check - married.<br><br>There was this guy beside the kid. Facial check - the dad and he is very young as well. Right arm 15 - 25 degree in position towards child, foot position and area of constant vision, expression and other minor little - he wants to clear up something, but he didn't knew how. He was anxious, but lost/ no good with words. Overall check revealed a possible Cancer or a Virgo.<br><br>Double check - both are very young when married. Possible shotgun. (Estimated Age minus kids age) All from deduction. Woman's figure check as well.<br><br>Kid played a fool, dad punch lightly in the side of his tummy and scolded him softly. On a good note: from body language: lady at least still care abt the child. She didn't wash her hands off everything.<br><br>The scene I was having is a family with a child, totally oblivious to his environment, in between his parents in midst of a quarrel.<br><br>***<br><br>Bottomline is: The child always suffer.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
