              <p>currently in J1 and I know it's too early to have this idea but I really think that I'm not ready for JC. Firstly I'm not coping well with homework even...then I'm also stressed with my cca( competitive sports) . I know its my fault that I even joined one that's beyond my limits and  I should drop the cca but I really like the sport..can't imagine myself joining another cca and how do i face my ex-cca mates. So Im thinking of stopping sch this year and enter JC next year again...but idk if any JC would want to accept me. Poly is out of the question because I really don't know what course to take. </p>
              <p>I entered a JC with a quite gd L1R5 considering the JC standard. By right I should be coping well but I'm not. I feel so weak. If I really were to drop out of school this year, I would be working ..then maybe I can sort everything out. Basically I have been rotting for the past few years. Im always feeling unhappy ...and i think i have depression but haven told anyone yet. Dont dare to. I have family problems too..that's why I dont' want to add on my mum's worries already but she's starting to warn me about my studies. </p>

              <p>Studies &gt; CCA, always keep that in mind.</p>
              <p>If you cannot cope with both studies and CCA, let go of your CCA.</p>
              <p>Don't bother when the school says you must have a CCA .... bla bla bla .... so on and so for. They can't expel you or punish you for not having a CCA.</p>
              <p>If you need any help on your studies (especially maths), just post here, or post on Yahoo answers. </p>
              <p>Anyway, you are expected to burn the midnight oil if you want to do well for JC studies, so coming back 1 year later will likely make no difference. </p>

              <p>even if you drop out, you will still end up facing the same problems again.</p>
              <p>just endure on. even at the worst scenario, retaining is more useful than dropping out, where at least you continue to learn something, as oppose to doing nothing.</p>

              <p>i recall spending most of my after-school time on my CCA. very common to stay till 8-9pm on weekdays. and often, my weekends are burnt up too, especially when approaching competition period.</p>
              <p>Technically, it is not compulsory to join any CCA, since uni admission now no longer requires CCA points.</p>
              <p>However, the school will usually try to enforce compulsory CCA. if not everyone dun join cca how?</p>

              <p>By right, yes. By left, no.</p>
              <p>You can just try to make yourself as invisible as possible, and not boast around that you do not have a CCA.</p>
              <p>At the worst, the teachers will just nag and nag and nag about how important CCA is and how Unis will look at you when they found out you do not have a CCA (Yeah...right....)</p>
              <p>CCA only matters for discrete admission or when you are competing for a place in straight-A courses such as medicine.</p>

              <p>currently in J1 and I know it's too early to have this idea but I really think that I'm not ready for JC. Firstly I'm not coping well with homework even...then I'm also stressed with my cca( competitive sports) . I know its my fault that I even joined one that's beyond my limits and  I should drop the cca but I really like the sport..can't imagine myself joining another cca and how do i face my ex-cca mates. So Im thinking of stopping sch this year and enter JC next year again...but idk if any JC would want to accept me. Poly is out of the question because I really don't know what course to take. </p>
              <p>I entered a JC with a quite gd L1R5 considering the JC standard. By right I should be coping well but I'm not. I feel so weak. If I really were to drop out of school this year, I would be working ..then maybe I can sort everything out. Basically I have been rotting for the past few years. Im always feeling unhappy ...and i think i have depression but haven told anyone yet. Dont dare to. I have family problems too..that's why I dont' want to add on my mum's worries already but she's starting to warn me about my studies. </p>
              <p>arghhh. what should i do????</p>

              <p>everyone's in the same boat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>now, on school days by the time i get home it's about 10.20pm. i would complain, but when i look at my friends and seniors who are in netball/ canoeing with their 5 or even 6 days a week training but are still keeping an optimistic outlook in life whilst having to sleep at 2 am in the morning trying to cope...</p>
              <p>then i feel like i too should try harder. things are hard. sometimes i guess it helps to rant everything out...</p>
              <p>and maybe you could weed out the not so impt activities that CCAs usually have. like the non-compulsory things, and then sort of leave earlier or come later for those activities. and also try studying on the bus. that's what i do :)</p>
              <p>tiring i know, but every little bit of time or studying that you get done helps.</p>

              <p>How about pulling through your JC before you decide either to come out to work or to go for university studies since you are already inside with decent grades.</p>
              <p>Cut down on CCAs activities if you cannot time manage. Take a break during school holidays. Merely caused by stress, you are still a bit too young to think about heading out for work at this junction.</p>

              <p>You may request to the principal to grant you one year leave from school. After that, you will return to school to continue from where you have stopped.</p>

              <p>Stress issue from JC students are very common nowadays, and I see quite a number of student getting the permission to leave school temporarily. So speak to the principal about this issue.</p>

              <p>hey all thanks for the advices! </p>
              <p>Actually CCA only contributes to part of the problem..I had this mental block since secondary school that I just don't want to study but somehow I managed to survive olevels. Then this sucky attitude got worse when Im in JC now. Even when I really want to study, I can't focus and would sit there for hours doing nothing. :s </p>
              <p>I love and hate my CCA actually...I like the sport and the feeling after training but I hate during and before training. errr makes any sense? And I really want to be active in a CCA for once because I didn't have gd experiences with my past CCAs.</p>
              <p>Can I ask those who were in competitive sports/time consuming CCAs.. sinicker,stuffedbears,deathmaster,FireIce. -Was it worth to join the CCA?</p>
              <p>@Singapore AFOL: I had this problem for years..but im not sure if its serious enough for psychiatrist atten. </p>
              <p>@Angel7030: Im jinxed yr business will failz. </p>
              <p>@Darkness_hacker99: Thanks, Im considering that. Maybe I'll talk to my mum about it but then she'll definitely not allow. </p>
