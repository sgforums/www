              The problem is you are still using the same method to study in JC, as in you are in sec school. Hardcore memorising is no longer working in JC and Uni. That why you cannot cope. 
              
              CCA is not really an issue, even if you are training 2 hours everyday. You cannot denied that you need a break from studying. 
              
              1. You can stay with your CCA. Remembering that it is a CCA only. You just need to follow your coach. Do what the coach say. 
              
              2. You need to change your method in studying. Your old sec school method never work out anymore.
              
              3. Time management. If you are training in the evening, and yet you still want to play computer games at night. You really dont have time to study at all. 
              
              4. Remember that people join CCA to distrub their studying routine, cose studying is boring. So study everyday will sure goes crazy.

              <p>I am not from PAP, nor I work with MOE, but I tell u ah, don't give up. As long as you got study, stress is indeed abit, you got chance. Even people working at PUB earning $2400+ talk big big, also dream of getting higher education. They tell you no need to study, bluff you one.</p>
              <p>When you come out to work, you will understand. Those people who ask you don't bother to study, the moment you quit your school, they go right in to replace your vacated seat. Still, what can deny you from doing well in studies, unless it is yourself who cannot tahan and want to throw in the towel?</p>
              <p>At my level, my Poly cousin same age as me, after got career, got wife, got son, got house, got car, still dream of go back school to study Uni. I go the JC, chaokeng my CCA whole life, then Uni track, when he was busy with being Vice President in Student Council, end up he come out one story, I come out also another story.</p>
              <p>The person who tell u to go join her at her PUB, I tell u, ask her to f*** off.</p>
              <p>But still, who can resist the lure of good money.</p>
              <p>Go la. If u like. Cannot cope with studies at school yet love competitive sports, then jump into earning money then love money at work yet hate competitive colleagues. WTF.</p>

              <p>Hence, if you really feel that JC is not the place for you, start planning head and see if there are any poly courses which interest you. </p>
              <p>Jumping from JC to poly is not an uncommon thing, and there are people who did badly for "A"-lvl, went to poly, and then go to uni from there. (Thus 2 years were sort of wasted, unless what they learnt is applicable to the poly course they are in.)</p>
              <p>Do consider this option, and keep an open mind to all possible options. For the time being, just try your best in JC, and don't give up even though you are considering other options at the same time.</p>

              <p>I think where I can agree with you, is that throwing the towel on JC is OK, but throwing the towel on god-da**ed lifelong education is not OK.</p>

              <p>Have you considered taking up a course in polytechnic? I know of many JC students who left and enrolled in poly.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying that poly is easier, but it is an alternative route.</p>
              <p>But considering that you already started JC, why not endure another year, who knows you may perform well in A levels?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Studying in JC is very different from studying in Poly... u actually need to work hard and work smart... is more like study methods is more impt... rather than purely studying. what i suggest u do is to firstly drop ur CCA. My teacher always tells us that we are first a student before anything else. Studies&gt;CCA. Mental block is quite a common prob. Don't give up to it and drop JC easily. U can actually try to drop ur cca first, then start to focus on studying. Get the study methods correct first. Dun give up on the first obstacle. Passing JC isn't really that hard. Tried it done it and it really can be done. Persevere on TS!</div>

I transferred into poly already..never did i expect to land myself in poly ( didn't even include poly in my 12 choices) because my family never did talk about poly as an option. I like it here because what I'm learning interests me and I'm motivated to study hard now, there's no mental block anymore. I guess I couldn't cope with the JC routine..rigid. To be truthful I have never put in much effort in my studies all along and had a bad attitude towards it. So when I said that I wanted to drop out everyone around me said I was lazy. Yes..and I kept finding excuses . think JC life really isn't for me, I hated to go to school and do the same things over and over again...</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I did quit my cca in JC and joined a slack club cca. But then it didn't help. I had lots of time but still nothing done. &amp; I found myself feeling miserable because I felt that im just wasting time and yearning more for training. </p>
