Try to get as many As as possible to assure you a place in UNI.<br><br>i slacked through my first year in poly and i'm starting to worry now. even if i get straight As from now onwards, i still wouldn't  be able to get into a local UNI. regretted  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Not as much info is available, but still serve its purpose of finding out what a course is about. When that fails, you can consider going to the poly to take a copy of the prospectus. Otherwise, you can always ask around.<br><br>There aren't many computer engineering related courses in Singapore, so it's quite easy to narrow down the whole list of courses that you are interested in or suitable for. Just go to the polys' websites to read through their courses summaries and their course modules for a brief idea on what you will do. The prospectus will also list it.<br><br>As for A Maths, it's not required, but it's a plus to have and to do well in it. Students aren't being kicked out for failing the Maths modules, but having to repeat to get a pass in these modules as they are required. There's not much you can do about it, except to pay attention and practise hard. Google isn't your best friend in this case, the friends you made in poly or secondary school will.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u prefer hardware or software? if software, go into IT.. if hardware + software == engineering.. i think maths in poly level is still ok, as long as u practise the tutorials. one thing to note, more maths as in calculas in engineering.. but if u plan to go to uni next time, in computer engineering course, think u choose computer engineering in poly will fit better.</div>
