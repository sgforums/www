            <div class='col-md body'>You're talking about poor VS rich.<br><br>Being poor is definately a disadvantage, but that's only if you ALLOW it to.<br>As some other people have said, think of it as something to spur you on, and you will succeed.<br><br>Many of our forefathers did not start rich. They all had to strive and work hard to get to where they are in life. Why don't you do the same, and give your grandchildren a good life?<br><br>I come from an average family myself, and i have no idea how i'm going to go to a Uni without working first, much less getting a car.<br><br>But all is not lost, i know that if i work hard (+ a bit of luck here and there...) i'll do well.<br><br>Regarding women... I think so long you can attract them well enough, they won't care about your being poor.<br><br>Rich guys don't have it made... girls may fling themselves at them, but if they don't have the attraction to hold on to it, they may find their hearts more bitterly shattered than ours...<br><br>Its all a matter of perspective, but one thing i know is that you should <strong> NEVER </strong> start pitying yourself. Self pity does nothing, but let everyone know you're a guy who doesn't have confidence, self-esteem, and THEN all the girls will avoid you like the plague.</div>

Since young I had things most other kids (unless they are filthy rich) could never afford to have.<br><br>Still, I was thrown into BMT along with all the hock-kian pengs, with some I made good friends with. My brother was also a white horse, and he too was thrown in a combat infantry unit and sweated it out with the hock kian pengs. Fact is neither me nor my brother enjoyed any priveledge at all, perhaps we had some immunity but this was NOT evident in the way we were treated. And we did have bunkmates who were chauffered in Mercedes S classes, BMWs, etc...and they were also thrashed.<br><br>I think the system is fair, unless of course if the rich can "chao keng" and hire a specialist to state that there is something wrong with them medically. But then again my parents did not do so, they think ppl who take the easy way out will never amount to much in life. On hindsight I agree with them. For me at least I really got to mingle with people from all walks of life, away from my cushy life at home. Gained alot of experience and learnt some valuable lessons too.<br><br>U can start low but it does not mean u will not end up high. Just look at Creative Boss Sim Wong Hoo <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Go enrich urself through part-time degree courses or pick up some diplomas instead of wallowing in self pity. Degree is also not a guarantee of a good job....u are going to need luck, vision, determination and GUTS to succeed.<br><br>U can have had a rough start but the wayers ahead are still up to you to chart and navigate....make the best of it. Instaed of lamenting on the fact that ur down and out, search for orportunities you can exploit to improve on your finiancial status or improve upon your job prospects.<br><br>There are plenty of nice gals in Singapore, u just have to look at the right places <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

However, I hope u don't mind my comments on u according to what u wrote.<br><br>I don't <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>feel</strong></span> that people are being treated unfairly in Singapore, although being treated unfairly can happen sometimes, but it's a matter of how you perceive the situations.<br><br>As for finance wise, I'm not very clear about ur circumstances so I'll just be very general about it. Firstly, don't just focus on ur problems and what u don't have. But rather ask urself "what can u do about it?" In the end, u will still have to deal with ur current situations and please, don't ever runaway from the problems cos they will always hunt u down and toment u again.<br><br>Again, It is important to have a good cert, degree or diploma. However, it is so not true that one cannot do anything or find a job just because of the qualification. There're some colleagues of mine in the past who were degree holders, and still lose their job and later, working in a factory as a quality assistant. Tiring job - 8 to 6 pm, and sitting there just to do samplings of wires and industrial equipments. The pay.. it's low. I just don't wanna say it out. And I've got a few friends who came out of ITE and doing good. They have a great job and a stable life.<br><br>It's not a matter of how high u go academically. But rather, how u manage ur time and how rersponsible r u with ur life. I believe that everyone of us has a potential inside us. It's just how willing we r to seek after it and share it wherever we go.<br><br>Lastly, about girls judging the local guys?? Hmm... if I'm a girl, I'll definitely WON'T reply to ur message. Hahaha...<br><br>But... since I'm a guy, then let me tell u something. If u think that girls will only go for guys who r highly educated, rich, famous, having a glib tongue and for being such a hunk, let me tell u, u r so WRONG! Although I will have to totally agree that about 0.000000000000001% of the girls around are that paranoid.<br><br>Here's a little secret: -<br>Girls are attracted to a few things:<br>1. Wealth<br>2. Status<br>3. Physical Appearance<br>4. Personality<br><br>Anyone who possess ANY of the four above will succeed... if u know what I mean... hehehe...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>However, if u wanna work on ur personality, then I suggest that you work on ur body language and eye contacts. Girls will be watching out for these things at first sight.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>That's all for now... hehehe, hope u feel better now bro. Cheer up!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>yours truly,<br>K.R.S.D.</div>
