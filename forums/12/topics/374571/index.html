              <p>Its all in your mind.</p>
              <p>Thoughts leads to action.</p>
              <p>What sort of thoughts are you having?</p>
              <p>Examine that, and you will get your answer,</p>
              <p>to why the flow isn't there.</p>
              <p>However, it may be too late to change your thought pattern.</p>
              <p>As this is developed in your formative years, as a child, and adolescence.</p>
              <p>How you are at your teen years is very important, for that will set you on how your will live your life.</p>
              <p>If you are competitive in your teens, you will be competitive for life.</p>
              <p>If you are a loner in your teens, you will be a loner for the rest of your life.</p>
              <p>Very few break that mold, and it takes great determination or trauma to be different from your teen years.</p>

              <p>drastic change in environment helps</p>
              <p>it is much easier to shed old skin in a totally new place, then in an old place where the thought patterns are reinforced repeatedly by people's expectation of you.</p>

              <p>the loop must be closed with manifestation on the outside.  otherwise the change cannot be permanent. </p>

              <p>This loop is what happens in you formative years.</p>
              <p>While you were growing up, "all manifestation on the outside", molded your thoughts.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, for the present, it all begins with thoughts. What feelings are evoked depends on the thoughts. Fear of disapproval or the joy of acceptance will determine you actions.</p>
              <p>But why surrender your sovereignty to those outside yourself.</p>
              <p>Therefore take stock of your thoughts, be aware of the directions it is leading you, and make appropriate corrections. You can't change your thinking habits, but you can redirect your thoughts, and thus actions.</p>
              <p>It will be a life long struggle, until the struggle itself becomes the norm.</p>

              <p>You are already 'aware' that 'something' is blocking you. You realize it, and therein lies your answer and solution awaiting you to deal with it, to confront it, to resolve it.</p>
              <p>To not do so, it will forever be the heavy load of baggage you wear, a reality you refused to face, the 'block' that will perpertually restrict you to 'move on', no matter where you go, what environment you attempt to escape to.</p>
              <p>What are your fears and concerns you are attempting to hide?</p>
              <p>I know not what they are to be of help, nor wish to know, for it is your privacy. Only you alone, armed with courage and determination to resolve it once and for all, will you be able to tear down those 'blocking walls', and discover the real you that exists in all of us humans, to be who we want to be - a king or a beggar - the freedom of choice that we all had been bestowed upon birth.</p>
              <p>And where would your 'heart' be, once you had resolve matters? It will be when you are not only well perceived by others, but you can sleep in peace at nights as well, for if you hurt no one, and had done and given your best in all that you do, you will find absolution for a day's effort.</p>
              <p>Procastinate no more, nor dwell on issues that you may have no control over, but push ahead to solve matters that are within your control and ability, with help if necessary</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>
