Cause men understand the kind of danger gals meet when they are alone in clubs (e.g kanna con or drunk then kanna laid)  I guess your guy is angry with you and in order to show you some "color", he refuse to see you when he book out and instead go clubbing without you to let you have a taste of your own medicine.<br><br>I find that you should really have a good talk with him lor..if not this problem will forever be bugging the two of you.</div>

But tired might not be the main issue here. More like adding on to his somehow already troubled bad mood? I think both of you are still quite young? And so is this relationship... NS can be a tiring and frustrating phase to face in life.... Loosen things up a bit... You sure don't wanna be part of his burden...? He might be worrying about losing you as much as you're afraid of losing him... But seems like his 'proposed plan' don't work well..? In order to keep you safe by his side he would have to sacrifice his energy proportionally.... Meaning he might feel that the more he loves you and try to protect you, the more tiring he'll become... 'Indirect Burden Accumulative'....<br><br>On the long run this would be bad for the relationship... He might develop a natural detest if not 'phobia' for this relationship... His 'own gathering' with his friends might act as a way to let him take a break from the relationship and at the same time to 'release everything' to his friends....<br><br><strong>What to do?</strong> Try to loosen up the relationship a little... Give him lots of assurance... Make 'give and take' situations where you don't make him feel he'll have to do this and that in order for the relationship to stay afloat.... Make him relax and break tensions when you feel that he felt threaten indirectly.. (I sense this could be quite a defensive guy... &lt;- Very surface presumption)<br><br>Though there might be an alternate picture to this, very much depends on his kinda mentality...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  But the 2nd probabilty is very much more SURFACE than the 1st.... Not worth mentioning for now... Please also note that all these are VERY SURFACE analysis as nothing much is known between you and him...<br><br>Anyway, hope things will get better for you....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

More like adding on to his somehow already troubled bad mood? I think both of you are still quite young? And so is this relationship... NS can be a tiring and frustrating phase to face in life.... Loosen things up a bit... You sure don't wanna be part of his burden...? He might be worrying about losing you as much as you're afraid of losing him... But seems like his 'proposed plan' don't work well..? In order to keep you safe by his side he would have to sacrifice his energy proportionally.... Meaning he might feel that the more he loves you and try to protect you, the more tiring he'll become... 'Indirect Burden Accumulative'....<br><br>On the long run this would be bad for the relationship... He might develop a natural detest if not 'phobia' for this relationship... His 'own gathering' with his friends might act as a way to let him take a break from the relationship and at the same time to 'release everything' to his friends....<br><br>[b]What to do?</strong> Try to loosen up the relationship a little... Give him lots of assurance... Make 'give and take' situations where you don't make him feel he'll have to do this and that in order for the relationship to stay afloat.... Make him relax and break tensions when you feel that he felt threaten indirectly.. (I sense this could be quite a defensive guy... &lt;- Very surface presumption)<br><br>Though there might be an alternate picture to this, very much depends on his kinda mentality...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  But the 2nd probabilty is very much more SURFACE than the 1st.... Not worth mentioning for now... Please also note that all these are VERY SURFACE analysis as nothing much is known between you and him...<br><br>Anyway, hope things will get better for you....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> [/b]</blockquote>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  wow sound like u v pro &amp; gd hor~!!! =PpPpPPPpPpPPp  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
