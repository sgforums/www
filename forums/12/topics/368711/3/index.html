              <p>I don't thing there is a way that you can send your maid back &amp; no need to tell your mom a good reason why. Your mom definitely find it odd &amp; gonna insist why you wanna send her back. You need a very good reason, &amp; you can't simnply make up a lie that the maid is stealing etc as the reason because it will create more trouble when confronted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think this goes down to exposing that incident liao.</p>

Only thing is, do not hate him,he is human after all, To Err is Human...peace... God Bless Your Family...</div>

              <p>Pls do let ur mother know. These things are best left in the hands of the adults to handle. Keeping it to urself will not help u or ur sisters.</p>

              <p>Do not have the thinking that by not telling ur mother, ur family will remain happy. Ever thought, if the maid turn over &amp; accuse ur father of molest or even rape? It would be too late to come clean. Maids these days are very smart. Nothing beat telling the true.</p>

              <p>lol i can totally understand how you feel, what you wanna do might not feel right, and you dun know if u should carry out what's right and whether it'll turn out wrong.</p>
              <p>Sound confusing? ya, coz you are confused anyway. keke. But do remember this situation is NOT YOUR FAULT. whatever you do, regardless you reporting to your mum or just keeping it inside, you do it FOR YOUR OWN PERSONAL REASON.</p>
              <p>Of coz, as an outsider, it'll be better for you to report you know. drag too long more consequences will occur.</p>
