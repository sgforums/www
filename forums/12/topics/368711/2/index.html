              <p>Tell or not to tell?</p>
              <p>Do either and you will be in deep shit.</p>
              <p>Any evidence? Your word against your dad and maid? Suspicions will rise immeasurably and run out of control, flaring into a hurricane that may see lives ruined.</p>
              <p>What has happened, had happened. It will not be the first, nor will it be the last. illicit affairs can often be performed hidden from sight and sound. Telling or not telling to anyone will not solve the deeper underlying problem - your dad's disatisfaction with your Mum, and the stolen moments behind her back with the maid or anyone else outside the home.</p>
              <p>Your dad is to be blamed, for he has a problem that needs to be solved. Divorce will be and must be the last and final option, or your family will be severely broken. As the maid had confronted you, it would be a fact that she knows you know whats going on. So too will be your dad.</p>
              <p>He will not listen to you, for you are forever his 7 year old kid even if you are 40 years old, and will not believe in your maturity. Take your burden to your priest or ummah, and let him attempt to resolve the masculine problem.</p>
              <p>If it fails, then your matured relatives must be approached, and hope that you will be believed if you have the evidence. If not, your dad will only be in denial, and be more careful with his hidden activity.</p>
              <p>Suffer the children, you did. My heart goes out to you. May your religion and elders be the source to heal your family and reduce the comming storm of revelation, as no affair can ever be hidden for long...</p>

              <p>Firing the maid aint gonna solve the problem.</p>
              <p>The deeper problem is yer dad.</p>
              <p>Although this is no laughing matter, it reminds me of joke. The Govt ( dad) is screwing the Workers ( maid ) while yer mum ( Taxpayers ) sleeps, and the Future ( you kids ) are doomed.</p>
              <p>While we can always vote out the govt, unfortunately, we cannot vote out our biological dad for flaws. Your dad is the ROOT of the problem and he needs help or your future of a family will crumble.</p>

              <p>If you don't tell your mom, this is what's going to happen. You're going to confront your dad about it and threaten him. He'll decide to send the maid home. But since your mom doesn't know, the root of the problem will not be resolved and he may just find another woman to have an affair with.</p>
              <p>If you do tell your mom, it's really going to be unpredictable depending on the type of woman your mother is. Definitely, the maid's going to be sent home. BUt what happens after is going to be very complicated. Your parents may choose to separate. OR they will still stay together, but only as a superficial couple for the sake of your younger siblings. THings will definitely never be the same again.</p>
              <p>Although i'm a guy myself, I really mean it when i say such men should be taught a horrible lesson to pay for their wrongdoings.</p>

              <p>There is no evidence to show who started it first, so we can't say that the maid isn't the one who started this chaos.</p>
              <p>It seems that the various ideas here conflicts one another, though each has its own points ( Except a certain shameless one by a certain somebody ). I certainly hopes the TS chose one which she believes will be the best for her family, as no one here can truly say that their idea will be the best.</p>
              <p>Two very important factors which are not touched on yet by the TS, and mentioned by xtreyier and simnatic, will be :</p>
              <p>1) What kind of woman is TS's mother, in regards to her attitude. A worst-case scenario will be that she is of the suicidal type, and commit suicide upon finding out about her husband's unfaithfulness.</p>
              <p>2) Whether there is any Ummah or elders who could directly intervene and help out. This is especially important if they have the power to influence the decisions made by TS's parents.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Princess, Let face it,its tough telling the truth,cause the truth hurts. Its complicated cause it involve your dad. Sending the maid away is a good option. She(maid) knew she was caught red handed, and not being wanted to be blamed,she's pointing finger to your dad.It take two to tango.Firstly you must forgive your dad and maid for their deeds.Speak to the agent,they have experience,can advice and handle the situation better than anyone else.Tell them the truth of what happen.Speak your mind,worries to them,trust me,it is best to send her back.....Tell your mum,maid is not a neccesity,it luxury, save some $$$ during the economy bad time, find a good reasonable reason that your mum can agree on sending the maid back....I'll pray to GOD to help out find a solution to your problem....</div>

I mean ask your dad to aplogise to the maid infront of you children as she appeared to dislike your dad's kisses. Then tell your dad to refrain his actions. If not,  this matter will be made known to your mum. Hope that this warns both the maid &amp; your dad that this should never happens and continue.</p></div>

              <p>DON'T  TELL YOUR  MUM...that will cause problems only.......he is a man and men do these things without the same meaning we girls have for such issues.  To men it is just something they do   not as we take it meaning love and deceipt and so on....</p>
              <p>So leave him to enjoy his new friut   he will tire of her too......for me I would try to spy and enjoy watching them!</p>

              <p>Be careful. Your mum cannot tolerate husband have another woman especially</p>

              <p>That's why I say she should get rid of the maid first then let her parents sort it out.</p>
              <p>If She go and detonate the bomb while mother, father, maid, sister all in one house, that will cause a lot of chaos.</p>
              <p>I see some people suggest go tell mother, that is very dangerous.</p>
