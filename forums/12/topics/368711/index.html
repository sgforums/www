              <p>Hey everyone out there.....</p>
              <p>I'm a little troubled and would like your kind feedback.<br>As you have guessed from my title, needless for me to say anything more....</p>
              <p>My maid has been with us for 3 years.  She was 1st emplyed to look after my late grandma who is sick.  Shortly after renewing her 2nd contract with us, my grandma passed on...  Our family continued her service as she has shown lots of improvement in her work over the years.</p>
              <p>Our family consist of my mum, my dad, we 3 siblings (all girls), myself &amp; my older sister is divorcee with 1 kid (boy) each aged 8.  my younger sister is doing her part time studies.</p>
              <p>Things went very well for our family throughout the years with the maid.  On Monday, 13th July, morning, when my younger sis woke up and entering the kitchen, she saw my dad kissing the maid.  Shocked, she walked away back to her room.  Shortly after, my maid went up to her, trying to clarify the incident.  She mentioned that my dad is always reacting that way.  She tried to push him away.  She also persuade my sis not to let anyone in the family know about this.</p>
              <p>My sis, 18 yrs old could not take the blow.  She was traumatised by this incident.  She told me about this on the 15th July, 2 days after the incident.  I knew she was very upset.</p>
              <p>I have always lived respecting my dad most.  My dad was a conservative person.  I was close to him but after learning this incident, i was very upset.  I'm so afraid my mum will find out about this.  I'm in a dilemma.</p>
              <p>Pls advise what are steps i should do now.</p>
              <p>P/S:  My maid is very smart.  She employed by my mum.</p>

              <p>I think you should do something before any thing get out of hand. <br>At least now it is just kissing you know.</p>
              <p>I still think the best method is send the maid home. <br>I think you should let your dad know that you're aware about it, use the stern attitude.<br>And, if your dad woken up from his dreamland, He will send the maid home. <br>If he doesn't, fine. You should let your mom know about it by then. <br><br>I'll hope things will get better for you. :) <br></p>

              <p>The maid is leveraging on the so-called good terms that she has struck with your mum; and as for your father - he probably succumbed to her ..... u know lar .... later she (the maid) would solicit for $$$$$$$$$ and ....</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nip it in the bud</span> - otherwise the repercussions could be disastrous lar - my suggestion - talk to your mother and spring the suprise on the maid - that is, make preparations to send her back FIRST and just send her away, otherwise she (the maid) would pre-empt with a police report OR  and turn matters to favor her lar when she senses that she is going to sent away.</p>

              <p>The wisest thing is to deal with this maid 'nicely', and cook up an excuse to send her away without giving out anything. Deal with the other matter of your father's amorous escapades later lar.</p>
              <p>Agency, no lar, its going to be a messy affair and u seem to intuit the same as i do feel.</p>

              <p>Of cos, no matter how much i'm upset with him now, i wouldn't

              <p>I am sorry to say this, but there is no way that you can settle this in total peace.</p>
              <p>Be prepared, for a huge storm is coming your family's way, and your father is to be blamed ( regardless of whether the maid or him started it first ) for it.</p>
              <p>Whether your family will be keep together in the end, depends on whether your mother will forgive your father or not.</p>
              <p>The 1st thing to do now is to break the news to your mother. You may think that you shouldn't do it because it might hurt her, but if you keep quiet about it, and if she would to find out later, things will get even more out of hand.</p>
              <p>Make sure your sister who witnessed the incident is present with you when you tell your mother the truth, and try to tell her at a time when both your father and maid are not around.</p>
              <p>After that, console your mother with your sister, and get the family ready for the confrontation with the maid and your father.</p>

              <p>Maybe you should instigate an incident and use it as a pretext to send the maid away.</p>

              <p>Good idea. I think you should instigate an incident first then if your mother is hesitant, you can break the news to her.</p>

              <p>You are seriously too naive to think so.</p>

              <p>Princess izah,</p>
              <p>I would think that in any problem, you should face the source right away - get a clarification from the horse's mouth(s) rightaway. Your Dad and the maid.</p>
              <p>If you only hear one side of the story - from the mouth of a younger 18 yr old sis who saw and heard something from the maid, how can you pass judgement and tell your Mum? What if it was a misunderstanding? What if the maid is the manipulative one and your Dad is merely being silly on impulse? What if your sis didn't convey the right words to you? That's all hearsay. You could spawn a major misunderstanding. You did mention that the maid is a clever one.</p>
              <p>Given that you are not a 3 yr old kid anymore (you mentioned ur age in Shoutbox) you and your elder sis r better qualified to confront the 2 than your 18 yr old sis. You r well entitled to ask for an answer from your Dad, cos it concerns your family and Mum especially.</p>
              <p>Not saying that you should withhold anything from your Mum but its always important to get the basic facts clear if you are not the actual witness. Then proceed to let your parents sort it out themselves.</p>
              <p>If it is an extra-marital affair, then your Dad needs to face up to the consequences of his actions. Including your Mum's fury. If he repents and is forgiven, he will do the right thing by sending the maid away. If not, really, can your mum accept? Surely a family breakup will ensue.</p>
              <p>If your Mum and Dad are due for a separation and divorce, even though it is heart wrenching, then in this day and age, it is beyond you or anybody else in the family. They are 2 adults as well. You can only mediate and influence, you can't decide for them.</p>
              <p>Your Dad will be well-advised to heed his mature daughter's warnings that he is in a potentially bad position:</p>
              <p>1) He could be accused of sexual offences - molest / sexual harrassment / rape</p>
              <p>2) I've seen maids entice and marry for money.</p>
              <p>3) He might lose his family in the process.</p>
              <p>All the best.</p>

              <p>I think the longer the maid stays in your house, the situation will get worse, the atmosphere will be poisoned, there will be mistrust.</p>
              <p>So the important thing is to get rid of the maid quickly.</p>
              <p>Maid's job is to work in household chores, not get engaged with dubious affairs.</p>
              <p>If you blow up the matter while the maid is still there, it will get very complicated.</p>
              <p>So better find a way to get rid of her quickly, the matter with your parents can be sorted out later.</p>
              <p>That is my view.</p>

              <p>Hey everyone out there.....</p>
              <p>I'm a little troubled and would like your kind feedback.<br>As you have guessed from my title, needless for me to say anything more....</p>
              <p>My maid has been with us for 3 years.  She was 1st emplyed to look after my late grandma who is sick.  Shortly after renewing her 2nd contract with us, my grandma passed on...  Our family continued her service as she has shown lots of improvement in her work over the years.</p>
              <p>Our family consist of my mum, my dad, we 3 siblings (all girls), myself &amp; my older sister is divorcee with 1 kid (boy) each aged 8.  my younger sister is doing her part time studies.</p>
              <p>Things went very well for our family throughout the years with the maid.  On Monday, 13th July, morning, when my younger sis woke up and entering the kitchen, she saw my dad kissing the maid.  Shocked, she walked away back to her room.  Shortly after, my maid went up to her, trying to clarify the incident.  She mentioned that my dad is always reacting that way.  She tried to push him away.  She also persuade my sis not to let anyone in the family know about this.</p>
              <p>My sis, 18 yrs old could not take the blow.  She was traumatised by this incident.  She told me about this on the 15th July, 2 days after the incident.  I knew she was very upset.</p>
              <p>I have always lived respecting my dad most.  My dad was a conservative person.  I was close to him but after learning this incident, i was very upset.  I'm so afraid my mum will find out about this.  I'm in a dilemma.</p>
              <p>Pls advise what are steps i should do now.</p>
              <p>P/S:  My maid is very smart.  She employed by my mum.</p>
