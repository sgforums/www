            <div class='col-md body'>Well, when it comes to be work and professionalism, work is work, what happens outside of work is private and his/her own life. If its going according to that line, then you shouldn't be quiting your job as it doesn't involve work btw you and your boss.<br><br>Men cheating on gfs/wivies or woman cheating on their bf/husbands is common. If you knew your boss killed someone, then that's a totally different story.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't mix work and private affairs, even when they're jumbled up.<br><br>Since he wants to know why you quit, tell him the truth, but not as an employee, but as a friend.<br><br>Though if it were me i would have stayed on. Respect for a boss is one thing, respect for his private life is another. (Not to mention its a bit harder to find jobs now).<br><br></div>
