              <p><br>vro...contract states clearly that u will not get ur pay if u r fired..no point arguing with MOM or singtel..besides Singtel is semi govt (I think so) ...so irregardless of waht, u end up losing...and worst still, u end up paying like what some forumers states....so i suggeest forget about it and find a new job....make it a lesson learnt and control ur temper..just my 5 cents thought..</p>

              <p>That's it. You have no case already since you did sign it (meaning you agreed upon the highlighted terms). That punch card will not be able to help you even if you manage to get it back.</p>

                                  contract i signed states that if im fired without or with any
                                  reason no salary shall be made payable for me. is there anyway i
                                  can actually try to appeal without going to the lawyer becuz if im
                                  calling a lawyer it will be like 3k + and my salary is onli 600 so
                                  its not worth it. anyone can u please tell me wad i should do. or

                                  it since the contract already states like tat? please advice. thank

              <p>It is quite common to see people being illegally or unfairly fired from their jobs. No idea about national statistics but based on an article I read, they estimated 250,000 workers annually (US), not counting those that were justifiably terminated.</p>
              <p>Judging from your post, I am not surprised you got fired. But very surprised you are not paid a single cent for 12 days work and you are prepared to walk away without raising questions to both MOM and top management of SingTel.</p>
              <p>You should have a copy of the contract you signed and a letter of termination stating why you were terminated without notice. If you don't have them, get them. If you don't have your punch card, call them up. Ask them for it. I don't think there is a chance in hell they won't give.</p>
              <p>If I were in your shoes, I will write a straightforward letter to the head office and make a formal appeal. Make it objective and simple with facts and dates, when did you commence employment, when were you terminated, who terminated you and the reasons you were given.</p>
              <p>Tell them you accept the dismissal, but you should be paid for the work you did.</p>
              <p>If they say no, you ask why.</p>
              <p>If they say because the contract says so, ask them why there are clauses like that.</p>
              <p>Best to ensure your correspondences are made in email.Take it from there but you need to do this within one month.</p>
              <p>Then with these information, phone MOM, make some enquiries, do some investigation on your own. It won't take you more than half a day to find things out.</p>
              <p>How old are you? 18? 23? It is ok to clarify your doubts, there is nothing wrong with asking these questions and finding out why. Even if eventually, you still don't get paid, at least you understand what went wrong and why it went wrong.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile start looking for a new job and maybe it's time to change your approach with new colleagues in your new workplace.</p>
              <p>You may act and sound like a real pisser, but that don't mean you don't deserve some good answers from them. Good luck pal.</p>

              <p><strong>Hi, you can call MOM @<span style="color: #000000;"> 6438 5122 to enquire on your case..</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p>The following information is quoted from: </p>
              <p><strong><a href="http://www.mom.gov.sg/publish/momportal/en/communities/workplace_standards/employment_standards/the_employment_act/Contract_of_Service.html">http://www.mom.gov.sg/publish/momportal/en/communities/workplace_standards/employment_standards/the_employment_act/Contract_of_Service.html</a></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong> </p>
              <p><strong>Dismissal</strong> <br><br>An employer may, after an inquiry, dismiss an employee if the employee is found guilty of misconduct by failing to fulfil the expressed or implied conditions of employment. <br><br>Inquiry to follow the rules of natural justice:</p>
              <ul>
              <li dir="ltr">No man shall be a judge in his own cause <br></li>
              <li dir="ltr">No man shall be condemned unheard <br></li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Misconduct <br><br></strong>Misconduct refers to a breach of duty or discipline which is inconsistent with the express or implied conditions of an employee's contract of service.  Examples of misconduct are theft or dishonesty, disorderly or immoral conduct at work, willful insubordination etc.  <br><br>If the employee has committed an act of misconduct, the employer should conduct an inquiry before deciding whether to dismiss the employee or to take other forms of disciplinary action.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Procedures of an Inquiry</strong> <br><br>The employer must hold an inquiry into the misconduct.  If, after the inquiry, the employee is found guilty of the misconduct, the employer may: <br><br>(a) dismiss the employee; or <br>(b) instantly downgrade the employee (with no pay reduction); or <br>(c) instantly suspend him from work without payment of salary for a period not exceeding one week. <br><br>There is no prescribed procedure for conducting an inquiry into an act of misconduct.  As a general guideline, <br><br>1) the person hearing the inquiry should not be in a position which may suggest bias; and <br>2) the employee being investigated for misconduct should have the opportunity to present his case. <br><br>Under the Employment Act, the employer may suspend the employee from work during an inquiry, for a period not exceeding one week.  The employee should be paid not less than half his salary for the suspended period. <br><br>If the inquiry does not disclose any misconduct on the part of the employee, the employer must restore to the employee the full amount of salary that was withheld.  <br><br>An employer cannot downgrade an employee with a pay cut if the employee has been found guilty of misconduct unless there is mutual agreement between both parties, or if the employment contract provides for it. </p>
              <p><br><strong>Appeals</strong> <br><br>Employees who feel that they have been unfairly dismissed by their employers may appeal to the Minister for Manpower to be reinstated to their former employment. <br><br>Appeals must be made in writing within one month of dismissal. <br><br>The Ministry of Manpower will look into any appeals. If it can be established that an employee was unfairly dismissed, the Minister will consider reinstating the employee's employment or order a sum of money as compensation, as the Minister deems fit.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.mom.gov.sg/publish/momportal/en/communities/workplace_standards/employment_standards/the_employment_act/Contract_of_Service.html">http://www.mom.gov.sg/publish/momportal/en/communities/workplace_standards/employment_standards/the_employment_act/Contract_of_Service.html</a></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Dismissal</strong><br><br>An employer may, after an inquiry, dismiss an employee if the employee is found guilty of misconduct by failing to fulfil the expressed or implied conditions of employment.<br><br>Inquiry to follow the rules of natural justice:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>No man shall be a judge in his own cause<br></li>
              <li>No man shall be condemned unheard<br></li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Misconduct<br><br></strong>Misconduct refers to a breach of duty or discipline which is inconsistent with the express or implied conditions of an employee's contract of service.  Examples of misconduct are theft or dishonesty, disorderly or immoral conduct at work, willful insubordination etc. <br><br>If the employee has committed an act of misconduct, the employer should conduct an inquiry before deciding whether to dismiss the employee or to take other forms of disciplinary action.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Procedures of an Inquiry</strong><br><br>The employer must hold an inquiry into the misconduct.  If, after the inquiry, the employee is found guilty of the misconduct, the employer may:<br><br>(a) dismiss the employee; or<br>(b) instantly downgrade the employee (with no pay reduction); or<br>(c) instantly suspend him from work without payment of salary for a period not exceeding one week.<br><br>There is no prescribed procedure for conducting an inquiry into an act of misconduct.  As a general guideline,<br><br>1) the person hearing the inquiry should not be in a position which may suggest bias; and<br>2) the employee being investigated for misconduct should have the opportunity to present his case.<br><br>Under the Employment Act, the employer may suspend the employee from work during an inquiry, for a period not exceeding one week.  The employee should be paid not less than half his salary for the suspended period.<br><br>If the inquiry does not disclose any misconduct on the part of the employee, the employer must restore to the employee the full amount of salary that was withheld. <br><br>An employer cannot downgrade an employee with a pay cut if the employee has been found guilty of misconduct unless there is mutual agreement between both parties, or if the employment contract provides for it. </p>
              <p><br><strong>Appeals</strong><br><br>Employees who feel that they have been unfairly dismissed by their employers may appeal to the Minister for Manpower to be reinstated to their former employment.<br><br>Appeals must be made in writing within one month of dismissal.<br><br>The Ministry of Manpower will look into any appeals. If it can be established that an employee was unfairly dismissed, the Minister will consider reinstating the employee's employment or order a sum of money as compensation, as the Minister deems fit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope this helps (:</p>

              <p>i think no chance to get back your pay becos of the kuku contract that you sign. the company also very smart. like that can always eat people money liao. make them work like 20 days then when pay day coming then fire the person off. like that can get people to work for free and somemore they know people cannot afford to sue them also.</p>
              <p>to TS, last time i also work part time in a place that they always ask me clear rubbish. the staff there also treat me like dog because i new there mah. then i left after 2 months of working. the staff still ask me why i want to quit. feel like telling him off in the face that if i dont leave, you might end up in hospital.</p>

              <p>You mean to say that (if salary is below $1,600 under private employment) since it is expressedly stated in a contract that a worker must work everyday 12 hours for a year, the employee would have to work like a slave and it's legal?</p>

              <p>The Employment Act overrides your employment contract, else there won't be any need for an Employment Act. The Employment Act prevent abuses from employers, because employers have more market power than an employee.</p>

              <p>Abstract from Butterworths Handbook of Singapore Employment Law:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Where the contract expressly states that the employee may be suspended pending an inquiry, it is submitted that the employee can subsequently be dismissed if the outcome of the inquiry is against him and in such a case, the employer need not repay the wages that were withheld during the period of suspension.</p>
              <p>The right to suspend may also be implied by statute. Section 14(1) of the Employment Act provides that an employer may, instead of dismissing an employee who is guilty of miscoundct, suspend him from work without payment of salary for a period not exceeding a week. Section 14(8) of the Employment Act also provides that while conducting an inquiry to determine if the employee should be summarily dismissed, the employer may suspend the employee for a period not exceeding one week but shall pay him not less than half his salary for such period and that should the inquiry not disclose any misconduct, the employer shall forthwith pay the employee any salary so withheld. However, as stated earlier, the Employment Act does not apply to all employees and therefore section 14 is applicable only in respect of employees falling within the Employment Act. (meaning managers, executives, etc)</p>

              <p>Right to summarily dismiss</p>
              <p>As stated, having already looked at the circumstances in which the emplyer has a right to dismiss an employee summarily for disobedience, negligence, incompetence and breach of the duty of goodfaith, the circumstances in which the employer may summarily dismiss the employee for misconduct can now be considered.</p>
              <p>Though the courts have refused to lay down a conclusive list of what constitutes misconduct, it would appear that if the misconduct is such as to show that the employee is repudiating the contract or one of its essential terms, the employee can be summarily dismissed.</p>
              <p>In neefjes v Crystal Products Co Ltd for instance, the court held that where one employee assaulted a fellow employee, the aggressor could be summarily dismissed.</p>
