              <p>Hey people,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nice forum, nice people too. :D Right, pls help me with this. I'm really going nuts thinking over this. There's this girl that I have come to fancy recently but she seems to be giving me mixed signals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Alright, everytime we go out, the past 4 times, have always been me calling her. We don't talk on the phone at home but everytime we go out, we would always have a lot of fun, tease each other. I enjoy teasing her, seeing her embarassed reaction and I think she does too. Then we would sit down during makan and chit chat for hours. I would always call her "auntie" and she calls me "uncle".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then there was one time, I told her, "give me your hand". I grabbed it and held it. However, she resisted and withdrew it. Then she mumbled to herself, "what are u doing?" I just laughed it off quite loudly too. (my god, what else??) Then she started smiling again and showed me her palm, telling me this is how I shd read palms.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And then a few days later, I asked her out on a sat (again). We had the usual teasing on the phone, names calling etc etc and she said she's ok to come out. She even suggested a place to eat. But that sat, she was held up at work till very late. She sms me that she couldn't make the appt and then an hour later, she knocked off and went back. I called her but she didn;t pick up. Then later she called me back, saying she didn't realise the phone ringing. I asked her if she was free to meet near her place at 830pm. Time was 8pm then. She said she had a stressful day and wants to rest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, rest is very impt to her and she sleeps very early...something like between 10pm to 11pm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sigh....but a lot of mixed signals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, I'm in my 20s this year. I have never met a girl who sends me such mixed signals....so lost. Appreciate all kind advice....thanks <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>Wah harsh but to an extent could be true.. She just think you are her good friend.. I would say be patient and enjoy the friendship you have with her... No need to rush things and then scare her away.. If she likes you, she likes you.. If not just enjoy the current status and enjoy each other's company.. Unless your rushing for sex.. Then.. I dunoe de.. lawls~</p>

              <p>You saw her cheerful smile and embrassed (A normal girl will act like this).</p>
              <p>She teased you and you teased her back (A sign of close friend).</p>
              <p>Chit chat for hours (Normal friend would do this).</p>
              <p>Called back that she missed your call (Normal friend would do this). It basically means Friends. I always do that to my friends as well.</p>

              <p>She rejected a hand hold immdiately, asked what you did.  (Treated you as friend)</p>

              <p>Reminds me of parn's topic...</p>
              <p>How hard is it for you to tell her, that you like her and want to further develop the relationship? Saying it firmly without the "I think", "Maybe" should cover her insecurities and let her know that you're serious.</p>
              <p>From the start, your motive is very clear that you want her as a girlfriend. Most girls are shy and prefer guys take the initiative. Stop the guessing game.</p>

              <p>Yeh IR, you're referring to that thread ok, haha that's a very interesting thread. Parn....she's so cute but think she's a tough girl by nature, that's y she is what she is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After reading that thread, I had a sudden impulse to tell my fren straight but then, wouldn't it kill all suspense? Suspense is often the engineer of all romance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe I shd huh? haha and if she continues talking to me, well, still got a chance. If no, time to move on....but I don't want to spoil everything just because of impulse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SIGH.</p>

              <p>Even if she rejects you, it might not be a permanent rejection depending on her behaviour after that. It could be she's confuse or not experienced at this kind of confession, at least she knows you're interested in her.</p>
              <p>Girls need to be ROMANCED, no matter what girl and which girl, all girls need to be ROMANCED. With enough romance.....guys can make turn the tide on their next confession.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if you really want to get the girl you like, go ahead and attack her heart(emotional department). Attacking her mind/brain is no use....at least it doesn't applies to most girls.</p>
              <p>Some girls need guys to attack her heart and money, some just heart, some just money, some just intelligence, some just heart and intelligence, some just intelligence and money.</p>
              <p>So go and see which category your girl falls under and work towards that accordingly lor......</p>

              <p>Even if she rejects you, it might not be a permanent rejection depending on her behaviour after that. It could be she's confuse or not experienced at this kind of confession, at least she knows you're interested in her.</p>
              <p>Girls need to be ROMANCED, no matter what girl and which girl, all girls need to be ROMANCED. With enough romance.....guys can make turn the tide on their next confession.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if you really want to get the girl you like, go ahead and attack her heart(emotional department). Attacking her mind/brain is no use....at least it doesn't applies to most girls.</p>
              <p>Some girls need guys to attack her heart and money, some just heart, some just money, some just intelligence, some just heart and intelligence, some just intelligence and money.</p>
              <p>So go and see which category your girl falls under and work towards that accordingly lor......</p>

              <p>dude honestly those signals arent very mixed ... based on what you're described theres not much hope. If you can bring yourself to do it , try make things clear to her .. will solve your problems.</p>
