              <p>Hi all, I was writing a long list of my account and the page navigated 
              away without saving my post! So now, am just gona cut short and list out
               my concern.<br><br>My mum has diabetes for over 30 years now but 
              fortunately, after seeking consultation from an endocrine specialist, he
               said that the condition is still under control. My mum was given full 
              course of medications for the past 2 months but the glucose level is 
              still very high after the last check up. Doc is suggesting insulin jab. 
              My mum is scared and apprehensive but after the doc showed her what an 
              insulin jab (disposable type) looked like, she is now contemplating.<br><br>The
               thing now is my brother (who is also a mild diabetic, I think) 
              disagreed with the insulin suggestion. He'd rather my mum, presumably 
              now old age (in her 60's) to enjoy while she can and only need to watch 
              and control her diet (he lives with her but not me) and that's good 
              enough.<br><br>But I beg to differ. My mum's been getting listless and 
              tired easily nowadays and doctor says though she 's having it for 30 
              years, it is still under control. Even when she went for her eye check 
              up, the eye specialist said her vision is still ok cept for some 
              cataract problem.<br><br>My brother's argument is that he doesn't want 
              to believe what the doctor said about insulin. He said once on it, it 
              will be dependent on it for life. But I don't want to learn on one day 
              if my mum faints outside or her condition gets worse. I'd rather she 
              live healthily and stable for her rest of life (even if lifetime on 
              insulin) than to know at later stage if the condition becomes worse and 
              she has to amputate her limbs or affected her other organs and yet still
               have to live on for her sufferings.<br><br>I just need some advices here from people who are on insulin and tell me if there are differences before taking and after.</p>

              <p>Seriously, wats the deal with your brother anyway.</p>
              <p>How can your mother enjoy her life when she is going blind and her diabetes is getting the better of her ?</p>
              <p>Insuling therapy is one way to ensure patients CAN live a "near" normal life.</p>
              <p>Diabetes is not a viral or bacterial infection. Our body cannot fight it with our immune system.</p>
              <p>Diabetes happens because our body fails to function properly.</p>
              <p>Diabetes won't go away after a while, it can only get worst.</p>
              <p>Does your brother prefers your mom goes blind, or needs a pancreatic transplant ?</p>
              <p>Eating right and living a healthy lifestyle COMPLIMENTS medical therapy. NOT replace it.</p>
              <p>Maybe your brother doesn't want your mom to live very long.</p>
