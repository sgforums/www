            <div class='col-md body'>is there a reason or reasons to why relationships end? do we have to understand why a relationship didn't work before we move on? does understanding why things go awry really that important?<br><br>in a few days, it would mark a year to the day i boarded a jet plane, leaving behind the man i thought i would marry, bringing home a heart too shattered to mend. I still don't understand why things turn out the way they did, why i was so blind to hang on to him and why he has to hurt me so. Whenever i try to think back, and find the answers to my question, my emotions, my mind just spiral downwards. For him, i've experienced the darkest times of my life. i don't want to go back to those days of sorrow and pain but now i wonder if i have to in order to truly let go and be over him.<br><br>i have to move on, cos after him, i had other heartaches in my life to sort out. i see getting over my ex and my past as the way to start the healing and end the pain. i want to be able to give my current other half what he deserves - my heart as a whole, beating healthily, not longer bleeding.<br><br>what show i do now? this sucks.................. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dare not say I share the same story as you but I dare say we both had sad endings and are taking it too hard. Our emotions over-run us like a 5tonner and there's nothing we can do about it. Someone had once told me this simple phrase.<br><br>What would you do if you miss someone dearly? You would go see that person to ease that sensation of missing him/her.<br><br>But what happens if things get bad and he/she is never there anymore? He/She will become a part of your memory.<br><br>Reminiscing is like a pill, it makes you recap what's bad but unconsciously you learn a new thing about the incident everytime it's recapped...<br><br>It takes time, truely takes time... Don't try to force it, it'll only make your life more torturous. Instead go with the flow, and it would go away. Bit by bit<br><br>For me I'm just waiting for a lost love, not too long have I waited, but going to be long before I stop.<br><br>Nothing is impossible, It's just how much you want it.<br><br>Anyway bury yourself in work.

Our emotions over-run us like a 5tonner and there's nothing we can do about it. Someone had once told me this simple phrase.<br><br>What would you do if you miss someone dearly? You would go see that person to ease that sensation of missing him/her.<br><br>But what happens if things get bad and he/she is never there anymore? He/She will become a part of your memory.<br><br>Reminiscing is like a pill, it makes you recap what's bad but unconsciously you learn a new thing about the incident everytime it's recapped...<br><br>It takes time, truely takes time... Don't try to force it, it'll only make your life more torturous. Instead go with the flow, and it would go away.
