It's not really necessary for you to know why a relationship didn't work out before you can move on... Though how important it is to find out the real reason before moving on would be subjective to an individual's character and mentality...<br><br>Understand that sometimes things might not be clear up so soon... Or you might not even be able to find out the truth forever... But life would still have to go on... And having just experienced a break up (especially when you feel you're at a lost and hurtful end), would often set you in a trapped ground... Making it very difficult for you to see alot of things...<br><br>Sometimes understanding why things don't go well would help (more like psychological and human's instincts)... But often than not, it's not of utmost importance unless you're in a hurry to go into a next relationship... Which in that case, importance would be subjective to the reason(s)....<br><br>If problem lies with yourself, it would of course be good if you can change for the better... And hence it would help in future relationship(s)... If the problem lies more with your partner or external factors... Then a certain level of understanding might help to an extent... But also only helpful to that certain extent....<br><br><strong><br>in a few days, it would mark a year to the day i boarded a jet plane, leaving behind the man i thought i would marry, bringing home a heart too shattered to mend. I still don't understand why things turn out the way they did, why i was so blind to hang on to him and why he has to hurt me so. Whenever i try to think back, and find the answers to my question, my emotions, my mind just spiral downwards. For him, i've experienced the darkest times of my life. i don't want to go back to those days of sorrow and pain but now i wonder if i have to in order to truly let go and be over him.<br><br>i have to move on, cos after him, i had other heartaches in my life to sort out. i see getting over my ex and my past as the way to start the healing and end the pain. i want to be able to give my current other half what he deserves - my heart as a whole, beating healthily, not longer bleeding.<br><br>what show i do now? this sucks.................. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></strong><br><br>Personally... Handling your own current problems would be of utmost importance because of their priority.. And also, having problems with them would probably give you more headaches which would slow you down in your ability to handle your past and accumulates your stress in the present....<br><br>Trying to understand why someone did something to you in a relationship... One of the 1st obstacles I've faced in my 1st relationship... Understand that a human's complex... And because of this complex nature and the many motives, it's often not very useful to understand why someone did something to you in the 1st place... Especially when the person's no longer with you...<br><br>Last piece of advice... It's never wise to let your past haunt you... Especially one not of its worth.. And if your current relationship's already as good as it is... There're people asking why they can't have a good relationship... Even you probably were one who had asked in the past... Now that it's here... Why don't you just treasure it...? Instead of hanging on to something awful? Doesn't matter what happened... Sometimes we have a choice... Just that we often just give it a miss...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></blockquote></div>
