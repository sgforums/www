Note, though, that this may not be any of your doing - she may simply feel that what she says needs an audience of a different mindset to yours if she's to be understood.<br><br>3) On the other hand, if your normal pattern of communication is reflected in how you've written your posts here, it's not ideal for such a situation.  Obviously, if she's saying it's "nothing", it's going to be something that she does not find easy to talk about.  Judging PURELY by the way you've been writing here, there's a lack of the patience that's required if she's to feel safe enough to speak her mind.<br><br>To illustrate the extent of patience I'm talking about, I'll present the Seven-Hour Clock.  Shortly after my girlfriend and I started dating (we've been together for more than two years), I noted that she took roughly seven hours of saying "nothing" before she finally spat out whatever was bugging her.  The next time it happened, I simply told her that I'd get back to her in seven hours - she was startled by that until I explained the pattern that I had identified, and it became our running joke.  I don't have to use the Seven-Hour Clock often these days, but she knows that she can talk about what's bugging her whenever she wants to.  The point is that if you don't get an immediate answer, don't apply pressure - she'll just clam up if you do.<br><br>4) Going back to point 1, look past what each of you is saying, and try to identify the ways in which she expresses herself.  You may just find that she is indeed showing that she cares, simply in ways that have escaped your attention.<br><br>All the best!</div>

It gives your partner a sense of pressure and burden all the time, like everything they do or don't do becomes soooo important to you, they can't be themselves anymore.<br><br>Also, when you become obsessive, instead of enjoying time together, all the time you spend together end up being  full of imagined(or real) suspicions, then accusations, and it gets tiring instead of enjoyable.<br><br>Time spent together need not be long, but it is important that both of you are happy. Is your desire for her to belong in your life more important than your desire to enjoy her company, make both your lives fulfilling, for both of you to be happy? Even if one day you lose her, at least you are building up on the happy memories.<br><br>It isnt easy but I find these type of frustrations, insecurity, unhappiness is the biggest source of breaking down a relationship than any other reason.</div>
