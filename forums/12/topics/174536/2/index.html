Shortly after my girlfriend and I started dating (we've been together for more than two years), I noted that she took roughly seven hours of saying "nothing" before she finally spat out whatever was bugging her.  The next time it happened, I simply told her that I'd get back to her in seven hours - she was startled by that until I explained the pattern that I had identified, and it became our running joke.  I don't have to use the Seven-Hour Clock often these days, but she knows that she can talk about what's bugging her whenever she wants to.  The point is that if you don't get an immediate answer, don't apply pressure - she'll just clam up if you do.<br><br>All the best!</div></blockquote>This "Seven-hours rule" sounds like a great idea!

Actions are just ACTIONS... If a person buys flowers and say the 3 words 'I love you', doesn't necessarily means that he mean it... Even if he mean it, doesn't necessarily means that it'll definitely be preceived by the other party as so...<br><br>Your personality is on a confused state in this relationship. Probably because you have a sense of... 'Lack in control' over her... Whether through superiority, ego, satisfactions... You feel that your actions are not giving results and efforts not in effects.. In fact, your orientation could be so very wrong...<br><br>She on the other hand could be spoilt by you (this is just a partial guess) and refuse to let you exercise your 'superiority' over her... Both of you probably have an ego which couldn't be easily compressed... Especially yours...<br><br>And you're 'hiding'... From alot of things probably... Not 'seeing'... Narrow perspective.... very much on your own even as you come here to seek for an answer.. You look and search, but you don't really figure out...

I wanted to find out reason why she behaved like that . Dun tell me to ask / write letter / sweet talk / sms / call / communicate , I have exhausted all channels of communication.</div></blockquote>It is very obvious she is lack of love.What u give her is not love but care and concern only... Love is sometimes special that is not like just normal asking of yr well-being or taking care of her! It is an action to make  her special and stands out from all the rest u care abt.Or even stands out from the rest of the gal. I bet u r a blockhead and don know how to make her become the special!</div>
