              <p>no quarrels doesnt mean it's good too.... it may be that the other party doesnt speak up what he/she actually dislikes (bout my bad habits, my ways of dealin things, etc) and prefer to keep mum.. (thinkin that it will do the r/s good, but actually not)</p>
              <p>i'd like someone to shout at me and tell me what she dislikes than to keep quiet, 'speak nicely' so as to 'maintain' the r/s. i believe that through quarrels it will bring 2 people to better understand each other.</p>
              <p>i'd prefer her to tell me what she actually feels, so i'd see what i can actually do to improve myself, or on the r/s</p>

              <p><br>aiya me also same.. 5 months never quarrel then broke up... sigh</p>
              <p>But i think u guys luckier than me.</p>
              <p>i and my ex only went out once alone. other day, no time cuz she need to accompany her parenst on weekend and weekday we all have classes. See, she rather use taht 2 weekends to accompany her parents but never use at least one day to accompany me.</p>
              <p>SO i cannot tahan anymore and then she began to treat me like stranger,. see me like never see my real body there. u get wat i mean?</p>
              <p>At last , i found the reason of why shes treating me like stranger. After long time, i already analysed that she actually feeling guilty cuz theres 3rd person.</p>
              <p>Guess wat? the 3rd person is a Philippine gal whom she fall in love with thru internet.</p>
              <p>Lucky i already broke up with her... hard to say but i think she's insane.</p>
              <p>and now, im with my current gf live happily together...thats only how i know true love means..thats how i can really sense that she really loves me.</p>
              <p>For my ex, seems shes at other country. Liking a gal.. yea. u guess it rite.. now a lesbian. She doesnt have feeling for man but woman. Now her life is messed up.</p>
