Does it hurt more when a person says tat u r childish or u r killed by ur loved ones or u r finding another person to add to ur resume??<br><br>Mayb u still dun get my point... tats y u continue to post all those threads.<br><br>I know u r juz doing tat to spite me, i can understand thoroughly, but <span style="color: red;">i juz can't believe tat u can make a mountain out of a molehill. </span><br>I already told u tat i wana stop all these, y u still hanged on to it? Can't u let me complete my personal encounters in peace?<br><br>Well, in chinese they say bu da bu xiang shi. I tink its true. Who knows one day we might argue and fight till we become gd frenz.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>excuse me, u r the one who wrote paragraphs to run me down. like i've said i merely dropped 2 sentences. did u not count?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ai ya , foxwalk , don't bother about her closing her legs lah. Her business mah.<br><br>One thing I am surprised that kiekie haven't learn after an abortion how some men can be such b@stards. Good ones are around but you have to find out how a guy is as a friend first to see how he stands as a bf. I wish you happiness kiekie and I hope you learnt from your past r/s mistakes in order to make the next a better one�.�<br><br></div>
