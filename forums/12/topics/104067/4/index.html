            <div class='col-md body'>J was in fact 10yrs older than me. He definitely has his way of wooing girls. B4 I learnt tat he has a gf, I knew he was very flirt, he always like to tease the girls and even admitted to me tat he had a one night stand outside(when we were a pair).<br><br>I was furious of coz, but I tot well at least he was honest enuff to own up. So I forgave him..Love is blind. We still continued to be together even thou I knew he has a gf of 6yrs and the lady was a Malaysian. Even thou they cohabited, he seldom brings her out. Even b4 he knew me.<br><br>All his frenz knew abt it but nobody gave me the slightest hint tat he was attached. We went out almost everynite to chiong, eat supper and stay till dawn then we went home. I know why, becuz they r buddies. When J told them tat I already knew abt his gf, they were stunned tat I cud accept it.<br><br>AS time passes, I was really in a dilemma.. I duno wat I should do next even thou I know its impossible to between us. I love him, I can say. But y???? y muz heaven play such a joke on me? If I had knew tat he was attached, I wud nv become the 3rd party, I swear I swear I swearÂ….<br><br>I tried to leave, but I cudnÂ’t.<br></div>
