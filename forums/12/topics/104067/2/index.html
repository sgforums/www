ThereÂ’s more to come. U might even call me a slut or unfaithfulÂ…. But I m not writing a resume, its juz tat I jot down all the past in a so call Â‘diaryÂ’. I posted all the dates to keep track as well as to remind myself wat I had posted or missed so far.<br><br>Mayb guys out there will feel tat I m a nonsense or wat, but as I mentioned earlier, I dun mind any Â–ve remarks. I mean these r my past and I found this forum a good place for me to voice out my hidden past. Cuz not every single thing tat happened n ur life u r able to confide in ur fren. Sometimes, I feel tat writing down is a good way of expressing ur thoughts and venting ur agonies.<br></div>

HeÂ’s charming, faithful, loving, humorousÂ…etc, everything tat a girl looks for.<br><br>We only got closer after he recommended me a job; workin for his frenÂ’s aunt. Gradually, our friendship developed further. Before me, he was in love in a girl(from our same sec), he told me tat she actuali rejected him. So he was very sad.. and hated all chio girls.<br><br>I was glad tat he was honest and willing to tell me his past, as most of the guys out there wud rather not reveal too much of their past to avoid any uninviting troubles.<br><br>The sad thing he told me, is something tat I will remember for life. Cuz girls r prone to be the more sensitive ones. He said he chose me because I m average looking.  cuz chio girls tend to have more admirers and get tempted easily. He said tat I was lucky tat the girl whom he liked, rejected him if not how wud he chose me! I was traumatized wif his words, but pretended as thou I felt nothing.<br><br>INSIDE my heart, I felt utterly disappointed, mayb I m too sensitive and calculative. But he was the 1st guy who ever told me tat, which makes me feel so lousy abt myself. I mean even if he feels tat  I m not BEAUTIFUL, he should not have said that mah.<br></div>

We met up for a movie and he realized I had changed a lot.. In fact, I was over the moon, when he called..cuz I tot our fate had ended.. in nearly 2yrs, we nv contact each other AT ALL.<br><br>After tat we met up for a few times, chatting and going to east coast.<br>We mentioned abt our past, he complained tat last time I always nv bother to ask him where he goes or who he goes out with..blah blah blah.. I told him, he also nv check on me mah.. Everytime I tok to him or saw him, I wud be dumbfounded. Actuali I have a lot to ask and tell him but when I saw him, I became speechless.. I duno y I hold back my thoughts.<br><br>I nv told my 3rd bf abt the meetups, cuz i scared tat he wud be furious. ( I M BAD, I KNOW.) When I got into Poly, gradually my bf and i seldom have time to meet up. He was retaking his OÂ’level as a private candidate and works at a banquet from evenings to midnights. While I was busy managing my studies and projects.<br><br>I got to know a guy whoÂ’s in the same course as me. We were taking the same lift to our lab, who noes, he was a blurred blurred. He got out at the wrong lvl and quickly dashed into the lift when he saw tat I was still in it. In my heart I was giggling mad.. This big guy is so funny.. When we stepped into the lab, I realized tat he was my partner as we go according to our sir name. And our 1st initial r the same. We shared a lot in common and often go for breaks together( I mean in a group wif other frenz).<br><br>Soon I broke up wif my bf because of him, I knew tat I was selfish and cruel for doing this.. ALL my frens, my buddies.. chided me for ditching him. For to them he was really a good bf, as I said heÂ’s everything tat every girl looks for.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Despite of feeling bad, I felt Great because he should regret for those hurting words he had said. I mean since u feel tat I m sucks, I might as well find someone who noes how to appreciate me.</span><br>When we break, he told me tat he never tot tat I will be the 1 initiating BREAK.<br>Cuz he tot tat I m so afraid tat he might leave me for a better looking girl, who noes, itÂ’s the opposite.<br></div>

I mean, I m not the demanding type, and every little things he had done touches my heart. HeÂ’s shy and often got teased and bullied by his frenz even thou heÂ’s big built. So everytime he got into all these shiits, I wud  be the one backing up for him.. Haha, sounds aggressive. Cuz heÂ’s the ching chai type, pple insulted him he oso will take it as a joke tat type. I remembered there was one funny incident when he was chased by one of our female classmates. She chased him around the pillars of the pavement outside our campus, pulling his bag and he went round and round all the pillars trying to escape from her. I forgotten wat made her chased after him, but it was really funny.. a big guy running around and being pulled by a girl.<br></div>

I shouted at him, call him a blur king blahblahablahÂ… I admit I m not a good gf to him. I took his weakness as an advantage. There was once, I saw a puzzle tat I realy love, it was so sweet, but very costly :$50+. He wanted to buy for me, but I dun want, cuz its too costly, I dun want to waste his $. One day, we had a heated argument then he told me tat he actuali bought the puzzle for me as our anniversary surprise. And had a hard time fixing up the puzzle for me cuz the sky was in many blue tones. I was still angry wif him but moved by him. I volunteered to help him in the process.<br><br>B4 me, he had a 6yr r/s. And his grandma like her very much. Even thou they were no longer a pair, she often comes over to his huse to visit his grandma. I often saw her, I dun feel jealous or angry at all.  Cuz sheÂ’s kind hearted, soft spoken and very lady like. His grandma hated me for the 1st sight, cuz she like tat girl very much. I know tat girl was still in love wif my bf. But I told myself, even if he wana go back to her, I oso canÂ’t do anyting cuz they have being together for so long. So let nature takes its course.<br></div>

I didnÂ’t give up, I tried all kinds of way to make her opinion change.<br><br>Near her bdae, she invited his ex gf to her bdae dinner, but didnÂ’t ask me to go at all. So I kept quiet, I noe in her heart, sheÂ’s an angel while I was the devil. In the end, his maid urged his grandma to invite me, but I pretended tat I wasnÂ’t feeling well. So I went home. It was tormenting..<br><br>however, things became better when I bought her a bag for her bdae. She began to tok m0re and even smiled at me. I was realy very happy!!!!! My hard work realy paid off! She wud even confided in me like how jealous she was when all of us listened to the maid. She felt she has no authority in the huse. Nobody listens to her now.<br><br>His maid is like their bao mu. SheÂ’s very intelligent and hardworking. She noes how to speak their dialect, English and Mandarin. And was agood advisor.<br><br>He has a younger sis whom we had  better terms when I helped out at his mumÂ’s shop in the wkends. She looks very dao, cuz she dun trust pple tat easily(due to her bad exp). but when u gained her trust, she can be as crazy as u can imagine. We are good frens even up to now.<br><br>When we worked together, she always complained tat she had became as plump as me! Haha.. cuz we always eat eat and eat. One day, the maid came to help out, we began to be 38 po. The maid understand my feelings and told his sis how ke lian I was in the past, being tortured by ah ma.  We all hugged together and cried. They were glad tat ah ma finally accepted me. The maid even said tat the route was not a easy one. I was touched tat at least someone care.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>However whenever I help out at his mum shop, he wud go canoeing wif his frens on sat. And often goes out wif a girl named XH and another guy fren. I wanted to go canoeing with him but he dun want to bring me along.<br><br>Returning to the puzzle part, near xÂ’mas in 2001, I jokingly asked him whether he completed the puzzle, he was very furious and we quarrel again. He said tat I promised to help him in it and now I demand the puzzle from him! He said tat I was ridiculous and unreasonable. So he broke up wif me at city link. He walked off w/o turning his head back.. I was standing thereÂ…..all alone. I was shocked and lost. I romped around the area, walked to Millenia, walked to Suntec and Marina Sq. I bought myself a pack of cigarette and was choked cuz I duno how to smoke.<br><br>I took a cab home, staring at my hp hoping tat he wud call but he nv. In the end, I called him. I dun want to wait any more. He said he was sory for being harsh and took a cab to my huse. We cried together. In the end, he still wana break up wif me. I know he canot tahan me anymore. I asked him to go n die and fuk offÂ….. Tat night, I cant sleep. So I gobbled down 21 panadols; (Panadols which I hate to take since young, cuz the tablet is too big for me to swallow.) I duno where I got the courage to eat so many. And I even told my bro tat I couldnÂ’t sleep so I ate some panadols. Shortly after, I felt very drowsy and fell into deep sleep. I woke up at around 7am.Feeling nausea and dizzy. I vomited all over my bed and was crying. My mum preparing to work was shocked.<br><br>She brought me to a 24hr clinic and I was immediately sent to TTSH. I vomited all the slimy yellowish stuffs with lots of foam. It was like hell. My parents took urgent leave and accompanied me. I was feeling so bad tat I didnÂ’t give a thought for my parents. My mum sobbed as she saw my condition and chided me for being silly. I had to swallow a bottle(as big as a carton of HL milk) full of charcoaldote(duno how to spell). It taste like fine sand tat u can find from the beach.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was hospitalised for a week until the 3rd day when my term starts, tat was my last semester in poly. It was so frustrating to spent the New Year in hospital, but he did visited me in the afternoon. I guessed he was feeling sorry tat i got myself into this state. I was realy naive and selfish.. I only care for myself in the past, and nv really care for my parents. Now, whenever I did sth wrong, I wud feel tat Â‘wo dui bu qi ta men.Â’ I promised my mum tat I wud nv do anyth to hurt myself again.<br><br>During tat time, he came to visit me, as my DAD informed him. He was sry and even admitted to the police officer tat he was my bf. From 50kg, I dropped to 44kg, cuz I dun have appetite. His sis visited me too. I remembered She slept on the bed wif me for a while tat nite. Then a nurse walked into the ward and to attend to the other patients. Suddenly the nurse turned around and walked towards me. She laughed, u noe why? Cuz she tot she saw a ghost sleeping beside me!! Tat was realy a joke for us. Her sis bought me a hamper of bird nest and a big Ty bear. she blamed her bro for being heartless..watever. and called him a stupid carrot.<br><br>My buddies wanted to confront him abt our r/s, y we got into dis stage..but I pleaded wif them as I dun want to make things worse.<br><br>I dun want them to blame him cuz I knew I was the one whoÂ’s in the wrong. I m the one who had caused all these unhappiness to occur. I make him feel inferior abt himself by passing rude remarks like Â‘eh u r realy a dumb dumb, u nv use ur brain to do arh?Â’ or Â‘y u do it dis way, u shd do it another way, wah lau, so daiÂ’ and some more I fogot liao.<br><br>In the hospital I asked him isit because he fell for another girl, the XH? He says no. I pleaded him for another chance, telling him tat I will change. Even my young sis told him tat Â“ wo jie jie hai yi wei ni shi ta zhui hou yi ge nan peng you, zhe me zhi dao nib u shi, wo jie jie hen nan guoÂ”. He was the one who told me wat my sis said. I dun hate him for ditching me, I think dis is my retribution.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When I got back to sch, my frens were shocked!! Some simply dun recognized me!! Cuz my hair used to be short and I m plump. But tat time my hair grew longer and I became slimmer. They questioned me for my absence and I simply told a white lie: I had food poisoning.<br><br>Being in the same class as him, life was nv better. I saw him chattin and teasin the girl who pulled his bag.. my heart yearns for a patch back as I realy nv tot tat our r/s wud end up juz lidat.<br><br>Soon, all our frens realized tat we were no longer a pair and nobody dare to bring up any questions. Gradually, we became strangers. I avoided any eye contact wif him in lecture and sat as far as possible away from him.. Some of my buddies from who know my 3rd BF luff at me for they tot tat its my retribution for ditchin my 3rd bf for the 4th one.. I ve got nothing to say. But this is life.<br><br>I got on better terms wif another group of frens in poly. They invited me to their regular outings and studying. Slowly I managed to put the pain behind.<br><br>My 1st bf called me when I was hospitalised, he told me he was in GH. Cuz he broke his finger. I told him I canÂ’t visit him as I was hospitalised too. Wat an coincidence huh.<br>I told him wat had happened and he said tat I was beri sha.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>After a few wks when sch starts, I met up wif my 1st bf and tat was the 1st time in 4yrs tat he popped out: ni ke yi zhuo wo de nu peng you ma?<br><br>I was shocked and yet happy. Even thou I haven got over my 4th bf, I felt happy tat the man I love most is asking me to go back to him.. LAO TIAN YE ZHEN DE HEN AI ZHUO NONG REN.<br><br>When my 1st bf Â‘s mum saw me, she was so happy. She hugged me and said: Â“ m I dreaming, is tat realy u? Son, u better treat her better this time if not I wun let u off!Â”<br>Tat time, I felt really paisay.<br><br>Sayd to say, We were together for only 12days. We broke up again on the 3rd day of CNY. I was the one who initiate it cuz I dun ve the feeling tat I m his gf at all, heÂ’s still the same bo cham guy. I noe heÂ’s lidat, but so many yrs liao, I realy canot tahan this type of guessing game; always have to guess where he go, who heÂ’s wif and whatsoever.<br><br>Perhaps I m sicked of it. He nv ask me to go over to his huse to bai nian and nv mention to come over my huse too. I m so sad and this is the GREATEST MISTAKE IN MY LIFE. U will find out y in the later part.<br><br>During CNY,  I got to noe a guy from my girl fren. Soon, we were a pair. I duno y I canÂ’t stay clear of r/s! I m such a sluutt!!! But I m not! I dun wear revealin clothes and dun drink alcohol when I chiong.. m I so bad? I realy duno. Mayb I wana find a guy to spite him or to make myself feel wanted.<br><br>This guy is very spoilt. He whimpered like a baby and always like to attract attention. Always asked me to this and tat to give his family a Good impression. I hate it man!! I mean I m who I m, I dun want to force myself to be sb else! Ask me to mopped his floor while his mum at hme to show her tat I beri hardworking. Ask me to call his bro kor kor so he feel superior. Told me tat his dad has a company providing catering services like DHL and buy me expensive gifts which I nv say I want! He always think heÂ’s rich is a big deal and I hate boastful pple.<br><br>I wondered y I went steady wif him in the 1st place. Mayb I need a shoulder to lean on.<br>Soon I got pregnant and he was so gan jong. He wants me to abort the baby cuz he dun have a job and he dun dare to tell his parents abt it! I was traumatized!<br><br>Y m I so suay? I mean y canÂ’t I find a good guy??<br><br>I dun dare to tell my parents too fearing tat my mum wil go berserk! In the end, I went for an abortion. And I told myself, our r/s wun last long.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It was true enuff. We broke up in April 2002. He begged me and pestered me like a super glue. He stalked at my workin place and campus. I was living in hell. He told me he bought me a lot of cosmetic and clothes. I told him I dun want. if I ever accept its merely because I m greedy for his things or I took pity on him. Of coz I didnÂ’t take!! If not he will go around telling pple I went steady wif him becuz of his $$! I dun want to have anything to do wif him. I juz wan to get out!!<br><br>Tat nite, I went to a pub wif my female colleagues(as I worked part time over the wkends), he followed me. I was likeÂ…omg wat the hack?? But I was relieved tat he left earlier. After tat, my colleagues wana go for supper, I wanted to join them but they urged me to go hme as they lived in the north while I dun, so its not so convenient.<br><br>When I reached my void deck, I saw the walls of the staircase very bright, it was glowing. I walked up the satirs feeling weird. Den I saw him, sweatin all over and beside him was a BIG HEART SHAPE formed by candles. The sight of him realy irrated me!I was extremely furious. Yes, I knew he was tryin his best to get me back, but instead of winning me over, he pisssed me off! I asked him: y r u here? U do all this for wat? Go home pls, its already so late. He refused! I hardened up my heart and walked off, telling him to stay there as long as he pleased. If not it wud be mei wan mei liao! In the end, he stood outside my door.<br><br>My mum was awakened by the slammed of the door. She walked out of her room and asked me wat happened.. I told her nothing la. Out of curiousity, she went to the door and saw him standin outside. My mum INVITED him in, omg!!! In the end I let him stayed overnite in the living room cuz he told me tat he had no $$ to go home liao. U noe y? cuz he paid for all the drinks in the pub and took a cab to my huse and was broke.<br><br>My heart is not make of stone.. of coz I felt sory for him but I noe wat I m doing very well. If I continue to drag on wif him, it wud only make things worse.. we r not compatible.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As for my colleagues I nv blamed them for helping him, cuz I noe they meant well.<br><br>I held on to 2 part time jobs tat time, one was a indoor promoter, the other was a outdoor promoter. I duno how he found out my work place as a outdoor promoter. Sianz..<br><br>I was chatting wif a guy which I got to know on the table outside Mc donalds while there wasnÂ’t any customers. Suddenly he appeared. OMG!!! HeÂ’s like my shadow.<br>He even accompanied me home. I had no choice cuz I took the MRT home, I dun wana waste $ to take a cab becuz of him!<br><br>Naturally, He kept asking if tat guy was my new bf, I told him no an umpteen times. He dun believe. I dun care man, I mean I m no longer ur gf, even if I got a new bf u oso got no right to interfere wat.<br><br>Tat  guy was one of my customer. He was a lao beng in that area. So everyday after work, I will join him and his kakis at a kopitiam to eat and talk cock when I m free.<br><br>They all noe my ex always geng zhong wo and even teased me tat heÂ’s right behind me for a few occasions when I m off guard. Life was fun then, I soon got over my abortion and nv bring it up to anyone else except my one best female fren.<br><br>One nite, my ex called again, asking me to go wif him to his auntÂ’s wedding dinner. I go for wat??? So funny, I m not related at all! After his dinner, he called again and asked where I was. I erefused to tell him for fear tat he might come and look for me again. I was actually at a kopitiam in a big vehicle park wif my new frens. He dared me y dun dare to tell me where u r arh?? U muz be wif ur new bf right? I was intrigued by his words and told him the venue straight.<br><br>No doubt, he came down wif his bro(whom he forced me to call him kor kor)<br>My frens alerted me: are those ur frens?<br>I turned around and saw the 2 of them standing near some of the big trucks.<br>I walked over and asked him y he comes<br>He said tat: wo shuo de dao jiu zhuo de dao.<br>I said: ni xia lai zhe li zhuo she mo ? u chi bao mei shi zhuo huh?<br>He laughed, then the guy whom he saw outside the Mcdonald walked over.<br><br>He gestured me to go back to my seat.<br><br>After quite some time, my fren walked over and told me he had settled everything. In future, my ex will not pester me anymore.<br><br>I will continue tomorrow, very tired liao.<br></div>
