            <div class='col-md body'>I am a simple-minded woman with complicated love life.<br>The stories below are all real life encounters of mine. Juz wana let them off my chest. Hope to share stories with pple who r interested. Feel free to comment. I m neutral.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PART 1 THE FIRST MAN IN MY LIFE (SINCE 25 NOV 1995)</span></span><br><br>We had been together peacefully for 2yrs, for we <span style="color: red;">NEVER quarrel or fight </span>before. But human do change.<br><br>I am the sort who seldom check on or question my bf about his whereabouts or watsoever. Bcoz i m afraid tat he might find me a pain in the ass for bugging him. I always tot tat if he wants to tell me, he will tell me eventually.<br>ANd he's juz like me.<br><br>Things started to change when its around my O'level as i cud remember vividly. i was absent from my fav. subj history as we broke up a day b4 the exam. And i did very badly for my <span style="color: red;">Os as I got 30 points</span>!! REal LOUSY. On top of this, i repeated a yr while all my buddies were in poly.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Everything was too sudden.</span> I cud not find him for almost a week.<br>I only managed to talk to him on a few nights when his mum reminded him to call me; as i left a msg to her. Sadly to say we only tok for less than 5minutes. U know y?? because he reached home after midnight and said he's very tired wants to sleep.<br><br>I was as hot as the ants on the hot pan!! I waited till the wee of nights thinking tat he wud call me, in the end dis is wat i heard from  him.  With all the bottled up feelings, I broke off with him for the first time in 2yrs! <span style="color: red;">VOLCANO ERUPTED!!</span><br>He said" break, break la, u dun regret!" those words really shattered my heart, cuz i nv expext him to say them.<br><br>I noe it was wrong of me to initiate BREAK in the first place. But i nv expect tat he wud agree readily. In a fit of anger, i told him i will go over to his place to collect my belongings some other next day, and he says ok but he might not be at home. (U noe, girls often threaten guys in this way) Tat was NEar Dec 1997<br><br>The following day, my anger eased and i decided to call him to say <span style="color: orange;">sorry. </span>when i called his room number, an unfamiliar voice picked up. In a short while, he answered the fone. I felt puzzled as in his family, his mum is the only woman! WHO IS SHE?????? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I asked him who the girl was. Immediately he said tat was one of his brudder's gf.  I was abt to buy his story when the voice in his background exclaimed" <span style="color: red;">CB LA, WHY THE HELL DO U WANT TO KNOW WHO AM I</span>?"<br><br>Upon hearing dis, i was very furious, i mean dis woman is so rude!! I didnt know wat to do. I slammed down the fone. To think back, i m so stUPid!!<br><br>A few days later, wif the accompany of one of my buddies, i went down to Jurong west to collect my stuffs. I lost hope of patching back wif him when i saw the photoframe of us on the wall was no longer there. =SAD= I was devastated.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br><span style="color: red;">His mum hugged me tightly </span>and the tears i tried to hold back came rolling down my cheeks controllably.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> I asked if he got a new gf, his mum says she dunno. She apologised to me tat her son has let me down. I m so touched by her kind words. Thou i forgotten some.<br><br>I had nv tot tat he wud betrayed my trust and love for him.  Bcoz he doesn't flirt around. Perhaps i was to young at tat time.. His dad was so furious to find out tat we had broken up and even swear to confront him on my behalf!<br><br>I told his dad"<span style="color: blue;">human makes mistakes, sometimes he's very mature but sometimes not"</span>. His dad agrees wif me.<br><br>My whole family learnt abt it and my mum called up his mum for a chat without informing me. I was so diu nian already.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> argghh<br><br>Luckily my family is very supportive and tats when i realised how much my mum loves me. Bcoz i m so busy wif my own things tat i neglected my family.<br><br>Who noes, he still calls me occasionally to tell me where he was. I was surprised as i tot it's all over between us and he dun ve to report to me his whereabouts. <span style="color: red;">Nevertheless, I was elated to receive his calls and the hopes of getting back together relinquished in my heart</span>.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>On his bdae, which falls on X'Mas eve, I called him to wished him HAPPY BDAE in the morning while i was at work as a sales promoter in town, waiting for my O'level results.  To my surprised, <span style="color: blue;">Guess wat had happened?? </span><br><br>At around evening time, <span style="color: red;">He appeared before me!!!! </span>I was totally dumbfounded and paisay.. I stood rooted to the ground for a few seconds. I cud not believe wat I saw.. am I dreaming?? I smiled to him and ask him how come he was here. He said, he came all the way down to see me. Naturally i felt he was so sweet. He told me tat actually he reached town at around 2pm but he wasn't familiar with town areas and had a hard time finding the place i was working in.<br><br>In my heart, i asked myself repeatedly what does this supposed to mean? is he trying to hint me someting? If he asked for a patch back, i wud definitely wagged my tail. I was over the ninth clouds. I think it was the best gift ever for my X'mas.<br><br>When i knocked off at 9.30pm tat X'mas eve, it was raining torrentially. I was<br>on my way to the Orchard MRT; I saw a  very familiar back in front of me. I quickened my pace to check whether it was really him.<br><br>That was when all my hopes were diminished once again!! There he was walking in front of me holding the hand of another girl! I tried to catch up with him and wanted to confront him. But my voice held back. I felt tat I have no right to interfere who he was dating with; as i was no longer his gf. My throat was choking on the journey home and my eyes were red.<br><br>Ever since he nv called me. Can anyone Tell me wat is he trying to tell me???? he already has a gf then wat for he come down all the way from Jurong west to see me?? Am i an idiot in thinking tat he still loves me??<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part 2: 2nd BF whom I hated MOST!!<br>I got to noe him thru my classmate in a arcade. His family background was real jialatÂ… sighzÂ… HeÂ’s the youngest and only son in his family with 3 elder sis all married. His dad was an odd job labourer while his mum worked as a mummy.<br><br>I was waiting for my OÂ’level results then, so I worked as a sales promoter. Tat was my 1st job! Haha, I wana earn $$ so I dun have to ask my parents for $$, cuz my family belongs to the ave income zone. I remembered during CNY in 1998, he bought my parents a hamper, which left a very good impression of him(for my parents)<br><br>Thou heÂ’s poor, he wear branded stuffs and likes to play billard, sing ktv, watch movies etc like any other human, which I felt heÂ’s doing tat to show pple tat heÂ’s a rich kid. Everyone says his bike brings him bad luck as heÂ’s very suayÂ… he always got into accidents and there was once his whole bike was dissembled, left the skeleton. So all my hard earned $$ contributed in. I can say tat I paid for almost everything. Nearly BROKE!! Everyday eats bread.<br><br>There was once his bike skidded and he told me he was alright. Later I found out tat he had injured his Â‘didiÂ’, but yet he still dun dare to bring it up to me. I confronted him, he said he tot it was juz a slight injury. I forced him to see a doctor and he was hospitalized. Cuz the doctor said he muz remove the foreskin(circumcized).<br><br>I visited him everyday and bought food for him and his dad. Cuz nobody cooks at home. At age 17, I took up the responsibility of taking care of him, his dad and mum..Hard life.<br><br>His huse is like a Â‘GUI WUÂ’. Cuz no body bother to clean up, so many spider webs and dusty. On the window panes oso have a lot of beige colour things very hard one; duno wats tat. Tink should be the warps nest. His dadÂ’s eyesight got problem and was half blind. His mum worst.. came home at 4am, wakes up at 4pm. She drinks and smokes and was as skinny as a skeleton.<br><br>His sisters onli visits them on Sunday cuz they ve their own family to tend. I hated his 2nd sis to bits.. let me tell u yÂ…<br><br><span style="color: red;">SHEÂ”S AN ARSHOLE</span><br>On my ex 21st bdae, sheÂ’s a loud speaker la. She came to his huse and joyfully walked into his small dark room to boast tat she had specially designed a bdae cake for my ex. So feeling curious and excited, both of us went to the living room to take a look at her SPECIAL designÂ… I nearly fainted upon the scene. U know wat?? I dun tink any1 wud ever want to ve the kind of bdae cake. If its me I rather not celebrateÂ… On the table, there was a tiger beer olive colour rectangular tray(which was used for putting glasses and others) in the tray , there were 21 small cakes arranged very neatly. Thos cakes were dos $0.50 type tat we used to eat when we were kids.. the cheapo type leh!! WTH man.. somemore, she even boasted tat she oso got buy fishballs. Wat a celebration, 1st time see before.<br><br>continued...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">Continued part 2, Why I hated his 2nd sis:</span><br><br>When her darling daughterÂ’s bdae was approachin, she kept reminding me the date and kept pestering on wat I wud get for her. She oso told me not to but dis not to buy tat, cuz her daughter already has them. I mean where got pple like here so thick skin one? Initially I tot she juz joking, who noes shes not!! She even got the <span style="color: blue;">cheek to tell me tat </span>her bdae oso coming!! WTH man!!<br><br>I was as sore as a bear and told my ex tat since his sis so greedy, I might as well get her a bucket of rice for her bdae!! If u understand hokkein u shld now wat I mean.. We laughed till we got stomach crampÂ…<br><br>One Sunday as usual the BIG mouth nonsense(BMN) came to his huse. I was staying wif him to look after him mah. Out of the blue, the BMN blurred out to him tat he still haven return her $150. I was puzzled cos y he borrowed $ from her. After much persuasion, he confessed to me tat actuali he borrowed the $150 to buy a hamper for my parents during CNY. I was so furious, I mean I nv ask u to buy anything wat, since u no $ y still waste $$?? So pretencious. I hate the kind of man, no backbones! He tot I will praised him or wat!!<br><br>Oh forget to mention tat time his Â‘didiÂ’ was as swollen as the size of a mango loh, even my parents went all the way down to his 2room HDB flat in Redhill to visit him. See how he buys my parents heart? They are so good to him. When I related the special bdae cake incident to my mum, she even tried to help his 2nd sis by saying maybe they r too poor to buy a proper cake. But its not true loh, they lived in a 5 room flat, got car, why dun ve $$?? They r niao ji la. Too materialistic! My mum says nvm la. Instead she asked me to accompany her to the goldsmith shop. She chose a 24k gold dragon design pager clip costing ard $200+ n bought it for him!! WAH kao so generous. And my dad paisay cuz my mum buy, he nv buy and my mum dun wana share wif him. Weird rite? So my dad got him a Key design pendant ard $80+ and we bought him a durian cake. There goes the smiles on his face. To think back they realy treated him too good. Hard to find in laws tat r so good to u. I mean my parents are really gong gongÂ… keke.<br><br>There was once I had a class gathering at taka wif my sec mates. He told me he's going to catch a movie wif his kakis and play billard after tat. I say ok, cuz I felt tat since I canot accompany him, I should let him go out wif his frenz mah. I was very happy bcoz finally I can used the $80 tat I saved up to do some shoppin with the gals. Cuz I long time nv shop. &amp; he was so sweet to sent me to taka.<br><br>But instead of heading straight to taka, he parked his bike at Cineleisure, saying tat his frens asked him to buy the tickets first. I innocently waited for him. Then he turned to me and said tat he didnÂ’t bring enuff $, and the total cost for the movie tickets was $49, for 7heads. I pass a $50 note to him grumpily. Inside my heart I was sizzling hot, feeling like a complete stupid fool,  my shopping intention wasÂ…..  he says his fren will return him the $, but I nv see it. ( used to his tales)<br><br>His eldest sis is the most ke lian. She has 3 young kids and a baby girl then. Her husband was always on the run for fear tat loan sharks wud come after him. They even borrowed $ from the <span style="color: red;">loan shark</span> to pay for the medical expenses for the birth of their baby girl. The father of the 4 kids is a gambler, tats y he had to borrow $ from another LS to pay off his previous debts. Its never ending. Their power supply was cut, can u imagine their life is so hard?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: brown;">Tat was when I backed out from this 9mth+ r/s.<br>He called me on the fone, begging me to lend him $5k. Where the hell I got so much $ to lend him?? My mum says if its $500, she wud not mind, $5k is a huge sum. I told him I dun have tat much $$, u noe wat he tried to psycho me?? !!!!!!!!! HES A BASSSSTARD!</span><br>He told me to ask my dad to to get a loan from his company to help him. I was a real gong gong, immediately I called my dad and he gave me a tongue lashing. Being a Male Chauvinist(duno how to spell) he said tat he will nv do it lor, as it wud ruin his reputation in his company. So I told my ex my dad cud not help him. GUESS WAT?? He got the nerves to tell me tat my dad cud get a loan from the bank to help him!!! I was really pissed off, thou I know heÂ’s trying to find $ to repay the Loan shark for his eldest sis. I told him straight tat itÂ’s the end. HeÂ’s really too much,dun u think so?? He tot that my family print Singapore currency arh??<br>Go AND EAT SHIT MAN, yue xiang yue qi!!<br><br>I tried all ways to avoid him, his callsÂ…everything. Even after school, cuz I got my O level results, a 30 points man!! BloodyÂ….. fearing tat he might wait for me at my sch back gate which I always used, I took a taxi from the front gate hme everyday. And I tot tat I m free from his pesters!! Hahahaha. Who knows, he waited at my doorstep!! Fu*king hell man!! I was like huhÂ…..omg.<br><br>I was a bit scared when I saw him at my doorstep duno wat he wud do to me. But I still pretend to be like very arrogant. I asked him y he was here, and he says y dun I invite him into my hse.  So in my heart I told myself, theres nothing to fear of, I let him in, I sta infront of the computer and started playing games. He juz sat veside me quietly. When I turned to take a glance at him, I realized he was crying.. I asked him cry for wat? He asked me to give him another chance. I am a very xin ruan person, but I dun want to go back to the same old days again so I told him Â‘<span style="color: blue;">hao ma bu chi hui tou </span>caoÂ’. Being a glib tongue he repliedÂ’ hao cao bu pa hui tou chiÂ’. I was realy dumbfounded. He tried to hug me from the back. I stand up and told him to leave. He refused, I tried to persuade him to give me a few days to decide and he better leave me alone! He agreed and left. I heaved a sigh of relief. Tats the only way to make him feel better so tat he wud leave.<br><br>The rest I forgot, sory.. onli remember tat 2 yrs back, I saw him at BQ with a lady. The very next day, he called my hse and ask me out for a chat. HahahaÂ… he buay tahan me. Know y? this the scenario:<br><span style="color: red;">He: when r u free, come out for a chat leh?<br>Me: I m not interested la, too busy.<br>He: come out makan lah!<br>Me: I not hungry lah.<br>He: then come out for a drink lor? Can anot? Dun like tat lah.<br>Me: Aiyah, I oso not thirsty leh, u go find the girl whose wif u at the pub lor, I busy now, tok to u again.<br>He: the girl?
