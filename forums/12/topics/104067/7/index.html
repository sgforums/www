Whenever i saw any movies related to it or heard my colleagues talking abt it, i will pretend tat i dun feel anyting. In fact, my heart was throbbing in pain. what else can i do? cry in front of my frenz telling them abt my abortions?<br><br>If its not for my character, i dun tink i cud even have the opportunity to post my encounters here.<br><br></div></blockquote>Everyone made mistakes in their life. Most importantly , they must learn from it.<br>Kiekie , your story is quite controversial - there might be people taking offence from it.  There will always be someone disagreeing with how your life went. One thing is to hold your head high and move on to the next stage of your life. If you feel that you cannot make peace with yourself regarding the abortion - talk to a counsellor . Might help - may not help - but at least get it out of your system. Most importantly - move on.<br><br>Foxwalk - you might feel offended reading her story . Fair enough . we are only human . I don't think reminding her of her abortion is constructive at all . She sounds guilty , judging from her words - probably this is just abit therapeutic for her to reflect back on her life .<br><br>Something could come out good of her story - someone else reading , might be going to make the same mistake - and then her story could have prevented that  person from the mistake.  We just don't know.</div>

Leaving out the first relationship (Our relationship is usually much different from the rest. Not merely because its our FIRST, rather, its due to the astrological and karmic notion of our First Love.

In this aspect you are so much like mine best friend; she has more past relationships than you, but that's not the point.

            <div class='col-md body'>just finished reading all 7 pages of this thread....<br>i have no idea how i should be saying stuff here...<br><br>first of all it's really daring of her to candidly share her bountiful life experience and i can see that there're some negative response which is hardly surprising considering the contents of it all.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>it's her life she choose how to lead it... but really do hope that she'd not commit the same mistakes again.... there're enough mistakes to last her 3 lifetimes....<br><br>often enough when we see/hear something that's deemed unacceptable to ourselves we sort of have a prejudiced mindset but think for a moment if you're in her shoes,would you want ppl to call you names for what seemingly is destiny/fate?we're all entitled to our thoughts which can be pretty constructive when voiced out but when that thought is converted to name calling then i think it's a bit too extreme(there're nicer ways of putting nasty thoughts which equates to heavier impact  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> )<br><br>that said i must admit that i have a pretty negative impression and one of my personal peeve is promiscuity.... i do not feel right that one should jump into bed just because they're "steady"... where have all the nice ol tradition gone to?i thought sex was supposed to be a sacred act commited only by husband and wife? ok bend it a little-with someone whom you feel that you're going to have a long future with,seriously serious(not neccessary spouse nowadays) i think throughout history and even now and i foresee much more so in future, sex is one of the most abused    act. And author please do use protection,are you feeling guilty just becos we say so( your reaction seems kinda delayed/stunted) or for real? where's the once bitten,twice shy thingy? and please have sex with someone you know well enough,not just because he's your boyfriend  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  then decide he's not the kind you like,dump him,hurt him have him chase you around(did you do tht to make yourself feel attractive),then you kill off unwanted kids just because you weren't even sure.<br><br>your relationships are like very shortlived but then again that's your business....  it may be interesting to read about your life 'chronicles' but the more i read the more i'm curious.... what really are your intentions of posting your 'life story' here? what advice do you need from ppl online when you don't even listen to ppl around you? our eyes are pretty vulnerable and gets blinded by lots of things, what actually blinds you when you start a new relationship? Lust?Love?<br><br>from how i see it you started this current relationship with your bf becos you felt indebted to him,he was there when you needed someone... but seriously if he hadn't helped you,yes he may still accept you but for your last abortion you fix it yourself.... would you have stayed so long with him?or would you have scouted for someone else 'because you think that you won't last long with him'?... think about it....<br><br>sorry if i sounded harsh in any way.... not my intention to make you feel uneasy but i'm just very curious to why are you telling us all these? just what are you trying to achieve? well i hope you'll retell your 'life experiences' to your offspring in hope they won't follow your footsteps... but really if you were to confide all these to your friends i have no idea what they'd think... .but then again that's me your group of friends may be... well... more liberal  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

You are definitely not a strong willed person and if you don't seriously reflect on yourself you will perish.<br><br>May be you should begin to mean what you say.

You tell people not to pm you and to discuss in the forum but you pm other people.<br><br>If you can't get a grip by yourself I seriously think that you should get professional advice. I don't think that people in this forum can counsel you. Those who symphathise only tell you not to worry and to move on, but can you really do that?<br><br>There are many girls out there who are really in a terrible state. They got pregnant and lost the support of their boyfriends and their families. They drop out of school at an early age and have to raise a child when they themselves have not grown out of childhood.<br><br>There are children out there who are being abused daily, both sexually, physically and mentally by their own parents.
