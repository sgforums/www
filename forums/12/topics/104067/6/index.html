F. Skinner </span><br>wat do u mean shake spear? sry.. i dun quite get it. can u kindly elaborate on it? thanks..</div></blockquote>It is a good question. The fact that you asked this proves the point that this quotation is trying to pass to us.<br><br>Lets analyse this.  To do that, I think its good to know briefly who is B.F. Skinner. Could it be Boy Friend Skinner. I would not go to think so. The one I am referring to is Burrhus Frederic Skinner.<br><br>He was an American psychologist and author. He conducted pioneering work on experimental psychology and advocated behaviorism, which seeks to understand behavior entirely in terms of physiological responses to external stimuli. He also wrote a number of controversial works in which he proposed the widespread use of psychological behavior modification techniques in order to improve society and increase human happiness.<br><br>In simple terms, lets just say he was a guy who went to school. I know its a weird but some people do that.<br><br>I think most of us, or at least some of us know that machines cannot think. This is something that you have to take for granted even if you don't know it.<br><br>But why is he saying that there is a problem of whether men can think? This is because sometimes, some people, it can be anyone, you, your boyfriend, really anyone, do not think. If everyone took time to think before doing anything then the world would go very slowly. And Doctors would not make money by doing abortions and such.<br><br>I hope I have cleared your doubts about this quotation and that I was of some help at least.<br><br></div>

Juz wana let them off my chest. Hope to share stories with pple who r interested. Feel free to comment. I m neutral.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PART 1 THE FIRST MAN IN MY LIFE (SINCE 25 NOV 1995)</span></span><br><br>We had been together peacefully for 2yrs, for we <span style="color: red;">NEVER quarrel or fight </span>before. But human do change.<br><br>I am the sort who seldom check on or question my bf about his whereabouts or watsoever. Bcoz i m afraid tat he might find me a pain in the ass for bugging him. I always tot tat if he wants to tell me, he will tell me eventually.<br>ANd he's juz like me.<br><br>Things started to change when its around my O'level as i cud remember vividly. i was absent from my fav. subj history as we broke up a day b4 the exam. And i did very badly for my <span style="color: red;">Os as I got 30 points</span>!! REal LOUSY. On top of this, i repeated a yr while all my buddies were in poly.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Everything was too sudden.</span> I cud not find him for almost a week.<br>I only managed to talk to him on a few nights when his mum reminded him to call me; as i left a msg to her. Sadly to say we only tok for less than 5minutes. U know y?? because he reached home after midnight and said he's very tired wants to sleep.<br><br>I was as hot as the ants on the hot pan!! I waited till the wee of nights thinking tat he wud call me, in the end dis is wat i heard from  him.  With all the bottled up feelings, I broke off with him for the first time in 2yrs! <span style="color: red;">VOLCANO ERUPTED!!</span><br>He said" break, break la, u dun regret!" those words really shattered my heart, cuz i nv expext him to say them.<br><br>I noe it was wrong of me to initiate BREAK in the first place. But i nv expect tat he wud agree readily. In a fit of anger, i told him i will go over to his place to collect my belongings some other next day, and he says ok but he might not be at home. (U noe, girls often threaten guys in this way) Tat was NEar Dec 1997<br><br>The following day, my anger eased and i decided to call him to say <span style="color: orange;">sorry. </span>when i called his room number, an unfamiliar voice picked up. In a short while, he answered the fone. I felt puzzled as in his family, his mum is the only woman! WHO IS SHE?????? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I asked him who the girl was. Immediately he said tat was one of his brudder's gf.  I was abt to buy his story when the voice in his background exclaimed" <span style="color: red;">CB LA, WHY THE HELL DO U WANT TO KNOW WHO AM I</span>?"<br><br>Upon hearing dis, i was very furious, i mean dis woman is so rude!! I didnt know wat to do. I slammed down the fone. To think back, i m so stUPid!!<br><br>A few days later, wif the accompany of one of my buddies, i went down to Jurong west to collect my stuffs. I lost hope of patching back wif him when i saw the photoframe of us on the wall was no longer there. =SAD= I was devastated.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br><span style="color: red;">His mum hugged me tightly </span>and the tears i tried to hold back came rolling down my cheeks controllably.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> I asked if he got a new gf, his mum says she dunno. She apologised to me tat her son has let me down. I m so touched by her kind words. Thou i forgotten some.<br><br>I had nv tot tat he wud betrayed my trust and love for him.  Bcoz he doesn't flirt around. Perhaps i was to young at tat time.. His dad was so furious to find out tat we had broken up and even swear to confront him on my behalf!<br><br>I told his dad"<span style="color: blue;">human makes mistakes, sometimes he's very mature but sometimes not"</span>. His dad agrees wif me.<br><br>My whole family learnt abt it and my mum called up his mum for a chat without informing me. I was so diu nian already.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> argghh<br><br>Luckily my family is very supportive and tats when i realised how much my mum loves me. Bcoz i m so busy wif my own things tat i neglected my family.<br><br>Who noes, he still calls me occasionally to tell me where he was. I was surprised as i tot it's all over between us and he dun ve to report to me his whereabouts. <span style="color: red;">Nevertheless, I was elated to receive his calls and the hopes of getting back together relinquished in my heart</span>.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>On his bdae, which falls on X'Mas eve, I called him to wished him HAPPY BDAE in the morning while i was at work as a sales promoter in town, waiting for my O'level results.  To my surprised, <span style="color: blue;">Guess wat had happened?? </span><br><br>At around evening time, <span style="color: red;">He appeared before me!!!! </span>I was totally dumbfounded and paisay.. I stood rooted to the ground for a few seconds. I cud not believe wat I saw.. am I dreaming?? I smiled to him and ask him how come he was here. He said, he came all the way down to see me. Naturally i felt he was so sweet. He told me tat actually he reached town at around 2pm but he wasn't familiar with town areas and had a hard time finding the place i was working in.<br><br>In my heart, i asked myself repeatedly what does this supposed to mean? is he trying to hint me someting? If he asked for a patch back, i wud definitely wagged my tail. I was over the ninth clouds. I think it was the best gift ever for my X'mas.<br><br>When i knocked off at 9.30pm tat X'mas eve, it was raining torrentially. I was<br>on my way to the Orchard MRT; I saw a  very familiar back in front of me. I quickened my pace to check whether it was really him.<br><br>That was when all my hopes were diminished once again!! There he was walking in front of me holding the hand of another girl! I tried to catch up with him and wanted to confront him. But my voice held back. I felt tat I have no right to interfere who he was dating with; as i was no longer his gf. My throat was choking on the journey home and my eyes were red.<br><br>Ever since he nv called me. Can anyone Tell me wat is he trying to tell me???? he already has a gf then wat for he come down all the way from Jurong west to see me?? Am i an idiot in thinking tat he still loves me??<br><br></div></blockquote>i think the worst thing a guy can do to his gf is to 2-time. there's no future with him. it's more constructive to find someone else who will appreciate you</div>

Self-Console helps..</div></blockquote>aunt agony forum needs good counsellors. not just those who are expert but most importantly, those who care enough to listen and guide the troubled person along to recovery. it's always easier to solve others' problems than our own because our minds are more open when viewing from outside the box. you can benefit from helping others by being exposed to various problems and being more experienced when the time comes for you to handle your personal problems. so contribute freely. but learn to accept criticism gracefully because others may share your views yet</div>
