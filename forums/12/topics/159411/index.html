You can still love and not get married. Marriage is almost the highest form of commitment between two parties.

I said TO ME, love is the only reason to get married.  I also listed out a multitude of common reasons why people get married nowadays.<br><br>2. I think your 2nd sentence is irrelevant to my post.  I'm Not arguing whether people should or should Not get married because of love.  I'm saying that love should be the main reason why people get married.<br><br>3. With true love, chances that 2 people want to remain committed might be higher.<br><br>4. Why can't I say that better alimony is a possible reason for the breakup of marriage?  What I'm saying is that it's 1 of the factors that may contribute to the higher divorce stats nowadays.  If you wanna debate with me, please try to provide a more intelligent argument rather than nitpick without anything better to add.<br><br>5. Lastly, willingness to commit also stems from love.  If you wanna deny that, then I don't think we should even waste time arguing.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br></div></blockquote>You are right that willingness to commit stems from love but in my opinion, not all people who love are willing to commit (which was the point that i wanted to put across but failed to elaborate).<br><br>As for better alimony being a possible reason for breakup, that seems strange cos i view alimony as a result of a divorce and not as a cause for divorce.  perhaps if one of the parties has difficulties in obtaining financial support from the other and decides to file for a divorce in hope that she will be granted an alimony to support herself and the family. this would however seem to me presumptuous. again, you may think that i am nitpicking and not constructive but i am just stating the grounds for my opinion as to why better alimony should not exactly constitute a reason for breakup. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Why  complicate things?<br><br>Another point I often notice about people posting about the sad state of the institution of marriage , and I assume this thread starter to be male, is that they almost always add the point that women are being unfaithful too, and horrors, women are just as bad or are more unfaithful than men.<br><br>What did you expect, really?  Do people still have trouble believing that both genders like to have fun on the side?<br><br>I'm not sure if the posters are really lamenting the status of marriage, or if they're complaining because their ego got bruised by the fact that women philander (yes, just like men do) .
