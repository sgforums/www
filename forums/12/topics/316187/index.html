              <p>hi computerm,</p>
              <p>sorry to hear about your mom. hey don't imagine the worst at this point. make the trip down to SGH with her and find out as much as you can. chances are your mom is shit scared about this now and so is everybody else. if i were you i'll avoid crying and showing too much fear. be strong. be the one to lighten things up. be cheerful around your mom. emotions are contagious. so be positive about this and so will she. :)</p>

              <p>There are lots of reasons that cause pain in the legs so it may not necessarily be cancer or bone cancer.  Just wait for the test results.</p>
              <p>So when is your mum's appointment?   </p>
              <p>Recently one of my colleagues suddenly suffered from numbness at lower leg when he was walking to work.  His wife took him to the doctor at the clinic and after having a look at him, the doctor just referred him to emergency at the hospital right away.  It turned out that he had a aneurism behind his knee and require by-pass operation immediately. </p>
              <p>If you're really worried about your mum, perhaps just take her to the emergency straight away.  Every minute matters.</p>
              <p>Take care and good luck!</p>

              <p>err, i dont know, but funnily, more people think that their pain or lumps or whatever is linked to cancer</p>

              <p>Im not very sure abt cancer in tat way..But leg pains &amp; numbness can mean many things too, not necessarily cancer.  Before the doc finds anything cancerous, B POSITIVE!!  Ur mum is ignorant of the facts &amp; not fully clear abt cancer, tat's why she has such fears.  But u too??  Please buck up, &amp; b strong.  Nothin has been confirmed yet, u are scaring sh!t outta urself &amp; ur mum.</p>
              <p>Bone cancer, if im not wrong, can b cured with donation of the rite marrow. </p>
              <p>Again, i have to say...BE POSITIVE, nothing has been confirmed by the doc yet.</p>

              <p>Let me share a personal experience with you.</p>
              <p>My aunt was diagnosed with cancer a few weeks ago. When my father broke the news to me. I almost felt like crying my eyes out at the spot, but I stayed strong. In the end, the operation was a success and she was alright after that. She even visited my grandparents and I yesterday to give us something.</p>
              <p>So what I'm trying to say is that cancer can be cured, and you should just be optimistic. :)</p>

              <p>My Dad just passed away last month after 8 months of battle with cancer at lymph nodes on his neck.</p>
              <p>it all started last April when he showed me an unusual painless ulcer-like patch on his innermost upper mouth plate. After referral by the outpatient doctor upon suspicion of cancer, he went for the biopsy and confirmed the diagnosis. By the time he consult the cancer oncologist in NCC at SGH, it was already stage 4.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cancer is incurable. Those that survived can maximally make it 5-10 years. It is like a windfall if the lifespan can drag that long, but notwithstanding the possibility of persistent pain, agony and sufferings of the patient. My Dad was on constant pain killer intake after the surgery and the months preceding his end, the prescription of the medicine to ease his pain extended to the most advanced type equivalent to morphine.</p>
              <p>Sometimes it is more a solace to see the victim passed off comfortably than to see the tumultous life of physical suffering to go thru. It is not only affecting himself but also the family.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, I suggest you face the fact than to speculate worthless miracles to happen.</p>

              <p>Sometimes this kind of dramatic event happened to a family can reveal how caring the members are towards each other.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some take for granted the loved ones' care and concern when they are in the pink of health. Just as tragedy struck and that loved ones vanished, the feeling of that loss and reminisce can be unbearable.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My Dad used to take care of us closely before he was diagnosed with cancer. Every Friday night before he went to bed, he will definitely enquired (sometimes he would wake up from his sleep and asked if we happened to reach home late on Fri nites) what we wanted for breakfast the next day (Saturday). He will walked the market for my mum and shoulder all purchase of groceries and other errands. We are being very pampered then.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just when he was bogged down by the disease, he became bed ridden and all these chores then fell on our hands.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now he was gone. I, as the elder son, will take over him to run these errands thereafter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is always the feeling and question to ask, "How much do I care for him?" when that person was no more with us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally, be ready to accept that poignant sight of the once upon a time healthy looking average sized person suddenly reduced to almost a bag of bones and totally transformed character (e.g. In great hallucination due to medicine effect and talking with incognizance) when cancer attacked on its final stage.</p>
              <p>Be ready to accept the pain of bereavement!!!</p>
