There might be some reasons for her not to wan u to hug her and she may not feel comfortable. Give her time to overcome it. Dun ask, jsut be there for her.<br><br>Even as bf and gf,i think there are times when u stil need to trust each other and give each other some time and space. What she is telling u is not wrong as who noes wat will happen nxt time. Who noes whether u will stil be with her in a few mths time. Nobody can garantee anything even though u 2 can be committed to each other.<br><br>If there are things abt her u are not happy with, try to tok to her in a nice manner. After all she is ur gf. Accept her for who she is. Tok things thru nicely if there are conflicts. Its no use keeping it in the heart forever.</div>

If u really wan a long rls with her, u have to win her trust with ur heart.<br><br>I feel that u are making a committment to make her ur wife and u wan to be with her. However, ur gf is making some committments to the relationship instead. I would say that u are wrong but dont take it to the extreme extent. As i have mentioned b4, rite now, u 2 are in a relationship, not engaged to each other.<br><br>Physical contact requires time. Give her more time. Its a phase in a relationship. However this phase can change dependent on ur thinking. If u read too much into things and stress ur gf too much, the phase may be gone. I would suggest ur gf is just trying to settle into her work and also work things out with u slowly. U 2 have just started work and need time to adjust to it.<br><br>Give urself some time to work things out. Remember that trust is the most important aspect of a relationship. Since u 2 are together now, y not njoy the happy moments shared together and treasure it? Oh and one last thing to remind u, marriage is a very serious matter to a girl cos if she marry the wrg guy she will regret forever. So I think thats y at the moment she doenst wan to committ too much.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Dun worry. Things will be fine.</div>
