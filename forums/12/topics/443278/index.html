              </p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Today I had
              another quarrel with my dad. The feeling is so bad that I had to find a way to
              vent my anger and sadness. Guess one way is to pen this down.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Since
              young, my dad don’t bother to take care of mum, brother and me. We had been
              staying with grandma and taken care of by grandma since we were born till the
              age of 12. It was then that we were seen as old enough to work that we were
              brought back to stay with dad. Since then we were forced to work in dad’s shop
              and earn our own living. Working after school till 8pm and earning a tiny $3 a
              day. Dad was never in the shop to help out, only collecting money at end of the
              day. My days only got better when I got fed up and signed up with the SAF’s at
              the age of 16. My dad did not want to pay for my school fee and therefore I had
              no choice but to seek SAF’s sponsorship for my diploma and earning a monthly
              allowance at the same time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Feeling
              grateful of what SAF had provided me, I worked hard in the SAF and was promoted
              along the way. Things got even better when I was given the opportunity to study
              in UK. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">During my
              studies, I read a lot of Buddhist teachings which always remind to be forgiving
              and providing for your parents. Even though I kind of hated my dad, I still
              believe that I should provide for my parents with what I can afford. So I
              suggested having our whole family pool our savings together (Bro, me and dad each
              paying 33.33%) to purchase a condo and the rental will be given to mum and dad.
              Dad readily took up the offer, we purchased the condo, but he took the entire
              rental without sharing with mum. Know his greedy nature, we just let him be.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Years
              passed and I returned to Singapore. I found my true love in UK and we were preparing
              to get married. The condo had appreciated more than $200k and I suggested to sell
              the condo at this high price to share the profit and thereafter we can buy
              again when the economy goes down again. But dad do not bother with my wedding,
              he is more concerned with losing the rental then sharing the profits first and
              helping me in my wedding. His reason in not selling, he did not take good care
              of us since young and he can trust no one in the world to provide for him!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Mum was so
              angry with him that she silently told me that she will help me with her $30k of
              private savings. But this was found out by dad when he saw mum’s messages in my
              phone.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">After much quarreling,
              he suddenly agreed to loan me 60k (of which he took mum’s $30k and claimed as
              his own) and that I have to return the entire 60k to his own account. To this, mum
              and I conceded.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Days passed
              and (for 5 months) almost every fortnights dad would ask on when will the 60k
              be returned or that I need to buy new household item like washing machines, pay
              bills for him. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">Today, 10
              Dec 2011, he got worst! He actually asked me to take the maximum cash-out housing
              loan to repay him the 60k (of which 30k is not his) and the rest must be kept
              by him for his personal purchase of shop house and more rental for himself! The
              reason being he needs to look after himself and there are so many news saying
              children are not taking care of their parents!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">But
              thinking aloud myself, did dad ever treat us as his children? </span></p>

              As long as it is not your money, return what is due to him/her. To justify ur stance is a cop out.
              He being ur father does not mean that he has to pay for u, if he wants to he would have done so. he is not, just accept and find a way to stand on your own.

              why is your mother not in any way suggesting as to what could be done?
              I also guess that your father is not telling u the actual reason for not wanting to part with his money now - fear and more fear, blame him i dont lah. also, ur impending marriage and the prospects of the kind of daughter- in-lwa  and the confluence of many other factors that contributed to these state of affairs is latent.
              
              Of course, what is the point of analysis or wondering. fact is he is suspicious and fearful that he mite be abandoned. He does not even trust himself - how to trust another lah

The total cash he paid for my first 15 years will not even amount to $20k, yet he is sucking hundreds of k out of me, mum and bro. Worst of all, he used our earnings for his wed,sat and sun gambling and drinking!</p>

              Ãº say ''he used our earnings for his wed,sat and sun gambling and drinking'' - if that is true, then it is obvious that he does not care. hoping is wishful thinking. Do what is necessary, of course, I would urge that you get ur bro and mother's opinions.
              Never trust a lawyer's promises, do ur own reading, (there a lots of info online) before engaging one, otherwise not another nitemare but a daymare!
