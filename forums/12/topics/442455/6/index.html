              <p>i need help with problems regarding my neighbour as well. it's a really long story, i'll try to summarize it in one sentence:</p>
              <p>"they like to spray bleach into my house, but we don't have solid evidence of them in the act"</p>
              <p>if you have time to spare, you may like to read on:</p>
              <p>i've stayed at my house since i was born, i'm already 20. then, my old neighbour (whom have not once complained about my family's behaviour during their stay) sold their house last year. the new flat owner rented the entire unit to several families, whom apparently aren't locals.</p>
              <p>initially, they started off cooking curry almost every hour of the day. Mind you, it's not nice smelling curry like my other malay neighbour makes. it's super pungent and unpleasant to the nose. like the curry got burnt and what's cooking is the aluminum from the wok. i suspect they do not flush after using the washroom as well, since there seem to be an accumulation of ammonia smell coming from the bathroom's drain. besides that, when hanging out the clothes using bamboo poles, they LOVE to use theirs to hit ours, which is rather gross. in addition, there is noise every night after midnight. it's not continuous-- we can easily call the police for that. it sounds like people using the washing board to wash clothes, and then random thumping noises. we stay above them, doesn't make sense for us to hear their walking/ running etc. idk but it feels like they have been using bamboo poles to hit their ceiling. they also like to burn incense, the stick form in their house, and have a pot of incense at the stairs between our 2 levels. the smell is overwhelming, but we understand. for religious reasons we tolerate that.</p>
              <p>BUT the previous actions mentioned above, we do not understand.  i don't think we deserve all these nonsense when we didn't even cause disturbance to them in any way. even if we did, they could have come up and speak to us, right? there's only my mum at home usually, how much trouble can she create? so, we spoke to them nicely several times. the wives who stay at home in the day don't speak english, and just answers "no, no, no", to whatever we say. fine, we wait for their husbands to come home. we spoke to them several times, okay good, they understand where we are coming from, say they'll try to restrict their actions (eg. when cooking close the kitchen windows a little, try to keep the bathroom clean, dun poke the bamboo poles too high when keeping their laundry...)</p>
              <p>AND IT COMES BACK WITHIN ONE WEEK. AND WORSE OFF EACH TIME. NEW "PATTERNS" APPEAR. AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE STAYING THERE INCREASES.</p>
              <p>i applaud them for their creativity, seriously. from incense burning, they upgrade to air freshener. the cheapo smelly kinds. spray out of their window. okay, i have no evidence of that but i can hear the nozzle sprays loudly when i stand by the window and the smell diffuses into my house. and next thing is all windows in my house closed, all fans turned on, main door opened to let the smell out. and the cooking smell appears with increasing frequency, everytime my mum puts out our laundry. and the noise levels up to door slamming, and table dragging etc. they blame it on their kids. </p>
              <p>it's getting out of hand. the neighbour 2 storeys below us got affected as well. we moved on to writing to the flat owner through post (not sure if he saw the letters). we went to HDB (to check if the rental is illegal, since the owner does not stay in the house, and it's rented to a few foreign families), then to town council for the daily incense burning along the corridor, it's a fire hazard especially when there are many kids in my block. then to the police for the noise. then also to the meet the peoples' session to speak to the MP.</p>
              <p>BUT TO NO AVAIL. the people sent to handle this case so happens not to do their job competently. we understand, they do have their limits.</p>
              <p>the people from hdb cant possibly catch them for illegal renting, when they came we peeked at the neighbour, they refused to open the door. after awhile, we see a man, supposedly the flat owner coming, and then the person from hdb came again. ah, the owner stays in that unit! like real. but we dont have evidence of him not staying there! we told the hdb officer, he insisted on his observations.</p>
              <p>the people from town council. HO HO HO. for the incense, yes, it's a sensitive issue. but what they did was to stick a weak piece of paper on the wall above the incense pot between our 2 storeys. it looks familiar. i have the exact same one at home, just that it's not pasted on the wall. i think every year during the chinese tomb-sweeping festival every household gets that.</p>
              <p>the police, i know, the noise, you cant really catch it, it's on and off. we don't expect you to send someone to stay overnight with us to check it out. maybe just get someone to issue a simple letter? and they just told us that they're too busy. yes it's a trival matter compared to catching serial murderers. but in singapore, really? in a neighbourhood police post, really?</p>
              <p>then they upgrade again. this time to spraying bleach during meal times. i'm really at a loss what to do. my mum's affected emotionally, so thinks that they're opposing her deliberately.</p>
              <p>i understand we must try to accept people's differing ways of life. but shouldn't they also try to be more open minded and change their habits a little?</p>
              <p>any smart people out there can offer me some suggestions to tackle this issue? or are we over reacting in the sense that all these are common?</p>

              <p>Your new neighbours are trying hard. Not very well though. They use cheapo air freshener, clorox because you complain their toilet smelly, their cooking smelly, their joss sticks smelly. They don't know how to weild the gala, that why knock here knock there. Carry horizontal too long for the flat, so they carry the gala verticle. They are learning. You should appreciate their efforts. They are <em>sua ku</em> who are now living in flats.</p>
              <p>Maybe you should befriend them, and show them how to be consderate.</p>
              <p>They will cook curry for you.</p>
              <p>Or you want to go to CMC, where they will agree to wait for you to be not in then they begin their activities. See they are not bad people after all.</p>
              <p>Its only you expect them to be, and you are getting your expectations.</p>

              <p>i need help with problems regarding my neighbour as well. it's a
                  really long story, i'll try to summarize it in one sentence:</p>
              <p>"they like to spray bleach into my house, but we don't have
                  solid evidence of them in the act"</p>
              <p>if you have time to spare, you may like to read on:</p>
              <p>i've stayed at my house since i was born, i'm already 20. then,
                  my old neighbour (whom have not once complained about my family's
                  behaviour during their stay) sold their house last year. the new
                  flat owner rented the entire unit to several families, whom
                  apparently aren't locals.</p>
              <p>initially, they started off cooking curry almost every hour of
                  the day. Mind you, it's not nice smelling curry like my other malay
                  neighbour makes. it's super pungent and unpleasant to the nose.
                  like the curry got burnt and what's cooking is the aluminum from
                  the wok. i suspect they do not flush after using the washroom as
                  well, since there seem to be an accumulation of ammonia smell
                  coming from the bathroom's drain. besides that, when hanging out
                  the clothes using bamboo poles, they LOVE to use theirs to hit
                  ours, which is rather gross. in addition, there is noise every
                  night after midnight. it's not continuous-- we can easily call the
                  police for that. it sounds like people using the washing board
                  to wash clothes, and then random thumping noises. we stay above
                  them, doesn't make sense for us to hear their walking/ running etc.
                  idk but it feels like they have been using bamboo poles to hit
                  their ceiling. they also like to burn incense, the stick form in
                  their house, and have a pot of incense at the stairs between our 2
                  levels. the smell is overwhelming, but we understand. for religious
                  reasons we tolerate that.</p>
              <p>BUT the previous actions mentioned above, we do not
                  understand.  i don't think we deserve all these
                  nonsense when we didn't even cause disturbance to them in any
                  way. even if we did, they could have come up and speak to us,
                  right? there's only my mum at home usually, how much trouble can
                  she create? so, we spoke to them nicely several
                  times. the wives who stay at home in the day don't speak
                  english, and just answers "no, no, no", to whatever we say. fine,
                  we wait for their husbands to come home. we spoke to them several
                  times, okay good, they understand where we are coming from, say
                  they'll try to restrict their actions (eg. when cooking close the
                  kitchen windows a little, try to keep the bathroom clean, dun poke
                  the bamboo poles too high when keeping their laundry...)</p>
              <p>AND IT COMES BACK WITHIN ONE WEEK. AND WORSE OFF EACH TIME. NEW
                  "PATTERNS" APPEAR. AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE STAYING THERE
                  INCREASES.</p>
              <p>i applaud them for their creativity, seriously. from incense
                  burning, they upgrade to air freshener. the cheapo smelly kinds.
                  spray out of their window. okay, i have no evidence of that but i
                  can hear the nozzle sprays loudly when i stand by the window and
                  the smell diffuses into my house. and next thing is all windows in
                  my house closed, all fans turned on, main door opened to let the
                  smell out. and the cooking smell appears with increasing frequency,
                  everytime my mum puts out our laundry. and the noise levels up to
                  door slamming, and table dragging etc. they blame it on their
                  kids. </p>
              <p>it's getting out of hand. the neighbour 2 storeys below us got
                  affected as well. we moved on to writing to the flat owner through
                  post (not sure if he saw the letters). we went to HDB (to check if
                  the rental is illegal, since the owner does not stay in the house,
                  and it's rented to a few foreign families), then to town council
                  for the daily incense burning along the corridor, it's a fire
                  hazard especially when there are many kids in my block. then to the
                  police for the noise. then also to the meet the peoples' session to
                  speak to the MP.</p>
              <p>BUT TO NO AVAIL. the people sent to handle this case so happens
                  not to do their job competently. we understand, they do have their
                  limits.</p>
              <p>the people from hdb cant possibly catch them for illegal
                  renting, when they came we peeked at the neighbour, they refused to
                  open the door. after awhile, we see a man, supposedly the flat
                  owner coming, and then the person from hdb came again. ah, the
                  owner stays in that unit! like real. but we dont have evidence of
                  him not staying there! we told the hdb officer, he insisted on his
                  observations.</p>
              <p>the people from town council. HO HO HO. for the incense, yes,
                  it's a sensitive issue. but what they did was to stick a weak piece
                  of paper on the wall above the incense pot between our 2 storeys.
                  it looks familiar. i have the exact same one at home, just that
                  it's not pasted on the wall. i think every year during the chinese
                  tomb-sweeping festival every household gets that.</p>
              <p>the police, i know, the noise, you cant really catch it, it's on
                  and off. we don't expect you to send someone to stay overnight with
                  us to check it out. maybe just get someone to issue a simple
                  letter? and they just told us that they're too busy. yes it's a
                  trival matter compared to catching serial murderers. but in
                  singapore, really? in a neighbourhood police post, really?</p>
              <p>then they upgrade again. this time to spraying bleach during
                  meal times. i'm really at a loss what to do. my mum's affected
                  emotionally, so thinks that they're opposing her deliberately.</p>
              <p>i understand we must try to accept people's differing ways of
                  life. but shouldn't they also try to be more open minded and change
                  their habits a little?</p>
              <p>any smart people out there can offer me some suggestions to
                  tackle this issue? or are we over reacting in the sense that all
                  these are common?</p>

              <p>I used to have the exact same problem plus noise and shouting (at wife and baby) at odd hours. We certainly are not overreacting because this is totally unreasonable.</p>
              <p>Btw, it's not curry they made. It's something else that smells like dead rats.</p>
              <p>1. Retaliate in kind with the same air freshener . Clothes, hang them inside so they won't get damaged or stolen.</p>
              <p>2. Be persistent with HDB. At they very least it will annoy them and show them you can make their life miserable.</p>
              <p>3. Try and understand their psyche and where they come from. They are obnoxious to other on a daily basis,  Above all, the womenfolk are like, even though they do nothing but serve as a home-bound fucking machine, to them, not losing face is EXTREMELY important. They are EXTREMELY stuborn, not that the men are reasonable but if you wanna talk, talk with the men or you'll go nowhere.</p>
              <p>4. I did all the above. Some of them fucked off and moved outl the rest were more acceptable after that.</p>
