              foreign indian family who use to call many peoples to eat at
              their house and play lots of indian bollywood dancing music
              thereafter till early hours.</p>

              music will be play till early morning,  rented a
              Yamaha top speakers with high power amplifier from
              Adephi, altogther got 4 big speakers and 2 smaller ones, like live
              concert at Padang NDP, once the indian start their music only, my
              brother play our taiwan hokkien dance song at full volume, the
              whole condo precinct can shake, all the indians, ang mo, chinese,

              <p>But your reasoning that they don't know... it's more accurate to say they don't want to lose "face" by giving way. Even if they don't wanna do something anymore, and they did it for the last time, if somebody told them off, they would do it again.</p>

              <p>What kind of flooring you have in your condo ? It could be footfall impact they are hearing.</p>
              <p>Typically, a professional can install a noise detector in your neighbour's condo to record ambient noise. Usually if it does not exceed 50/60 db, ambient noise is normal and usually within acceptable range.. (depending on rules and regulations).</p>
              <p>If the recorder shows higher db frequently, they have a legal case against you.</p>

              <p>Some condos pipes are not well thru or got air inside, so everytime, someone use water, there is these bubble sounds or coin dropping sounds, it is not the neighbour making lots of noises, please check with your condo management, they use fake or poor quality pipes and contractors to build your condo, then charge you 1 million for it, end up everyday listen to pipe bubble music.</p>
              <p>Those living near lift also can get alot of noises if the lift is a lousy one and the mechanism may not have any sound proof installation, end up every nite count the nos of lift trips, how to sleep leh.</p>

              <p>Singapore Cops only knows how to write report, for settling neighbourhood problem, they act blur one lah. I notice when I was younger, singapore cops were better, they really arrest people back to police station and talk, ask this and that, charge those really at fault or disturb others. But as time goes by, notice that Singapore cops are doing less and less, scare this and that, talk only but no action taken.</p>
              <p>I once called police for a drunken in my pub who look for fight with my other customers, the police came, and the first thing they do, instead of taking the drunken man out, they ask for my IC, name, time of call, description of incidents, all for them to write a report that they attended my call and do their duties, I was so fed up, scolded them that they should arrest the problem in hand, not taking a cardboard file and start writing report, do you mean that if someone live is in danger, you can still write reports??
