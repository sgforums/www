              <p>The answer is no. </p>
              <p>We go out with a group of friends, never alone with single guys so frequently. Unless you are just a visiting tourist. </p>
              <p>We also make sure to introduce u to our husbands so there be no misunderstanding.</p>
              <p>She obviously is using you to fill the void when her husband is busy with other things.</p>
              <p>She is merely hiding behind the "friendship" label, to justify going out with you.</p>
              <p>Dont you have a social circle ? It is shameful for you to be seducing a married woman. Your local friends will gossip behind your back. </p>
              <p>I suggest u spend more time hanging out with other friends, than being an undercover gigolo for this lady. </p>

              <p>If she is separated, she is not yet free from her husband, legally she may be accused of adultery. Adultery may affect her child custodial rights during divorce proceeding. Maybe, she is worried about losing her child, that's why she haven't sleep with you yet .</p>

              <p>Or course is abnormal.</p>
              <p>Asian women are super conservative. Asian women are even more conservative than a virgin catholic nun in her 60s. They act like some kind of phobia virgin piece of shit nun that has never seen a dick in their life. But secretly they are sex-maniacs. Outwardly, they despise sex and porn - hypocrites. The asian women treat the men like bacteria. They think they damn holy or something.</p>
              <p>When I dine with friends at a round table, I notice the wife always sit next to the husband but makes sure the person next to her is a woman. Stupid culture.</p>
              <p>Also when watch movie at a cinema or at a lecture hall, the stupid women always leave big gaps because they are afraid to sit next to the men.</p>
              <p>Its not like in the USA, where you can sit at a bench next to a female, and she don't give a damn about you. Or when you are tired at a UK shopping complex, so you sit at one of the benches next to a few girls, they just leave you alone.</p>
              <p>In Asia if you try to sit next to them, they just run away. Crazy folks.</p>
              <p>So yes, if a married woman call you so many times, its damn abnormal especially when she is a conservative idiot asian woman.</p>

              <p>Dude, I think the problem u face is not due to idiotic Asian women.</p>
              <p>You may want to consider using products made of Potassium Alum, or commonly known as TAwas in Asia. Please follow the instructions  properly.</p>
              <p>I think u have body odor that makes women not want to sit next to you.  Women do hav better sense of smell compared to men.</p>
              <p>In S.e Asia the weather is hot and humid, your body odor is much worst. </p>
              <p>Given Asian men lack of proper oral hygiene, your mouth probably stinks too. </p>

              <p>by asian are you refering to women in myanmar?</p>
              <p>because I'm apparently always seated next to a female. and with the ratio of females so much higher there's hardly any chance you'll be seated next to a guy.</p>
