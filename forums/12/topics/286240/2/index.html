And this is the cruel reality (and not because she is materialistic, materialistic means she wants to buy those designer clothes, asked you to pay for the meals all the time, etc), in order to get security and have a future, certain amount of money must be there in the bank at the end of the day.<br><br>She is urging you to work because she doesn't want to be stuck with someone who will rely on her for financial support the rest of her life.<br></div></blockquote>Do u know what are u taking abt? This guy is still studying. He is still in poly. I bet he has not gone thru NS yet. If she sp badly need the security u mention. Might as well she get a 25-30 yrs old guy who has a career and enough financial abilities.<br><br>Looks like a 18-20 yrs old guy who wanted to fully concentrated on his studies and dependant on parent's financially is on fault or wrong?? If she is not comfortable with TS of his present status. She shall consider this r/s in the first place....<br><br>It is absolutely understandable from a understanding gal of a 18-21yrs old poly guy financial stand. Basically,he is still a student and he is still very young.. Yr expectation cannot be put to that extreme!</div>
