            <div class='col-md body'>no no, she doesnt need me to pay, but she urges me to work and be independent. i think it is because she feels she has the ability to, why not me? besides, she keeps saying in the girl in the relationship in the past <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

The thing she shall do for u is be understanding. The number one priority is yr studies and her studies. If u think u can jiggle work and study then u go for part time work. She shall be understanding enough that u are a status of student. Money might be a constraint. She shall not add financial burden to u. She shall be caring and prioritise yr study. She wants u to be independent is good but everybody has different learning pace. She shall not force u to work and study at the same time if u feel uncomfortable. She can do it doesn't mean u must definitely do it same as her? As I say yr number one priority is study. She shall undestand that too....<br><br>I know u try to be  a good bf. But there is a limit of what u can be, she needs to be understanding enough of yr situation. No matter how good she is in yr eyes,if she lacks understanding. Yr r/s will be a one side affair!</div>
