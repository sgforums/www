            <div class='col-md body'>Dear xxSuexx<br>It seems that your bf doesn't want to settle down yet. And trust me game addicts care little as i used to be one. Maybe the two of you should sit down and TALK not thrash things out, after all both of you are soon to be parents. Ask him to cut down on gaming for you and the baby's sake. Is he working? If he's not then both of you might run into financial difficulty when the baby is born.<br><br>About the part where he's seeing another gal, if you don't trust him why have a baby in the first place? You both are soon to be parents, there should be mutual trust between the two, this is the period where both of you should be there for each other.<br><br>On a brighter note though, maybe having a baby might change him for the better and make him more mature?<br>Or even better if all these might be you having natal blues.<br><br>Anyway, congrats on having a baby. you're going to be a mummy   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Don</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh mine.. tis is bad..<br><br>I feel tat when a gal is pregnant.. She is undergoing tremendous stress, happiness, etc.. tHe hormones level is higher than normal.. Thus.. gAls tend to be more sensitive &amp; touchy abt every little thing..<br><br>Both of you R still very young.. Are you ready to be tied down? Having a child is no mean feat! It involves alot of money.. Love and patience..<br><br>@ 1st i tot that mayb he is ready to be a father yet.. But as i read on.. I realise tat he already has a 1yr old child!<br><br>The most impt thing is to have a gd talk with him.. Ask him abt both of ur future.. Is he goin to marry you, tak responsibility for the child? Where are you goin stay, etc.. Who's goin look after the child.. Is he able to support you?<br><br>If he is serious abt you, he shld be planning for your future and not onli keep playin games..<br><br>You mention tat  you love him alot alot.. But could it because you are having his child to make you feel tis way?<br><br>Touch your heart.. Is he the man that you always dream to marry? Someone you know u can depend on?<br><br>Are you prepared for the fact that if he choose to dump you? No matter wat, gals are always on the losing end..<br><br>Mayb it's too far to think.. But shouldn you consider.. say.. If he reali choose not to bother.. Wat were you do? How will u support your self? Are you prepared to raise up ur child or give the child up for adoption.. eTc.. Open your options up.. And have a plan to fall back on so u wouldn be hurt..<br><br>I'm not a gd advisor.. But if u need someone to talk to.. P.M mi ya..</div>
