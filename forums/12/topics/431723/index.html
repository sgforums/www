              <p>I've been going out with this girl (F) and she likes me too, so anyways on the day she decided to to be my gf was also the day my NS buddy was to celebrate his birthday at butterfactory.<br><br>I send (F) home and then met up with my fren (A) inside Butterfactory. Everything was going fine, everyone was partying and drinking until (A)'s younger sister (K) came and made out with me on the dance floor. I guess we were both drunk but then she took away my phone and went to the ladies toilet and started alling up somebody on my phone. Turns out that she called (F) to tell her that she is with me and having fun.<br><br>I snatched the phone back from (F) and talk to (F) but I think she got really pissed and cut the conversation. So angrily ask (K) why she's doing this, and she said that she already like me and doesn't want anyone else to have me. I got confused and ask her her how she know about my gf, and then (K) explained that her brother (A) had told her about my relatioship with (F) and that she (K) had secretly known me for quite some time.<br><br>She revealed that she was the secret phone pal who message me doing my days in NS, and that her brother (A) her given her my number.<br><br>I was shock. I recall that during those lonly days in camp, this secret phone pal (K) would chat with me during my duty and that our convesations were always fun and cheeky.<br><br>So now, I have a problem. (K) said she will try everything in her hands to stop (F) from getting back to me, and that (K) want's to be a clubbing girlfriend to me. SO how? Should I try and patch back with (F) or just forget everyhtin and just have fun with (K)?</p>

              <p>Hullo everyone. Thanks for the replies.</p>
              <p>Anyways, I talk to (F) yesterday and she ask me to go fly kite. I told her I got no excuse and I deserve to get scolded. Then she said that she was going out with her friends to party to venge her anger on me. Ofcos I sad loh, so last night I go and look for her at Wine Bar and see if I can calm her down.<br><br>She was with a few friends, and one of them was her ex-boyfriend. I know this ex-boyfriend's bad history becos (F) use to tell me how much she dispise him for cheating on her. Ofcos I knew (F) want to make me jealous.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I just be myself there and try to be friendly but I think she give me cold shoulder the whole night. So I just drink on my own. Then one of her (F)'s friend (E) come and talk to me, (F) n (E) are close friends, she ask me why I did what I did. I told her that I make a foolish mistake and I'm still young and sometimes I get tempted and do stupid things.<br><br>(E) said that guys will always be guys and that they surely do stupid things first than think of consequences. And I agreed with her. So the whole night (E) talk to me and we started playing drinking games - 5,10.<br><br>So much so that (F) started to come over and play with us, I think she got abit jealousy of (E) and join in the game. Ofcos I was happy that (F) came and play games with me. And then we started talking again. So thanks to (E) for helping out. (E) tried to patch us back by breaking the ice and I thank her for that.<br><br>But the nightmare start all over again. (F)'s ex-boyfriend (R) was still there, and I think he still have sonme feelings for (F) and when he saw (F) move over to me to play games, he follow her like a shadow. Like when (F) went to get drink, (R) will follow her, and when (F) go to the ladies, he also follow her. Sigh ..<br><br>So anyway, (F) also knows that (R) still likes her but doesn't want to do anything about it, I guess her revenge is working out fine for her, on me. Ofcos, I very the sian loh.<br><br>Anyway (F) still stick very close to me the whole night, and I apologise to her about what happen that day, she said that she knows I have a few female friends out there and she doesn't want me to be tied down on her, and that we both just started going steady so it's still very early to be certain about anything.<br><br>I agree with her that we should just take it slow because both of us also have other issues to solve and we should take one step at a time. <br><br>By this time, (R) the ex-boyfriend started to become tipsy and started talking without thinking, start saying that he is the right guy for her and that he can take care of her and all that. (R) (F) and (E) use to always hang out together and I guess I felt odd one out of the group. So both (F) n (E) are use to hearing (R) talk crap.<br><br>Then (R) started to breakdown and cry, and (F) started to comfort him. Bloody hell, (R) is a good actor, I can't beleive he use this cry baby tactic. Ofcos I boiling inside.<br><br>So I went outside to get some fresh air and call my NS buddy (A) to just rant. (A) said he angry for me and want to come down and "settle" for me, I told him he can come to wine bar but not look for trouble, I told him i'm cool with the situation. So anyways, (A) said he come down look for me. I said okay loh.<br><br>When (A) arrived, he also brought his sister (K) along, craps, now big time sh*t.<br><br>Ofcos I angry with (A) for bringing his siter along, but he say his sis die die also want to come along if not she won't let him out of the house. <br><br>So when both brother n sis arrive, I told them to go into Zouk first and wait for me there. Best is not have to 2 girls come face to face in open area if not sure quarrel and so many ppl will see somemore.<br><br>I ask the rest (F) (E) to go into Zouk and then (R) also came along inside. Inside Zouk was very noisy and playing trance, so when everbody inside, (F) saw me talking to (A) n (K) and she ask me who they are, I told her that they are just my own friends.<br><br>Then (K) came and talk to me, ofcos I abit worried, she ask me if that girl (F) was my gf and I said yah, and then (K) said she want to make friends with (F). I ask her what she up to? (K) just said that she want to make friends instead of making enenmy.<br><br>So (K) go and talk to (F). And my heart was pounding like mad. Then somemore (R) the ex was still like glued to (F). Then (K) ask if (R) was boyfriend of (F). Ofcos this bloody (R) say yes lah, but (F) never say anything. Then (K) said that they look like a perfect couple, and this freaking (R) looking like as if he strike lottery.<br><br>I knew what (K) was trying to do, so I go and talk to (K) and ask her to stop the bs. She said I should just be cool about it and that she was commeting and nothing serious.<br><br>Then (K) saw that I talk to her, she also not happy, (F) confront me and ask me why (K) so "friendly" to me.. so I told her that I want to be honest with her and told her that (K) is the one I kiss.<br><br>(F) just flipped out, she went straight to (K) and shouted at her. And both girls started arguing with each other. Madness!<br><br>(R) n (E) then pull (F) away and (A) pull his sister away. (E) told me that I should have brought my friends here, and that it wanlt good to let both girls see each other. So (E) said she bring (F) home and ask me to stay with (A) n (K).<br><br>Then (R) drove (E) n (K) home, it was 1 am already.<br><br>Inside Zouk, (A) say that he treat me drinks and we both drink together with his sister (K). By then, I start to dislike (K) for what she started, and I didn't talk to her much.<br><br>Then I called (F) to see if she reach home safely and she was already at home, but she told me that (R) her ex wanted to give their relationship another try. I got upset about that and I ask (F) if she hated (R) so much she wouldnlt even consider him at all. But she said she not sure and just let nature take it's course.<br><br>I ask her why she still let (R) hang around her, so she told me that although (R) is not boyfriend or lover material, he is husband material. I hear already I damn ^$%#!(^&amp;*(!! pissed. And I cup the phone.<br><br>How can she make decision like this?! Now that I think back, (F) use to always say that girls don't go for looks... <br><br>I mean like, wtf, I'm in NS now, what can I do?? <br><br>So (A) tell me not to be sad, and ask me drink some more. (K) also come and comfort me and tell me that, sometimes girls want everything in the world, and that they tell people looks and money not important but when they face with a choice of their own, their choice will reveal their true intentions, and she (K) tell me that's why she like me for who I am, and she really go for feelings.<br><br>So what the f888K am I suppose to do. Wah lau why so difficult one? <br><br>(F) or (K) ???</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>DRC,<br><br>(F) and (R) broke up becuase (R) cheated on her with someone else. He works in the finance sector and (R) was intern at his working place. After (F) internship was over, (R) see lesser of (F), so I guess he found new girl to play with. (F) told me that (R) always meet alot of clients and sometimes never go back home to sleep. <br><br>I like (F) more than (K), but i think I undestand what (F) wants in her life now, I don't think I can give her a better future, at least for now. I'm very crushed by what she told me until I don't want to go back camp, so take MC. So miserable. Makes me feel Iike I have a "value" attached to me, and not worth a thing.<br><br>I haven't been with (F) for a long time but this incident tells me more of what will be if we are together, we havenlt really spoken about what type of people we like, so I guess this time her response came as a shock to me.<br><br>(K) on the other hand is more open to ideas and talks alot about life and struggle. She's the more free spirited and artistic kind, but tends to go clubbing alot. <br></p></div>

              <p>I guess you answer the question yourself.</p>
              <p>(F) wants someone more stable and you are not the right you for her. Is a case of you are not ready for her expectations. Dragging it will only cos you more pain, is better to let go. I know is hard but different expectations in life will wear both of you down and will cause more rife in your relationship.</p>
              <p>My suggestion for you to give yourself some time to think it over before even accepting anyone.</p>

              <p>DRC,<br><br>I just spoke to (F), and I ask her what she actually mean by husband material, she say woman like to be taken care of. Then I ask her if she had this type of preference then why even consider me?! Since I only doing NS now? She said I still young, after NS still have to go Uni, and then after that can come and look for her. I told her she sounded like she want to break up with me.</p>
              <p>She sad no. She just telling me how she feel. I told her if she want to break up with me, then break up lah, she said she can see us as puppy love bf gf only, but if got major important things to decide, I might not be ready.</p>
              <p>I told her that she very mean to see me this way, that doesn't mean i'm in NS now that I have no future. She said that NS will hold back time and obligation for her and only have tiome on weekends, ask me to go look for (K) instead. She suits me.<br><br>I ask her what she mean by that? She said, (K) looks like the dao er lang tang type, happy go lucky no future, just happy can already.  </p>
              <p>Wtf?! so I am like that meh?! Fk I told her that I very dissapointed in her mindset and that she thinks i'm like the same type as (K). I told (F) that you only look on the outside but never look into the inside of a person.</p>
              <p>I can't believe (F) has this type of agenda.</p>
              <p>The more I think about it the more stupid I feel. If (F) really mean what she say, then I think it's really stupid of her to think that way. fk! Why?!?!<br><br>fk it ..i'm just going to going cheong tonite ..thanks for listening.<br>  </p>
