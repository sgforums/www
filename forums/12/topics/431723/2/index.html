              <p>I've been going out with this girl (F) and she likes me too, so anyways on the day she decided to to be my gf was also the day my NS buddy was to celebrate his birthday at butterfactory.<br><br>I send (F) home and then met up with my fren (A) inside Butterfactory. Everything was going fine, everyone was partying and drinking until (A)'s younger sister (K) came and made out with me on the dance floor. I guess we were both drunk but then she took away my phone and went to the ladies toilet and started alling up somebody on my phone. Turns out that she called (F) to tell her that she is with me and having fun.<br><br>I snatched the phone back from (F) and talk to (F) but I think she got really pissed and cut the conversation. So angrily ask (K) why she's doing this, and she said that she already like me and doesn't want anyone else to have me. I got confused and ask her her how she know about my gf, and then (K) explained that her brother (A) had told her about my relatioship with (F) and that she (K) had secretly known me for quite some time.<br><br>She revealed that she was the secret phone pal who message me doing my days in NS, and that her brother (A) her given her my number.<br><br>I was shock. I recall that during those lonly days in camp, this secret phone pal (K) would chat with me during my duty and that our convesations were always fun and cheeky.<br><br>So now, I have a problem. (K) said she will try everything in her hands to stop (F) from getting back to me, and that (K) want's to be a clubbing girlfriend to me. SO how? Should I try and patch back with (F) or just forget everyhtin and just have fun with (K)?</p>

              <p>To TS</p>
              <p>After seeing your story, I begin to laugh at myself and realise I was even worst then you in the past. I cry, beg and did whatever I could to make my ex stay.</p>
              <p>I ask the same question " why did she rather chose the other guy then me "</p>
              <p>My ex left and I was all alone. I drank, did silly things and blame myself for everything.</p>
              <p>Yet I could not find the answer on the topic. After many years, I change myself to be a better guy. I study hard, finish uni. Got a good job,  mix with gals of different types, trying to understand  the answer to the question.</p>
              <p>Finally I realise the answer is actually very simple. " I could not provide what the gal wants, at the point of time."</p>
              <p>What do I mean?</p>
              <p>I was like you in NS (my salary is much lesser then yours ;p ) . She was working and she got to know other guys. She too said the same things to me. I was too dumb to understand back then. But now i know why.</p>
              <p>I could not provide for her, she wants more. In singapore, we need money for everything, going out, transport .... She wants to get married with a guy who is able to provide for her. I am not ready back then, having only $100+ a month in NS, I could not even feed myself how am I going to feed her?</p>
              <p>Is the same case as (F), how are you going to provide for her? Love does not give you money, sadly only jobs do.</p>
              <p>That is the sad truth in life. My suggestion is to let (F) go no point dragging and holding to someone that does not really love you and is looking for more.</p>
              <p>Yes is painfull to see her with someone else but if you truly love someone is better to see her happy then sad.</p>
