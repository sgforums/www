Since u felt sorry for him, why not be his friend? One reason why he's behaving this way is because he feels lonely.. or insecure..? By being his friend, who knows... you might be the one who is able to turn his life around and make him a better person?<br><br>Think about this. You (in fact everyone) have the potential to make a difference in one's life. You have my fullest support!<br><br>your friend,<br>S.H.I.N.</div>
