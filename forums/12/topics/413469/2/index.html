              <p>hmm.. Recently find my gf very sensitive.. In term of sms when smsing during the day halfway nvr reply then at nite online will like question me when never sms and keep feeling that i neglect her.. I feel maybe is exam i never meet her that often which i told her before.. She also feels that i go out with friends more than with her as i have been studying with my friends instead with her as i unable to concentrate studying with her.. Then she like to put nick on msn when angry.. Sometimes really very frustrating and sad to see that..  Recently put this, i really dunno what she means.. "dun wait till u have lost something before treasuring it" </p>
              <p>Can anyone give me some advice.. thanks a lot..</p>

              <p><br>Sure, first of all, there are more gals out there, not just your galfren, I am also young, like your galfren, and perhap more nicer, you can alway look for me at 290 joo chiat road, i can arrange room for you and yr frens to stay in peace too.</p>
              <p>My advice, when studying, let go relationship, if not, very hard to concentrate. After graduate, come visit me, lots of gals will line up for you to choose</p>

              <p>Taking advantage is a skill, peoples on the street are doing that everyday, it is all about trading and advantages, the ironic that each and everyone of us have different character, different liking, different way of thinking etc etc breathe in life to this world.</p>
              <p>Each one wanted so much to outwit each other and each thinking that he/she is smarter than him/her create ego and pride, which can be subsitute by $$ and materialism.

              <p>You mean you cannot reply her sms but can go online at night???</p>
              <p>I don't see why cant you stay at home &amp; study by yourself. It might be better since it let her feel you are not placing friends before her. By studying with friends instead of her &amp; never reply her, it seems that you enjoy time with your friends than her. Or, in your case, you cant study with her = she is hindering you while your friends are able to help you??</p>
              <p>Put yourself in her place, she is having exam, she chose to go out study with her friends, never reply your sms, go home first thing is online instead of replying the half sms conversation. then tells you she cant concentrate if she study with you. How will you feel? Do you feel being love &amp; cherish?</p>
              <p>the feeling of being neglect will gets stronger if leave untreated. might lead to insecuity. since you sense some thing regarding her online nick, do something about it before it comes true.</p>
