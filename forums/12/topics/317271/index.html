              <p>Minors is equivalent to below 21 years of age. Thus you would be a minor for another 3 years.</p>

              <p>Well, if that is the case, you should have consent from your parents.</p>
              <p>The thing is, you will not be able to enter into any legal binding agreement outside. You may/will still be required to get your parents signature.</p>
              <p>I suggest you ask an agent about the legality due to your age. If you can qualify to sign the  rental agreement as an individual ?</p>

              <p>The first thing i thought of is the money problem because you gotta pay for the house rent and not just food, transport, etc anymore. But since you say (and certain) it's of no problem to you at the moment, so yea, i say you're free to go to be independent, learn and work outside.</p>
              <p>It's actually not a bad thing. A child should go explore the world him/herself and IF i do have one i'll let him/her go at 18. And i dont regard movin out as abandoning your parents (drag too far.... isn't it?)  But one thing is, you GOTTA make sure you have sufficient money to support yourself not just for 1 week, or month, but probably long term.. depends on you.</p>
              <p>18 sounds good and old enough to take care of oneself. But I'm not sure of the legal issues though. You need to hit a specific age to rent. Sorry cant be of much help here regarding the legal issues but could only support your thoughts and i wish you all the best. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"><br></p>
              <p>Is there no other ways besides movin out?  No talk, mate? (I guess your mind is set anyway....)</p>

              <p>TS cited the reason for wanting to move out was because he asked his parents for more space but his parents disagreed Hmm...I wondered his 'space'  meant if his parents were cramping his lifestyle for not allowing him to bring back girls to s.... Cos if that was the real reason then the parents were wise to do so and TS had mistaken his parents good intention. Well, let's hope we don't get to read about underage migrant had sex with underage girls and now being charged in court for 'rape'<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>In any case why not just stay on for another 3 years? Not that it's really long that you are itching to score some girls. Oh wait! You might have been a female! In that case the more reasons for your parents not to give you more space for fear their precious daughter got cheated by some colour wolves or worst got pregnant at such an early age!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>

              <p><br>My EX moved out when she was 17, within 2 months she slept with 5 other guys even participated in threesomes and turned out a slut. Now she works as a social escort once-thrice a week at geylang. Smokes a pack a day and has barely enough money to feed herself. She skips rent sometimes by sleeping with her roommates who cover her rent and packs up their room for them.</p>

              <p>Okay, back to the point.</p>
              <p>Below 21(Age of a minor) you need to have a parent or guardian sign for rental(unless you do it without papers, which can be pretty risky as they can kick you out on accord that you are 'illegally' staying at their place)</p>
              <p>Also, basic rule for rent would be 2 months down payment minimum of 6 months stay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There shouldn't be a problem not living with your parents, if legal issues arise, just state you have family problems, go for counselling sessions and it will dissolve. As long as your reason is justifiable, the law wouldn't hurt you</p>

              <p>thats one reason why singaporeans are pampered in a way. parents should really kick their kids out when they reach this age - i have friends like that, I envy their parents - free at last from their kids. Upon saying that tho' I dun think I bear to kick my child outta the house when she is 18. Perhaps she would be the one who cant wait to get outta my sight.. sigh..... we'll see.</p>

              <p>hello bros,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the first test u need to pass toward independent is to know how to handle human relationship well at home especially with  parent and sibling.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>why dont u go figure out a way to solve your problems with your parent first, if u can solve it then u can think about surviving on your own.</p>
