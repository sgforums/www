            <div class='col-md body'>January 2002-May 2002<br>I got to know this gal a while ago and she piqued my interest.So I tried(still trying) to "get to know her better". Met with some resistance at first,but gradually I thought perseverance was finally about to move mountains.Just when I was experiencing a bit of success after trying really very hard,I found out that she was attached...I was bitterly crushed but Life still went on.I told myself that I'd still keep in contact with her (which I did)while keeping my options open and also seize any window of opportunity that came my way.So I waited...<br><br>31st May 2002<br>When she told me that she had broken up,I thought my breakthrough had finally came...3 hours later,Senegal beat France 1-0...Anything is possible now!!!<br><br>World Cup month<br>I rooted for all the underdogs-Senegal,Turkey,Ireland,South Korea.Why? Because my situation was(still is) pretty much like theirs so I could identify with them.For once,it really seemed that fairy tales can come true...I never felt so uplifted since I watched "The Shawshank Redemption".<br><br>July 2002<br>She told me she is attached again.I didnt expect her to get attached so soon again and the guy she only knew for a few months.Furthermore,she said the present relationship is very stable unlike the previous one.The window of opportunity closed as soon as it opened...<br><br>August 2002<br>I wanted to see her one last time before I go for SEP.She said her boyfriend would not be happy if we meet too often.Often? I meet her once every 2-3 weeks or more...So I am the sacrificial pawn yet again.Anyway I won't be seeing her for a few months till I come back from SEP.I think that would be a good break for me.<br><br>So what am I going to do about this situation? Like the first time-Keep in contact with her while keeping options open and wait for any window of opportunity to open again.<br><br>Any of you guys ever been in this predicament before?<br><br>"Geology is the study of Pressure and Time.That's all it takes,really.Pressure...and Time..."<br>Ellis "Red" Redding(Morgan Freeman) in The Shawshank Redemption<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>firstly about the part letting the other party going out with other people who like him/her.. i think all you need is a little trust and faith. nothing can work out without that 2 components. if you are really so insecure about it, and yet you don't want to sound all possesive, you can go along and join in. why not?<br><br>anyway, as people often say.. maybe it's not meant to be? since her boyfriend may not like it, there's nothing really you can do about it right? or maybe it's just an excuse to hint to you.<br><br>one advice.. get on with your life, you'll meet the girl of your dreams someday.<br><br>believe.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks a lot people for your advice.<br><br>ButI would like to make something clear-that I am not waiting aimlessly,I did make myself clear that I am keeping my options open<br><br>We went out before in the past and had some good times but her new boyfriend has changed the complexion of the situation completely.<br><br>I'll never regret it.<br><br>The sea does not reward those who are too anxious, too greedy, or too impatient. To dig for treasures shows not only impatience and greed, but lack of faith. Patience, patience, patience, is what the sea teaches. Patience and faith. One should lie empty, open, choiceless as a beach - waiting for a gift from the sea.<br><br>Anne Morrow Lindbergh<br><br></div>
