She don't mean to cheat on you.. At least.. she's willing to tell you the truth then hiding it from you.. THink about if she hide it from you all the while.. and jus one very fine day.. where you both are already so in love with each other, and she tells you the truth.. Wouldn't that be more hurting.. and painful..<br><br>Well.. i'm sure the moment she tells you.. she has already prepared for the worst situation.. She knows that you have lost trust in her.. But at this point of time.. she needed you most! What has happened cannot be change.. Right now.. you jus have to face it.. i wouldn't say that everything that is faced can be changed.. but at least don't avoid it! It won't solve any if you are trying to run away..<br><br>Well.. if you still can't accept what has happened.. give both some time to cool down.. In any case or another.. after the cooling period is over.. both should have a talk on this.. whether to continue the relationship or not.. is up to your decision.. she knows that she needed you.. bt she cannot force or push you to have her back if you cant.. but remember don't push the blame on her.. is nobody's fault.. not her not you.. not the ex..<br><br>Maybe this is one of the difficult path that you both have to pick up the challenge and see if you both can fight till the end.. If you really do love her.. You should forgive her.. You love for who she is.. love her good and bad.. positive and negative..<br><br>Sit down and think about it... I'm sure you already have the answers to yourself.. is jus you wanted others to suggest or to see if you should do the right thing anot.. Noone can force you something you don't want to.. If in the end.. it doesn't work out.. then so be it.. Give her and yourself a good explanation.. i'm sure if it really happens this way.. you dun wish to end it so badly..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi i understand ur dilemma... frankly, if i would u, i wld feel so damm miserable too &amp; most likely i would not see her again...<br><br>But this being AA, well, i ought to give some positive comments:<br><br>1st, it's a positive sign that she came clean. i dun know all these shit abt gals being tricked??? It's like if guys do xxx, its called cheating. If gals do it, its cause they are "playful" or "being cheated"..<br>i think it depends very much on what kind of person is she... only u know her best. If this is somethk rely out of character for her, maybe its a geunine mstake.<br><br>2nd, how much do u need her? As in, is ur love for her great enuff for u to forget the past.<br>If u 2 cld get past this hurdle, it may means ur love will be stonger..<br><br>good luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, congratulations on finding the love of your love.<br><br>I see you've met some difficulties along the way, but if you learn to forgive and forget, despite the moral difficulties you encounter.<br><br>As a sidenote, i always believed that Love is the first thing humans learnt. Back in the stone ages, what morality was there? Only when we slowly evolved did things like law and morality come about. Oops, totally sidetracked.<br><br>Since she is deeply remorseful about it, and has told you about it first thing before she did anything, you should be happy. Happy that she trusts you so much, and is so very afraid of losing you.<br><br>But know that the two of you are very insecure now, and you two need to shower each other with a bit more love and care, especially in these next few days, which will prove crucial.<br><br>Help her to break up all ties and contact with her ex-boyfriend, who's only using her.<br><br>Only you can do it, so...<br>Godspeed.</div>
