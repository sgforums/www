The more you think the more confuse you will get. Like you said it's only what you thought it might not be true. How you know that you are not as good as her. Everyone has their strong point. She may be better than you in some way but you will have strong point too. If he really still can't forget about his ex-gf, the more you have to treasure him because this show that he is a very good guy. Different people take varies time to forget their previous relationship. If what you say is true, give him some time. If that's his first gf you have to forgive him. Because i think everyone's FIRST LOVE is the sweetest  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  Even for me if happen that i can still get back together with my first gf(provided not attach), i will treasure her. After saying so much, my conclusion is to treasure your bf because he is a good guy from the way you describe and don't think so much because your thinking might not be true. Jumping to wrong conclusion and thoughts might lead to some unessary quarrel. Last but not least, treasure what you have.

However, when it has reached to a point where he is holding himself back to the past - a past where he knows there is no future though.

Remember, its not asking her to forget, rather its asking him to <strong>move on</strong>. Well, if the talk wasn't effective at all - I suggest giving him some period of time. Tell him, when he has the courage to make a decision and to move on, then tell you. If not, don't bother contacting you at all, because he hasn't sort himself well yet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Just for fun: He is a Taurus, Leo, Scorpio or Aquarius? *Accuracy not guaranteed*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Cheers<br></div>

If you are really worried and this matter keeps on circling around and haunting you always.. Talk to him... This is only what you think..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>What makes you so sure that his ex was his most love?? He told you or is jus a wild guess from yourself?? He got over that previous relationship for 1 year.. be cos he needed time to readjust his own life and move on with it.. and of cos let himself rest for sometime before getting on to another relationship.. And then he found you.. Dont doubt his feelings for you.. You need to trust him.. and have confidence in him..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You think that he listens to sad songs means he's thinking of his ex.. But do you really know?? You think you can read his mind?? Maybe he waas thinking about you all the while.. the happiest moments you guys spend together or the times where you all quarrel real hard..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Don't compare yourself with her ex.. NOone can be exactly or be like another person.. Even twins are different!! Everyone is unique in a way.. You can't make yourself like his ex.. be like his ex.. and try to act like one.. Be yourself.. he likes you for who you are... Not someone who can be like his ex or watever... He loves you, cares for you... You are definitely worthy for him.. This is jus a minor thing in every relation.. You can talk it out with him if you really feels so uncomfortable..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Maybe for his assurance you will feel much better.. And even if he really think of his ex.. it was all past.. Its only the memories that is kept in his head.. and he sometimes jus think it back.. This happens to everyone... These are good memories to be kept.. "Huai Nian" Got nothing to do whether his ex is good or better than you... IF she's really that good.. then why arent they still together now?? Noone is perfect!! God is always fair to us..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>You need to communicate with him.. Tell him about this.. and ask those that has haunting you throughout.. Listen to what he has to say.. Try to more considerate.. Dun hold him too tight till he cant breathe.. Take time slowly.. This isnt any big problem.. Soon when you have all those unsolved questions that have been answered.. move on and lead your life..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Try not to think of such things again.. Well i know sometimes you cant help it.. but try not to worry on silly stuffs.. It will make the relation worse if you always have those kind of feelings in yourself.. ANd your confidenct level will drop slowly.. Keep your mind clear.. Keep yourself occupied so that you would think of it anymore..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
