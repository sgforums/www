            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Caleb,<br><br>I didn't see anywhere in her post that mentions her being attracted to some other guy.  This is more an issue about the bf having a gambling problem, which, although doesn't seem serious to those of us lucky enough to have avoided the experience, can escalate into an addiction.<br><br>I'd read true stories about people so addicted to gambling, they dug into their children's bank accounts to fund their addiction.  Some even got into trouble for stealing company funds.<br><br>Her concern is very real, &amp; from what she says, the bf seems to have emotional issues.  Lying to her about kicking his gambling habit (at least I hope it's still a habit), threatening to kill her &amp; making a din at her house, etc.  It's emotional blackmail, emotional threatening.<br><br>I can see why she wants to leave him...<br><br>This is a case whereby a woman has to take care of her own interests 1st, because her bf seems too self-absorbed to care about her well-being.  It's Not as if she's dumping him to go off with a guy with better "prospects".<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by caleb_chiang:</div><div class="quote_body">Why I always hear the same thing about a girl breaking up with a guy stuck in the army???

Pretty normal case, and I'd bet you are much much more younger than this... man-in-green. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>And this man-in-green is so stuck cos he's now stuck in a mud with only guys... most probably cos the way he reacts you report here is telling.<br><br>Normally NS only last so long, and if you ain't seeing nobody for now, me advise is during a weekend out, ask your boy to take you to his parents. Don't make any fuss at his place, and if his parents' not in, don't stay. Stop anymore intimate moments.<br><br>If he refuses, then you use that as big excuse that after months, you're still hiding, and he's not sincere, and he's just toying with you and bla bla bla. No matter how much he claimed to have done for you means nothing if he cannot bring you to his parents. And of course, a guy who cannot even be courageous enough to bring you to the parents probably would think twice cutting himself.<br><br>If you really do see them, or seen them oredi, approach them one day when your boy boy is in camp, and take time to seek their help. But should you do so, you must not be persuaded by the parents to stay with your boy boy. It's a final strike.<br><br>If you can wait, then let him finish NS and when he got chance to see other girls, you'd be free... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Let their parents do the middle-men's job.<br><br>I advise you to save up some monies and go Genting for a couple of days' stay. Even if he wanna jump, his parents and platoon sergents will be responsible, not you liao...<br><br>And... next time, don't just take any boy boy just because you thought you'd like him... It's like spending $100,000 signing the rental contract, doing renovations and spend more monies to buy goods and such... because you <span style="font-style: italic;">thought</span> got shop must mean go business...<br><br>If anything happens that he threatens you again, you mentioned you got a buddy... I no know <span style="font-style: italic;">how buddy is this buddy</span>... But don't be stupid to approach the buddy. No one in the right mind will borrow anyone monies for toto or 4D... drop me a note at me site, I'd try see if I can perhaps refer some counsellors or you should just call the police, quietly.<br><br>Police makes report... but they ain't definitely gonna be your bodyguards <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ... So... If all cannot, do you know you can approach his camp? Actually one motive of NS is to educate the youths... which sadly speaking, such is quite messed up nowadays. There are counselling centers at CMPBs for this purpose and the lieutenants of his platoon are supposed to <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">care</span></strong> for them...<br><br>See? So many things you can do... why scare?</div>

Ã­ told him i'll do anything to leave him..<br><br>pls.. pple... can someone give me some advices? how can i leave him?</div></blockquote>I think you should be more worried about yourself than your buddy B's debt?<br><br>For all you've mentioned's sake, just LEAVE HIM...<br><br>1. You can file a police report against him and you SHOULD. Just a matter of 'protecting' yourself? Don't think it's to the extent of needing a protection order yet? Not sure as you're the one in the situation, you should be more certain...?<br><br>2. No matter what, he's emotionally unstable.. Be caution on your moves and stay alert if he is to appear...?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, y not see from the bf's point of view. i agree on feowfeow's reply that the bf may have compulsive gambling habits, which may be threathening to the relationship in long term.<br><br>but the excuse that you "thought" that you will like him in the future is totally ridiculous. the first 3 months of relationships are always the honeymoon period, therefore, i am not surprised you said that ur bf has changed after the inital stage of courtship. do you know about his gambling habits prior to accepting him? you said he promised you to change, how much have you helped him with that?<br><br>your bf is in NS, and my guess would be he's probably between 19-21, and you should be about 18-20. at this age, shouldn't relationships be abit serious, and not puppy love like, i "thought he will be the right one for me".<br>what if he was serious about it? then aren't you taking him for a spin?<br><br>i too have friends who choosen to break off with their bf when they are in NS, similarly, they quoted lots and lots of excuses to justify their actions.<br><br>judging from the replies you gave, you have already made up your mind, what you need is not advice but someone to support your decision. good luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This kind of guy can get pretty distressed in a situation like this. Since he hides his gambling from you n is found out by his 'traitorous friend' he he..ahem.. well, he may get desperate and MAY continue to threaten you. Now you only have a few options.. coz he is either gonna come out of the Army pissed and out for some blood... or he is gonna do the weepy in your face.. heart wrenching .. ' i cant live without u.. n i am going to kill myself' scenario. Either way..its just not looking good for you. Obviously all verbal communications in sorting ur r/s has failed.. time to go to the most obvious plan. Rally your friends...  coz no way u can go 1 on 1 with him n walk out of there alive. Contigency planning means hook up with as many friends as u can..at least he gotta slash through the mob to get to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  Oh...n if he comes n tell you parents..or kacau your parents.. u can do the same to him. Just tell his parents he did unspeakable stuffs to you. He wanna play with fire..u make sure he gets BURNED.. besides.. i hella dun like guys like that. Its losers like him that makes us males look bad.. desperate and pussy ass...<br><br>but hey..everyone makes mistakes.. maybe he just needs more motherly love and understanding.. that pooor...thing...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

Even if he does threaten u face to face, u can always call 999 de. Police shall transfer him to IMH de. So dont worry. If u are going out, please make sure u bring ur hp along. Make 999 ur speed dial. Bring along a pen knife oso. Self defence. If possible, u should make sure tat theres someone accompanying you.<br><br>of course, u should speak to ur parents n clsoe frens about this situation too.
