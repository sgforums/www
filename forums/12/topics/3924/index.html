            <div class='col-md body'>Dear friends,<br><br>About a month ago, I have met this guy from the IRC and got into a relationship with him.<br><br>One day, he asked me to go to bed with him but I refused.  From then on, he never stopped asking for that and I finally gave in to him.<br><br>We have done it three times since. Throughout the whole time, he seemed very nice and romantic towards me.<br><br>He is a sec 3 guy from Victoria Secondary School.  He's 15, a year younger than me.<br>I loved him and trusted him with all my heart.  I felt really safe and protected when I was with him.<br><br>It was until towards the end of May when I had a strong feeling that something was terribly wrong...<br><br>With dread, I dialed his handphone number.  It was an engaged tone!!!  However, his home number was still accessible.<br><br>I am still able to recall my last date and last two phone conversations with him.<br><br>My last date was at his house.  I had sex with him then and it was the last time I ever saw him.  That day, he was behaving rather wierdly and was unusually quiet.  From then on, he never called.<br><br>On the 26th of May, I called his handphone(that was the second last call I  had with him) and he told me that he was grounded by his parents for doing something I don't know.<br><br>He told me that when he got ungrounded, he would see his friends first before me.  I thought that that sounded a little funny but I didn't ask him why.<br><br>On the 27th, I called him again.  He said,<br>"I'm no free now, I'm helping my uncle with the computer."<br><br>I said bye and put down the phone.<br><br>I was on the 29th of the same month(if I had remembered correctly) that I realised that he has either changed or cut off his handphone line.<br><br>In the Singapore law, those of age 16 and above is at the losing end if it becomes a police case.<br><br>He is 15 and I am 16.  I can be charged for having sex with and underage guy.  Luckily, I did not get pregnant and am very thankful for it.<br><br>Until now, no one in my family knows about this.  I need someone to talk to urgently so please e-mail me at &lt;buggie_84@yahoo.com&gt; as soon as possible.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>Yours faithfully,<br>Desiree<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You r rite not giving in to him the 1st time, but why did your heart soften as time goes by. No matter how deep you love him, u shouldn't have done that.<br>If he really loves you, he won't mention it again definitely. Think carefully, a relationship based mainly on sex won't b a true one, agreed?<br>I know u r rather depressed rite now, hope I'm not adding to your agony. My advice is forget abt the whole thing though I know it's not easy. You should also concentrate fully on your studies now.<br>By now, you should b extra careful in getting into a relationship, okie?<br>If u still need someone to talk to, can email or ICQ me, ok?</div>
