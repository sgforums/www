            <div class='col-md body'>I think first love is something very special, as the word 'first' say it already. Since it is your first love dun forget it, enjoy it, savour it.  Although after your breakup, anybody will be devastated, it will be like the end of the world, as the saying goes life do have to go on.  In scientific term love is nothing but a bunch of chemical reaction in your brain. Which most people tend to like these kind of chemical reaction.  I been through it before, I too took a long time to get over it.  When it is over just treat it as a dream, a beautiful dream.  Once you are awake it will be over.<br><br>May god bless you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I could never forget my first love, even when I was attached to my second gf I was still thinking about the former. She showed me how being loved felt and I wouldn't have exchanged it for the world. But when I met my current girlfriend, all that has changed. She (though I never thought possible) showed me more concerned than anyone ever had, and I knew that I was the most important person in her life. Gradually the pains of missing my first girl started to fade. I guess it takes a whole lot more in order to forget one's first love, and my Dove had managed to do just that. I still keep my feelings for my first love, but those shall remain as memories, as a lesson which I have learnt, so that I can treat my girlfriend better.<br><br>Dove, if you are reading this, I want to let you know that I'd Love You Forever, And Like No Other.<br><br>------------------<br>The gentle dove takes its maiden flight, as Darkwoof re-emerge into the light 23/05/2000</div>
