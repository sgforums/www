All my other gf's I could not find anywhere in my heart to find that speacial feeling I had for her. Its like its been lost.Even though she broke off with her then bf because he ran off with another girl,she still would not give me a chance.Irony rite? She ran off with some1 and yet that some1 ran off with another person as well.<br>I really wish to be with her.But 2mths ago she said that she does not want anything to do with me anymore.That hit me really really hard.But what can I do?<br>I even had a year and a half in Australia to stop my feelings for her.Its not working even as the minute I am typing this.I really wonder how long isit going to take.I hope its not to long cause I really hate this feeling and i wish to get on with my life.<br>The only thing i am better off with you guys is that i had no choice to see her cause I know if I am in Spore I would have grapped every chance i had just to grap a glimpse of her.Don't worry I won't stalk her.I am NOT A STALKER.But you know its just a feeling or just to make sure she is fine and getting on with life....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I got dumped by my first love, who couldn't get over his first crush....<br>Anyway, it took 3 mths to get over him. During those 3 mths it was really painful and lonely, but thankfully i had great friends who were by my side when i needed them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Anyway, I knew that I still loved and cared for him deeply, and the more i talked to him, the harder it was for me to get over the relationship. So in the end I told him that I couldn't talk to him anymore as it hurts me.<br>2mths later, i found out that he was going out with my irc mei mei. I was actually happy for em.. surprisingly, but hai.. now she wants to break off wif him cos she feels as if she's being controlled.. oh well..<br>can u belive he told me b4 that he felt controlled in our relationship?? hrm... oh well.<br><br><img src="http://www.animfactory.com/animgifs/creatures/animals3/dog/dogshearts_sm_clr.gif"><br><br>[This message has been edited by peiyi (edited 18 April 2000).]</div>
