              <p>I mean your friends and you may share the same thinking in terms of culture but all have different family backgrounds. If you apply this to your traditional parents, it's gonna cause u a lot of hardships. We can't choose our parents leh.....and how many have a property from their parents at this age? That's one big blessing u alrdy can count :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also have a problem with this rat race kiasu mentality in singapore. I do not see my long term future here too. Actually nowadays, with budget airlines and the skies opening up, you can actually fly back to singapore more often than ur parents think u can.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's hard to keep a free spirit and ur soul is akin to a bird stuck in a a cage, waiting eagerly to fly out and spread its wings. Maybe you like to strike an agreement with ur pa and tell him how often u will come back. After all, no parents would want the child to be unhappy even if he's by their side.</p>

              <p>I recommend that you take care of your family.</p>
              <p>Taking care of your family means many things, but in my opinion, mainly and chiefly, that entails keeping in contact with them, having a relationship with them, and helping them financially if need be.</p>
              <p>First I want to let you know something.</p>
              <p>I think you need to consider not only "me me me." This "me mentality" needs to be changed to a more gracious and appropriate mentality, and I do think you are capable of doing that.</p>
              <p>Please consider your family, and what you can do for them.</p>
              <p>Dont just think about "me" , how to fulfill "my" ambitions, "my" desires, etc.</p>
              <p>In my humble opinion, if you can do something for your family, that should take precedence and be at a higher priority level for you, and when can be, you should do a little self-sacrifice.</p>
              <p>That is just my own personal opinion, and an advise from one son / person to another son / person.</p>
              <p>I am also of the opinion that if you can do something / fulfill some role that helps your family, that is actually a bigger accomplishment and a bigger achievement, and more meaningful in life.</p>
              <p>I also regret to hear that your elder bro is only visiting your parents once every 2 years. This is quite infrequent. I think this is rather unhealthy. If this continues, it will take not long before your brother drift away more and more....and suddenly there is a gap.</p>
              <p>Nowadays in the age of budget travel, air ticket is not so expensive, I think you should talk to your bro and remind him to increase the travel frequency. If possible you guys should also visit him periodically.</p>
              <p>Of course, if you are really convinced that Australia suits you better, that is still possible, but it's just that you need to be able to keep in touch with your family more intensely and dont be like your bro who seem to forget about them.</p>
              <p>If it's possible, you might want to reunite your parents/ bring them over to Aussie, or at least try to make them elligable for some kind of easier access, more reunion chances, more contacts, actually that is the important thing, not the place. The place can be anywhere but the family relationship is the key.</p>
              <p>Please think about what I say.</p>

              <p>Hi Alpha, i was forced back by dad too but i'm supposed to go there for studying though and i have plans to stay there for good after experiencing their lifestyles and asking the school of their plans for me.</p>
              <p>I would say it's up to you if you can leave comfortably knowing no one else is taking care of parents, there's nothing else to stop you any further. I'm always with dad as he's a retiree, the people in market told me that they wouldn't have the patience, some even thought i'm his mistress LOL</p>
              <p>but since you've made the first step to come back by their requests, i think... i think... i think you have to live with this plan that your dad 'desperately' made, a choice that you just have to accept.</p>
              <p>life sometimes isn't fair but there's an instructor who once told me life will be fair if our hands were of the same length lol</p>
              <p>bad luck for you and me though you have better luck ;) </p>

              <p>Good question. Mostly because my parents did not approve of me
                          working over there. My mum absolute hates Australia. She was
                          brought up in the traditional chinese family type. Even though i
                          did my college, university, and some work over there.</p>
              <p> My dad keeps saying that if i am really so capable, that i
                          should get a job that will post me overseas in the future, like
                          some sort of big MNC.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, they do not want to end up with a situation where
                          both sons migrate to Australia forever and not come back to
                          Singapore. Especially if my sister marries and has to move out of
                          the family.</p>
              <p>With regards to the relationship problem. Its not about settling
                          down. Because they just want me to at least get a girlfriend.
                          Marriage is secondary and they don't really care when i get
                          married.</p>
              <p>Although i would say i am very fortunate in life, but material
                          possessions do not make me happy. I prefer the quiet lifestyle
                          compared to the big city mentality that exists in Singapore.
                          (actually spent 3 years in Perth, one of the quietest cities in the
                          world) All i wish for is to settle down, and to actually work to
                          live and not live to work like most singaporeans.</p>

              <p>Your parents are both alive and healthy, Yes ? They don't need you to take care of them. In fact, you need them to take care of you.</p>
              <p>There is/are something else you are not telling us.</p>
              <p>Are you the responsible kind ? Are you able to stand on your own ?</p>
              <p>Are you accountable for your own action or do you make your parents bail you out whenever you get in trouble ?</p>
              <p>Your parents had no problem with your brother migrating to Australia, but they make you come back. What does that say about you ?</p>
              <p>You complain about your parents holding you back, but really who is stopping you ? Yourself.</p>

              <p>It is unfortunate your parents are bigots. If only your parents had not been so hard headed, there woulda be more happiness instead of strifes  and sorrow within your family.</p>
