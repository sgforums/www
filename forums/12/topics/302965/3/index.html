Nowadays child are just so stubborn and its hard to let them bear in mind of wat we warn them. Dun blame me, i just read the facts. Facts tell everything, not sure if nowadays the method of teaching the child to behave has become more verbal<br><br>if i have a daughter, and her bf slap her for something she did terrible, that is ok for me, dont u wish your daughter to get some1 who knows that your daughter is doing very bad things and he take initiative to make her realised what she did was wrong?<br><br>if for lame excuse and her bf slap her for stupid reason, i myself will kill him lol.<br><br>Like i said everything has the limit, just need to see how much.</div></blockquote>TS is not her father.<br><br>So you will let your daughter's bf slap her ?<br>What may seem punishable to her bf, may not be the same for you.<br><br>You as the father should be protecting your daughter, not let another man violate her body.<br><br>Physical punishment only serves to intimidate, you cannot make a person reasonable with violence.<br></div>

The situation is not  a direct threat to your life . And she is not some enemy combatant. If i were to accidently tap ur shoulders from behind, will u suddenly turn around.. bring me down on my knees , do a sleeper hold and break my neck ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  Have to control a bit , u not in hostile environment , ur training wouldve taught u to be more disciplined, and civilians got no chance against u in hand 2 hand combat . Not to mention a girl... =S .<br><br>But since its over , then so be it. What to do , obviously she was taken back suddenly and to most women , its something they wont let off so easily. hurting them emotionally is as bad , physically will be AS bad or even worse. But i gotta admit , the heels.. it hurts man. I got it once,  even with shoes it  @ss hurts like hell.<br><br>but yeah.. maybe u should try to be a little bit more careful , later ur 'defence mechanism' pushes her off the stairs u end up breaking her neck.</div>
