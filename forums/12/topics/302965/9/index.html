Or if you would just return her her bag, and let her go back herself as she had wished, the story would have ended there too.<br><br>The key point is, both are equally willful and explosive.<br><br>Thing is, regardless who is right and who is wrong, such characters are highly incompatible.  Things might just snowball one day that might lead you to killing each other before you know it.<br><br>If you ask me, i think it is a blessing in disguise that you broke up.  Learn from your mistakes.  Understand the girl whom you are with.  If you choose such a wilfull gal, then let her go home herself.  Learn how to 'brake'.  That will save you lotsa problems and heartaches.  If you cant handle that, choose a more even-tempered gal, they are more suitable for you.<br><br>I still maintain, regardless what happen, a man laying his hands on a gal is itself already wrong.<br><br></div>

Or if you would just return her her bag, and let her go back herself as she had wished, the story would have ended there too.<br><br>The key point is, both are equally willful and explosive.<br><br>Thing is, regardless who is right and who is wrong, such characters are highly incompatible.  Things might just snowball one day that might lead you to killing each other before you know it.<br><br>If you ask me, i think it is a blessing in disguise that you broke up.  Learn from your mistakes.  Understand the girl whom you are with.  If you choose such a wilfull gal, then let her go home herself.  Learn how to 'brake'.  That will save you lotsa problems and heartaches.  If you cant handle that, choose a more even-tempered gal, they are more suitable for you.<br><br>I still maintain, regardless what happen, a man laying his hands on a gal is itself already wrong.<br><br></div></blockquote>To a certain extend i agree that we are very different. and there are conflict in our personality.</div>
