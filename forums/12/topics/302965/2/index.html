I gave in , try to reason and explain. Of course i gave it another few months just to give her a chance and hopefully able to see things through , however it proved that she is highly unstable. The last straw was when she threw a fit at an important dinner. Which of course i felt a real loss of face.

All i can say she was very unreasonable , and only after no longer together that she regret , but its too late.
