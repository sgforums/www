( not puppy love /teeny love)<br>I thought I'd see him improve.<br>I keep blaming myself for not being a good gf when he constantly complains about how lousy I am.<br><br>I go to work with bruises and scrapes on my skin.<br>But I lied to all my friends and co-workers that I am just a klutzy person and falls and bumps into things.<br>Nobody believed me, but I continued to lie out of embarrassment.<br><br>It finally ended, when I refused to come downstairs to meet him on a weekend.<br>He calls me up and tells me he will set fire to my house.<br><br>That's when I woke up. And I started to fight back.<br>But I dared not go to the police, because he says he knows most of the officers there.<br><br>Everything ended when I finally admit to my grandparents and my brother.<br>They helped me leave him . Painful memories.<br><br>But, if you see him on the street, you'd never have guessed he's an abusive person.<br>He looks very decent and seems like a good guy to everyone.<br>But, like what everyone tells you, looks is very deceiving.<br><br></div></blockquote>How long has it been for you?<br><br>For my ex, she also had met a terrible guy when she was young.<br>Who knows her intention of helping or sympathise him.<br>Cos her to lose her freedom as well.<br>He will go to her house and threaten her that he will let her dad knows she bring him back.<br>Steal her money and items in her house.<br>Deny all facts.<br>Also tried to control her by installing fear.<br>Cheated her virginity by pinning her in a public toilet and ask her not to yell as there are ppl outside.<br>Got her pragnent as well. She took a long time to shake her off.<br>It was a terrible 3 years time.<br><br></div>

Many things which had not been settled which strain your present relation<br>3)Not willing to listen, conpromise or understand in either party.<br>4)Perhaps either party is not ready for a relationship. eg mental, financial etc<br>5)wildful for either party maybe.<br><br>I think guys and girls speak different language, but i hope that my partner will not take things personal, and would advise and sit down and talk sense to me should i did anything wrong. Perhaps one is saying and one is not listening, after a long period, without knowing that both party have reached the limit, things just falls apart without warning.<br><br>But of cos, if he threatens, then he is at fault unless he can provide a valid reason for his actions.<br><br>Well, ppl inevitably will take things for granted, but should we risk of losing what we had, then we have to fight for it in a diplomatic way. Personally, i just tried to put in extra effort to woo her back with explainations and apologies. But after a while, i will go back to my old habits, "turn off here and there". Perhaps She is not the one for me? or am i not ready yet?<br><br>But of cos, although not very motivated to put my best foot forward, she is still important to me. Well, ppl only feel the pinch when they are about to lose what they had. Sad to say.</div>
