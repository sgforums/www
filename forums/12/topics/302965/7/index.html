Only by then, u can feel your truly appreciated and the feeling for The One is somewhat different from what u have for the previous 6 r/s.<br><br>I guess your ex doesnt really know how to communite much with u and for the previous bad exp of hers, perhaps she kept quiet on certain things to avoid the same thing happened again.<br><br>but really, u should feel glad as u are now single.
