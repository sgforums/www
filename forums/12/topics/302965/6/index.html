            <div class='col-md body'>Originally posted by jojobeach:<br><br>Why do you insist she has to learn from you?<br>&gt; Both of us have temper. At me, at least listen and talk things out.<br>Are you really so knowledgeable ?<br>&gt; I believe We learn from each another<br>Don't you, yourself have a lot to learn about relationship too ?<br>&gt; I had my retribution. I had always want to talk things out no matter what arguement exist. But this time round, someone else came along and she thinks she deserves someone better. Dun really have a chance to say my part.<br>She refused to listen.<br><br>She is the first girl you fought with, as in she is your first "serious" girlfriend ?<br>&gt; I had about 5 serious relationship. This is the only one i fought with. I asked why, had i become agressive or is this woman really too hot to handle. i guess like what Yunhaier had mentioned, there are many factors which took place, eg. personality, character, mindset, esteem, confidence, perception, emotional state, sexual needs, material possession, etc. Perhaps it is not the right time for love between us to blossom. I had tried hard. To me conflicts are part of learning towards us. Forget and forgive in whatever things that happen. But i guess i still lost fighting against all odds. There is a lmit for everyone. Misunderstanding, the unwillingness to talk and opportunity cost came along, everything happens like the mercyless tides of tsunami. And all is lost.<br><br>If not, how many relationships have you been through before ?<br><br>And if she is the first girlfriend.<br>Then my question will be.. how you do usually go about dealing with conflict ?<br>&gt; Noone likes arguement or fights. But if it is for the greater good for both to understand. Why not?<br>Or issues that your girlfriend is not happy about ?<br>&gt; Many things which had been done wrongly.What isn't said doesn't meant it dun exist. Everything only spur out at the end of the story. Which becomes blames and hatrated.<br><br>1. Do you shrug it off and sweep them under the carpet ?<br>2. Do  you just keep quiet , hoping it will go away ?<br>3. Do you sleep on it, and deal with it the next day ?<br>4. Do you slug it out with her the moment she raise the issue ?<br><br>During an argument, do you validate her feelings or do you try to shut her up with your reasonings ?<br><br>I've got a feeling you have let problems snowballed for too long.<br>&gt; Agree. Perhaps she cared about my feelings and din't talk about them.<br>Or maybe to the extend, i am a grown up. hence, she dun needa nag and remind me like my mom.<br><br></div>
