            <div class='col-md body'>I'll admit i flicked through this quickly but a few points brought up i'd like to comment on...<br><br>1) 'programming' or 'controlling your woman'... has anyone seen the Stepford Wives? now i dunno about you but that sounds like hell to me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> imo love her as she is or leave her cos you don't love her, you love who you want her to be and that ain't the same thing.<br><br>2) abuse <span style="font-style: italic;">can</span> be a two way thing or just the woman being violent and i'm willing to bet it's more prevelant than any statistics'll say because of male pride... i'm not sayin that's the situation here but there's also a long running insinuation in this thread that it's the fact it's a woman that makes it wrong... as if a woman beating the shit out of her husband/bf would be any better... there's some beefy girls in this world that'd kick most of our arses lol<br><br>as: <blockquote>Hitting a girl = wrong.<br>Hitting a guy = wrong.<br>Hitting a someone = wrong.<br>Hitting a pet = wrong.<br><br>Domestic violence = wrong and against the law.<br>Animal cruelty = wrong and against the law.</blockquote>(well i say that knowing full well there's many occasions i'd get in a fight... but not with someone i love)<br><br>and on the original message... i try my best never to fight in any way with my fiancee, and i can't think of a single time we have fought, but the last thing I could ever do is physically hurt her - i don't think i could live with myself if i did. and i don't think that's just me... if you really love someone your first instinct has to be protecting them - and yes i can back that up. the only other species to demonstrate the love emotion is dogs, and in the breeds that have shown it strongest many have been known to risk death to save their owner but very rarely, if ever hurt them (without some history of abuse).<br>maybe not everyone will never verbally fight with their partner but is it really love if you can physically hurt them? and if she's willing to hurt you does she really love you?<br>just wanting someone to love you and wanting to love them and even them wanting to love you too doesn't make it love... if it's not there it's not there and who wants to be in that? i think both ts and partner need to seriously think about where that relationship's going...<br>my two cents.<br><br>i guess there's always the argument for conditioning that if a childs brought up in a violent home then they'll see love and violence go hand in hand and go on to abuse... but i don't think that's really the point.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have absolutely no idea where you got the idea that fighting is an act of passion, especially towards yr girl. no matter how fiery her temper is, i see no reason why violent physical contact must be resorted, there's bound to be other ways out.</div>
