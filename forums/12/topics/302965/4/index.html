U can talk about that here . I dont mind about the charter protecting them from violence , unequal pay based on gender and all that stuff. Its issues like must have 50% female presence in senior management , and others that is a worrying trend. Why is there no 50% male  in senior management ?

Pampering too much and be too protective can also lead the child become used to it and become wild due to overprotection from their parents.

            <div class='col-md body'>so i read and wanna conclude. COrrect me if im wrong TS.<br><br>TS Agony:<br><br>1) Frustated by how her gal behave: not understanding and supportive<br><br>2) Confused why gal and guy treated differently based on social belief<br><br>3) Pissed off and over-limit when his gal didnt try to understand why he already tried to control his anger by saying verbally 1st. ONce over limit, he exploded and try to make her realise by physical action but never beat her up or bang her in the wall or do anything nastier. But the gals seems to threaten TS to destroy this and that which for TS is valuable thing to just destroy it like that.<br><br>4) TS still let himself got punished by the gal after he pushed the gal and even still have conscious of why he did it on the 1st place and he stop doing nastier things<br><br>5) Biggest problem and confused of TS: Will this kind of fight after all these 3 years are healthy and acceptable.<br><br>TO Jojo: What army technique that u mention bout how TS used it on her gal ? Please explain. I didnt come across any army technique. Is the push down and hold her hand is army technique ?<br><br>TS,<br>I begin to understand more after i read several times. Fighting is not a problem ( a very common thing to happen between couples ) but u still need to be more patient if she still dun understand and keep flaming you this and that. Try to talk patiently and just let her know you dont like this fighting and you're tired of fighting all the time. Just simple tell her that you dont wanna argue cuz you dont like it. Telling her all these doesnt mean you've giving in or being timid. If scolding here and there never work, try it peacefully. And always tell her you love her and dont want this kind of thing to affect your r/s<br><br>Keep trying till she finally can understand that you never be so aggresive like u used to be. Perhaps she will be more understanding in future.<br><br>If she still be the same, mayb you can consider if you want this kind of gal as your future wife.. 3 years is some amount of time with all the happiness and arguement between you both. Since you love your gal so much, do your best to control your anger.<br><br>If you think u cant control your anger already, try other method instead of pushing her. Try to leave the place and get some puff to ease yourself before see her again . Best of luck <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>History will of course repeat itself if you do nothing. Dont mind so much bout giving too much. When u love some1, it doesnt mean you should give equally. Most of the time is only one party gives more.<br><br></div>
