(she has a very fiery temper)<br>But i will just put it aside the next day and view it as an act of communication.<br>But to her, she viewed me as an aggressive person.<br><br>On the other hand, the common practice now is<br>Guys is usually at fault, reason we are physically stronger.<br>And gentleman kind of expectation which is seeked from us.<br><br>So what is ur stand ladies and gentlemen.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i see fighting as wrong if your just acting on impulse, not an act of passion. No matter how you see it, hurting somebody physically does not acheive anything, especialy so if your not in a properly state of mind.
