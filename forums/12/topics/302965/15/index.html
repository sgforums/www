            <div class='col-md body'>I have been thinking. Why can't ppl let go of their past or what they had lost?<br>Example: Even the wheels of fate has been fixed and it has been quite a while. Why do we still dwell and ponder what caused it? Finding it somewhat it is a waste that is ended even duo we may know the reason behind it.<br><br>So what is the reason behind all these?<br>1) A person can't  put down his/her pride to fully accept reality?<br>2) A person cannot adept to his/her lost routing?<br>3) A person cannot accept cos he/she find that it is not being fair to him/her.<br>4) Miss him/her cos they still love them?<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br><span style="font-style: italic;">if so, what kind of mentality is best used to accept and move on with life?</span></span><br>Some ppl will usually say, keep urself busy, Learn to Hate your partner, Put them all aside.<br>So what is your stand about the most efffective way or mental state?<br><br>Personally, after such a period of time, i still ponder on and off:<br>1)How can one change in such a short period of time from an angel to a devil.<br>(Listen to turning a deaf ear)<br>2)How long is a cool down period?(Switch partner)<br>3)Why cant there be communiation after a quarrel. In which she chose to escape for months. Waited for her to cool down, when you finally met her face to face and caught her red handed with another guy ehom she ensured me that she will not choose to be with (She just twist her words and said the impossible usually happens), she pretented to be a fierce b|tch which is barking (er ren xian gao zhuan), pushing all the fault to the other party. (Perhaps she has already changed her heart before the conflict happened or perhaps revenge even duo it has been a 3 years issue)<br>4)Felt betrayed to a certain extend.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Why all these? Why should i bother? Why does the thoughts  keep pestering me?</span></span><br>Haiz.
