ESPECIALLY when it comes to romantic inclinations.<br><br>detsub, i would tread on this path carefully. some say if i do like a guy, who cares just go for it. got gf or not bochap. some say never to touch an attached person. think u need to have ur own say. and proceed accordingly.</div>

She has to accept it. U cannot do much abt it either... for she's stubborn. Do wat U "feel" is da best. If U wanna carry on "helping" out da guy, tok to him &amp; stuffs, go ahead. If U wanna "break" contact to prevent further implications, go ahead.<br><br>Wat I trying to sae here is, doin things always have some obstacles pop out some where... Its how U handle dis obstacle (in dis case, da GF's "misunderstanding", suspicions &amp; jealousy towards U...) dat matters.

Tell his gf that you TRUST her bf is being TRUTHFUL to her and hence that's why he bother to make those queries for you to help him on this relationship on theirs.... The reason why he chose you OVER her is probably because it's always more difficult to dissolve relationship conflict(s) between parties directly INVOLVED in it..... (you need not tell her this...)

Its direct meaning referring to going on extra mile on something unneccessary.<br><br>Firstly: Both of you know each other online. The gf hates you because either she heard/knows about this OR she simply read the log or similar when the both of you are communicating (OR sms/gifts/etc) and all these perhaps suggest wrong motive. Its is rather likely that that guy is mentioned/compare/did something subconscious which made her claims of 'she thinks he likes me more than her.'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The other thing is that: When you tried explaining, it will make matter worst. Seriously speaking, you shouldn't have tried explaining - Duo chi yi ju. Their matters is between them - you being the third party, when you so anxious about trying to do something, it will only make you appear as if you are gulity.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The explaining must be DONE by that guy. I suggest a cool off period.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well ... ... I think firstly you need to know what's the guy thinks about you ... Advice is never continue a r/s with a guy who is attached and yet make his moves on you ... Even when he is having problems with his r/s. That's wht I think. If you see my post ... maybe you can understand what I am saying.<br><br>Next, ask yourself, are you still harbouring hopes with him. If you do, stay clear from him. Dun make yourself as an excuse for him to break with his gf. You will feel miserable if it happens, unless you are quite a heartless person?<br><br>If he only treat you as a good friend, of course you can carry on the friendship. If the gf so easy jealous, there's nothing much you can do. Its the guy's job to communicate with her and all you can do is advise him on the more tactful way of communicating with gals.<br><br>Good luck to you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

It's a norm that she hates you. If you have a bf and he is always talking about this particular gal.. you too will feel uneasy. It's hard to have truely good friends of the opposite sex (I mean pure friendships)</div>
