              <p>i met this girl last year and after some i think i am fond of her and well i can say that i have a place in that girl heart.(cause sometimes when she is in trouble, she will call and tell me and ask me for my help and she told me before dunno why when things happen she will think of me and ask me for help).</p>
              <p>this girl usually hangs out with some guys in her school but that the boys are younger then her. (she is sec 4 and those boys are like sec3? sec2?) well its ok for what i can see... but some boys like older sister to be their girls to be their girlfriend?? well i dunno what those boys are thinkin... and well... some of her suitors is boys younger then her.. and so far i am the only 1 that is older than her 2 years... and from what i heard from her 2 best friend, i am the guy which stand a higher chance then the other boys... (well i can say that my background is not like normal people... a guy who can cook very well and have potential to earn big money in the future, even my friends who are older then me also said. " wa who ever is ur wife sure have good life...." well that is the kind of comments i go around and all of them said the same thing....)</p>
              <p>cause i got help and support from 2 of the girl best friends, what ever the girl have anything to say, she will tell those 2 friends.. and those 2 friends is something like spy to me la.. but usually i will talk to the girl and she talk to me treating as her very good friend and we sometimes will to topic like which kind of girls u like which kind of boys u like bla bla bla...( sometimes i think like the girl is giving me hint... well i am those kind of people which go know the girl slowly and when the time is up going together with her is just nthing... just like a sharp knife going down a tofu... effortless) but even other pple who know us can see that i like that girl and is trying to getting close to her with some motive(no evil thoughts) but i dunno whether she can see that i like her or not... if she can see, why she is giving me false hope?!</p>
              <p>recently those 2 friends those me that she is with a guy now and guess what, that boy she is with is a sec 2 boy which haven even break his voice... when i hear this i was like... speechless...................... even herself know that herself and that sec 2 boy would not last long...(if know will now last long, then what is de point of going toghther...) now it really prove that we guys really dunno what girls is thinking....</p>
              <p>now i am very confused and lost... should i be a fool to wait for her??? or be a bastard which can easily forget her and find a new target???</p>
              <p><strong><em>to those who think that they are a joker, please keep their joke comment to their self... i don't think i got the mood to entertain clowns now....</em></strong></p>

              <p>well, simply put, the ball is actually in your court.<br>Waiting for someone is perhaps not a silly thing to do, but of course to ppl who are 'outside' viewing your situation (not myself), some may think she isn't worth it. I suppose you have to consider the fact of how deep is your affection for her, and whether she herself is actually considering a 'real' relationship at the current stage.<br>Sometimes ppl make decisions that can make us wonder why, but simply put, only you know best yourself. No matter what opinions others can give you, its still up to yourself.<br>I suppose you're 18. (same age as me). <br>If you suppose that you are the right guy for her, then go ahead and make your move. You don't have to wait for her to regain her single status before finally making your move. <br>And also, if she's really with a sec 2 boy and you're wondering why, i suppose you can just approach her and ask her to justify her choice?</p>
              <p>Furthermore, you mentioned " should i be a fool
                                      to wait for her??? or be a bastard which likes any girls which
                                      i see???".</p>
              <p>What do you mean? You mean you can change your personalities with her being the factor? Try to be sure and confident of yourself.</p>
              <p>So i suggest you dont continue and wait, but find a right opportunity to make a move. In my opinion, you've waited long enough.</p>
              <p>Wish you all the best.</p>

              <p>Its your lost... you are 2 years older than a sec 4 (that means you are 18) and you still cannot anticipate that this kind of things would happen? just because you can cook and maybe earn big bucks, does not neccessary means you can take your time to know her more. Strike while the iron is hot. When you have your chance, your should have taken it.</p>
              <p>Girls are so unpredictable since long time ago. On one hand they may look like they are interested in you. Giving you hints, being close to you, talk to you, but all these may only be for show. They may only treat you as a friend. Guys on the other hand, would think that such girls are interested in them, and in the end only find themselves in sorrow.</p>
              <p>For your case, even though u have 2 spies that worked for ya, you striked too late, my friend. I have encounter such similar situations just like you. Never dare make your move and only suffer when you see the girl of ya dreams going together with someone else.</p>
              <p>I advise you, just stay by her side, since you predicted that they would not last long, then you wait. And when your prediction comes true, then you strike. Dont go about and give me things like you are not one to take advantage and try to get her and be your gf when she is in her vulnerable state of mind. Everyone is taking advantage of someone. So you strike while the iron is hot.</p>
              <p>Just like Man Utd, got chance shoot liao, dont be like Arsenal, pass pass pass pass and pass then never shoot. Fuck (I mean arsenal not you)!!</p>

              <p><br>I don't think she likes you enough to consider you as one of her suitors.</p>
              <p>But you should work harder to become the person that you claimed to be in the future. (earn big money in the future) ---&gt; You should know that friends simply don't think or wish each other well SINCERELY.</p>
              <p>So you should take those words as a form of encouragement. Maybe your friends feel that you needed those words of encouragement from them? But I can tell you 100% guarantee + chop, that your friends are not praising you and will NEVER be putting themselves down.</p>

              <p>Can cook well + POTENTIAL to earn big bucks in future = big deal?</p>
              <p>I agree with you man, TS think too highly of himself, overconfident, and in the end despite got whatever spy here spy there still lose to a sec 2 boy. 18 year old lose to 14 year old boy. I guess his cooking skills and potential are for nuts, then.</p>
              <p>You can want to be a bastard and find another target, but unless you change yourself, you'll be playing this game over and over again, losing to your younger, immature, no-cooking skill, no-potential suitors just the same.</p>
