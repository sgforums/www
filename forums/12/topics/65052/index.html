You pamper each other irregularly, like you enjoys an occasional sharkfin or birdnest and NOT one blast on one occasion which you have to give and you raise the value to substitude for your lack of attention previously.<br><br>Don't keep quiet! That's the last thing you ought to do. But don't trash it out with him because he did nothing wrong in a way.<br><br>Communicate and share you thoughts and ideas with him. Seek to understand his work and his side of his story. Allow him to share his pressure with you. Give him the benefit of the doubt when he has done nothing wrong, yet. At the same time, tell him how you feel. He has to know what's wrong, so that you don't one day trash hell with him and him totally lost about what has happened in the relationship.<br><br>P.S: Last time call everyday, go out all the time, etc - doesn't mean this has to go on forever. Events in love is highly volatile - be adaptable and making amends along the way in your love together. In this way, your relationship will survive eventually - with a little hardwork to fuel it.<br><br>Cheers</div>

Sometimes in a relationship, the situation is a little of the same...<br><br>Don't keep EVERYTHING to yourself. In most sense, no ordinary human can do that. You'll probably just BURST OUT in a matter of time? Instead of risking your relationship that way (if you truly treasure your relationship), tries to go SLOW and EASY on this one... Let him know the things you feel that he should know... No doubt he may be facing things from his part of life... But when things are happening in your relationship with him, you can't simply close one eye and pretend that NOTHING is happening... Especially if this matter can drag on for quite a while... Let him know at the appropriate times... Share little things with him... It's always better that way than to find yourself bursting out one day or just leaving him quietly simply because you can't take it anymore...<br><br>Be fair to yourself...
