Your way may not be the one the girl is expecting, or maybe she doesn't need you in her life now.<br><br>I don't think undying love should be sent in smses, it really does show a lack of sincerity and courage. Perhaps next time you should do it in person, and only after you know she's ready for a relationship, and she likes you a lot, more than friends.<br><br>You can send her flowers, but just send her 1, telling her you want to be friends for now?<br><br>As for what you're facing... i'm sure alot of us are also lost. The only one who can find the path is but you yourself. Search out your heart, remember all the ambitions you once had and wanted, and then go for it. Seek your dream~<br><br>Only by living for a dream, and an ambition, can our life be truly fulfilling. Otherwise life can get rather meaningless..</div>
