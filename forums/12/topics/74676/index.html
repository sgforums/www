In the sms, she said she really hate me and am i happy to see her sad? I was shocked. I called her and ask her what happen. She was in a crying tone, she ask me what did i said to that guy.<br><br>I didn't know what had happen, i ask her and she said the guy told her that "I" told him that i feel terribly upset and hurt over losing her and she would come back to me one day. Then he said that he's trying to avoid her because he thinks that i'm pityful.<br><br>I admit that when we were together, i knew she was going out with him a few times and were quite close. I told him over the IRC that i do not feel comfortable with him and my gf going out so frequently and hope that he can don't contact her so much.<br><br>After the breakup and i knew he was together with her, i chat with him again in IRC and told him to love her as much as i do and don't lie to her nor hurt her. I told him i still love her and won't give up.

Relativity's definition of 'love'? This statement is often valid mainly in an at least 2 way relationship... It can also benefit as a 'pushing factor'....<br><br>Understand that your 'relationship' is now more of a mono-directional.... She's not much responding... Might not even be on 'receiving mode'? Though not a 100% thing, it's quite likely to remain this way unless... 1. There're some major changes 2. Hidden factors 3. You finally walk out of it...<br><br>My difference from you back then was that I just love her... I don't even sense much disappointment when she's with other bf(s)... She told me her things... I just listened... Of course, it's not uncommon for you to feel this way by objective definition of love... And through a relative definition... A true defined love should be something like this... The complications it brings in based on simple principles... Humans are complicated by nature...<br><br>Oh well.. Why am I telling you all this?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In your current stage and without much changes... In time you'll probably walk out of it.... And if you don't? (for now or quite a long run...) As long as it's not giving you much problems and affecting your mood, it's consider quite ok....</div>

Nobody will know what you want until you tell them. Even if they can't give you what you want, don't force. Cause we are humans, we have our limitations and there are some factors that makes us can't give you what you expects.<br><br>I don't know if i will do better next time. Nobody knows the future, now i hope i can purse my own interests and do the things i want to do. I do not think so much about relationships now. I wanna let things be and let it flows with time. Be it good or bad, no regrets i hope and i will accept whatever will happen.<br><br>And for furthur info, she don't trust me. She said i'm crazy and don't know who am i. She don't even know the words i said is truth or a lie. She said only me myself knows it's a truth or a lie. I know my actions at times don't follows what i said. This is a truth as i have ask some of my friends. But i know myself that whatever i've said is all the truth. What can i do nor say then? I've learnt.<br><br>Actions speak louder than words.</div>

I start to feel and understand this theory a few weeks ago.<br><br>Yuhaier said: High demands ALWAYS brings deep disappointment.<br>So why not take what you will receive? Nobody will know what you want until you tell them. Even if they can't give you what you want, don't force. Cause we are humans, we have our limitations and there are some factors that makes us can't give you what you expects.<br><br>I don't know if i will do better next time. Nobody knows the future, now i hope i can purse my own interests and do the things i want to do. I do not think so much about relationships now. I wanna let things be and let it flows with time. Be it good or bad, no regrets i hope and i will accept whatever will happen.<br><br>And for furthur info, she don't trust me. She said i'm crazy and don't know who am i. She don't even know the words i said is truth or a lie. She said only me myself knows it's a truth or a lie. I know my actions at times don't follows what i said. This is a truth as i have ask some of my friends. But i know myself that whatever i've said is all the truth. What can i do nor say then?

I understand this theory now.<br><br>I would think of this at times : If that guy is really a good guy, love her and cherish her truly, i would be happy for her but sad for myself.<br><br>But on the other hand, love should be selfish at times right?

Our relationship was over, I remained as her friend and listened to her woes over the other guys... She knew all the time that I still love her. She made her stand that we cannot be, I accepted that and told her that i just wanted to care and love for her... No return in kind... So it happened...? Through mails and talks... Seen her cried over other guys... Until one day I realise... It wasn't a tragedy... I mean the break up between us... It really wasn't meant to be.... She's really not my type of girl... And I also happened to realise then that I had already unknowingly got over it... My actions... The things I did... Were just practices of beliefs already demolished....

That is one of your basic characteristics. You yourself probably won't much notice it as it's usually just momentary comments coming from your thoughts... People around would be much more prone to noticing it... Especially your partner if you have one. It's just a matter of whether she can accept / tolerate it or not... If you think it can give you problems, you can do a bit by mastering over it... One example would be my buddy? Though it's often your character to be bubbly and chatty (making this control a bit difficult to work..)... What my buddy does I think is that he has somehow mature and becomes more stable in his delivery of speech... Meaning he says only the things which needs to be said... What is more amazing is that he don't even have to get rid of or suppress his bubbly nature (which I think it would be a waste if he does?)... He just show it in front of the appropriate people who he's quite certain that can readily accept his behavior.... eg. close friends etc...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
