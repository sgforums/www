            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the feedback. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Firstly, he is the oldest in the class as I knew him from NS when a year ago. He was actually from JC but his results can't get him to local U so he came to poly and study and that makes him 2-4 years older than her female classmates. My friend is 22 this year but most of his classmates are around the age of 18.<br><br>And yes. Something might be wrong with my friend as he had encountered many unhappy incidents when in NS but generally he is a nice guy who will not harm you.<br><br>As for how comes the lecturer entered the flame I am not so sure as I am also puzzled about it since I am from poly last time.<br><br>And I can sense the childish elements of those girls when my friend talked to me regarding this</div>
