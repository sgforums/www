            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Serenity,<br><br>This is a difficult question to answer, simply because the availability of the internet has opened up a whole new means of communication &amp;/or "dating" with people all over the world.  The crux here is: you haven't even seen the lady in person.<br><br>For all you know, she could actually be a guy leading you on deliberately.  Don't think it can't happen, it has happened, &amp; to a good friend of mine too!  Then there're the perverts, the gays, the weirdos, the psychopaths, etc.  Last but Not least, there's also the consideration whether or Not you guys will click in real life.  I'm Not trying to discourage you here, I'm just trying to let you know:  Before you sink deeper into your feelings, take time out to first MEET this lady.<br><br>I've heard &amp; know of success stories of people dating, falling in love, &amp; eventually marrying, the person they knew via the Net.  And those are such, SUCH romantic stories.<br><br>Thus, it's best you consider the above, AND try to meet up with this lady before letting yourself sink too deep &amp; risking severe heartbreak.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by serenity1805:</div><div class="quote_body">i have a question.  is age a problem when in a r/n? is it ok for a guy to go out with a older woman?<br><br>i'm 32 and the lady whom i'm may be getting close to is near 40s.  she's mature and i feel very comfy with her.  weour met online and we've not met in real.  she says she's single and never had a bf. but she's really nice and caring.<br><br>hmmm i wonder why.  we chat every nite.  i hope she doesn't get the wrong idea...aiya...i also confused now.<br><br>your view on this?</div></blockquote></div>

Dont ask me why, its born in our genes where we chose our suitable mate to make our next offspring.<br><br>Anyway, if you think she is too ugly for you to be able to tolerate, then lets stop the chatting with her, if not she will have feelings for you and end up making her heart broken, difficult for both of you too.</div>
