In that forum that are quit a few of them living in europe. Get to know them and who knows u can meet them for travel. I have been travelling to other countries bcos of work by myself alone and the best thing in this is to train urself to be more independent. Its a good time to train that and also get to know more friends.<br><br>As to ur friend who is going to 'fly ur kite', if I am u i will never never ask her out for any trip. Ppl like this does not deserve my attention anymore.<br><br>Lastly, while u are there for 8 mths, it an opportunity to travel cos u might not have this chance again in the future and u will regret it. Like myself now, I am also thinking ways to get out the small town in the states altot I am very afraid of driving long distance.
