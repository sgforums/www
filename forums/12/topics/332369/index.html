                                  Jan Leeming claimed in Femail last week that internet dating has given
                                  her a new lease of life - and she's not alone. A staggering 65 per cent
                                  of British singletons now turn to the internet looking for love. But
                                  everyone who's ever dated online knows personal profiles can be a
                                  minefield - too often a tall, dark, handsome millionaire turns out to
                                  be a short, fat, ugly geek. Here, to help you read between the lines of

She'll be forever
                                  showing you pictures of fluffy kittens on her mobile phone and, on your
                                  first date, will have given pet names to all your fingers before the
                                  main course arrives.<br> <br> <strong> CURVY</strong> Fat. Forget any silly notions of Marilyn Monroe's softly sensuous body. This girl is more pint glass than hourglass.<br> <br> <strong>VOLUPTUOUS</strong> Fat and shows too much flesh in clothes two sizes too small for her.<br> <br> <strong>BUBBLY</strong> Fat AND annoying. Tries to make up for her ample size by being the life and soul of the party and fails in all respects.<br> <img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/10/01/article-0-02DE052400000578-92_468x286.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em>His ad says he's attractive, sporty and 5ft 10in. That means he's ugly, 5ft 3in and plays snooker</em><br> <br> <strong>CUDDLY</strong> Morbidly obese. A date would necessitate the removal of the roof and a
                                  whale sling. Cuddling is very unlikely, although squashing is a
                                  distinct possibility.<br> <br> <strong>BBW</strong> Stands for 'big, beautiful
                                  woman'. Well, two out of three's not bad. She's certainly big and
                                  female. But it's doubtful many beholders will consider her beautiful.<br> <br> <strong>SIZE</strong> <strong>10</strong> In Uzbekistan. On the UK High Street it's a completely different story.<br> <br> <strong>FIERY</strong> Psychotic. Cancel a date with this girl and you'll come home to find
                                  your car has been keyed and all the sleeves have been cut off your
                                  shirts.<br> <br> <strong>VIVACIOUS </strong>Aggressive. An opinionated
                                  finger-jabber. She's got views on everything and she's not afraid to
                                  ram them forcefully down your throat. <br> <br> <strong>GREAT PERSONALITY </strong>Ugly as sin. If a woman is selling her personality, then her face looks good in a paper bag.<br> <br> <strong> ARTISTIC</strong> Drama Queen. Welcome to a world of slamming doors, smashed crockery and huffy silences.<br> <br> <strong>ATHLETIC AND TONED</strong> Flat chested and shapeless. A sexless, lumpless and bumpless Tomboy.<br> <br> <strong>AGE 34</strong> Age 43. There's more chance of winning the Lottery on a double rollover
                                  week than there is of being a woman over 35 and getting a date on the
                                  internet. It doesn't matter if the guy is 60, he'll still confine his
                                  searches to '35 and under', so any woman's age should be taken as a
                                  ball park figure.<br> <br> <strong>PLAYFUL</strong> Hussy. Working her way through the internet site and it's your turn.<br> <br> <strong>GIRLY</strong> Thick. Shallower than a mouse's foot bath. High School Musical is her
                                  idea of high brow. She can tell you the name of every character in TV
                                  teen drama Gossip Girl, but has no idea who the Prime Minister is.<br> <br> <strong>LIVES LIFE TO THE FULL</strong> Alcoholic. Likes to start the day with a couple of Bacardi Breezers. Happy Hour is her favourite time of day.<br> <br> <strong>I'M INTO WHIRLWIND ROMANCES</strong> My visa runs out in 10 days and if I don't get married I'll be deported.<br> <br> <strong>CHALLENGING</strong> High-maintenance pain in the neck.<br> <br> <strong>HOMELY</strong> Frump. You want to paint the town red and she'll want you to paint her
                                  living room beige. Brace yourself for a world of cup-a-soups and
                                  novelty toilet roll holders.<br> <br> <strong>LOYAL</strong> Stalker. She'll have
                                  Googled you and looked you up on Friends Reunited before you even meet.
                                  Her brain cannot process the words: 'I don't think you're quite right
                                  for me.'<br> <br> <strong>LIKES THE FINER THINGS IN LIFE</strong> Gold digger. Looking for a new wardrobe, jewellery and a few weekends away before she dumps you for a 25-year-old Adonis.<br> <br> <strong>HONEST</strong> No social skills. The censorship button in her brain doesn't work. Says whatever comes into her head. <br> <br> <strong>SENSITIVE</strong> Cry baby. Woe betide you if you don't notice she's had her hair cut or that she's wearing new shoelaces.<br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="color: black;"><strong>WHAT MEN REALLY MEAN</strong></span></span><br> <br> <strong>ATTRACTIVE</strong> Plain. Everyone in online dating is 'attractive.' In the real world it
                                  means 'pleasant to look at' - in the internet-speak it means: two eyes,
                                  two ears and a mouth.<br> <br> <strong>FAIRLY ATTRACTIVE</strong> Gutchurningly
                                  hideous. When he's not even claiming to be attractive, it's time to
                                  worry. Andrew Lloyd Webber will look like a Calvin Klein model next to
                                  this guy. Meeting under the cover of darkness is advised.<br> <br> <strong>TOLD ATTRACTIVE</strong> By my mother, the only woman I've every loved or am ever likely to.<br> <br> <strong>RUGBY PLAYER'S BUILD</strong> One who retired 10 years ago. Stop thinking: Jonny Wilkinson. Start thinking: Johnny Vegas.<br> <br> <img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/10/01/article-1066311-02A2C8B6000004B0-903_224x390.jpg" border="0" alt=""> <img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/10/01/article-1066311-029997F50000044D-641_224x390.jpg" border="0" alt=""> <br> Translation: When his ad says 'rugby player's build' he doesn't mean Jonny Wilkinson, he really means Johnny Vegas<br> <br> <strong>DISCRETION EXPECTED</strong> I'm married and don't want my wife to know.<br> <br> <strong> DISCRETION OFFERED</strong> I don't care if you're married too.<br> <br> <strong>HOPE YOU LIKE MY PICTURE</strong> Taken 10 years ago and bears no resemblance on now.<br> <br> <strong> MODERN MAN</strong> We'll be splitting the bill 50/50. I go on three of these internet
                                  dates a week. So unless you're a sure thing you pay for your own dinner.<br> <br> <strong>NOT JUST LOOKING FOR SEX</strong> I am just looking for sex but hope you won't see through my cunning reverse psychology.<br> <img src="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/10/01/article-1066311-02DE058200000578-628_468x286.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> <strong>WILLING TO TRAVEL</strong> Lives in a filthy flea-ridden hovel that he can't possibly let you see.<br> <br> <strong>ADVENTUROUS</strong> Pervert. He can turn anything into a double entendre. On a date he'll
                                  order graphically named cocktails and talk dirty with you over the
                                  garlic bread.<br> <strong><br> NORMAL KIND OF GUY</strong> Normal in a Norman Bates kind of way. Normality should be a given, so run a mile from anyone selling it as a good point.<br> <strong><br> GSOH (GOOD SENSE OF HUMOUR)</strong> No sense of humour. The golden rule of internet dating is that anyone
                                  who feels obliged to mention they have a sense of humour is usually
                                  devoid of one.<br> <strong><br> EARNS A SIX-FIGURE SALARY</strong> Yes, he does. But he includes pence in that figure.<br> <strong><br> NEVER DONE THIS</strong> Have done this a thousand times before, but I'm too embarrassed to admit it, so will pretend that you're my first.<br> <strong> <br> FUN AND ZANY</strong> Mental age of a 12-year-old. Your date will be a riot of whoopee cushions, itching powder and fake-dogpoo-filled fun.<br> <strong><br> LOOKS NOT IMPORTANT</strong> Barrel-scraping beggar who can't afford to be a chooser.<br> <strong><br> 5ft 10</strong> 5ft 7. It's safe to deduct three inches from any man claiming to be between 5ft 7 and 5ft 10.<br> <strong><br> SPORTY</strong> I watched the Olympics and play snooker for the local pub team. <br> <br> <strong>UNIQUE</strong> Sex change. Best not to hang around long enough to find out whether it's pre op or post op.<br> <strong> <br> NOT INTO EMAIL TENNIS</strong> I need to secure a date as soon as possible, before you suss out what a tedious dullard I am.<br> <strong><br> OLD FASHIONED</strong> Male chauvinist pig. A woman's place is in the home and, more
                                  precisely, the kitchen - preferably cooking his meals and elbow deep in
                                  his dirty shirts.<br> <br> <strong>TRADITIONAL</strong> Patronising. He'll order
                                  for you in a restaurant and pat you on the bottom and say 'don't you
                                  worry your pretty head about it' when you ask him about his day.<br> <strong><br> MANLY</strong> Hairy. Only to be pursued if you like men who moult all over your furniture. <br> <br> <strong>DISTINGUISHED</strong> Old. Speak slowly and clearly and always be within five minutes of a
                                  toilet. The good news is he travels for free and gets in half-price at
                                  the cinema.<br> <strong><br> INDEPENDENT</strong> Lying, cheating commitment-phobic scum.<br> <strong><br> UNCONVENTIONAL</strong> Insane. The sort of person you cross the road to avoid, even if the road is the M1 in the rushhour.<br> <strong><br> ASPIRATIONAL</strong> Broke. He has lofty ideas, but not a penny to his name. Expect early-bird specials on your date. <br> <br> <strong>ROMANTIC</strong> Oily creep. The flowers come from the garage forecourt and he calls you
                                  'babe' or 'sweetheart' because he can't remember your name.<br> <br> <br> <em>Source: Femail UK., October 1, 2008</em></div>
