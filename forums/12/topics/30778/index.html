Its simply shows that she is indecisive about YOU and waiting for you to do something if you wanted her. Let me tell you, if the communication channel is up, things will be clearer and easier for you. She choose to give you chance to go out with her signal 3 possibilities.<br><br>First: She really has nothing to do and needed that company <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br>Second: She needed someone around to clear her mind of her ex.<br>Third: She is giving you a chance <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>My advice is remain as friends - yes, strike in the dark. Open up communication and add humor into it. If you want to be like friends - act and speak like a good one - from there, you will be attempting to make her realise what she really wants. If you wait and wait and wait and wait.... *continues till xmas*<br><br>... chances are you will lose this battle. Not asking you to take rash moves, but intelligent emotional moves so that you could execute your good moves, when you needed them in the future. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
