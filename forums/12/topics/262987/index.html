            <div class='col-md body'>My uncle who was balding sought help from Beijing 101 some years ago, but Beijing 101 did not take him then because they said they could not help improve his situation. So i think in your case, you could go for a consultation and listen to what they have to say. The choice is still yours whether to sign up with them or not.<br><br>My brother who is also balding, recently found that he has been washing his hair using warm water which resulting in him lossing hair, so his advice is to use cold water to wash your hair.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>diet also plays a factor.  if you are currently on a diet to control your weight. it may make your hair brittle at some point where its not getting enough nutrients, cosing the hair to break and lose out in extreme cases.<br><br>warm/hot water makes the hair strands open up along it and makes it easier to break.  Cool water helps smooth down the hair by closing off those strands.<br><br>This is a age old beauty tip which I think will also apply to those losing hair:<br><br>Those with curly hairs and hoping to keep their hair curls. Are recommended to sleep on Silk/Satin Cover pillowcases.<br><br>Rationale is that the silk/satin dont snag your hair as much.  So for those still young, but possibly losing hair....not because it drop from the roots, but because the hair strand broke.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh...and something else.<br><br>Avoid smoking or smoke filled environment.<br><br>Inhaling smoke constrict your blood vessels, thereby restricting the delivery of your essential nutrients to your skins, hair follicles &amp; nails thru your blood.<br><br>Thats why beauty magazines always advise against smoking, cos smoking ages you by resulting your skin to look dull, your hair brittle &amp; your nails uneven surfaces.<br><br>Doctors also advises patients from smoking, especially after surgical procedures  because when blood cannot send those essential nutrients to your needed organs....it heals so much slower.</div>

Shampoo selection also important, seek professional or  experience hairstylist regarding this. Stick to one shampoo and dont keep  changing. Apply hair tonic.<br><br>Do not colour or rebond your hair at this period of time.<br><br>May I know how it happens? Did you do some hair dye/rebond/perming that causes this?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey girl,<br><br>First off, worrying about it will just increase your stress levels and that's really bad for your overall health.<br><br>I myself found my hair getting thinner especially at the parting near the hairline. When i consulted a dietician, she told me i was lacking in Omega-3 oil. Since then i've been taking Usana's Omega-3 fish oil gel capsules and also their multivitamins. Currently, after a month, there's a vast improvement and though my hair is not luciously thick, at least noone will comment saying i'm balding or whatever.<br><br>Also, i nourish my hair every week by applying Olive oil to the entire head and massaging it in. This is done before bed and left throughout the night, clipped up. Then i wash out my hair with a mild shampoo in the morning. Though it is really gross to touch your oily hair at night and stuff, this treatment leaves your hair healthy and shiny. If you are hardworking, once massaging the oil in, soak a small towel with hot water and wrap your hair in a turban-like fashion. Leave till towel is cool. Repeat at least 5 times. This is good especially in early stages.<br><br>Another rule is to NEVER brush your wet hair! This will jerk the hair follicles out as wet hair is at its' weakest. Instead, use a wide toothed comb to comb out once, and then let hair air-dry. As far as possible, use a brush only on dry hair, that has those plastic points in its teeth. This will act like a massage on the hair.<br><br>It is important not to use too many styling products. Best to have a short, no-fuss hairstyle during this period of pampering your hair. Rebonding/straightening/perming is out of the question as they do the worst damage possible to hair.<br><br>Lastly, hair is a woman's crowning glory. Do think before you do/apply anything to your hair.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are losing your hair, looks like you going to lose your money too.<br>Money can be earned, but the hair is not growing back.<br><br>Hair loss is natural, you can only slow it down. It drops and replaces itself. But slowly the replacement does not match the loss. Simple massage of the scalp to improve blood circulation will help to keep the scalp supple longer. But it may be too late now, this should been done regularly decades ago. The best time to keep your hair is when you still have it, so say an advertisement, very true.<br><br>If the cause of hair loss is a symptom of some ailment, it can be treated. This is why some people are "successful", while others have no effect in hair raising treatment.<br><br>If you are truely persistent in regaining you crown, there is hair transplant, or hair weaving. Thats why I say you going to lose your money too.</div>
