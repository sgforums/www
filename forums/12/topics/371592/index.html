              <p>That you had to ask why you cant control your emotions only proves you are not master of your own emotions, lacking in its control and management of it. What else will you 'lose control' of and blame it on something else? Afterall, you are an  educated and matured grown adult already.</p>
              <p>Today it is this 'uncontrollable' urge to chat with her. What next? I dare not contemplate.</p>
              <p>Talk is easy and cheap. But still, it is within your power to control your emotions and not let it betray your sensibilities. Perhaps it may be time to train yourself up to control your emotions - never to give in to urges or impulses, but to follow strictly on fully rationalised course of what you want, what you hope to achieve and what must be done to see a successful conclusion or a stop gap 'cut loss' measure to such goals.</p>
              <p>Make no mistake.That girl is only a secondary issue. Your emotions and its control is the primary concern.</p>

              <p>Goes with the flow. Making love or friends is not a logical event.</p>

              <p>That will depend on your own self control and determination. It might just be a temporary thing for now but how it progress really depends on yourself and noone else really knows you better than yourself.</p>
              <p>Sometimes people wait and regret later when they lose a person. Sometimes people can find even better 1s because they wait.</p>
              <p>The new school semester starts tomorrow so it would be best you settle your thoughts fast and focus on your studies. Remember in an earlier thread you worried about your results and future so make sure you don't let this issue affect it.</p>

              <p>That will depend on your own self control and determination. It
                  might just be a temporary thing for now but how it progress really
                  depends on yourself and noone else really knows you better than
                  yourself.</p>
              <p>Sometimes people wait and regret later when they lose a person.
                  Sometimes people can find even better 1s because they wait.</p>
              <p>The new school semester starts tomorrow so it would be best you
                  settle your thoughts fast and focus on your studies. Remember in an
                  earlier thread you worried about your results and future so make
                  sure you don't let this issue affect it.</p>

              <p>I'm glad you sort out your thoughts. School starting today le so remember to study hard.</p>
              <p>You seem easily affected by things happening around you though and your studies might be easily affected. Do consider what i suggested to you before in PM though as that might help you more in the long run.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>If one purports to love another and at the same time feels fear of losing him/her or even wanting to possess the ...  belies the lack of self - love. Hence, the fear. It is needs of many sorts parading as love. One's love is beggarly. One gives only to take or hoping for rewards.</p>
              <p> It will soon entrap the other and oneself is enslaved. Freedom (of loving) has become bondage.  And if both are in the same predicament ( fear-based love) the usual is of exploiting each other for the benefit of each ends. Only the word 'love' is used but certainly it is not.  </p>
