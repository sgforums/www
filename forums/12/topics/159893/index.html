            <div class='col-md body'>He really has serious problems, maybe even depressions. It will be hard for you to help him becasue in his current state he may reject you becasue he doesn't feel like to open up to anyone. You must be strong for yourself and for himself, I know it's very hard, I am in a similar situation. You must stand by him even when he doesn't want, show him that you care, but  carefully, step by step. It will hurt you when he rejects you, your help, he will sure hurt you, tell you words which hurt you, but you must be strong becasue he isn't himself now. Don't come too close too fast, if it is needed, make one or two steps back, you must be patient. Try to endure, I am trying that too though sometimes I feel like giving up, but keep fighting.<br><br>Good luck!</div>

Doing drugs is serious. Not only it's against the law, but on a more personal side, it's definitely a very very bad thing.<br><br>I would suggest that you call for professional help. Tell them the situation and seek for their advises. Normally you don't have to reveal who you are if you want to protect your bf (ex).
