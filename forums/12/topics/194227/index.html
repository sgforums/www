            <div class='col-md body'>You see, I have several incidents that makes me unable to get up and do somethings properly without even worrying that it might happen again.<br><br>Firstly, there was this girl, she was just a girl I've seen before somewhere in school and during PE, we were playing something like soccer, I was trying to catch it but she suddenly threw the ball to another side forcefully and becuase I was the goalie, I had to ran to the ball to picked it up and behind me, she screaming away at me like a mad girl. After that incident, she started to scold me behind my backs, calling me a slut all that. Also, she tried to saboh me everytime a sitaution wnet wrong. I didn't know why she was soo mad at me, trust me, all I ever had was went on a chatline (where my classmates use to frequent) to look for comfort as a friend, so I begin chatting up wif the guys (the girls in class are not really close to me and some the nice girls are not on the chatline) so I assume she must be jealous that I am chatting wif them because I heard from my friend that the guys in the class talks about me and their conversation in the class.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Secondly, there was this attention seeker guy. He is like always trying to be holier than thou, though he never follows what he 'preaches' he's always putting down those lazy, late-comers, boastfull ppl etc. you get the drift. In actual fact, he does everything of the above &gt;.&lt; But because he always made it seems that he is the 'one' to change them, he once went overboard on me by standing in front of the whole class saying, 'you know what happens to people like that?' After he finish hi sentence, he walks over to my desk and he use his legs to bang on my table. I got shocked and I heard a guy laughing real hard and I turn my head beside me and saw how he looks like he enjoyed seeing me being totored  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  From that onwards, I always had this image of him laughing real hard at me wherever and whatever I do...<br><br>Thirdly, I have a 'friend'. She is always following the crowd. So whatever bad things ppl do to me, she automatically thinks im a nusiance and screams at me for no reason. To tell u the truth, If I see her on streets, I feel like kicking her &gt;.&lt;<br><br>Lastly, when I view pretty images like models actresses actors all that. I felt jealous. Yes, it's because they are beautiful that they are in the spotlight. But mostly it's because their attitudes and inner beauty sucks that's why they get most of the spotlight..take for example, Paris Hilton. She reminds me of those pretty girls in real life that act like her, spoilt and so on, bad-tempered but they get the most attention. Inner beauty? Nah, who wants to see inner beauty..you dun hear ppl saying, 'waa, she is so kind-hearted and hardworking, I like her for that' instead, 'waa, she's so chio' is often heard. Search for good looking ppl, you get more results than say..stephen hawking, einstein etc. People also dun purposely create a inner beauty forum or place to worship them, even if so..their activity ratings are not up to par than say, a forum with very good looking people. Who wants to talk about mother teresa?<br><br>Sigh, anyways, do give your opinions about this matter.

Just ignore them, if they are around u, try not to talk so much, to avoid any trouble. If they really come and piss u off. Show them u had enough of it (Like grab his collar and shout "WTF is ur problem, j/k). After tt, it is likely they will leave u alone and start their antics all over again a few days later.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This kinda people obviously all talk and no action, as in your useless classmates. Seriously, I agree with what someone said here, don't be afraid to show them that your pissed off. Confront them and tell them to piss off. Bullies are useless cause they suffer an inferiority complex which they hide deep down inside, covered with self-denial and they can't bare to ever admit and mature.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>jam on a bread,<br><br>My advise will be learn to trust and walk out of the past. After all, what pass is already past, no point to look back and ponder over them. It is rather hurthful and demoralising to be subjected to such forms of prejudicial behaviour. However, take it as a lesson and through it grow and mature with better social skills and communications ques.<br><br>Cheers</div>

I didn't know why she was soo mad at me, trust me, all I ever had was went on a chatline (where my classmates use to frequent) to look for comfort as a friend, so I begin chatting up wif the guys (the girls in class are not really close to me and some the nice girls are not on the chatline) so I assume she must be jealous that I am chatting wif them because I heard from my friend that the guys in the class talks about me and their conversation in the class.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Secondly, there was this attention seeker guy.

Yes, it's because they are beautiful that they are in the spotlight.

Nah, who wants to see inner beauty..you dun hear ppl saying, 'waa, she is so kind-hearted and hardworking, I like her for that' instead, 'waa, she's so chio' is often heard. Search for good looking ppl, you get more results than say..stephen hawking, einstein etc. People also dun purposely create a inner beauty forum or place to worship them, even if so..their activity ratings are not up to par than say, a forum with very good looking people. Who wants to talk about mother teresa?<br><br>Sigh, anyways, do give your opinions about this matter. I hope to hear from you people  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>If I were to say that beauty is only skin-deep, I'm sure you'll say that's bullshit. I agree completely. Beauty affects all of us, whether we are aware or not, or whether we admit or not. But the thing is,  beauty will fade over time, and people would wean over them after a while. Personality wins after a while. If you are selfless, people can feel it, say etc. Audrey Hepburn. People still remember her after so long, while the other (possibly?) more beautiful women in her time were forgotten, exceopt for possibly Marilyn Manroe (sp?).<br>There are lucky people who have both personality and good looks;they must have been good beings in their previous life, but everybody has different fates. There isn't any use wishing it were any different, is there? So chin up gal, be cheerful.  I can see those guys in your class can feel your personality already.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Life is like that, there are nice people and not-so-nice ones. I think that first girl mentioned in the PE incident is just jealous of you. Maybe you should confront her...? So much gossip isn't good...<br><br>That (lol) holier-than-thou guy, I doubt he will change until anybody dares to confront him. the other guy who enjoys laughing at you, don't let him have the satisfaction of letting him laugh at you! I get laughed and ridiculed by boys in my class a lot too; I know they don't mean to really make me sad, but still.. Anyway, I just ignore them. They are so... &gt;_&lt;<br><br>Forget that "friend". try to ignore whatever hurtful things she say, or just avoid her completely. "Nobody can make you feel hurt without your permission."
