              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just want to clarify with things here. I'm quite new to clubs and pubs. In fact, last saturday was my very first time went to night club (gotham penthouse). I've been to zirca before and that was the first too quite a few weeks back but i never really entered that place, just outside the area. Since its my first time i was quite excited about this. Because i never had a friend to ask me out go to this kind of place and it looks like my dream come true. I always fantasize myself in those places, u know.. dancing around, talk to the girls, bump into one of the strangers then starts to apologize and had a conversation since its a good place to socialize and stuff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok, last sat when i stepped into the place. I was "wow", u know. But looking around with the girls dancing and those drinks (i never drink before but i would love to try one) and those peoples around me, i felt kind of scared u know. Not like terrified, just a confuse scared. Its strange, i mean i suppose to enjoy this but why am i felt that way? I usually the type those who are really outgoing person but when i entered that place, i felt this fear in me and i went quiet all 4 hours straight. Not literally quiet though. Then when i got back home, i was thinking why this is happening? its a club... a place where teens like me to enjoy but yet it scares me. I was so excited but i never expected this feeling when i entered there.</p>
              <p>So i just want to know that anyone of those in clubs/pubs went in the first time got this feeling?</p>

              <p>Maybe u can try going 1-2 times more and if u still don't like the place, maybe its just not suitable for u. There are many other ways to get to know people and enjoy urself without going to such clubs/pubs.</p>

              <p>Just do what u feel is you. U dont have to BE someone u are not.Relax... observe.. get a drink or two. Feel the mood.. the ambience. aaah.. the bass.. the beat.. the music. Can u feel it ? Is that you ? Is this the place ?  Do u feel the mojo..</p>
              <p>When i meant cherries to be popped , i didnt mean it sexually. More like, sometimes first timers expect alot. And some may grow accustomed to it, some may suddenly do a 360 n become a fiend.. once tasted the forbidden fruits.. losses all sense of self and becomes the extreme of his former self.</p>

              <p>U can enjoy the little simply things in life man.</p>
              <p>Just do what u feel is you. U dont have to BE someone u are not.Relax... observe.. get a drink or two. Feel the mood.. the ambience. aaah.. the bass.. the beat.. the music. Can u feel it ? Is that you ? Is this the place ?  Do u feel the mojo..</p>
              <p>When i meant cherries to be popped , i didnt mean it sexually. More like, sometimes first timers expect alot. And some may grow accustomed to it, some may suddenly do a 360 n become a fiend.. once tasted the forbidden fruits.. losses all sense of self and becomes the extreme of his former self.</p>
              <p>Know ur limits la ya. keke.</p>

              <p>why i cant survive volunteer work? please tell me the flaws.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And yes, i dont mean to brag but i already had quite a number of
              friends but i want to know more. So i do have a passion about it. I
              know community events but volunteer work? really sorry for being
              picky but i want to make friends that around my age i believe
              volunteer work is for 27+ ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, im 18 now. I just have this mindset that i want to try and
              enjoy everything that i wanted to do before i reach 20.
              somesort of my goal</p>

              <p>There are many different types of volunteer work. Some work with elderly, some work with children, some with the physically handicapped etc etc.</p>
              <p>Personally i work with youths and children providing tuition and organising activities for them.</p>
              <p>There are a large range of age for volunteers depending on what sort of vol work u do and where u do it. Knowing people older might not be a bad thing as well since u can learn from their experiences etc.</p>
              <p>I said u won't 'survive' because without commitment, there is litte push factor to make u continue volunteery work. People with the passion for it will feel happy just doing it regardless whether they have friends going as well or anything. Its the actual task perform that keeps them going. However if u go only to make friends, u will loss motivation if ur friends decides to stop, change place etc etc. Very often, ur beneficeries can 'detect' whether u are really sincere in being there with them.</p>

              <p>I find that a very stupid thought. There is no point in trying to be someone you are not. What others enjoy doesn't mean it is something u will enjoy and vice versa. Everyone have different interest that suits their personality and there is no 1 model fit all thing that u can do.</p>
