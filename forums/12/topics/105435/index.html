Now she's happily married with another guy. I hope u got the hint where I am driving at.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Don't mean to be the bearer of bad news : but I think some how he may had lost the torch that he carried for you in these times. Married couples lost their flames of love after some years becoz of family life and stress the up keep each other, and some of them are smart enough to go for therapy when they realized that their relationship is going down hill. They do it becoz BOTH are committed to making a marriage work..<br><br>But a a wooing couple like yourself and your dearest, you may need to give him time to understand what he really wants in life. Some young guys thought they had it all and girls are easy in the pub. So they take their closest person that love them so much for granted.<br><br>You can either psycho yourself to continue to be with him or you can begin to open your life and start seing other people. Some times what a person need is just some new perspective.<br><br>A baby elephant had it's legs chained a tree trunk, he tried to pull pull pull, but still cannot escape, as times goes by, the elephant grew up big and strong and yet he's still chained to the tree. what the elephant does not know is that he can break the chain now becoz it had grown much stronger in these years. ....sadly it didn't ..... the elepgnat had been taught that he couldn't... it didn't learn a new pattern , chained to the trees all these years and it does not even know what it is capable of.<br><br>The elephant thinks that there's no escape.<br>he should be treated this way and no other way.<br><br>Think about it, is your BF suppose to treat you in this way.<br>Letting go someone you love is tough on you, but hanging on to some one who doesn't love you any more is tough on BOTH of you.<br><br>Just my two cents. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

He ranks his friends above you, and treat you as a 'second choice'. He is obviously not ready for a relationship.<br><br>This may sound cruel, but it would do you good to forget him and get another boyfriend.<br><br>More likely he needs time to grow up.~</div>
