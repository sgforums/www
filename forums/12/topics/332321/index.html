              <p>Hi all.</p>
              <p>I didn't want to use a clone account even though I know many of my friends, and those that dislike me surf SGF, cause I'm really sincere in changing myself.</p>
              <p>I had an arguement with my best friend. And he asked me to change, first he said I should ask myself what to change and when I ask him, he said a whole lot of hurting words that are crude and harsh.</p>
              <p>I told him I feel offended and I'm really sincere in changing but can would you mind using a less harsh tone? He said, this is the way he is if I don't like it than we be normal friends.</p>
              <p>I told him, <em>"hey I'm really sincere in changing, but please don't use so crude words can?"</em> </p>
              <p>I don't understand which part of my sentence sounds offensive and maybe it's due to him not feeling well today, but his way of speaking just gives me the feeling that he's venting out whatever unhappiness he has in him.</p>
              <p>And one bad habit of mine is I like to say I love my friends alot, like I &lt;3 xxx ah, etc etc and he says he hate that about me. He finds me ah gua-ish and being sissylike. Ok, is that something I should change too?</p>
              <p>I don't know what to do now, my life's is in a big mess and now not having my best friend to lend his hand when I need support is something.. demoralising for me..</p>
              <p>Can anyone advice me what to do please, or recommand some counselling centres that I can go for that is hopefully free.. I don't have alot of money to spare also.. And lastly is it very sissy to ask for help online.. I rarely see guys ask about friendship but to me I treasure friendship more than relationship cos they'll almost always last.. But this already make me start to lose faith in life and I'm really depress right now.. Just now almost want to take the razor from my cupboard but my mom saw me..</p>
              <p>Thanks..</p>

              <p>Hello daigooro</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">when god gives you lemon, you find an apple and move on.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">when friends ask you to change, change your underwear and find a new friend.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Hey man, I guess you are young and growing slowly in maturity.  Maybe, slower than most of them of your age. It is okay to feel the way you do...cherishing friendship.  But don't push your luck or you will get the shove.</span></p>
              <p>You might be confused about your sexual inclination, liking your best friend to the extreme.  It is still okay.  It does not matter whether you are straight or gay or bi.  Just don't be a sissy or ah kuah. </p>
              <p>If you have a tight budget, I suggest that you can seek help from any doctor from polyclinic who will refer you to a psychologist for counselling session.  Alternatively, contact any Family Service Centres in Singapore which can also help you to foster better ties with family members and friends!</p>

              <p>My sentiments somewhat.</p>
              <p>It's important to treasure friendships.</p>
              <p>And equally important to treasure yourself.</p>
              <p>It's a delicate balance TS needs to mull over, perhaps with the help of counselling.</p>

              <p>Hi all.</p>
              <p>I didn't want to use a clone account even though I know many of
              my friends, and those that dislike me surf SGF, cause I'm really
              sincere in changing myself.</p>
              <p>I had an arguement with my best friend. And he asked me to
              change, first he said I should ask myself what to change and when I
              ask him, he said a whole lot of hurting words that are crude and
              harsh.</p>
              <p>I told him I feel offended and I'm really sincere in changing
              but can would you mind using a less harsh tone? He said, this is
              the way he is if I don't like it than we be normal friends.</p>
              <p>I told him, <em>"hey I'm really sincere in changing, but please
              don't use so crude words can?"</em> </p>
              <p>I don't understand which part of my sentence sounds offensive
              and maybe it's due to him not feeling well today, but his way of
              speaking just gives me the feeling that he's venting out whatever
              unhappiness he has in him.</p>
              <p>And one bad habit of mine is I like to say I love my friends
              alot, like I &lt;3 xxx ah, etc etc and he says he hate that about
              me. He finds me ah gua-ish and being sissylike. Ok, is that
              something I should change too?</p>
              <p>I don't know what to do now, my life's is in a big mess and now
              not having my best friend to lend his hand when I need support is
              something.. demoralising for me..</p>
              <p>Can anyone advice me what to do please, or recommand some
              counselling centres that I can go for that is hopefully free.. I
              don't have alot of money to spare also.. And lastly is it very
              sissy to ask for help online.. I rarely see guys ask about
              friendship but to me I treasure friendship more than relationship

              <p>to be urself.. or to be someone everyone likes.  mmm..
                                      tough one. ;p</p>
              <p>So what if u are a bit.. sissy.. lol... i find sissy guys one of
                                      the more genuine helpful nice guys out there. You sound like a more
                                      sensitive kinda guy. heh..</p>
              <p>When you not sure , u ask. Its always good to ask if u are not
                                      sure.If ur friend is genuinely ur good friend, he will accept you
                                      for who you are and instead be understanding and maybe only
                                      intervene on ur actions if its a serious threat to the well being
                                      of yourself and/or ur friend. I dont believe in forcing another to
                                      change when his character and how he is, is still at a tolerable
                                      level and you are unique in ur own way.</p>
              <p>The only 'bad habit' i see from ur explainatory first post is
                                      that of ur friend... lol.... and u call  him ur good friend ?
                                      Even my good friend who bust my balls and disses me knows when to
                                      give good advice and when to be Mr Vain.</p>
              <p>Razoring urself is just dumb...  lol... might as well go
                                      get tattoos right ? At least they look good. heh heh.</p>

              <p>I didn't steal his GF, but there's one time he liked a girl and I think the girl wasn't suitable for him and he wanted to wait for a long time to change the girl's mindset.

              <p>I really don't know. And today in the morning I called him, he says i'm a very crafty person that thinks very fast and almost always have a backup plan. So this type of friend will backstab u in the future and hence he don't really care if he have me as a friend ornot..</p>
