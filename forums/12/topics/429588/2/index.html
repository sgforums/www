When it comes to ingenuity and creation, the creation itself is a reward. Money in fact only appears to serve as an incentive for repetitive, mundane actions.</span></p>
              <p>Yes, they are successful in their own rights. But they were not motivated by money. You don't have to be exceptionally rich to be successful.</p>
              <p>On topic, I'd say go for it mate. Old age is a perception, the moment you think you're old, you act old, and then you're very old indeed. do what you like, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. I'm sure you'd do something great from there.</p>

              <p><br>Hi Dr Language,</p>
              <p>Many thanks for sharing. Yes I read about Julia Child. And I remember she didn't start cooking until she was at the age of 40s. I agreed to certain extend that age is a total discrimination in asia society. In Singapore, I see many kind of people like Angle7030..</p>
              <p>Currently I am into wine industry, and have decided to take up part time culinary course. Even if I could not enter culinary career, but at least I still enjoy the pleasure of cooking, and add pleasure to people I love:)</p>

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>I am with you. In life, who doesn’t want to be successful?? The thing is to know the difference in success and dream. My dream is to work in a wine industry. Now I got the chance. I had fulfilled my dream:) But that doesn't means that I am a successful person. I have friends who are very successful in business, one of my friend attended to many entrepreneurship seminars held by successful people and make it by networking. But that does not mean it was her dream to be successful in the first place. She don't love what she do, yet she is successful than a lot of people. She admires people with dreams. If everyone become a successful business men or women, then who is going to do the dirty work?</span></p>

I got so angry that I start to cry at nite, then, i told myself, cannot go on like this, must show it to master that I am good, the best, the most independent and the most able. So, I am here now, owner of pubs and other businesses, and when free, i go back to taiwan to visit my master, I will kneel in front of her to repay her kindness and her true way of motivating me, she told that whenever she make remarks on me, she would go back and shed a tear herself, because for people like me, only sarcastic remarks can make me a harden and truly capable person.

              <p><br>again all the best, i hate this phrase, my master once said "No matter you make if big or small in life, just use the third hand, meaning do not cheat other, steal from other, conn other and use other to your advantages" For you can see for yourself, so many rich and well educated peoples, but their moral way of living can be worst than a road sweeper who used his sweats, blood and hard work to really earn a living.</p>
              <p>Life is a never ending learning journey, how you learn and how your adapt and evolve depend on yourself and the condition around you. If you make it, learn to return back to the society, that may end you life worthy of been here.</p>

              <p>moreover i think you'll do better than the younger ppl in your course ( if you take up the culinary course ), because you've got a goal and you'll be more motivated. you're also more mature so it'll help as you wouldn't be distracted by trival things that youngsters would be distracted by.</p>

              <p>I wanted to take up culinary course too, to be specific molecular gastronomy. But in the end i decided not to. Although i like food and to create them, but I'm rather picky with what i eat. Furthermore, I'm afraid I'll not be able to get a job after the course as this profession is on rather low demand, am i right?</p>
              <p>I think interest is not the only thing to consider when you choose a career, especially if pursuing your interest makes you a burden to others. For my case, if i remain unemployed for too long after my course, i'll be living off my parents, and that makes me a burden to them.</p>
              <p>This was what went through my mind before, hope it helps you to make a wiser decision. Nevertheless, whatever decision you make, it's your choice and you have to be prepared for any consequences that come along.</p>

              <p>At 32 culinary course is abit too Late, to be frank my cooks here start at 22 or 21 after NS, and by 32, they are chef and master of certain dishes, if they are not around, i take over, but do you know that culinary takes a long time to master, peeling and cutting potatos already takes you 2 years to master, you go for those courses for 2 years, get a dip or skill cert, you are still an apprentice, then you need another 5 years before you can stand beside a chef to prepare food for him, and all these 5 years is like a torture to you, get scold and shouted like dog, and because of lots of knifes and choppers around, in culinary, fighting is strictly a serious offence, you will be out and the whole culinary world knows about it.</p>
              <p>After 7 years, you will be 39yo, goodness, for guys, should be in the height of their career and you still chopping ginger and garlic, only if you are good, then you get to be the 5th cook all the way to 1st cook. And most 1st cook in hotel are only in their late 30s and early 40s. Only if you are good, maybe i see you get 3rd cook position at 60yo, near retirement. So please consider all these aspects.</p>

Many a time, peoples wasted alots of their time learning something that they do not really do a research on it, so end up, either give up half way or totally useless, more so for uncles and aunties in their 30s, you got not much time to learn, you need to do a Training needs analysis so called TNA before embark on any courses or training, becos, one wrong move, you got not much time to change and once failed, you get moody and no more morale to go on, so take a short course on TNA first, from there, the lecturer will teach you how to identify what you really needs, you can also contact me and ask me to teach you, terms and conditions apply</p></div>

              <p>I olso got gal at 45yo working as hostesses, but the audience will be different, the selling point will not be there, and certainly, those in 40s and still learning culinary must be final chapter of their life, no way out or had enjoyed a youth life with no education, end up chopping veges also need glasses.</p>
              <p>Do not just follow yr heart, you need to look at the situation, the economy, your age, what there hold in future, what is the faster way up and what is your final goal in life. The heart is only use for pumping blood, nothing else.</p>

              <p>A mate of mine is in his 50s, and he went back to uni and is now a doctor.</p>
              <p>My plan B is to go to cooking school in the not so distant future and I'm also past the big 3-0. But that's because I love cooking and realize I need the formal instruction to get to the next level.</p>
              <p>If you're into food and wine, cooking isn't the only option. You could train to be a sommelier, you could go into wine making - there's heaps of options.</p>
              <p>What responsibilities have you? Don't let's be reckless now, but all else being equal, if the boat ain't gonna be rocked if you make this switch, then do it like a man.</p>

              <p>Yo dude, i dun suggest culinary, too many are in it after singapore become one of the best fine restaurants around with many to come, at 32yo, you dun stand a chance, because as i said earlier, by 40+, when you finally reach a junior chef position, you may not be able to get job, because your mates who are in their early 20s or late teens when started, would had more chances, employers like young nice chef, not old ones, unless top chefs.</p>
              <p>Give yourself options, dun listen to these uncles advices, surely or most likely you will regret, the options in services is wide open, today, lounge bartending, winery and butlers are on demand and so is it in the future, and all these need mature older guy to handle, courses are available at most hotels and services academics/institution. With high intake of young chef trainees today, you will see a mushroom of them in the market when they graduated, but for bartending and winery, there are few intakes, and such course takes you overseas to expose to wine and different types of liquors, from Merlot to mexico tequila, you will learn and serve customer well, you knowledge and way of serve will delight these rich and reputated peoples, and generous tips and opportunities will be given. I myself is trained as bartending, with it, my Dad open pubs and so on, we then employ chefs who earn less than a bartenders, cos bartenders are up front service people, clients chat with them more and know them, chefs alway cook inside kitchen like a mad dog and the trainee chef alway get blame and scolded, some even give up half way.</p>

              <p>I think it's never really too late to chase your passion. At 32, you've probably got another good 30 years of economically viable life.</p>
              <p>Go for it. Got a few friends who became pilots in their 30s, early or late. Haven't you heard before: "Life starts after 30"? Haha. Gd luck.</p>
