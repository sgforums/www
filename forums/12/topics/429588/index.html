              <p><br>thanks. Still feel a little worry although Shatec replied my email enquiry that there is no age limit. Sounds like they were only interested just to make money. And seems like there is no one here does such a career switch in their 30s before</p>

              <p>Hi, what you've just shared was interesting. When you said free trial, do you mean to find a restuarant that allows me start out as a trainee? my age will a big minus then:( Sometimes I wish I am 10 years younger and at least 5 years younger.</p>
              <p>I thought Shatec is very recognised internationally. As for sunrise, I find that the course fee is on the steeper side. Shatec does have SDF aid for their students.</p>
              <p>Yes, I love wine, I started out by exploring into the world of wine although all these while I enjoyed the love for fine dining and trying out new restaurants/hawker stalls. I wanted to sign up the WSET with Shatec in the first place until I read somewhere online about the importance of fundamental in food in terms of wine pairing. But Shatec only offer up to Diploma in WSET, and that leaves me wondered what if I want to carry on to sommelier course? And I've found out that I can only study to be a Sommelier outside singapore..I know the International Sommelier Guild is very popular in Canada. But is this job as demanding as a cook/chef? Which is harder to study for you?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Economically speaking, with the influx of high class restaurant booming here, cooks and culinary suddenly become a course that gain respect and much people wanted to gain entry. But frankly, few can make it, if you look at the nos of them training now, it will be very competitive in near future, and also you need to compete with foreign cook or culinary masters coming in. So, i think is not wise to do culinary, why not try be a bartender, in hot demand now.</p></div>
