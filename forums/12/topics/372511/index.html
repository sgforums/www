              <p><br>It is perfectly normal for a wife to be fired up at such events. The fault of a person having an affair does not lies on the other party. No one will want the their significant other to cheat on them outside their relationship.</p>
              <p>Like most of the forumers had commented on the other threads, you should know what the road would leads eventually. I know that during the relationship, of course the father of your child would coax you and I understand that you would not think rational enough to see the situation as a by stander that it is only a affair as no divorce was filed even though there was like repeated breaks and pact in this relationship.</p>
              <p>Don't be confuse, you are not alone in the world and you still need to be strong and take care of your new born child.</p>

              <p>Relax, girl.</p>
              <p>What's done is done. Too late for anything. You had been living in a dream, deluded yourself that your bf will magically acknowledge you and your kid, divorce his wife and marry you.</p>
              <p>That's the stuff of taiwanese and korean movies. It sure is a rude shock to your young immatured mind. I really and sincerly wish your awakening would be gentle, but reality is often harsh, painfull and hard to bear.</p>
              <p>Still, you must face up to the truth. I can feel your pain, but there is nothing that I can do that can give you consolation....</p>
              <p>You may feel alone, and perhaps with feelings of being an outcaste, labelled by some uncaring friends or relatives, for what you did, knowingly or unknowingly is deeply wrong. People are quick to judge.</p>
              <p>But that is all they can do - judge. You still have control over your life, for it's your gift and right to live as you choose to. It's already too late for abortion, not that I would reccomend it any way. Choose wisely, for now you have a precious life in your hands.</p>
              <p>You are not alone, for there are single mothers in existance, even in Spore, and are respected for the courage and love for their child had shown. You too, can be like one of them.</p>
              <p>There are events that you can no longer control. Walk away. You may be seeking vengence, but do not do it. Retribution is sure in life, and come in many forms. I know, and had experienced it. No human is immune to it. So too will your bf.</p>
              <p>These are events beyond your mortal control, best leave it, walk away, and focus on living your life now, with a precious child on the way. These are events that you can still control, and we as a society will help you, as long as you dont give up on yourself and more important, your innocent child.</p>
              <p>Wipe that tear away and make it your last drop. Have a good sleep and face the new day, with courage and not fear, for you are in reality, not alone. We are Singaporeans, know what is pain and fear, but that had never gotten us down, only made us more resilient, strong and courageous to live for a better tomorrow. You are one of us, through the blood of your forefathers.</p>

              <p>Surely you are not expecting his wife to open her arms and embrace you into her family , are you ?</p>
              <p>She is afraid of the DNA test, because she is afraid of finding out the truth.</p>
              <p>As a woman, she needs to put up a brave front for everyone else to see.</p>
              <p>Deep inside, she has fears just like any human beings.</p>
              <p>Because of one man's selfish act, so many lives goes into disarray.</p>

              <p>Remember always, the child you are carrying in your womb is a life, precious and innocent.</p>
              <p>The child did not asked to be born, but it was a blessing to you, even though you may think otherwise now. Not many are even capable of bearing a child, or those in your situation, would even consider bearing it for so long.</p>
              <p>The child is innocent, and is dependant on you for sustenance. Weak, tiny, but breathing, he/she needs you even more now, for a chance to live, for your protection against the elements.</p>
              <p>No matter what happens, he/she is innocent. The child has done no wrong, and is not a burden to you, only because he/she is weak,uncomprehending, knows nothing of our world. You must protect her/him till he/she can fend for herself.</p>
              <p>The child needs you. Please do not deny her/him of love and concern, the way you had been denied by your bf. You know how it feels, how more will your baby feel, if left abandoned and alone?</p>
              <p>The child is innocent and is yours too, a part of you lives in him/her. You are not alone in being a single mother. Pragmatism dictates the necessity for money, but as long as you live within a civilised society such as ours, with pillars of family, relatives and friends for support as well as your own brains, hands and legs, you need not beg and are fully capable of earning money to support yourself and child.</p>
              <p>You innocent baby within you needs you now, more than ever. Be strong, for your baby and yourself,just as the rest of us have to be, for no one amongst us have no problems or find life a bed of roses daily. We all can overcome our woes, and a better tomorrow exists.</p>
              <p>Your greatest reward is not bags of gold, for it only brings more problems and worries than comfort. Your greatest reward is the shining pure joy from her eyes when she sees you, the sweet smile that will radiate from her/his mouth as his/her tiny hands reaches out to hug you, all unconditional a love no other human can give or you can ever hope to experience in life. He/she is your child.</p>
