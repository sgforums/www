              <p><strong>You</strong> ...what will u do if  you are living in a world that has been pulled over yr eyes to blind u from the truth. The pressure from family to settle down as a successful man in life, rising cost of living, artificial inflation, debt, mortgage loan , everything orchestrated artificially by someone and u are not in control of your life. You ask yourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?</p>
              <p>if tomorrow u woke up, if not already woken up to the fact that everything around is an illusion, and the only thing that is real is u.</p>
              <p> you look around and what do you see? Businessmen, Teachers, Lawyers, Carpenters...the very minds of the people you're trying to save. .  most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so innerred, so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will that they will fight to protect it.The question is, How will u fight back?</p>

              <p>Let me summarise your problems.</p>
              <p>-First, you have a very different case from others. Others are merely worried that the things and people around them are fakes, and that they are the only existing one. You think the people around you do exist, but they are of a typical illusion and robot-like creatures. You also fear that the world is artifically orchestrated over your eyes, blinding you from the truth. Last, you are worried that you are not the one in control of your life.</p>
              <p>Here are a few solutions to test yourself.</p>
              <p>-When a human thinks that the people around them are fake, it is probably because they do not interact much with other humans. This causes a weird feeling, as humans behave the same way. You don't talk to me, I don't talk you(strangers). Thus, because you don't interact with them, you feel that they are fake and inerred for their simillar behaviour, and also gives you the impression that they are robots. Though they are not.</p>
              <p>-Are you sure you are the only existing one? If the world was artifically orchestrated over your eyes, Are you sure you ARE the one who did it? If it was you, how could you not have any knowledge of it? Obviously it is another person who did it IF your life was an illusion. Okay, back to the topic. So, you think are the only existing one, but that is not true. Once again, you have not much interaction with what is happening around the world. Go look at those who are suffering of pain, hunger, and disease. They don't even have much time to think whethere things are real or fake. You have too much time and too little interaction with what is going on. Go read the news daily, se those who are suffering, and you will feel better.</p>
              <p>-You are not the one in control of your life? Go, go poke yourself with a needle. Jump down the building. Do any unseen forces stop you from doing so? NO. You have freewill. You do what you want to do and no one is going to stop you, unless it is something illegal and the law will stop you. This shows you are the one in control of your life.</p>
              <p>You really should not spend too much time at home thinking about such things. In fact, you are not the only person who has this feeling. Ever since man existed, they had such fears due to their insecurity. And obviously, the richer they were, the happier they were, they were scared that the things around them are fake. This is just what the human brains like to do. Cause insecurity. Go out, have fun, make more friends. You will find deeper meanings into life. :D</p>
