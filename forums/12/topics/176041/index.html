            <div class='col-md body'>There's this girl who was my junior in school/student leaders/NPCC. She's in Sec 3 now, and I've left school (Sec 4 in 2005, O Level). She's damned cute, and damned sporty, and she smiles all the time (I really mean all the time). Her smile really<br><br>Though I was the Chief Drill Instructor in my unit, I volunteered to take her squad since there was a lack of standard in the junior squads. Over the past two years I've known her, she's laughed the loudest at even the silliest stuff I say, and we've developed a very good friendship and I feel that I want to take things to the next level.<br><br>Okay, things were going well. I went back to school for the Sec 1 Orientation Camp campfire and nightwalk, but wasn't allowed to stay longer than that. I went for a midnight movie with some friends, and at 2AM she sms-ed me a "where are you?" and asked me to go back to school, but I didn't want to climb over the gate since it would be breaking the law.<br><br>After that, I constantly returned to school every week for NPCC parades, though I'm not a Cadet Inspector. She also sms-es me and calls me the day before with "coming tomorrow?", "there's parade tomorrow", and "coming today?".<br><br>BUT<br><br>The complication sets in. This girl, who is also Sec 3, her friend, and quite close to me in a brother-sister sense, tells me that there's a guy (Sec 4) wooing her and she kinda likes that guy. What's worse, I found out that he is the person all the senior student leaders hate for acting like a big shot, and cheating on one of the senior girls once.<br><br>I seriously didn't know what to do when my friend's sister (also Sec 3), told me that they are together. I still carry on with life normally but the question still pops into my mind constantly. "WHAT TO DO?"<br><br>I invited her to my chalet BBQ which is on the weekend before Valentine's Day, and my initial plan was to propose to her while sending her home after that. Don't know if I should carry on with this plan, I don't want her to get cheated on by this guy. I feel that I can give her a better sense of security than him (he's the type who always hangs out with mats, smoke with them..etc etc)<br><br>Which brings us back to the topic title...<br><br>What should I do?</div>

She's in Sec 3 now, and I've left school (Sec 4 in 2005, O Level). She's damned cute, and damned sporty, and she smiles all the time (I really mean all the time). Her smile really<br><br>Though I was the Chief Drill Instructor in my unit, I volunteered to take her squad since there was a lack of standard in the junior squads. Over the past two years I've known her, she's laughed the loudest at even the silliest stuff I say, and we've developed a very good friendship and I feel that I want to take things to the next level.<br><br>Okay, things were going well. I went back to school for the Sec 1 Orientation Camp campfire and nightwalk, but wasn't allowed to stay longer than that. I went for a midnight movie with some friends, and at 2AM she sms-ed me a "where are you?" and asked me to go back to school, but I didn't want to climb over the gate since it would be breaking the law.<br><br>After that, I constantly returned to school every week for NPCC parades, though I'm not a Cadet Inspector. She also sms-es me and calls me the day before with "coming tomorrow?", "there's parade tomorrow", and "coming today?".<br><br>BUT<br><br>The complication sets in. This girl, who is also Sec 3, her friend, and quite close to me in a brother-sister sense, tells me that there's a guy (Sec 4) wooing her and she kinda likes that guy. What's worse, I found out that he is the person all the senior student leaders hate for acting like a big shot, and cheating on one of the senior girls once.<br><br>I seriously didn't know what to do when my friend's sister (also Sec 3), told me that they are together. I still carry on with life normally but the question still pops into my mind constantly. "WHAT TO DO?"<br><br>I invited her to my chalet BBQ which is on the weekend before Valentine's Day, and my initial plan was to propose to her while sending her home after that. Don't know if I should carry on with this plan, I don't want her to get cheated on by this guy. I feel that I can give her a better sense of security than him (he's the type who always hangs out with mats, smoke with them..etc etc)<br><br>Which brings us back to the topic title...<br><br>What should I do?</div></blockquote><span style="color: violet;">the thing is u will lose!
