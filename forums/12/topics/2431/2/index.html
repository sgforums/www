Remember the last time how you wish things would go back to normal and you be given a CHANCE again...? WELL... Your 'wound' and 'bleeding' are HEALED though you may not see it... (Of course, you're just a mortal..??) But CHERISH your relationship okay...? Cherish HER... If she's REALLY what you want.... You won't know when GOD would decide to YAWN and kick you on your ass!!! You might think that you DESERVES it then... But I'm telling you now SHE DON'T.....<br>If you decides to go back to her and LOVE HER today...
