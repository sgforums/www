Also, certain things are in line with your past as well as recent behaviour. It's easy to comment because of the situation involved.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Soul_winner has already posted it on an open forum, so you cannot stop people commenting on it. </span>I can understand why you would want this to be kept quiet.<br><br>Besides, I think soulwinner decided to come forth on a public forum about the kind of person you are because you have not been honest and forthcoming in your conversations with him As much as GHoST_18 has a point in saying you owe soulwinner an explanation and an apology, your very posts here show how unaplogetic as well. I dare say you've not made an apology or attempts at amends even to soulwinner directly off this forum.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Soulwinner has merely highlighted the kind of person you are, </span>I believe he would not have been so angry to post in a public forum had you been more responsible and at the very least apologise for not turning up for a job. You have even come up with excuses and turned the blame on soulwinner. Shame on you really. 17 yr old yet you are still acting as if you were till a primary school kid. Past postings by yourself have also shown you are very full of yourself too and are not one to take rebuke well, unless maybe by your own parents.<br><br>GHoST_18 has a point, but I believe <span style="color: red;">you yourself have not done your part in solving this privately</span> hence soulwinner's frustration and anger at you. Posting on a public forum may not seem right to certain people, but it does not absolve you from the wrong you have done either. As certainly you still do not realise what you have done, or rather are not mature enough to take responsibility for it. Choosing to push the blame elsewhere, even to people who offered you a job in the first place.<br><br><span style="color: red;">What soulwinner now has done is to warn the online community</span> or at least, people on sgforums itself <span style="color: red;">the kind of integrity you have as a person</span>. That is after repeated attempts by him to resolve it with you privately. And your replies right now go very far in proving the kind of person you are.<br><br>I admit I am basing on soulwinner's posts, but he has no reason now to slander you would he?<span style="color: red;"> Are you trying to say none of this happened? </span>That you didn't fail to turn up for a job as promised? Did you even apologise for not turning up? I would have given you benefit of the doubt but your reply below shows how unapologetic you are towards the whole incident.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ghimpheng:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: green;">you know why i never come or not ?<br><br>i keep asking you about the job scope and u keep reluctant to tell me what izzit about<br><br>so i tot it might be some illegal activity so i never go<br><br>i asked you about the job scope about 5 times</span></div></blockquote>Most of us here were not directly involved, but it's quite obvious here whether this is <span style="color: red;">a legitimate reason or simply an excuse</span>. You know yourself which one it is. Be honest and take responsibility Ghimpheng.<br><br>Even for a 17 yr old, your lack of maturity and sense of responsibility is appalling. What really disgusts me is even after all this, you are arrogant enough to think that you are in the right to boss people around. You think the world owes you a living?</div>
