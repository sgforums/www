Moreover, he'll be entering NS in about a year from now at least, so the job thing won't affect him. More importantly, it's about him realising what he has done. He is just running away now and avoiding responsibility.<br><br>He even blamed soulwinner who was the one giving him a chance to work in the first place. The very least he could do was be apologetic. But he is just so full of himself that he twists things around to blame soulwinner.<br><br>I'm sorry, but I just find it's too much from anyone, let alone a 17yr old kid. At least hopefully with some rebuke he may still learn.<br><br>Just my opinion, but no need to make life difficult for him, just make sure he knows he's in the wrong and why. Insteading of pushing the blame to others.</div>
