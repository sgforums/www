              <p>My mum and dad are currently in the process of divorce. Cuz my dad refused to fulfill his duties as a husband &amp; father. About 12 years ago, he lost his job and has not work since then. He refused to care for the family and leave all the expenses to my mum to take care. My mum has been enduring it for so long till she cant take it anymore.</p>
              <p>As a wife, she has every right to claim maintenance fees from my dad. But whats there to claim if my dad had been jobless for more than a decade and no savings? The only funds he has is his CPF. Will my mum be able to claim full ownership for their matrimonial flat from my dad as a compensation since he has no money at all? Now their divorce process is heading towards the Meditation stage which is coming on next February.</p>

In fact, the laws will relook into why your mom married him, and yet borne you. So, why then should your Dad gives your mom his assets when the cause of divorce is just due to your dad laziness.</p>

              <p>My mum and dad are currently in the process of divorce. Cuz my dad refused to fulfill his duties as a husband &amp; father. Abou<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">t 12 years ago, he lost his job and has not work since then.</span></strong> He refused to care for the family and leave all the expenses to my mum to take care. My mum has been enduring it for so long till she cant take it anymore.</p>
              <p>As a wife, she has every right to claim maintenance fees from my dad. But whats there to claim if my dad had been jobless for more than a decade and no savings? The only funds he has is his CPF. Will my mum be able to claim full ownership for their matrimonial flat from my dad as a compensation since he has no money at all? Now their divorce process is heading towards the Meditation stage which is coming on next February.</p>
