              <p>People, my mum has many reasons for taking action against my dad. Besides being lazy and refused to look for job to support the family, he has always been aggressive towards my mum and sis. He never talks to us nicely. He has serious attitude problem. No one can tell him what he did is wrong, he will shout and stomp to his room and slammed the door. No matter how nice we try talking to him, it doesnt help. He only want things his way no matter what. Now that he is jobless and no money, he tends to ask neighbours, relatives for money. Any amount of money we gave him is never enough as he wil use it to buy cigarettes, lottery ticket. He will used up all money fast and ask for more. We had given him so much money and so many chances to change but he never change. So my mum go to take action. Tell me, which woman would want to stay in a marriage with that kinda man?</p>
              <p>He has always been mentally abusive. Early this year, he even tried to hit my sis with 3 different weapons. So bad that he was arrested and a PPO soon followed. Despite all that, he still in denial. He thinks he has done nothing wrong. Even after several counselling sessions and court hearing, he still never change and was never remorseful. Myself, my mum and my sis are his only hope for a shelter and food and yet he has the nerve to act like this. Well, we all dont need to depend on him to survive, its him who needed us.</p>
              <p>In my whole 30 years of my life, he has never been a good father or even carry out his duties as a man, a husband &amp; a father. He is a real disgrace to all the men. So much for all the enduring we had gone through, wasnt worth at all.</p>

              <p>There is no need to justify yourself to some of these ignorant forumers here. Most of them are just teenagers pretending to be adults here.</p>
              <p>We all know there are good fathers and there are bad fathers.</p>
              <p>Good fathers derserve all our respects , bad fathers always die a lonely death.</p>
              <p>Your father is simply a human <strong>parasite</strong> . These kind of people know no shame at all.They will continue leeching off whoever lets him do so.</p>
              <p>Enable his behavior no more.</p>

              <p>I agree with you Jojo. what happened in their marriage is not going through thick and thin, its like what you said, freeloading and my dad is a human leech that sucks our blood till dry.</p>
              <p>my mum already did her part like cooking, household chores and even work to support the family when my dad lost his job. even till now she has problems walking, he didnt even bother to help out with anything. he act as if its not his problems. so tell me why should my mum to stay with someone who's a complete zero?</p>
              <p>none of us wants to do this but he had pushed us to the edge. based on what happened to my mum, i always advice my lady friends to take action should their husbands shirk their responsibilities. cuz only the women themselves can do something about it if no one else can since its their own marriage.</p>
