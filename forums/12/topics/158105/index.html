            <div class='col-md body'>Dear All,<br><br>It's been a long time since I've posted something on relationships, &amp; how to keep the romance &amp; excitement after the initial excitement has waned <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I was just speaking to a dear friend (you know who you are  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) yesterday, &amp; I thought I'd also share this with the others here.  1 of the reasons my guy &amp; I have Not had that many arguments, is because we've tried, as far as possible, to make our differences work for the relationship &amp; Not against it.  In short, we've tried to be a team.<br><br>We recognise that each person has different qualities, &amp; we can't expect the other to be like us, &amp; to be telepathic.  So my guy can't come up with exciting, imaginative plans for our weekends.  I do it, &amp; discuss with him.  He gets involved &amp; very excited.  But when it comes to preparation of the junk food we need, let's say, for a movie night, he's the 1 who's handy with the knife (I take hours to cut a pepper), so he does it.  He doesn't expect me to cut stuff, &amp; neither do I expect him to come up with plans on a regular basis.  We just can't do that.  Basically, we accept each other's deficiencies, &amp; make the other good points work for us.<br><br>Granted, despite all that, we sometimes have our disagreements (as any couple will, I'd be lying if I say we don't have any at all), the fact is that we don't allow the nitty gritty details distort our vision of the big picture.  We've agreed to work as a team, &amp; so far, we've been having fun being a team : )<br><br>To those who wonder what my point is, the point is, there's No point.  My posts are to help those who have problems with their relationships, or those who're looking for ways to add something fresh to their love.  I'm only sharing what has worked for us, how being a team has kept us feeling happy : )<br><br>I've talked too much again, blah blah blah.  I hope my post has helped some people : )  Till next time, tou-loose!<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br></div>
