Yup... Probably not gonna work quite well or easy as you've suggested...<br><br>This one works LARGELY on 'FRIEND FACTOR'... And YET, at the same time if you really want anything to happen at all.. You'll need to BALANCE it off with your affection...<br><br>Romance and patience dominate. Have to make her feel very comfortably into you. Have to let her feel that you're one whom she can rely on (in certain aspects.. Don't mean that you'll have to be a 'superman'...)</div>

You are attracted to Taurus as well is because both ruling planet belongs to Venus, plus the very fact your Moon lies in Taurus. You have very strong placing for Venus in sign of Pisces: influencing you to be a dreamer, poetic and person who crave and deliver romance. Emotional, sensitive and highly psychic, but when disappointment in love comes, you have tendency to retreat and feel disillusioned. Likely to be wounded when trying to understand love - in 12th house: you have tendency to give secrecy to your emotional life and tendency to seek solitude.<br><br>In simple: what you really feel, you might not express. A small however is that your Sun and Mercury stays in Gemini in 11th house - the candidate would know about this hidden emotion first is likely a friend. This will probably change when you get married. Pluto lies in 7th house, learn this: <strong>He who loses himself shall find himself.</strong> Don't ask me explain. When the time comes, you will probably know what I am talking about.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> But you do have a guardian angel watching over you and you may not know.<br><br>Opposite Mars in 6th house reveals that you that you have to learn cooperation and compromise. May have to suffer through disloyalty and unfaithfulness of others. Temperment swings between very loving and very annoyed and irritated periodically (depending on planets transist).<br><br>Any Leo Ex-gf before? Anyway you have up to three potential relationship before marriage. Please note: potential means potential - freewill works here. You can chose to reject or accept them. Afterall, CloUdiSm Remix under first law of love states: it is we who choses our partner, not the other way around.<br><br>P.S: Even I didn't see you before, you should be quite decent looking.
