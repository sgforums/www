From then you can even ask her out 1 v 1 easier and better.. Dun hint her anything yet.. cos you might not know how will she react if she knows that you like her..

"Feed-abit theory". When you know how she feels towards you.. and you are gurantee that you can make her your gf.. that's when you pop the questions.. think of some innovative of asking.. that wont make her feel embrassed or awkward..

            <div class='col-md body'>yea and has been said, patience is the name of the game. to help the process do show her a bit more attention, like smsing and stuff and chatting a little before and after tuition class, but nothing that gets too intrusive or forthcoming which will be irritating to her. take it easy - coolness is attractive! girls always like to go for guys who are a bit unattainable.</div>
