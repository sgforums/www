I'm not freaking you out, but I challenge you to find a way to win the girl's heart always well as her mother's worry. Like I say, her mother knows you know and has not rejected you totally, so you're actually at an advantage position than any other competitors if there is. The future is just about your determination, your effort, you hard work, your foresight, and you planning.<br><br>sounds like a lot of pressure right?? Well, I guess you want her to have a good life too right??<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)
