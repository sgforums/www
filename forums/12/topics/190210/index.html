You can also accept her behaviour. But I doubt you want to do this lopng term.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi.<br><br>I think the best is too have a heart-to-heart talk with her. From wad u're saying, she does indeed, sound like a demanding and possessive galfren. In my opinion, I think that it's becos of her previous failed relationship. She has since lost her confidence in relationship.<br><br>Try to gain her confidence back. I'm not telling u to do stuppid things like "I'll kill myself to show u my love!" or "Let me cut my wrist for u!". 18 years old and she's schooling eh? Maybe u can walk her home after school. Find a cosy spot to sit where there're not many people around(for privacy reasons). Chat with her to find out wad's happening in school.<br><br>Dun purposely avoid the places with gals. Bring her along. Den in front of those that u noe, sing her praises (not sweet-talk mind u!). Tell everyone why u fell for her. Let her noe that she's important to u.<br><br>I hope my advice works. All the best to u!<br><br>(p.s DO NOT use words like "break" or "don't care" during conversation. Some gals get agitated upon hearing)<br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey there.. She's just feeling insecure, and I know it feels suffocating sometimes but, always always remember don't get your emotions get the better of you at that particular moment of time. We guys must have a lot a lot of patience in moments like this. Look at it in another way, she did all that because she loves you a lot thats why. 2 separate individuals are bound to have conflicts and misunderstandings but the very very bottom line is that both of you love each other deeply. Knowing that, the relationship is worth it. Throughout the relationship, must give and take and also learn to adapt to each other lah.<br>What you are going through, some of it is very similar to mine. The not liking to talk on the phone, the insecurities of other girls, and so on. But hey, it's 44 months for us this Sunday and it's still going strong. So take your time to think about it but don't make a regretful decision. You love her a lot, and she loves you too. That's all that matters...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

This 'retribution' is an implanted fear mechanism that is coaxing her to keep an emotional distance away from you. Probably because of her existing love for you Â– every time when she finds herself becoming emotionally intimate/close to you, this fear is triggered and immediately, some false contexts are taken from reality and justify her self-induced melodrama.<br><br>These are illusions spawn to entertain her twisted emotional mindset.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It's beyond logics - it's an emotional defect.</strong></span><br><br>You can probably throw what you got at her and pacify her soul momentarily, but give her few days; she would probably revert back to that original mindset because Venus is afflicted. The beauty of Love has been warped to a form of physical possession and bondage.<br><br>MC suggested accepting it - my take is that, you are just suppressing yourself until implosion occurs. And it will definitely occur if things continue along this direction. I am pretty sure that she would probably remain the same, until the advent of some drastic event/s. It's MORE than just changing; itÂ’s about shaping a mindset.... and to alter someone's mindset is an incredibly daunting feat.<br><br>If you want to influence someone's mindset, you got to enter her spirit and nurse whatever injury that is fuelling that negativity. Although I hate to say it, but sometimes, aberrant mind games coupled with rhetoric can do wonders for people like her. Because she has made herself a protagonist of a tearful tale, you can go along that 'plot'... then subconsciously seize that position of a 'director' and control that flow of scenarios, thoughts and feelings that is incorporated into her belief.<br><br>Her self-made prophesy is as powerful as an impervious fortress. Years of depressing, sick and negative thoughts has conjured millions of ' undead warriors' that would take years to decimate and breach through. Some people remain this way for eternity, because nobody could lead a successful siege and win. And when they failed... they add more ranks to the 'undead warriors', making it even HARDER for the next foolhardy adventurer to attempt.<br><br>Forget about surface pacifying - go inside, explore what's wrong and heal them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

This 'retribution' is an implanted fear mechanism that is coaxing her to keep an emotional distance away from you. Probably because of her existing love for you Â– every time when she finds herself becoming emotionally intimate/close to you, this fear is triggered and immediately, some false contexts are taken from reality and justify her self-induced melodrama.<br><br>These are illusions spawn to entertain her twisted emotional mindset.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]It's beyond logics - it's an emotional defect.</span></strong><br><br>You can probably throw what you got at her and pacify her soul momentarily, but give her few days; she would probably revert back to that original mindset because Venus is afflicted. The beauty of Love has been warped to a form of physical possession and bondage.<br><br>MC suggested accepting it - my take is that, you are just suppressing yourself until implosion occurs. And it will definitely occur if things continue along this direction. I am pretty sure that she would probably remain the same, until the advent of some drastic event/s. It's MORE than just changing; itÂ’s about shaping a mindset.... and to alter someone's mindset is an incredibly daunting feat.<br><br>If you want to influence someone's mindset, you got to enter her spirit and nurse whatever injury that is fuelling that negativity. Although I hate to say it, but sometimes, aberrant mind games coupled with rhetoric can do wonders for people like her. Because she has made herself a protagonist of a tearful tale, you can go along that 'plot'... then subconsciously seize that position of a 'director' and control that flow of scenarios, thoughts and feelings that is incorporated into her belief.<br><br>Her self-made prophesy is as powerful as an impervious fortress. Years of depressing, sick and negative thoughts has conjured millions of ' undead warriors' that would take years to decimate and breach through. Some people remain this way for eternity, because nobody could lead a successful siege and win. And when they failed... they add more ranks to the 'undead warriors', making it even HARDER for the next foolhardy adventurer to attempt.<br><br>Forget about surface pacifying - go inside, explore what's wrong and heal them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers       [/b]</blockquote>I think your post would be too CHEEM for him to truly comprehense and follow....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Which should be due mainly to her emotional baggage from her previous relationship.... A possible minor contribution to the former could be her immaturity in handling a relationship... The MAJOR further CONTRIBUTIONS should be YOU....<br><br>As much as I understand you love her... Your LOVE for her in the form of 'shielding' and 'protection' has also inevitably shielded her self-confined mindset (for more information, pls refer to Yun's reply). Her deep belief that something bad might just happen to her relationship anytime and you being the bf should have a major role to go for it... Her 'protection mindset' (known as 'delusional mana protection' in Devilism) has been serving her well for till today... And you have also indirectly turned 'slave' to her mindset (the 'protector' of her mindset and hence the one to ENHANCE her BELIEF...).. Realise by now that she has already confined herself within a narrow mindset belief, which has been further locked and protected by YOU....<br><br>The 'addictive' part of the whole picture is that she can 'magically' draws you CLOSER to her (in your attempt to protect her) which would somehow gives a 'smoothing' effect on her insecurity... If you may think of it in another way... It's really like 'drug'... A 'dose' to give her her comfort.. Leaving her wanting more... 'Dosage' often can tend to increase over time (just a matter of personal appetite for it)... In her case, it's pretty bad... And YOU as her bf takes pride in doing so... (in your perceptive, bringing her 'comfort' and 'security') Which in reality is really just an upbring of her unhealthy habit which you can no longer upkeep when her appetite is too big for you to handle... At this point if you're already feeling the 'stress' and 'unreasonable demands' within her, I can tell you this would probably be just the tip of the ice berg if things are to carry on with its current forms....<br><br>I won't quite agree with what some of the other forumites have suggested on just 'loving her' and let time tell based on the above scenerio? It'll be quite unlikely for things to just turn for the better unless there're other external factors changing the situation (no thanks to you).... On serious thoughts, the chances are things to get much worse than reasonably better due to external factor(s) would be alot higher....<br><br>Then we come to the point of your request... What should you really be doing now...? Ask yourself these... "If your gf is doing drugs, would you just give it to her to make her happy...?" Would you just deprive her of it even though it might mean that she might really HATE you for it...?<br><br>Personally, I think your FOCUS for now should be to get your relationship back on a 'healthy mode'.... Yes, I understand that (and you should understand this too) in the process and attempt of trying to turn things over in a different direction, you might just risk losing her anywhere along the line at any point.... But you'll just have to know what you want in this relationship... BOTH for her and for yourself.... Do you want it a long-term? Or you just wanna be with her for so long as you can hold her still...?<br><br>Don't make it as the problem lies on her.. To be fair it really isn't the whole picture... It's with both of you (though technically it's quite fair to say she holds the 'seed' to the issues, but that really shouldn't matter for now...).... So the ROOT of things are still the RELATIONSHIP itself... Let her UNDERSTAND that the relationship is not going healthy... And it's really quite bad for the both of you being together... That you wish to remedy this so that you can stay long term with her (only if you mean so)....<br><br>EXPLAIN the WHOLE PICTURE to her and lead her the way OUT of it... Just like the way you'll try to explain things to a person on drugs... Understand that it'll take 2 people to fully facilitates everything so that things would work...<br><br>Let her know that you REALLY wish to make her a HAPPIER PERSON... And not one living in her insecurities at this point... Worrying for every points and days to come... And seek her permissionfor you to help her walk happily out of her shadows.... To be NOT afraid of this world though failures might be around... And to stand even closer together to each other in this 'fight'.....</div>

Beside you both known each other for only 8 months, what you expect <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.  Try do things together. Develope some common interest if can. The more you try to avoid, there more will come in your way. There no need to especially avoid your friends, be open, be natural, introduce her to your friends and know her too will help.</div>
