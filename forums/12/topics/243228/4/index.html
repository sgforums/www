            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by the disguised:</div><div class="quote_body">ok, i am in a difficult situation right now.<br><br>ok lets me intro myself a bit. i am a sec 3 student studying in a neighborhood school. i didn't do very well in my sec 2 exams therefore my parents got me a tuition teacher this year in february. My parents said their friend's son also had this tutor for his o level and he passed with flying colors. Therefore they recommended them this tutor.<br><br>My tutor is a 20 hot babe studying at NUS. she's slim, sexy and hot, and will always appear in spag or racer top with miniskirt or mini shorts when giving me tuition. Therefore when i am having tuition with her in my bedroom, i can't concentrate!! coz she's so hot and its turning me on! i can't help staring at her long sexy legs and she is busty, probably about C cup, and i also can't help staring into the cleavage of hers coz she likes to dress in low cut tops. The perfume she's wearing is also very lovely.<br><br>And she has this angelic eyes with mascara, and a pretty face with makeup... a truly stunning beauty.<br><br>Tuition wise, she teaches me a-maths and triple science. She explains clearly and precisely and uses examples to explain and write down the steps by steps clearly. Therefore her teaching method is quite good, no complains.<br><br>But its her dressing that turn me on! When she's teaching, she sometimes like to sit close to me and lean forward while writing or explaining the formulas. My eyes will sub consciously wander to look at her cleavage and long sexy legs. Sometimes i even get an erection. This affects my concentration and i have to fight hard with my urges to concentrate on what she's saying.<br><br>And she'll look at me with her beautiful eyes and ask me whether i understand this that?? And it further turns me on and i have dirty thoughts about her like u know u know??? *hint hint*<br><br>and normally after tuition lessons when she leaves, i have to masturbate to release the tension. But after that i feel guilty and will bury myself in the notes and books and whatever she has taught me earlier on.<br><br>Then now i am thinking that my studies are more important and that i can't let my parents down, coz they are low income workers and i have to support them in future. But with such a sexy tutor, it makes concentration difficult. Imagine me trying to do a logarithmatic equation with a hot babe by my side, and me with a rising erection everytime i steal glances at her hot body. It's just affecting me, although she doesn't know about it, and just assumes i am really weak in my work and daydreams too much.<br><br>Therefore i wanna let my parents know i want a change of tutor. But i cant possibly tell them the real reasons!! Anyway my parents aren't home most of the time when i am having tuitions coz they work till late. So they don't know she dresses such skimpily. Anyway on the first session when she met my parents, she was in more professional dressing leh.<br><br>Its very embarassing to tell them the real reason why i wanna change tutor, and my dad might even flare up and whack me for having dirty thoughts instead of concentrating on studies and wasting his hard earned money.<br><br>but if i carry on, i am afraid the tuition lessons won't help much and i will be back to my days of lousy grades. I think i lack self control or my raging hormones are too overpowering.<br><br>So how??? help me please!! Help me think of a reason for my parents to change tutor for me or just give up on tuition and let me study on my own. but i think i will sure won't really study on my own coz i lack self control and will surely go n play basketball with my friends or pa games instead of studying.... thats what they worry and therefore the reason they get me a tutor is to make sure theres someone supervising me and telling me to do work.<br><br>so how? how to get rid of this distracting tutor? i cant make the decision on my own as my parents are strict. Sekali i give some stupid excuse and then they change tutor and end up is her friend, a hot babe, then will still end up jialat.<br><br>please help please help. thank u guys n girls. serious comments please.<br><br></div></blockquote>Why don't you just tell her directly to dress more appropriately during the tuitions?</div>
