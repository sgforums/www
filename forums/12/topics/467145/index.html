              <p>Hey guys :D</p>
              <p>Well recently I started talking to this guy and well I kind of like him but definitely not "omg-he-is-the-one" kind of like. I just kind of have some interest in him. We are both in the same cca in poly and I am two years older than him. Well I like talking to him in person because there will never be an awkward silence between us and we could keep the conversation going on and on, and this conversation, although we do not know each other very well. And okay I admit I find him not bad looking hehe!</p>
              <p>He started texting me, starting off with some doubts about school work and after that we will start chatting. When the texting conversation died he will once again ask me about some school work and once again we are talking. As the conversation progresses on, he will take a long time to reply, and now it became hours. </p>
              <p>In my own perspective he may be busy or could I have given him really short replies thus making him thinking for a long time on how to keep the conversation alive? I tried saying more things in my replies but still he did not reply faster.</p>
              <p>Well using common sense maybe he didn't want to keep talking and I didn't want to disturb him so I gave him really short replies so he could stop replying my messages reasonably. He didn't. Hours later I still do receive a text from him, a text from him on a new topic to talk about. So yeah we just kept going on like this for days. He even shared with me he is travelling the very next morning and asked if I want anything from his trip overseas.</p>
              <p>Bear in mind that we only know each other for about 4 months in total AND I am two years older than him. All of the above happened in say the 3rd month we know each other?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Oh and one more thing. I didn't add him on facebook so I don't know if he's got a girlfriend or not. But his whatsapp picture is a picture of him and a girl though. Will you guys with girlfriend treat other girls like how he treat me?</span></p>
              <p>I am realy really curious of what he thinks of me. What are your views on this? Are you as confused as me too? I need your opinions on this! Much appreciated!</p>

              <p>Of cause we are confused. Non of us are<em> </em>psychic.</p>
              <p>Everybody behaves differently and how they decided to treat others is personal</p>
              <p>It does seem like he is finding excuses to get close to you by asking for home work.</p>
              <p>However while we can try to conclude from his actions, its almost impossible for us to have an insight of his intentions.</p>
