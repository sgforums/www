So the total risk of having a child with a genetic condition where parents are first cousins is around 5-6%. Looked at another way, there is approximately a 95% chance of having an unaffected baby.<br><br>However, in societies with a tradition of first cousin marriage, and where marriages are usually contracted within the community, many couples are often more closely related than first cousins and consequently their risk may be significantly higher.<br></blockquote>'WHEN PARENTS ARE RELATIVES - CONSANGUINITY', http://www.genetics.com.au/factsheet/26.htm</div>
