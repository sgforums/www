            <div class='col-md body'>Is it me, or is it that we all do the stupidest things during sec school? I myself don't really have fond memories of my sec school years(although partly, I myself am to blame). When I got back my O-Level result, I was damn happy, because I could go JC, and knowing that most of the people I don't like are going Poly, I immediately put a JC as my 1st choice. I won't say its my best 2 years of my life, but I definitely enjoyed it more than my sec school days.<br><br>True, the backstabbing, the competitive nature of school are still there, but at least the people i know in JC are definitely much more mature. I think its pointless to look back anymore at the "worst years of my life". We all have moved on, and no longer keep in touch. I think that's more impt than remembering the stupid things we once did to each other.</div>
