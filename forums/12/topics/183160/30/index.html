            <div class='col-md body'>heres what happened :<br>remember i told u all that im goin for an audition with my friend?<br>well. the audition is tml and we agreed to practice last fri and today...<br><br>what happened on fri :<br><br>we discovered that the chords that i figured out were too low for her.coz initially we did it over the phone so maybe thats not accurate...and after that we figured out together which the chords are quite difficult and i am not confident of playing.so she mentioned she had a friend who might be able to get the chords and so we agreed..in the meantime ill juz practice with the chords first and den we ll meet again today to see how is it...<br><br>but today..when i ask her what time she ll be coming over..she said she got something on last min.after some smses exchange,she said she don think 1 rehearsal is enough and its fine with her to go alone.<br><br>i am very disappointed and angry...why?coz if she had something last min,isnt it obvious that she had already decided not have this rehearsal today?<br>she didnt even give me a chance...coz what if ive decided to go?in which i don think i can go coz we didnt even practice today!!!<br><br>to me..i would like to see how much we can achieve today...but for her she thinks its pointless...which i feel..its really unfair to me loh.and what for i practice for these few days?if she doesn want to practice today,she could have told me earlier and i don need to waste my time practicing and figuring out the chords!!!<br><br>i might b wrong,but to me...her actions speaks,she is afaird of me dragging her down.so what is all these talks about juz goin there n have fun and don talk about dragging each other down?<br><br>she offered to pay me back..which i declined coz its not really so much about the money...in the end,she smsed me "you are very good in speaking which i admit i am not..so our smses would b endless of we continue our message"<br><br>to which i told her "im juz stating the facts,if there are no facts,i won be able to state so many points.<br><br>btw..i called her after she told me she got something on and couldn make it today.and she didnt answered her phone.<br><br>im so pissed off now.<br></div>
