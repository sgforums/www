            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps for your case, a professional counsellor would've been better able to help your friend.  And being young yourself, you didn't know better.  Now that we're older, perhaps the best advice we can give Pup is to ask him to refer the case to a counsellor.<br><br>Your friend has probably allowed herself to go into a downward spiral.  Sometimes where family is concerned, the scars run very deep.  They can even be scarred for life.  When the closest people who profess to love you can't even protect you, then who in the world will be able to give you the support you need?  Apart from your very young friends, who probably don't know any better?<br><br>Believe me, I know this, &amp; up till now, I've been very scarred, for reasons which I won't delve into here, because the problem is my own, &amp; I've handled it as best as I can.  I wish, during my younger days, someone had come to my aid too.  Somebody who's had better training to be able to give me the proper guidance I need.<br><br>The pain was unbearable, &amp; it made me go off the rails.  The reason I'm so passionate about helping this kid, is because I went through it myself!  The only difference is, I come from a relatively privileged background, &amp; STILL, the scars ran so deep.  What more somebody who has a dad physically abusing his mother &amp; the rest of the family?<br><br>True, I picked myself up in the end, &amp; I made good, but how many success stories have we heard, Pink Jie?  Too many teenagers have fallen into this detrimental cycle, Not realising that at the end of it all, the people they're hurting the most is themselves.<br><br>I'm Not saying that you're unkind.  But we can't use 1 paddle to knock off 1 whole boatload of people.  Ultimately, we may Not even be successful in helping this kid.  But at the end of the day, if I can tell myself, I've tried my best, &amp; I've reached out in my own way, then I wen xin wu kui...<br><br>*Hugs*  No hard feelings.  I know you're Not the heartless kind.  It's just that, we can't use 1 e.g. to sweep everyone into the same category.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by pinkygal76:</div><div class="quote_body">i noe the boi is young so is my frenz when she starts getting sucidial and falling into<br>lapse of depression....i know her<br>since i was 12...... she was seldom happy and i always support her being the free spirit me...<br><br>trust me...i was fill with so much compassion for her that i want all the way to help her.....<br>when i mean all the way....i mean ALL THE WAY!!! ......<br>my frenz who knows us personally can ALL vouch for that....<br><br>but abt so many years.....she is still constantly whining abt her misfortune becoz of her dsyfunctional family etc etc.......<br>and getting into sucidal mode every now and than .....things of coz worsen 6years ago...when<br>the depression and sucidal attempts come more often.....<br><br>I can almost picture pup frenz like her.......  i want to help...cant help....<br>just have to give her minimum support and let her be.......<br><br>Feow mei....its not that i dun have a heart, i hope you understand <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote></div>
