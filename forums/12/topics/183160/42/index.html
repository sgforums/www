            <div class='col-md body'>Bringing in the professionals is the correct step here, because ultimately, this person is still a kid.  He'll need someone to lean on emotionally.  I won't even talk about him, but sometimes I also need to emotionally lean on friends.  FAKE LARLING, Smudge, &amp; many of you here have been a great emotional crutch for me when I need it.<br><br>Of course, at my age, I can jump on my own 2 feet quickly.  However, my problems are small compared to this child.  Pup, being a child himself, may Not be the most suitable emotional crutch.  It's someone older, wiser, &amp; stronger, who's able to help Pup's friend.<br><br>In this boy's muddled state, I don't think he even realises what he's doing.  Too often, kids are unaware.  You're right in that he needs professional help.  But it doesn't mean that we can condemn him : )<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by NekoRin:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmm, I never said this isn't a geinuine problem mew~<br>I didn't dismiss that his attitude now stems from his family problems. What he needs now imho is professional help and perhaps a knock on his head. He needs waking up from his depression, as friends what we can do is really limited.... It's like how can we help someone whom doesn't even make the effort to help himself. He is finding a solution to settle all his problems, but his direction is wrong, what we can do is direct him towards there, not carry him over there.<br><br>Pup can continue to advise him and stay by him in his hours of need, but do take a step back when you feel he is spoon-feeding off you wor... Lending assistance does not equate to spoon-feeding.<br><br>I'm not the type that will give up on helping anyone de wor, but at least make an effort to the road of recovery, not plunging yourself deeper and deeper into the abyss</div></blockquote></div>
