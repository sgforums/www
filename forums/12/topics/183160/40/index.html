Poor yes, but those hours of playing games on consoles could be spent on studying hard or taking up odd jobs to make more money and perhaps can help out with the family expenses alittle. $10 wages for 3hours is not much if for a Macdonalds worker but a $10 can still provide some  decent dishes for the whole family. This is where I see is contradictory here, someone whom is depressed, wants a solution and willing to work hard to that compared to someone whom is depressed, wants a solution but also want to just sit there complain and complain until it happen miraculously.</div>
