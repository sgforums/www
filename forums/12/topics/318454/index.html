            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hey guys, having a tough decision deciding on which university course to accept. Currently got an offer from NUS for engineering science and SMU for accountancy/information system management. I like the NUS course more, what they are doing and stuff, but the career prospects are pretty shroudy, since its a new course. On the other hand, the SMU option gives me a pretty good foundation for my career, but I don't really like being stuck in an office doing paperwork way past midnight. Anyone care to give me some suggestions?</p></div>

I was actually quite set on NUS, just that there's some pressure at home about taking the SMU option for the money, so got kind of confused. I'm still serving my NS now so at least I still can wait and see, there's still 2 more years for me to make a switch later, so not too bad, lol.</p></div>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Hi TS, </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Coming from both engineering background (NUS) and also my accountancy qualifications, I hope I can be of help to you. Firstly, I believe your results are good enough such that both local universities accepted your choice of course. If I am not mistaken, engineering science from NUS is a newly set up course which I believed focus more on R&amp;D rather than commercial/industrialized works and training. The reason is always to go up to the higher technology chain but I always have reservations which I dun think is appropriate to disclose here. SMU accountancy and Information system (lets called it AIS) offers both an accounting background as well as IT. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I will tell you the pros and cons for you to weigh. Firstly, for AIS, you will learn both accounting and IT. I feel this is a pretty good combination because big MNCs mostly used ERP like SAP or Oracle into their financial systems. Also if you really excel in these 2 areas, you can also work in banks (cos most of their systems have to be compliant with Basel II) If I am not wrong, SMU is also offering a masters in IT in Business which targets specifically for IT people wanting to get a job in Banks. Well, under your impression, this is more for the money.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Engineering science I believe will be more hard sciences (which I believe in you’re a levels you did pretty good in science and maths). You can eventually find a niche in which you will pursue your dreams.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">When reading your current predicament, it makes me feel that that time, I wish someone would advise me on my career path. Firstly, like you, I was also passionate about engineering (especially electrical engineering) and I felt that microchip designers are the coolest engineers around. However, while I was working as an engineer, I saw a wonderfully startup company with fantastic technologies and ideas but failed terribly in their financial management and end up not a going concern. That kinda make me do finance related work such as audit. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In addition, I also have an ex-colleague who opted for an accounting degree in a private institution than pursuing an engineering degree in NTU. Currently he is working in a big 4 and the things he see and the experience he gets will be more versatile and valued. He received that advice from his friend and until now, I reminded him to thank that friend. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">In addition I have posted a thread with regard to engineering and accountancy/finance and you can read it below</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">You can PM me if you want to know more. Personally I feel your parents are right cos they want the best for you and if you have the intelligence and ability, use it to compete with the best for better paying jobs. Call me pragmatic but after going through what I have gone through, I hope you made the choice fully aware that you have been advised on.</span></p>
