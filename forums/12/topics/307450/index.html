              <p>This problem may not sound so problematic/ serious at all to some of you. But to me, especially a pet lover, it is.</p>
              <p>My sis and I have been keeping this male tortoise for quite sometime now. It was my sis's idea for wanting a pet initially. There is great bond between my sis and the tortoise especially. She loves it so much that she was willing 2 bring our tortoise to the vet twice when he was sick.. all the way till he recovered. (And he did, otherwise he'd be long gone already)</p>
              <p>But until recently, my sis is thinking of letting it go. Because she feels that our tortoise needs to live in its natural life and not under our care.</p>
              <p>She also feels our tortoise needs to develop as well as other tortoises, which aren't deprived of any needs. And under our care, she feels there are some we lack providing.</p>
              <p>But here's the dilemma. If she let go, she worries that it may not survive long since it was initially brought up by us and not naturally in the aquatic life. For we have read somewhere before that tortoises under human's care live longer. Really?</p>
              <p>So.. to let go, or not?</p>

              <p>I think there is no problem with the survival of your sis pet in SG's environment. It is just that your sis is feeling a little torn apart which is very normal.</p>
              <p>Animal's do have natural instincts and how they survive is also dependent on a lot of other factors. So if she is too worried she may try continue keeping it or if not opt to release it as suggested by another forumer at Kusu Island.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>I agree tortoise have gd animal instinct... I realeased mine at bedok reservoir, gt lots of food for it to eat...</p>
              <p>anyways, the same tortoise. Wen i brought it home, i didnt have a proper tank for it... So i placed it in a container with water of course.But the container is short, so the tortoise can climb out. That's y i but a metal grill for bbq(havent use) on top of the container so it cant climb out...</p>
              <p>My mum didnt know, so she but the bbq grill in the store.. that was the last time i saw my pet... Then suddenly, almost 6 months later, i saw it at the side of the hole that leads to the drainage system...</p>
              <p>it survived by eating NOTHING for almost 6 months! of course it looks lethargic n all... But it survived... I took care of it for 3 yrs, wen its too big i let it go at Bedok reservoir...</p>

              <p>Thanks for the responses everyone.</p>
              <p>We are aware that keeping pets is a lifelong commitment. We were very committed that we refuse to release our tortoise when he was very sick and insist on sending it to the vet. I personally was never for keeping pets, but why we got our tortoise is a different story. And of course after this one, we are never getting a pet again.</p>
              <p>But now he is big enough and we feel he deserves more than what we can provide him. Be it proper care, companionship and so on.</p>
              <p>Months ago, we noticed a painted turtle released in a pond nearby our house. Recently, we saw it in the pond, with the paint almost removed from the shell by now. And he looks much bigger. I guess this indicates that he can survive out there. And that drove my sis to think of releasing him there too.</p>
              <p>But nothing is confirmed yet. So.. keep your responses coming in. And thanks. =)</p>

              <p>if keeping it makes one guilty and yet releasing it is another form of guilt....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Weigh the issue with the pros and cons and when finally make the decision, dont look back. Do it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because any one of the two decisions u make, the tortoise will still die in the end eventually whether u care for it or not.</p>

              <p>We humans will never be able to know how the party(tortoise) truly feels about its situation. The only thing we know is ourselves.</p>
