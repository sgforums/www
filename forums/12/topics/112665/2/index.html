            <div class='col-md body'>I hope someone can give me a good advice too. I have been betrayed by my ex when I am preparing for my exam last year. She tole me that she has broken up with me before accepting that guy. I knew the whole story after her own friend told me everything that she has been meeting that guy behind my back. I cant accept it at first. Very hurt and one day, I receive a call from her parent apologising for what she has done, they told me that its not my fault that things turn out as such. She is naive, fickle minded and created alot of trouble that causes her to lose her job etc etc. I have suffered all hardship with her and this is how she treats me.<br><br>As for now, I felt quite numb but just dont have any courage or drive to chase after another whom I have known in the institution where i am studying. I have dated her out a few times. My friend told me that maybe she is giving me a chance but I really cant pick up courage to woo her. Pls give me some advice, thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's a piece of advice,<br><br>Try talking to her about your previous relationship with her just for once.<br>Never bring it up or referr to it in the future though...<br><br>This may bring you closer to her, also yyou must forgive the previous stead and move on. It is because you have not forgiven her that guilt and ghost of a love is there achoring you to the past.<br><br>Do cheer up, you were right some girls are indeed fickle minded and naive.<br>These can't be helped. They are just looking experiance in love.<br>Always treat the present as a precious thing. Never give up on Your future.<br><br>Regards<br>Sekundes AkA XEK</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks Sekundes for your advice., feeling much better and hope that one day I will forget her. I believe her parent is setting up alternative route for her if things doesnt turn out well for her and that is to remain in contact with me. Believe it or not, she is 27 this year, old enough and nobody believe that she will do this type of things to me. She has cut off all communication and thinks that she has done the right thing.<br>So unfair as she has a companion to spend time with her, enjoying with her and as for me, so empty, lonely even when I am with my friends. Really unfair.<br><br>As for icyprincess, the more committed you are in your relationship and before you know it that he is leaving you, for he has prepared to leave you, its like stabbing you deep and let you suffer alone. I have been through this and I am still struggling to move on. Aint easy to step out of this traumatic nightmare. Really need time and effort on your part to move on. One thing for sure, if you didnt do anything wrong, you have nothing to regret. Seeking for more advice and hope that all will turn out well in future.<br></div>
