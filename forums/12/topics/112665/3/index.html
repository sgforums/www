I didn't really notice him at that time because he is the shy and quiet type and prefers to keep a low profile no matter where he is. Plus I was in love with another at that time, but that guy ended up hurting me. It was at that time he began chasing me, he did a lot of things to let me know he cared, so 6 months later, I decided to give him a chance. I didn't even really care about him at that time, I guess I thought it could be a fling or something to help me get over my previous crush.<br><br>But as time passed by and we spent more and more time together, I began to fall in love with him. We continued to go out for 6 months, then he went back to Malaysia for hols last month and we continued to keep in touch thru emails almost everyday. It was during this time I realize just how much I care for him, esp when I heard abt the tsunami disaster in Malsysia and how relieved I felt when I foudn out he was alright.<br><br>So when he came back, I decided to ask how he felt about me. He said he likes me, he likes being with me and there are not many ppl whom he can be close to as close as he was to me. So he asked me to become his gf, but he told me it couldn't be a long term commitment..cos we are both going to graduate in 1 year and 1/2. Then I asked him if he loves me and he gave me that disappointing answer. At that time I was so confused, so I told him I agreed to go into a r/s with him, even tho if it is just for company, even if it won't last long.<br><br>But, I thought long and hard that night and came up with the hardest decision I have ever made in my entire life...I decided to leave him now rather than later because I know my feelings for him will keep growing if I am together with him...if I dun leave now, I will be even more hurt later...<br><br>I really dunno how he feels abt the whole thing...I am sooo confused too..<br><br>i.c.y</div>
