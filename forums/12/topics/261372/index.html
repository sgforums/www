He have to protect the gf in many ways and sometimes he may have to hid a few things from her in order not to harm the gf or  kena scream at.<br><br>e.g.<br><br>a) comics book reading<br>b) prono<br>c) smoking<br>d) going out with friends late at nite.<br><br>Slowly as time goes by the couple will have less and less to chat.<br><br>Just remember the following instructions so that you will not be in any problem with him<br><br>1) Check yourself. ask if you like this guy ? If you can tell yourself no then is alrite?<br>2) Check him, when he goes out with you does he touch you, or say anything about being his gf ? If not then is alrite.<br>3) Best solution ask him if he likes you or not. Is the best solution cos it will clear up any misunderstanding.</div>

Anyway, long time no hear from them liao... probably their work and r/s are more stabilised liao, which is a good thing.<br><br>then TS muz judge for yourself le.. wat kinda topic he talk to u about.. his work, his r/s problems or probing into your personal life and flirting with you.  </span><br><br></div></blockquote>browniebaobao so powerful~ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

If he intend to flirt,he will hide the truth from u and play around with u. Btw,did he say any mushy mushy things toward u or hinting that he likes u? If not,pls don't think too much.
