              <p>Problem is not like that......</p>
              <p>Problem is actually more multi-faceted and in multi-phases / stages.</p>
              <p>For example, working hours is often long.</p>
              <p>From long working hours, result = less time for socializing, getting to know more people, going out to places, etc.</p>
              <p>Thats one.</p>
              <p>Second is,</p>
              <p>Comparatively, housing cost is high.</p>
              <p>This results in a delay, when young couples need to save money. This problem is compounded by some regulations / rules which in my opinion further hampers marriage / act as obstacles.</p>
              <p>And there are more factors, add more as you like.</p>
              <p>* Btw, I request the mods, to please ban the obvious trolls.</p>

              <p>upon divorce, they gain more from the financial side along with the custody...the policies indeed fail to take into consideration of the obvious side effects that is not healthy in the long run for the males...and also their future sons...</p>
              <p>something has to be done..the govt knows the problem but keep grovel at the same old solution that is aggravating the male suppressed state to sustain the bitches well being when they plot on exploiting to their advantage</p>
              <p>for every credit they receive will hit back at their own future sons..which they shall soon get it...the cost-benefit is not on the men side...</p>
              <p>that has increased the fear of commitment to marriage and the known outcome of divorce for men...and the rise of singles - its really a policy problem and it could greatly help if the govt steps up to attack on the real problem than to push people to get married through useless icebreakers programs - you still need to look into the unfair divorce laws on men no matter how - its so foreseeable....</p>
              <p>FCUKPAP -  they fail to feel the ground for men..and they know its tough to sustain bit sexes...so it would be easier to step on the men to help the women....</p>

              <p>sg women have no respect for male thats for sure, from my own negative personal expereince. And foreign girls in fact dint like sg girls . and i see many now are plotting to use women's charter and divorce laws to exploit men And being elite princesses, putting up a show on the outside just makes men loathe them more. They are also the reason why call girls and hookers have greatly risen in numbers as Polly Adler says :</p>
              <p> <strong>The women who take husbands not out of love but out of greed, to get their bills paid, to get a fine house and clothes and jewels; the women who marry to get out of a tiresome job, or to get away from disagreeable relatives, or to avoid being called an old maid -- these are whores in everything but name. The only difference between them and my girls is that my girls gave a man his money's worth.”</strong><br><br> in my whole life living in SG, i have never met a desirable SG girl</p>

              <p>The root cause of all these seems to me to be PAP policies.</p>
              <p>High pace, stress, mentality of women changing, low birth rate, HDB high cost, all these it seems to me, the source of all the problems - is PAP.</p>
              <p>Because before PAP, Singapore's birth rate is high, but after PAP, the rate is low.</p>
              <p>The ultimate source of all the problems facing Singapore today and Singaporeans in general lies with the People's Action Party.</p>

              <p>i dont have a problem with them earning 5-8k. I only have a problem with them placing high standards on man when in Singapore, its clearly evident that men are at a disadvantage in career progression due to NS and reservist duties thereafter and lagging behind women by at least 2-3 years.</p>
              <p> I have a problem with them apathetic to everything regarding their lives and that of men</p>
              <p>I have a problem with princesses who think they are living in American Disneyland where everything seems so magical.</p>
              <p>I have a problem when Women cry gender equality, women's charter when the circumstances are not in favor to them and when equality was already granted to them ages ago in education, career, health and life choices.</p>
              <p>And lastly i have a problem when women  say they are independent but yet expect men to support them</p>

              <p>Solution : GO find yourself a girl at least 3 years younger. Why must you insist on women your age ?</p>

              <p>Are you also apathetic to female way of life. Are you expecting from them what you cannot give in return ? Are you only interested in their vagina ?</p>
              <p>"problem with princesses who think they are living in

              <p>Indeed, every girl wants to be a princess. Your daughter will too. The girls you hanker after are all princesses in the eyes of their parents. EVERY parent will not want their daughter to date or marry someone who don't treat their daughter like a princess.</p>

              <p>You are sorely mistaken, an educated and independent female do not need a man to support them... they just want to ensure the man can support their FAMILY. Survival instinct. Just as you expect a female who is capable enough to help take care of yours. To ensure their offsprings are not disadvantaged.</p>
              <p>There are a lot of loser guys out there, I hope you are not one of them. I attribute your skewed perception to  ignorance and inexperience.</p>
              <p>No one generation or ethinicity is dumber, smarter, better or worst. Look at the picture objectively and you will realise women are all the same albeit living in different era with different desires and opportunities.</p>
              <p>Your father and grandfather  each has a different set of challenges to face during their own era, they were able to adapt and florish, why couldn't you ?</p>

              <p>Please!!!! not all educated SG girls are like that.maybe some of them YES but if they really earn big bucks and set high standard for themself why not??frankly, marriage is a one in a life time thing so i think even a girl who earn $900 per month will consider twice and to choose their bf carefully...Women can be very independent but no matter what they still need men in their life and this my friend need skills to handle!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The key is give and take...like what some man said,"if i earned $5000 to $7500 per month .i rather go for young and pretty girl" and i dont think its wrong when women set some standard toward their prince charming right??</p>

              <p>In my opinion, the hazards of being an educated female in Singapore is
              really the increasing difficulty in getting a husband and also the
              increasing difficulty of handling multiple roles of being a good wife,
              good mother, good daugther-in-law, good employee and more.</p>
              <p>To SG women:</p>
              <p><em><strong>Why more difficult to get a husband?</strong></em></p>
              <p>1. Plenty of women in Singapore but not enough men to marry them all.</p>
              <p>- More and more SG women than men, not counting foreigners.<br> <br>2. Increasing competition from foreigners.</p>
              <p>- Non-SG women are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">very actively</span></strong> attracting and marrying SG men. If you still think this is no big deal,
              you better think of the concequences if more and more SG men are
              marrying foreign women instead of SG women (which should be you).</p>
              <p>3. Poor reputation.</p>
              <p>-
              One rotten egg can really spoil the whole basket. I do not want to
              elaborate much on why SG women has poor reputation for being a "lousy"
              wife. One example I can tell you is from my own grandmother:
              "&lt;someone&gt; is so lazy. A 70+ years old grandma has to wash
              clothes for a 20+ years old young woman ... ... ..."</p>
              <p><em><strong>Difficulty in handling multiple roles</strong></em></p>
              <p>1.
              Due to the complexity and materialistic lifestyle of our modern
              society, it is difficult for a woman to be good in every role she has
              to play.</p>
              <p>- Our society's expectation for women is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">very high</span></strong>.
