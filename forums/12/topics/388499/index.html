              <p><a href="http://talkback.stomp.com.sg/forums/showthread.php?t=94999"></a>The hazards of being an educated female in Singapore. <br>This is my personal account from recent observation and memory, and is no means to being a nation-wide statistic nor phenomenon. It may be singular more than wide spread. <br>---------------------------<br><br>My JC class of 12 females, thereabouts, have a varied life. All of them went on to local Universities, NUS and NTU. There are no SMU graduates as I don't think SMU has opened up applications then. That may be wrong, but point being, all are NUS / NTU graduates.<br><br>- The "vainest" of all married early. She was 24, and married 2 years after graduation. Her husband is relatively old, around 5 years older. <br><br>- The "prettiest" of the class (widely concurred) married surprisingly early, too, at 26. Her husband is also relatively older, at 7 years older than her (us). She conceived very soon into marriage, and duly has a daughter. Her child is now coming 3 years of age. <br><br>- Out of the balance, there are 2 girls "unaccounted" for. They have dropped off the radar totally. These 2 girls are the "nerds" of the class. No idea what happened to them at all. <br><br>- Of the remaining lot of 6, this is what is happening to them, now.<br><br>- They are all single (unmarried).<br><br>- Half of them are in serious relationships, with a view to get married.<br><br>- Half of them (4 I have in mind), are not in a serious relationship, or in any form of relationship. <br><br>The last category of girls from my JC batch set me thinking. Personally, to me, I do not find them very attractive, physically speaking. This is not to say they are ugly or have a physical deficiency, but more of, they are not the awesome jaw dropping kind that makes you spill your coffee on your shirt.<br><br>They are now 30 years of age. They are not seeing anyone. They have graduated and have been working thereabouts 8 years in the workforce. If you take progressive financial increments over the years for a working professional, they should be easily in the S$5,500 - S$7,500 range as all four of them are in the finance industry. Not taking into account possible bonuses and performance related bonuses, that is a &gt;S$80,000 annual, with a view to go maybe even up to S$120,000/annum for a good year with 6 months bonus. <br><br>They may be unfortunate, in the sense that the guys who woo-ed them, they simply ain't interested in. They may be unfortunate, in the sense that the guy who they will be interested in, had eyes for another. Whatever the case is, you can't force someone to date, and you can't force someone to be interested in you. <br><br>I know for a fact after conversation, that they do not have incredibly high standards for a guy. They just want a guy who is preferably of the same, if not marginally lesser income power, someone intelligent, and of good character. But it just seems that the guys who woo-ed them (or a lack of guys to woo them) just never materialized with those qualities.<br><br>On the outset, they do not seem flustered. With a healthy income, they indulge in spas and getaways and they go to exotic destinations for holidays. Recently, one of them came back from Spain with an extra suitcase than she left with. However, I do believe that inwardly, they do experience a certain loneliness. <br><br>When they were younger in their twenties, they probably put that loneliness aside for their dedication towards their career. Everyone however hits a precipice of thought - even me, yes, even me - and this will channel a certain sense of long term planning and security for the self. Having a marriage, being loved, and starting a family, is an aspect of that sentiment. <br><br>Beyond this year, they will be &gt;30. It will be harder and harder for them to attract an independent male of suitable character and ability (read: intelligence, professional et cetera), and even age, for them to be with. <br><br>Being an educated, relatively high income earning professional woman in Singapore does have its hazards and its risks. In my opinion, if they were actually not so successful in life, perhaps, they may even have been married years ago. This sentence, however, is my personal and individual thinking, and not of any form of stigmatization.<br><br>Myself? I am 30, in half a year's time thereabouts. Am I worried? Not at all man. The shit's out there for me. Why?<br><br>I am a male.</p>
