            <div class='col-md body'>crapshik,<br><br>It is, in fact, very natural of you to behave and feel in the way you r feeling rite now, when you fall for some1, be it just a crush or deeply in love.<br><br>Allow me to quote a few examples of the things you will want to do for her, without you realising it.....<br>1) If she's sick, u will wish that u r there to take care of her or bring her to a doctor.<br>2) When she's unhappy or sad, u will lend her a listening ear more than willing. U will wish to know whats on her mind actually.<br>3) When she's disappointed, you hope u will be there to give her a word of comfort.<br>4) When she cry, u dun mind lending her a shoulder to cry on........<br>5) When shes in fear, you will be there to protect her and make sure nothing will happen to her.<br>6) When she fell, you would hope that you will be there to at least give her a pat on her back, making sure she will pick herself up again......<br><br>The bottomline is, u r feeling this way cos u start, or already like the ger, deeper and deeper. Its natural....... as a guy (okie no offence to gers but somehow most of the time we still treat gers as the more vulnerable gender), we really hope that the ger we love can be happy, hope that nobody will bully her etc..... so yr worries and feeling are natural.<br><br>Okie, a little off topic but i can understand why u r keeping a distance from her. Cos, u r not confident of yrself, u know that she wun like u yet. Many guys, including me, did these b4.....worst still, some guys might just say a couple of things to hurt the ger, so that she will hate him and eventually the distance will be greater. Foolish act, but guess thats what love can really do to a man.<br><br>My advise is, yes i know its not easy at this stage of yr point to completely forget her and ignore her, cos u still like her. Maybe u can really shower yr care and concern as a friend, and hope that eventually she will realise that theres some1 really good to her just beside her. Keep on 'protect'her, its yr duty   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> . If she appreciate it, maybe eventually, good. If not, still, u wun live in regret. I know its really really hard on u (actually i know how u feel now cos i went through this b4 also  :p ) , but u should just keep hanging on. U can do it. Good Luck!<br><br>Regards<br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"</div>

Think she knows that u will always be there for her, she will ultimately come to you... becoz by then ur sincerity would have touched her. u may say that she can't see or can't feel ur presence and ur sincerity... but u just never know wat's gonna happen next. Be there for her as i said. Yes, they may see u an idiot waiting there for them. Yes maybe they will tell u not to wait, but Im' sure that ur heart will not be satisfied until u r by her side rite?? That's how i mean by u be there till being there... and touch her heart... till then i believe u can finally tell that u really love her and also proudly say that she's ur gf and u will cherish her much much more...<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>=========================<br><br>()""()<br>( 'o' )<br>(,) (,)<br>(.)_(.)<br>~.~.~</div>
