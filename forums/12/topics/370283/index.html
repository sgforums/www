              <p>Got a call from a tuition coordinator a few days ago. She said that got one assignment that is very good. Claimed that for a P2 And K2 $15/hr.

              <p>Just now, another agent call me regarding another assignment. i rejected because the time slot was book by the assignment stated in the previous paragraph. Then, that agent instead of calling me, sms me to tell me that the parent decided to cancel. Reason was that her child teacher say that she is very weak, need to stay back everyday for remedial. So she don't want to stress her child any further.</p>
              <p>Still so confident claim that confirm will engage. Btw, I find it unfair that parent can just like that cancel assignment but tutor cannot. We will have to pay if we cancel. that is like "so fair".</p>
