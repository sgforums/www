              <p>I need some advice.</p>
              <p>I'm in relationship with M. </p>
              <p>One day, M cried out about his family problems to me. I tried to comfort him. Out of sudden, he said that he needs to forget someone and he needs time.</p>
              <p>Since then, my trust towards him has decreased and I do not know how to react. He, on the other hand, acts like normal. Sometime, he behaves super irritating that he gets on my nerve. Even so, he does apologise and behaves like normal again.</p>
              <p>However, he has stopped expressing "i love you" or "i miss you" spontaneously since then. Only when I express it first, he will say it. Other then that, he is pretty quiet about it.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure whether I would stay or move on in this relationship.</p>
              <p>Frankly, I love him but I don't dare to place high hope in him.</p>

              <p>However, he has stopped expressing "i love you" or "i miss you" spontaneously since then. Only when I express it first, he will say it. Other then that, he is pretty quiet about it.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure whether I would stay or move on in this relationship.</p>
              <p>Frankly, I love him but I don't dare to place high hope in him.</p>
