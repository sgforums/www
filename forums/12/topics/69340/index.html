Certainly one has to give oneself time to grieve and get accustomed to the new set of circumstances, but at the same time I see a lot of cynicism floating about on this forum.<br><br>Make no mistake about it, people Â– cynicism is only a paper-thin disguise for cowardice.<br><br>Zen is predicated upon three simple metaphorical statements:<br><br>Â“A mountain is a mountain and water is waterÂ”<br>Â“A mountain is not a mountain and water is not waterÂ”<br>Â“A mountain truly is a mountain and water truly is waterÂ”<br><br>Though I am not a Buddhist, much less a Zen Buddhist, this philosophy has always struck me as making a hell of a lot of sense.  We start out naÃ¯ve, taking everything at face value.  As we go along, we learn that not everything is as it seems, so we treat every new thing with disbelief and cynicism.  However, we reach a higher level of understanding of the ways of the world, by which we take the trouble to assess everything on its own merits, and as such develop an understanding and acceptance of the true nature of everything Â– that is how we get past cynicism.  The Zen Buddhists hold that not everybody reaches that ultimate stage, because it takes a lot of soul-searching and effort to get there.<br><br>From the number of people in their mid-40Â’s and onwards who stay stuck in a world of cynicism, hell, IÂ’d say that them Zen guys are right.<br><br>Can I blame people for proving them right?  Hell, no.  LetÂ’s face it Â– life has a tendency to knock us around like pinballs.  Regardless of our insight and intellect, thereÂ’s always going to be at least one thing thatÂ’s going to come all the way out of left field to clobber us right in the temple.  Get yourself knocked around enough times, and if youÂ’re half-smart, youÂ’ll know the meaning of fear.<br><br>If we bring up the topic of fear, it is almost inevitable that we bring up courage.  Courage is not a question of not having fear.  Indeed, I pity the man who knows no fear Â– life will find a way of arranging an introduction between him and fear, and he will not know what to do then.  Courage is acknowledging your fear, embracing it and working your way through it.  Dammit, the human race has gotten to where it is on that principle.<br><br>So go out, experience, push the boundaries, hit the wall, feel fear, face it and by God, work through that fear, for that is what makes you human.
