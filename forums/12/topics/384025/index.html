              <p>Like most countries, there's always an ethnic, race or whatever you want to label it, predominant group trying to wrestle control and spread their network (wealth), culture and stifle any other race around.</p>
              <p>I am a peranakan guy growing up in a poor family and I can say I took the brunt of most these Chinese Ed hatred since I could remember. Typical english ed are rich and hence arrogant from what I observed. But because I talk like them due to my better "england" and culture I end up with the sam brush but without the safety net of the rich network and lifestyle to avoid such cretins.</p>
              <p>Looking back as an adult now. I find it strange that such is the way of life for minorities in singapore. When I was in the army, surely I was badly bullied and beaten. And like my Indian friend across the other company complained equally the same issues with these chinese ed I encountered. At that time and age, I thought I was the problem and I didn't even know about this Chinese Ed issue, let alone protected.</p>
              <p>In the political scene, Tang Liang Hong confronted this issue to the most ugliest possible and I thought he sucked cos he brought other factors in like religion and status and turned it into a circus. Yes, there's some truth in it but the big picture painted was distorted and wrong, like what if a Chinese ed was christian? I believe its better handled at a personal basis. Such issue can never be solved by "policies".  </p>
              <p>As I grew up, I see my job opportunities being taken away by these chinese ed as again, I had no like minded network. In fact, competing in interviews for executive jobs, speaking much better than the ah beng without much effort didnt land me any decent jobs. At one time during the recession, for a customer service job with Starhub. When I spoke fluently, the ah lian interviewers face turned soured and hostle. Some ppl just dont know that expressions are obvious. Mind you, I am not the ABC fake slanger type. I can also speak hokkien like the pai kia style as I came from such low life schools. Its so bad that the schools defunct now.</p>
              <p>And even, when I got the job, guess what? Yep, the harrassment didnt stop. You find these cretins being backstabbing colleagues. Not the usual ones that try to bring u down and get themselves promoted. The "ostracising, lying, defamimg, backstabbing, get promoted and got you fired at the same time type.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, when I see these ah bengs in their pseudo sports car, Subaru and the ilk, with their golden pork floss disaster of a hair, playing loud neon strobing music, while I waited for my next bus ride, I cringe at the thought of Capitalism's cruel way of showing the survival of the fittest motto.</p>
              <p>Thankfully, in a strange way, the govt decision of opening the PR floodgates sort of defused the whole chinese ad stranglehold. Now, they are busy bitching about these ppl, a taste of their own medicine as I hope one day, they end up like a minority and go through what I did.</p>
              <p>I wonder how many minorities went through life like me. rant over.</p>

              <p>I always enjoy watching kids play. Black or white, girls and boys, they would innocently mingle with one another, rich or poor, here in our homeland. When you talk to them, they seem to have high hopes and confidence in their future - to be teacher, a lawyer, a doctor, a soldier to protect the country, etc, in their sweet smiles and wide opened bright eyes.</p>
              <p>When they reach secondary schools, some of the innocence is sadly lost. They begin to be more aware of each other, and hidden fault lines that once was not there starts to appear.</p>
              <p>Material wealth, favoritism, exam achievements divides them into differing cliques. Being young and immature, and worse if the home environment was not of the nurturing kind, they are unaware of their own potential - some be good at academic subjects, some just are slow starters. Some are good with hands, some good at other things, things which are gifts that are inherent in every human soul, unknown by them and only yet to be realized....</p>
              <p>I am saddened whenever I see  intellectuals seeking to protect their own self interest at the expense of others, by looking down on others to make themself look exclusive,ultimately dividing society into Them and US. That IS NEVER the aim of education, for education was meant to help and improve not only oneself, but others around him as well.</p>
              <p>The ah beng may not be an intellect in academic sense or have excellent grasp in languages, but he is not without basic senses and abilities, at times even abilities that would put a PHD to shame. He is a human being, one of us.</p>
              <p>He is where he is today, often not by choice, but by negative influences, his environment, his self confidence destroyed by a society hell bent on obtaining a degree, or be deemed a faillure, as well as limited places and funds in colleges and Uni. Should he be given funds and time with a nurturing environment, he too may turn out to be a PHD scholar.</p>
              <p>But no society can support a nation of PHD scholars, more so the monetary compensations it presumes that doctorate should be entitled to. Each has his/her own natural gift which complements and benefits society, and must be allowed to grow and shine. </p>
              <p>The ah beng is a fellow human, a fellow law abiding citizen, just like anyone of us. He is equally hard working and while may be capable of the worst, he/she would be fully capable of the best for our society, if given the chance, just like anyone else, you and me included.</p>
              <p>There really is no THEM or US. They are us and we are them - equal human first then citizens. We bleed the same, and aspire the same, if given the chance. Let us not divide, but seek ways to bridge our gaps, for we are ONE.</p>
              <p>They too, were the bright eyed innocent kids with hopes and aspirations just like everyone else, rich or poor, clever or late bloomer,  indian, malay, chinese, peranakan, or mixed. This is Singapore, our heritage and our future.  </p>

              <p>them us, aiya stop sounding like the govt. lah repeating their cultural integration mantra.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I faced the same issues with the TS my whole life, working here growing up in another place. but TS, take heart, do the attas thing all the way and stop worrying about trying to come down to whoever's level. This is called pleasing man. There is enough of pleasing man going around already. Focus on your good points, not the lowering your standards points. Don't care how others perceive you. What's it to you? Don't let them affect you... I can't speak Mandarin very well and face these types of customer service and people all the time. In fact you should turn on your power even more, to show that you're not even local, they'll treat you differently and better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you have "elite" coming through your words, the elite will eventually pick it up and use it which will inadvertently benefit you. Ever heard of fake it till you make it? Even ah bengs and lians have fako crappy Americo accents.</p>

              <p>I will disregard your ill manners, as it is irrelevant and serves no purpose except to show you frustrations and incivility. To continue your way would only degenerate into a flame war, the last thing i would want here in AA.</p>
              <p>A question remains - Have you thought of reaching out to the Ah Bengs, making friends, instead of securing your own elitism and promoting hate amongst your fellow citizens?</p>
              <p>Are one or a few bad incidents justifiable to generalize ALL the chinese eds as ah bengs, uncouth, and uncivilised as you, presumably trying to promote your own exclusivity and elitism,  have obviously shown in reponse and criticism of my post?</p>
              <p>Do drop the blinkers and take a long hard look at yourself. I have no ill will towards you, even if you have of me. You owe it to yourself to make your life happy, and discontent only breeds hatred, evidently in you and had blinded you, clouded your rational judgements.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>for my pri and sec education, my school environment was english-dominated. we would speak english even to the chinese teachers in class, making them very pissed off.</p>
              <p>in first day of JC i was shocked that most of my new classmates preferred mandarin. took me a long time to adapt. In NS also, mandarin and chinese dialects the way to go. now in uni, many PRC students and profs around. I wonder if I can adapt next time when I go back to an english working environment.</p>

              <p>For your info, BASED ON SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH ON BILIGUALISM. </p>
              <p>The real reason for the mandarin and english language disparity is because of the great difference in culture and thought process in both languages. Go and check.</p>
              <p>thats the reason why one cant adapt to each other. Not Singaporeans fault. Perfect biligualism under findings in various countries achieved only about 7% from the population. And thats including those adaptable languages like say french and english. Malay and english.</p>
              <p>Thats why our good MM Lee's son with all the help this good prosperous country cna offer, still struggles.</p>
              <p>That sir is a fact.</p>

At least I know its love. The rich elite on the other hand, willl never know if the bitch they have truly ever loved them for wat they are or is that warm fuzzy feeling called money and status that got them a free fuck in the first place.

              <p>His bitterness is obvious for all to see. He hates those below him, whom he categorised as chinese ed and derogatively as Ah Bengs. and hates those above him as evil ugly brainwashed elites who envies his supposedly sexy hot babe waiting at home for him. What she does while he is at work would be anyone's guess.</p>
              <p>He claims to speak up for the minorities, but the only one who is blowing hot air, speaking up only for his OWN ego, being abusive and racist is this self admitted 'westernised bastard'.</p>
              <p>He may claim to want to talk about discriminatory practices with job advertisements, but that's already a no-brainer. An EXAMPLE:- which company would hire a japanese who speaks only japanese if the company's clients are majority spanish speakers? More so when we are diversifying to other markets around the world? Are there no other jobs that requires an employee capable to speak only english, a common trade lingo? Or is he just too lazy to find, and in his usual bastardized style, to generalize all and everyone as bad except for him?</p>
              <p>He only wants to rant, to boost himself and his over-inflated ego up, which had long been in tatters  left by his lackluster achievements in life, by lashing out at others to make himself look and feel better, at those who are below, above and even beside him.</p>
              <p>He dont need help. So leave this 'poor westernised bastard' ( his own words, I kid you not) alone to drown in his own self inflicted hate filled misery. I pity him. Such needless and unnecessary pain....</p>
