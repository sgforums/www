            <div class='col-md body'>Hey,<br><br>i'll try not to be biased, but somehow i can't help but to speak up for the guys. I've been thru NS and I've changed.<br><br>When a girl first steps out into the world to work and the guy steps into NS, the ger will then to 'mature' faster which i feel is due to the enviroment which she is in.<br><br>On the other hand, the guy in NS is still discovering himself and learning his limits. NS is at times pretty much abt conforming to orders. Upon completition of NS, the guy now knows how to handle a lot more things and maintain his cool. However until he works, he will never put these 'hidden' discoveries which he has aquired in his NS days.<br><br>Upon working, the guy will definately be more matured when he puts his skills to the job. To a certain extent, i feel the gers will learn some maturity from the working counterparts who have already been thru NS.<br><br>And now, on the issue of... do you really love him, or are you all juz together juz becos you are comfortable with each other?? Wat do you want in this relation and where do u see it going??<br><br>A guy in NS will tink differently as compared to when he is working. it's quite unfair to say he's immatured. it's an unfair comparision.<br><br>Yup, i went thru this before and broke up. She is now with another guy and she told me she regreted. Well life goes on and i can't reverse wat has been done.<br><br>Gd luck, think carefully.</div>

Soft toys signifies immaturity? geez i have no idea. my dear, i think maybe because u started working n u start seeing things differently thats why u start feeeling confused... three years is a long time to be someone.. think thru carefully before u make any decision. Basically he actually bothers to buy something u might actually like, imagine his excitement n joy when he tot u might like it.... the whole point is he had already given all that he can give to you... what more would u want from someone that had given everything to you.<br>anyway think carefully hor, the grass is always greener on the other side.. but then always full of pesticide...<br><br>i happen to like soft toys.. i am forced to give them away because no space on my bed! wails~* <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>but then again if u dunwan soft toy tell him what u want la. ask him give u money the best hahahah</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, I would like to offer my sincere apologies for some of the words and phrases that I have used in my postings. I have to admit that I was pretty worked up because once I had a girl who treated me as such and broke up with me over what she thought was an insignificant present and which I had spent the whole day searching all the stuff toy shops in Singapore just to find that particular toy for her.<br><br>What I wish to say is this, if you really love your boyfriend, love him for who he is and what he has done for you. In buying presents and such, look at the heart which begets the action rather than the present itself. True, the present may seem insignificant to you, but to the guy, it is something he bought with the hope that it will really make your day and would give you a smile to remember for the days to come.<br><br>If you still feel that he is not the one for you, leave him. It is better for him this way. I rather that he be single and serve his NS with a peaceful mind than he thinking what he should have done to please you while doing some dangerous maneuvers.  True, he maybe upset for awhile. But at least, his buddies in the camp can do a better job comforting him and watching for him knowing what he has gone through. Life will go on for him and he will find a girl eventually that is more suited for him and who really matches his maturity.<br><br>My 2Â¢s worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ya tats rite i think shes flamed off. anywayz point to note: if gals are "mature" why would they like soft toys in the first place? anywayz the toy was for her not him, he thought she liked it, so we might at most conclude that he thought she was immature; its not for himself (though he'd be queer if he liked it haha). if soft toys are immature wat isnt? perfume? lingerie? wat? or should he show her how man he is by asking for sex?<br><br>how abt for the guy? should a gal show her maturity by buying something "mature" for her man? from wat? switch from spiderman figurines to boss cologne?<br><br>duh. i can understand if the different environments result in different frequencies so they cant communicate properly anymore, but to put the blame on her bf for being immature is, in itself an immature act, not to mention that it is bound to piss guys off.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi selfishgal,<br><br>I think its normal for girls to feel like u do coz you and ur bf are going through different stages and environment in your life. Its sad but true, puppy love that lasted from teens to adult hood usually won't last. This is because girls generally matured faster than guys... And they will feel that the guy whom they used to like in sch has not grown up. Actually, ur bf hasn't changed, its just that you've become more matured now. Perhaps u're looking or seeking for something more than love in your relationship now. A stable income, and security is what you're looking for. There's nothing wrong with being realistic in life. Its all part and parcel of growing up. If you really think that he's not suitable for you, then leave him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>come on everybody! I think their realtionship is not just be'coz of a softtoy. If it is only that classified him as childish then seems a bit unfair. If yu really think you'all communication got problem, maturity gap diff then I recommend a break up. No point changing for each other I tried b4 it's impossible. Just break.</div>
