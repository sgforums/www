            <div class='col-md body'>I have been with my boyfriend for almost 3 years. Just last year, we both graduated from Poly, so I am currently working now and he is in NS. I started to feel the gap between us. I begin to feel that he is still so immature and childish. During my 21st birthday this year, he is still giving me soft toys as presents. I feel that I couldn't be with him anymore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> I wanted a Man not a Boy.

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe you should take a look at yourself first. Just because he gave you soft toys for your birthday, you label him as immature and selfish? Did you expect him to give you something more valuable for your birthday? If that's the case, the immature one is you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>every individual has their own approach to show their care for another. giving you a softtoy for present might not please you enough but at least he tried. look at it as how he show his concern to you.<br><br>have you tried giving him the benefit of doubts and assess him based on his goods? or is your mind left with only the unpleasant moments?<br><br>i thought you should tell him that you no longer a little girl and you prefer something else on your next birthday. give him another change to prove his and your judgement, as far as his maturaity is concerned.<br><br>if all else fails and you think a break-up is the best solution to all of these problems, carry it out. at least the both of you can utilise the rest of your life finding a more suitable partner.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi selfishgal,<br><br>i heard abt several stories similar to you. meaning that gers feeling that the guys are still childish, and mostly, they occur when the guys are in NS while the gers are working. when you are working, the environment is v diff, and things are no longer the same as when u are working. u are meeting with diff kinds of clients, customers, superiors etc. u have to be mature at all times, whereas the guys are in NS and the environment they are in are v diff from yours.  i am not sure if NS life is similar to sch life, but perhaps it's the change of environment that you are facing makes you feel as if you have "matured" and therefore your bf seems to be childish when he is actually still the same old bf that u used to have.  hmm... perhaps give him more time to understand wat you want from him, and also, perhaps when he also step into the working society, both of you will be the same as in he will probably be "mature" then... erm.. dunno lah, tats y i think. hope it helps you. dun think of breaking up so easily, cos' u might really regret it in the future!~</div>

Go ahead and leave him... I think it would be better for BOTH of you anyway....<br><br>If you're just all WRAPPED UP and CONFUSED because of what you're facing in your Life currently and the fact that your bf cannot always be around with you, please try to make it CLEAR between the things happening in your Life and your relationship with your bf.... Personally I think your CRY means that you still needs your bf..... And giving up on this relationship of yours and your bf just because of this soft toy is too stupid a reason.... Unless you can find yourself a better reason, I suggest you reflect over what happened from BOTH your stand and your bf's stand....?<br><br>And here is a BONUS story... Some of the female friends I know now and whom I've spoken to WERE just like you.... But now they're such UNDERSTANDING ladies.... And always giving in to their bf and have NO COMPLAINT.... Most of them told me that they ONCE had a VERY NICE bf but they never treasure him... Always throwing temper and asking for more.... Though they kinda regret now but they too understand that they cannot change anything now... Relatively the bf they have now are always BUSY with their own things and friends... But they very much APPRECIATE the LOVE more than the faults they can find on their bf....</div>

As all the guys know in NS the pay also not much still need to save for the next appt aft booking out. If he were to gave u valuable things and not able to go out aft booking out. Then will u think he dun like u. Please see the problem outside the circle and not inside it. If u keep thinking that he is immature and wish to breakup with him i think u are the one who is immature or u have fallen for some other guys and wish that the forums can help give u good reason to Breakup with him. this also prove that ur relationship cannot last as ur thinking is unstable.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>goodness, 21 year old gal only, only GRADUATE poly (duh, big deal) to me is like ru3 xiu4 wei4 gan1 (milk smell havent dry). so young work for a short while only want to believe yrself to be mature? give me a break. i'd say yr bf is more mature than u, do u know why? let me speak out for all the guys who are clearing army or have ORD. why are guys from the army more mature? because during their stint they have tested their own limits of both mental and physical endurance; no man can understand himself and his limits more than someone who have undergone such intensive training. other than this, the army trains someone to be patient and to keep a cool head when faced with difficulties so u'll see that army trained guys do not blow their top as much in the outside world, which is a sharp contrast to gals outside (no matter how long they've worked) who have no experience of intense hardship at all and cannot tolerate unpleasant situations (blowing their tops at the slightest dissatistaction.)<br><br>this is a pretty common scenario: when my gal frens ask me, is work tough? i'd tell them when i think of army training, work suddenly becomes really easy (which is how i seek stress relief! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ) and when they ask me is army really that tough? i can only smile at them cos they have no idea at all..<br><br>having said all these, i'd still say i dread army, sispec and soa. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>anywayz, i do not think u are mature, but i do think yr bf is maturing. in any case if u think yr expectations for yr bf have changed, i suggest u give him some time, or rather 21/2 years to finish up his holy task of protecting yr country (including u! while taking the peanut pay) and appreciate wat he (and other NS guys) is doing now. its pretty sad to see such a typical case happening again.</div>
