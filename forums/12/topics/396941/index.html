This other girl shows signs that she likes me but they are not so obvious and I did not notice until a friend told me. I am quite fond of her and feel that she is attractive but I'm not going to start anything with her because it's wrong for me and very wrong for her! She knows I am attached but sometimes she is just too sweet to me I feel a turn off for this behaviour coming from someone with bf. Should we continue to be friends?</p></div>

              <p>Agreed. Think it through and look at it from a spectator's point of view, not one who is still in the relationship with either girl. Think rationally! Not emotionally.</p>

              <p>This may be too broad and sweeping a statement, but its something I firmly believe in. So here goes.  </p>
              <p>"All's fair in love and war". Cliched but true. Basically my take is this, it doesn't really matter if a girl is attached or not, as long as she isn't married! If you like her, then go for her.  At the end of the day, its the girl that will be making the choice between her current boyfriend and you. Then again, if you succeed in a "hostile takeover" as it were, would you be able to fully trust your new girlfriend? I.e. If she broke up with her ex to be with a better guy i.e. "you", would she do the same to you if some other nicer guy came along?</p>
              <p>The issue at hand, is that you yourself have a girlfriend.  Which means you have responsibilities to your current girlfriend.  Do yourself a favor and try to reconcile the differences between you and your girlfriend first.  The last thing you should ever do, is to reciprocate feelings towards this girl that likes you whilst you yourself still are attached.  If you really feel that your current relationship doesn't have any long term prospects, let your girlfriend know and end the relationship.  Once you have a clean break then see how things work out with the other girl.  Its much easier on your conscience and less stressful to have a clean break, instead of two-timing and trying to hide your activities from the girls.</p>

              <p>Like what actions suggests that she likes you? I tell you when you are fond of someone, every little action can be interpreted in the way that she might like you.</p>

              <p>For starters, when she has girl problems with another common friend, she turns to me for help and advice rather than other guys that she knows. One time I bought her a gift for her birthday and thereafter she gave me a gift too for no occasion! This gift relates quite well to the earlier gift that I have given her so maybe she is suggesting that we share something in common?? She also speaks of me quite a lot when I'm not around that is what my other friend told me! Not only that I think she takes me to be a close friend since she often take cigs from me when we go smoking for distress.I am not interested in her but as a normal guy I must say she is pretty hot. Should I just avoid her, try to distant or what..</p>
