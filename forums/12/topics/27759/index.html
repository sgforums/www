At least once a week to clubs. While I just stay at home and let them enjoy their male bonding time. He then tells me that he is abt to be tied down. Ha! I told him tt if i wanted to tie him down i would have done it b4 marriage not after. He is the guy, I am the gal here.<br><br>Funny, I should be the one feeling more tied down that him.<br>He was the one that wanted to get married ever since we went steady, I was the one that hesitated.<br><br>What I am feeling now is anger and hatred for him.

It's not to Spike him but to make him go through EXACTLY wat u've gone thru &amp; FEEL it for himself as in case, he's SLOW?!?....might as well give him the benefit of the doubt<br>b) For me, maybe Marriage seems like a Big Decision to make....i can empathize, so wat i'll do is to 'act in accordance' to his psychological changes. Make known to him this 'FEAR' by speaking aloud &amp; overcoming together...<br>c) Cant really comment much......since togther for so long.....already like 'Lao Gong Lao Puo'.......u do expect to hear this: "My pleasure, dear" ??!?! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I guess it does not matter if he was the one initiating the marriage or u coz the fact is someone has to DO IT....n the Marriage can only be possible when both agree. Which means Marriage belongs to the both of u...no one has more responsiblity than the other. I've read before on couples having phobia for Marriage....no matter how long one has prepared for it.....the phobia will still be there since it's a new experience. If u can acknowledge this 'PHOBIA', u may like to talk to ur guy abt it.....maybe he's having the phobia while u r not, so it makes u really Frustrated over his actions?!? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>How many pple can go thru 5 yrs of Courtship &amp; finally deciding to share their lives together?!.....i cant change ur thoughts so i can only make u see the wat u have so far <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
