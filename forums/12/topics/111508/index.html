            <div class='col-md body'>sad to say... i'm also this type of 'shy' guy<br>i've had this type of experiences before so i think i can tell u the guy's viewpoint on this matter. i'm no expert, but i hope my understanding of this situation is useful to you:<br><br>Either:<br>1. that day due to the flying sparks and chemistry and everything, he gets v high and excited, and being the shy type he wont reject any confessions but just play along, so he ask u out for supper after your clubbing. However, when u didnt go out with him, u didnt 'seize the moment' and the small flame that burn inside him start to go off le.<br><br>2. because u confess to him, he start to take u for granted, and he'z probably used to you taking the first move first, since u already know that he'z the shy type of guy. You've already been making the first move, why stop now, ask him out, but dun expect to pick up from where you left now, let things develop naturally step by step.<br><br>However, my advice is to really take it easily and slowly, he really show lack of commitment in the relationship, so you must ensure that he is also really interested in you, no point moving too fast. Two people may like each other, but its not necessary for them to be in a relationship.<br><br>Well if that guy really likes you, he will regret his passive stance. i know, because i have lost the important 'someone' in my life the same way....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

I simply hate the thing about 'Women are from Venus, Men are from Mars'.... Only read a couple of pages of that page and already 'dumped' it... But your case...? Hehheh.... Would be a bit useful...?<br><br>To START OFF.... YUP... He's a SHY GUY.... Ever thought of HOW a SHY GUY would ACT...??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> As much as you know both of you wants each other, he's simply 'stupid'....<br><br>Don't just drop him 'hints'... ENCOURAGE HIM... PRAISE him... Joke around with him and loosen the tension for him a little... Let him feel more 'open up' to YOU..... YEAH.... YOU DON'T have to THROW YOURSELF TO HIM! Just 'INVITE, INVITE &amp; INVITE' him!!!<br><br>Women, women... Men, men.... I know though you like him you might still feel paisay as a girl... How old are both of you by the way?<br><br>BE SENSITIVE to this SHY GUY! ACTUALLY, he might have ALREADY MADE HIS 'MOVES'... Just that AS TINY as they are, you probably just let them SLIP THROUGH... Examples would be..<br><br><span style="color: blue;">1. He accompanied you to wait for your friend.<br>2. He offered to wait for you to finish your clubbing to 'take you supper'.</span><br><br>Here's a BIT of EXPLANATION....<br><br>This SHY GUY might actually be the 'slow receptive' type... It's NOT that he's NOT INTERESTED in you... He's probably just SLOW and don't make 'daring manevours'....<br><br>Out of so many so many things you've told him and you hinted him, he only makes ONE move...?<br><br>And his move ain't that 'DIRECT'... He CREATES 'EXCUSES' for himself when he wish to get NEARER to you.... See the above 2 in <span style="color: blue;">BLUE</span>?<br><br>In the 1st case, there probably ain't really a need to EXCEPT that he WISH to SPEND MORE TIME with you...? SIMPLY PUT. Who would wanna spend more time with someone who they don't like to hang around with?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>2nd case is CREATING an 'OPPORTUNITY' to have more TIME with you too... The 'supper' thing is just superificial... Though I must say it's really not BRILLANTLY DONE on his part, it also just happened that ya turned him DOWN...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>ANOTHER POINT to NOTE. Many SHY GUYS are like 'TORTISE'. When he make the 'occasional' moves, you 'hit' him on the head by REJECTING him... He'll probably just SHRINK IN.... Haha...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  As much as you're ASKING all the WHYs now. He might just be DOING his own 'THINKINGS'...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Just read through a few of the 'classic' topics on how guys are 'rejected' by girls or ask questions like 'what does it means...' then you'll UNDERSTAND...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>So NEXT TIME before you 'hit' his head again, try to AGREE to him... But don't OVER STRAIN yourself by making it a MUST... If you can't, just let him know and reject him... BUT.. Let him KNOW HOW MUCH you would REALLY LOVE to HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY to SPEND MORE TIME with him even though it's 'SAD' that you have to REJECT HIM yeah...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> "<br><br>PS.

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe you will need to set up the atmosphere for him to take the initiative again... like what the others said loosen him up and make the fire in him burn again... and if he continues on to ask you out, try your best to go, but if really cannot, u can reply in a way of telling him u would like to go but can't and try not to kill all his opportunities. eg. "I would like to go for supper with u, but i have something on tonight and i can't miss it. How about tmr?"<br><br>However, if it is always u that have to take initiative, i can understand that it is frustrating esp u are a gal... afterall no matter how shy he can be, he is expected to take some initiative after u have done ur part... if he continues to be like this u can consider not doing anything and see if he will be worried enuff to come rolling to u... however it may not be too wise to do this coz he may jus think that u are no longer interested and he deserves it.<br><br>Drill this idea into him... Dont think, confirm. When he thinks abt how u will feel and so on, he is actually making himself see that the 'u in him' is giving him that impression. here is no confirmation from ur side at all.<br><br>Wish u luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That is either a extremely shy guy or he is taking you for granted. I am also very shy to girls too(sometime I blushes till my ears are red) but I manage to overcome my shyness to ask the lady I like out for movie and dinner. So personally I don't think being shy is a good reason why he is being so passive in the courtship. Try ignoring him for a while, stop smsing him for a day or 2 and see if he response in anyway.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what Devil1976 said is right, encourage him. E.g. when he asked you for supper, you declined. If he is really a shy guy, he would find it harder to initiate next time. There's no harm in taking time to know one another more and see if both of you can be together...All the best.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
