When a gal takes initiative, being taken for granted is of high possibility. Like what others said, he may only think of u when he is free, and slot u into his timetable when it is of convinence to him. eg. talk after his lan gaming. I think talking can be carried out anytime not necessarily after his lan gaming in the early morning. Do u think he take into consideration of ur feelings and situation?<br><br>U can try not to give him much attention from now on, and i think that no matter how shy a guy can be, he will  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm...right now I am also seeing a shy guy so I can understand your frustration. Last time I used to ask him out a lot but then one day, I just stoppe ddoing it cos I was tired of being the one asking all the time. I refused to be taken for granted...so just let things cooled down for a bit. And surprisingly he started to ask me out more after dat.<br><br>so mebbe you should stop asking him out, just wait for him to miss you or something, then dun agree so easily, let him know you do have your own life to lead too, you are not someone who would drop evthing the moment he calls...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>i.c.y</div>
