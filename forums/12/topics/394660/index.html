              <p>Sad to say, but usually these people are so into thinking that they can drive around in an Audi or BMW at a young age, they will not give up their dreams so easily and "persevere" on. Advise your friend, dig out old case scenarios, explain why in your opinion its not good. </p>
              <p>If you friend still persist on, seriously, its only at a later time when they realise they are not reaping what they are suppose to sow, then will they drop out of that fantastic plan. </p>

              <p>It is good that you care a lot for your good friends, but if they really want to learn things the hard way, you will not be able to do anything either.</p>
              <p>However, if the time comes when they trip and fall, do not laugh at them and do not think of it as your fault. Instead, just do what you can to help them back up on their feet. </p>
