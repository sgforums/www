            <div class='col-md body'>I don't reckon you have split personality, nor is it depression. It's you being unwilling to accept the fact that your bf has a new gf while you have stop moving on with life.<br><br>Why is it that when you're alone at home, things which had never happened while you're outside is now coming to you. Reason is becoz you dread loneliness. You yearn for companionship. You cannot accept that he's out there living a happy life, you allow yourself to be swallowed in self pity, even to the extent of allowing your mind and soul to be weakened. Subconsciously, you want alot of attention that's why you seek him out, tell him about what is happening to you. Hoping he'll empathise with you, tells you things you want to hear very much... you are actually hoping he'll feel remorseful for breaking off with you and subsequently come back to you. You want to feel the closeness with him, you hope for time to go back to where it stopped.  But it's not going to be happening, my dear... you have to be brave and stop torturing yourself, him and his gf. It's not fair to anyone, especially yourself.<br><br>Bear in mind, throughout your post, you mentioned you wanted his attention. Please remember one fact, both of you are leading separate lives now. You should treasure yourself and live a life fuller than what you're going through now. In order for him to feel remorseful over leaving you, you have to make the best out of what you have, not to pester him and leave nothing but bad impression to him.<br><br>You do not need any psychartrist, you need yourself to get well and be well. For yourself, for the ones who love you. Please move on with life and prove your worth to the one you love by ensuring you do not ruin yourself in any manner.<br><br>Please PM me if you need help. I'll be around... hoping to hear from you.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by f|ower ger:</div><div class="quote_body">hi all, new here....<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>hope u guys be able to help me with my problem...<br>i think i am suffering from depression.. which makes some people think that i have spilt personality...<br><br>the typical kind of stuff i experience is that when i am out with my friends.. i am very normal.. just like my usual self..cheerful and very jovial.. but after the outing when im at home.. i will start to cry to myself coz i start thinking of unhappy stuff... i cant stop thinking coz its always on my mind when im alone.. to the extend that i cannot be alone.... there's always someone in my mind talking to me...<br><br>i have becoming a nuisance to my ex bf.. i think he finds me rather 'fan' coz each time such incident happen, i will call him up and cry.. most of the time he will comfort me..but when he is with his present gf he will not ans my call, which makes me cry even more..<br><br>there was once i attempted suicide.. not because i want to die, coz i want to let him know that im willingly to die for him.. i think i very fan also.. he cant handle me anymore.. but i cant stop myself from acting in this manner coz that's the only way to gain his attention....and im running out of ideas to get his attention.. what can i do??<br><br>i think i going crazy soon.. please recommend an affordable psychatrist if u can..<br><br>Thks  </div></blockquote></div>
