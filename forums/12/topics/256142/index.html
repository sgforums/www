            <div class='col-md body'>get your priority straight, you can travel at leisure at any time and there are always opportunities, your IA only happens just this once and don't waste people's time if you are not going to be serious.

You are flying east, you need more buffer timing in Asia to get over jet lag then you need rest from road lag at San Fran.  You planning to chit chat, talk, play card games and keep yourself awake on the 24 hourss flight back home?<br><br>For hostel, i would recommend Green Tortise or USA hostels at San Fran.<br><br>For LA, I will recommend [ur]www.usahostels.com[/url].
