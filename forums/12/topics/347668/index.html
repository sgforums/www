              <p>... Don't feel alone and emo. Your parents care about you more than anything else. This is applicable to all. If you do not want to be late for work, then MAKE IT a point to wake up earlier. Your perception of work = "shit". Perhaps you don't like your career? Since you don't like it, you can change it you want to.</p>
              <p>The fact that there is so much negativity in your ranting is that you view what has happened to you as something bad. You can change your perception of all those negativity into something postive.</p>
              <p>Being late for work &gt; tell yourself, " I must do something to get rid of this bad habit"</p>
              <p>This is already a lesson learnt. If you apply all this to everything that is going wrong in your "life" now, perhaps you will feel better.</p>
              <p>The fact that you feel that the people you care about the most are ignoring you is because of being oversensitive. Sometimes, when you get emotional, you will tend to overlook a lot of things.</p>
              <p>Treat what you are going through now as a lesson. You can choose to brave the wind or cower. If you brave the wind, you are going to get stronger and will be able to brave an even stronger wind. However, if you cower and get engulfed in despair or self-pity, you are never going to be any stronger. Take action now!</p>
              <p>I hope this will help you.</p>

              <p>i really hope it's just a bad day. but something tells me that,
              that's just not all. i realize at times, everything seems to go
              wrong. everything literally. i was late for work. even cabbing all
              the way there and wasting sooo much money, i was still late. i
              faced semishit at work. my bf and i bickered quite badly over some
              stuff while at work, and the stuff i heard him say really made me
              so deflated beyond hope, like i'll never be good enough. and
              recently i just pissed my mom off. when i came home, all it took
              was a few glares from her, just that few glares. and everything
              just falls apart. a huge huge flop.i was staring at my dinner and i
              felt so much like crying out loud. i never seem to get anything
              right. the people i care about most are crazy mad at me and they're
              ignoring me. and really i feel so alone now. like never before.
              after a whole day's of hustle and bustle and drama, at the end of
              the day, i'm still alone.</p>

              <p>when that happens, have a good laugh, cause seemingly, you can predict that things will go wrong.. and after a while, you will be pleasantly surprised when things start to pick up and go right..</p>

              <p>pls just let me rant and save the nasty comments</p>
              <p>i really hope it's just a bad day. but something tells me that, that's just not all. i realize at times, everything seems to go wrong. everything literally. i was late for work. even cabbing all the way there and wasting sooo much money, i was still late. i faced semishit at work. my bf and i bickered quite badly over some stuff while at work, and the stuff i heard him say really made me so deflated beyond hope, like i'll never be good enough. and recently i just pissed my mom off. when i came home, all it took was a few glares from her, just that few glares. and everything just falls apart. a huge huge flop.i was staring at my dinner and i felt so much like crying out loud. i never seem to get anything right. the people i care about most are crazy mad at me and they're ignoring me. and really i feel so alone now. like never before. after a whole day's of hustle and bustle and drama, at the end of the day, i'm still alone.</p>

              <p><br>To cheer yourself is easy, you can go watch a comedy movie, or do some shopping and buy something for yourself until you're happy, or turn on the air-con in your room and hug all your pets to sleep.</p>
              <p>Or...maybe you just needed a break from your current routine lifestyle.</p>
              <p>Change may be what you needed the most at this time. Whenever your life is going through some miserable stage over a LONG period of time, it is a warning sign to you that it is time for you to make some changes to your current routine lifestyle.</p>
              <p>Of course changes doesn't necessary means quitting your job and moving on in search for another job, that would be running away....unless you're a runner in life, you are not going to be able to RUN FOREVER in your life.</p>
              <p>Changes should be made within YOURSELF and not anything that is OUT of YOURSELF. Reasons is because ONLY you can make the changes within yourself and you can't really make any permanent changes outside of yourself.</p>
              <p>Changes within yourself could range from a variety starting from your dressing and appearances, attitude towards yourself and others, personality or personalities, social circles and moral values, hobbies and life skills, and of course most importantly believing in a RELIGION. If you are a free-thinker, I would urge you to step into a Christian Church or accept the invitation to visit a Christian Church to attend their service.</p>
              <p>You may find that your day is already at the most miserable at the moment as compared to your yesterdays. But if you were to think forward a bit, your day could have turned out a lot worse and more miserable than what you had went through.</p>
              <p>And every possible setbacks or aggression that you have faced is an opportunity for you to grow stronger in character and become a better person than Fantagf, jojobeach, Gedanken. I'm had to quote them because they are such excellent examples of chaotic and imperfect people.</p>
              <p>Time will help you to overcome all the setbacks and aggression that you are facing right now. All you need is to focus on what you would like to change within yourself.</p>
              <p>And when you find that one day you no longer feel affected by any setbacks or aggression in your life, then you will find how happy, simple and easy it is to find happiness in your life. </p>
              <p>You won't be alone anymore when you have found GOD in your life. Because GOD will always be with you, watching over you, protecting you, and loving you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
