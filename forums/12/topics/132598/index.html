            <div class='col-md body'>Apart from normal work/school during working hours, you could apply for part time, night shift jobs in retail or svs establishments where labour intensive movement is required; like moving goods, stacking shelves, serving dishes, washing cups and plates, singing karoke, bouncer, cleaner etc..Avoid those that make you sit around your desk, cashiering, telemarketing or in front of a PC, chit-chat type of tasks. Then, with all those moving around your metabolism will increase and gradually your chubby fat will discharge itself like a shrivlled sardine on a hot tin roof.., Also, you get paid and you may reweard yorself with a nice hipster jeans for that new image in a short span of a month or 2. Don't trust the slimming centres or ads. They just feed you with some false sense of pschological solace, so you pay plenty money for nothing. The so called systematic packages and courses, couselling, and fantastic sounding state of the art instruments and hardware you see, are mere fakery. they could just charm you and apply to your flesh one of those hand held vibrator that were probably modified from some discarded osim massage chairs and tell you its the latest magic wand fat buster from mars. or shine some multi coloured light/uv ray and say its the latest laser beam secretly franchised from nasa. It is the soul that needs attention and it manifests in ways such like the desire or need to be controlled..,.so, you could be taking a placebo drug or a simple analogy is that you gorge on 3 cheeseburgers and force-vomit out every residual ingredients and gastric juices. but alas, these won't make you slimmer except develop aching jaws and ulcers. Once you realize the root of the problem, that these could simply boil down to lifestyle or basic discipline, then, you will be whipped back in shape in no time. Best Wishes!</div>

Personally, I'll advise going for long-term ones then short terms one... And YOUR HEALTH should be a critical factor to look into throughout the process... Ask friends for GENUINE CASES and feedbacks from them... When you find MUCH DISCOMFORT in the process, though you might just thought of biting your teeth and go on.. ALWAYS ask for PROFESSIONAL's ADVICE.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>During my sec sch yrs,once, i was almost overweight. So, my PE teacher wanted my to lose weight in a wks time! If i'm nt wrong, it should b 3 kg. At dat time, i was of coz ignorant.<br><br>Luckily, dere was e SARS thing so we had a 20 odd daes of sch break. Yes, so i have more time to lose weight. I lose 7kg. BUt it was hell!<br><br>Breakfast was tomato or egg sandwich. That means, Sandwiching tomato N egg ONLY in 2 slices of bread. plus tea<br><br>Lunch was a packet of LUX biskuit. Plus either yakult or tea.<br><br>Dinner was same as breakfast. But i alternate wad i had. Haha... between tomato N egg of coz.<br><br>After each meal i would exercise. Squash, the hula loop thingy, dance .... anything tedious dat's it.<br><br>At dat time, i'm always hungry. It felt really terrible. Sometimes i even felt like i'm goin to faint. I just feel weak.<br><br>But i'm glad when my stomach churn. Coz i'm tinkin,... yes i'm hungry... churn all the fats away N i'll nt be in TAF.<br><br>TAF was of coz seem like an insult to many of us. So, i would do anything to get away frm TAF.<br><br>I lucky, coz i can't turn down food. After my PE weight me. I began to pamper myself. I eat more. I start goin to the stadium everyday. My diet return to normal. I dare sae,... e weight i loss was nth. 7 KG! But it's unhealthy. 1kg of fats loss follows 4kg of water. I like i lost only bout 1kg of fats.<br><br>I maintain my weight for quite sumtimes. N i dare sae... it's due to my healthier living N nt the hella diet i had gone thru earilier.<br><br>It was until later in my poly yrs dat i learn bout nutrition N wellness dat i realise how dangerous i had put myself at during my terrible diet.<br><br>Slimming down it's nt a short term project or goal. It's bout changing ur lifestlye. I takes bout 1 to 2 yrs to actually see the results u want.<br><br>Now, of coz i still want to lose weight. But no longer frm those diet and things. I give myself 2 yrs. N i'm takin things slowly to change my lifestlye.<br><br>For those who really wants to know more bout losing weight N all. Shape is a realli good magazine. I had read bks for slimming down N kind. I find a lot of illusive concept here N dere. So, if u're relyin on any slimmin plan frm a bk, pls do consult a doctor 1st. Yes, N b4 buying thsoe diet bks, check out who's the author N how reliable the bk is.</div>
