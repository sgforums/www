They don't deserve it.<br><br>Don't care about what Fann Wong, Michelle Chia and so on say.... slimming pills are simply no good for you. I remember one of those ads claiming that it can absorb 2200 calories of carbohydrates a day. Sounds good? NO.<br><br>Check the food pyramid; you'll realise that carbs make up the great bulk of your daily energy intake. In other words, you'll be starving yourself slowly by taking those pills. It's anorexia on the installment plan.<br><br>Oh yes, this means that the low-carb, high-protein Atkins Diet is out as well.<br><br>Just listen to what most nutritionists and physicians would say: eat a well-balanced diet and regular exercise. You don't even have to sign up for expensive gym memberships; why not just go jogging regularly in the park? It helps to burn fat, tone your muscles, improve your blood circulation, and promote the release of feel-good hormones (leading to the 'runners' high).<br><br>Best of all, it costs nothing.</div>

I know a few of these people....no matter how much physical activity they go through, they will still be large, unless thay starve themselves (which is something I DON'T recommend).  Anyway, I doubt that this is your case.<br><br>(2) You wrote that you're a snacker.  If you continue to eat the way you, it will be no different if you exercise or go for slimming sessions.  Because whatever positive effects you get from exercise or slimming sessions.....will be destroyed by your eating habits.<br><br>I hear many people claiming that they exercise, but can't slim down.  This can be due to several reasons (including snacking).  But I suspect that your exercise method may be ineffective as well (twice a week is too infrequent too).<br><br>Um....if you're still just interested in slimming packages, then I'll be totally out of point here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>But if you wanna go back to basics and examine why your exercises don't work, perhaps you could give details of how you exercise.....and we'll try to figure out something (no promises, but we'll try).<br><br></div>
