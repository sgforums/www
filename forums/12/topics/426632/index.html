              <p>Have you guys ever felt that there's just this one special person that, no matter what you do, won't leave your heart? </p>
              <p>We were together in secondary four and after breaking up with him, I've been in countless relationships. He dated only 1 other girl after me.. but it's not like it matters, cause we always find ourselves back to square one with each other. We don't talk much (partially due to the fact that we've completely different personalities - he's rather quiet, I'm outgoing) and we hardly meet but whenever we do, my heart feels like it just went on a marathon. It's such a strong desire, and it lasted close to five years... but I've yet to figure out what makes him so special and desirable. He's told me bluntly he's open to the idea of us dating, but doesn't see us in a relationship - ever - because he's a Christian and I'm not. He's still rather attracted to me but there's this barrier between us, as in, we can't seem to proceed beyond the "special friends" stage. I don't think I really want him as a partner, but there's just this strange longing and chemistry between the both of us. </p>
              <p>Ugh, how do you guys deal with such things! </p>

              <p>Everyone enjoy their teenage years, I enjoyed it the most, and it is alway this wonderful restless and tireless teenage years that we want to remember and hope to move back to it, but it is gone, the mind are alway conditioned to longing and carving, unless you train your mind to think and focus on reality, that he is history and just a bf of the past and a friend of the present, you can never stop longing and carving that stange feeling over him till your deathbed.</p>
              <p>Now how to get rid of such longing and carving, firstly, you need to train your mind, control it instead of it controlling you, dun worry about the heart, heart is use to pumping blood, so when guy said he love you by the heart, that is bullshit, why i need a heart to love me? Train yr mind to focus on reality, where are you and what are you doing now, what is your next destination, your goals, throw away all those unwanted carving and longing or wanting feeling, move toward your goals, and as you move along, you sure to have more problem to settle than these type of longing feeling, your life will be much brighter and meaning, then bless him for all his best in his future.</p>

              <p>let me guess. christians no sex, so no way to progress further in the relationship right? boy you sound like very trouble yet experience in a relationship. go serve NS (make sure your maid don;t carry your field pack), go out work, then you will have tons of choices and time to meet better people and experince more in life before you make any decision.</p>

              <p>Dating wif gurls like u, r a waste of time.</p>
              <p>All u want to do is to play the "game", make the guy chase u and bargain ur price when all the time u're not interested in him.</p>
              <p>Although I am staunch buddhist n go to temple, but I have few close christian frens, who tell me about what they envision for their life partners.</p>
              <p>Chritians prefer genuine relationship. Problem wif u, is tat u r an unbeliever - so u may not have the same values tat christians value in a relationship or marriage. Christians want to look for a partner tat will compliment their growth and progress in church life. I once know a christian woman marry to a taosm man, with 3 children. They both fight over their children whether to go to church or temple.</p>
              <p>If u really serious about him, u should invest more time in his religion n see if u fit in. If not, then u r not tat interested in him afterall.</p>
              <p>For me, I would rather date someone who is of the same religion than waste my time wif somebody of another religion bcause we got a lot of differences. I prefer somebody who is staunch buddhist.</p>

              <p>TS, he does not want to get into a relationship with you...... And you are also not considering him as a partner..... both of you can remain as platonic good friends... i have lots a platonic girlfriends as well...so what's the problem?</p>
              <p>the chemistry and desire that you feel are fragments and memories from your previous relationship with him... but now that you and him have moved on, and are not prepared to go back into a relationship, then its better to look forward... and to be thankful that the two of you are still good friends</p>
