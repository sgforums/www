A young man, even though he could have any woman he wanted, would find it difficult to emulate the air and feel of a VMODM. They have their own charm no doubt, but its a different thing with what maturity seduction gives.<br><br>In astrology, Saturn's staying power is like wine - gets better with age. And ALL VMODM knows how to make use of this planetary influence and of course, Younger woman with Saturn in 7th house could likely marry an older man (although not neccessary chronologically speaking).<br><br>I wouldn't say an absolute NO to such relationship, however, I am more concern about the love attitude this man is equipped with.<br><br>There are solid reasons why marriages fail - [b]they don't fail for no reasons</strong>. Many times, it's the individual, not cause of the marriage itself. Sometimes its the life of the individual - people reject BGR cosmic lesson are forced to absorb the challenges their marriage bring forth. Some failed badly... others survived on a thin line.<br><br>A young woman, greenhorn in love, being tapped onto their vulnerability by VMODM, finds it enriching.<br><br>Psychologically and emotionally - there are four factors why VMODM would choose a very much younger woman. (Or vice vista in the woman's case)<br><br>I) To restore fallen charm (Feminine Charm)<br><br>II) Fatherly figure (Vice vista)<br><br>III) Desire for the youth... the innocence (Maturity)<br><br>IV) Easier to satisfy than woman of his peers. (Material satisfaction and abundance)<br><br>P.S: Attractions works in dual mode. With our needs being satisfied in any relationships, mutually and simultaneously.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers      [/b]</blockquote>i agree with yunhaier's points as follows:<br><span style="color: black;"><span class="large"><br>I) To restore fallen charm (Feminine Charm) [color=darkblue](tis i truely agree because vmodm has the charms to turn on like a tap as they have "experienced" many types of women </span><br><br>II) Fatherly figure (Vice vista) (true also, they need someone to "protect" them and give them advice, maybe a younger guy cant satisfy these needs)<br><br>III) Desire for the youth... the innocence (Maturity) (true, the old man wants innocence, the young gal wants maturity)<br><br>IV) Easier to satisfy than woman of his peers. (Material satisfaction and abundance) (true also, becuz women his age wld have achieved alot and dun want a man who hasnt achieved alot but women younger wouldnt have achieved much and think that a man having car would be damn great) </span>[/color]<span class="large"></span></div>
