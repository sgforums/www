            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Lim Ah Kow,<br><br>I concur with Devil1976 in that it's your friend's life to lead.  To often, many get so involved in their friends' lives, that they expect their friends to take their view &amp; follow it, &amp; there's No other correct way nor alternative for them to choose.<br><br>Whilst as friends, none of us would like our friends to suffer, &amp; sure, it hurts to see them cry, we can't force them to lead OUR lives only, &amp; to accept OUR views only, &amp; to do wat WE wld do only.<br><br>As friends, what we can do is listen &amp; offer advice, but recognise at the same time, that it's THEIR lives to live, &amp; THEIR lives to lead.  We shouldn't be so narrow-minded to think that our way is the ONLY right way.  There're other factors to consider, like the depth of her feelings, her character, &amp; so on...<br><br>You may disagree with me regarding this matter, but nonetheless, this is how I feel.  I've had friends in similar kinda positions, in which I think that what they're doing is only hurting themselves further, &amp; I do let them know what I think.  After saying that, I just focus on being a friend to them in need &amp; giving them a shoulder to cry on.  My advice to them is always this: "Think seriously about whether you really want this kinda sadness in the long-run.  If you think you're better off &amp; happier this way, I'll support your choice".<br><br>And that's how I've kept my friends.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by limahkow:</div><div class="quote_body">nobody is critisizing her but just that dun want to see her make mistakes after mistakes and only when she got pblems then she come and look for me, if not she also heck care about me<br><br>love is blind and that is why people will go for so called old men.. </div></blockquote></div>

'Drifting' is often when a person choose to live his / her in a semi-hallucinating state... Can be like in a dream... Can be in his / her own world... Can be when this person starts to believe that he / she won't (or don't have the need to) live for long....<br><br>How do you know her stories are 100% true? There're also often psychologically related cases where people like to make up their own stories (intentionally or unintentionally).... Else, it might be that like you've said.. Your friend has some sort of 'deficit' in her mental processing systems which can actually be amount to some medically (not sure if this is the right word to use?) related conditions...</div>

There're also often psychologically related cases where people like to make up their own stories (intentionally or unintentionally).... Else, it might be that like you've said..
