What sometimes seems 'best' or 'obvious' to us might only be of such values from our own point of view or consideration...<br><br>Nonetheless... If it's really such a foolish, especially BLIND decision.. Often it would not be so easily persuaded off... Stupidity is not something we can easily identify within ourselves at times, but only something which expresses itself in different forms and at different levels....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
