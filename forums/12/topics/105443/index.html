            <div class='col-md body'>Motivation. Comes from any where, any one, any thing. As gandhi always said, to cure one's disease, you got to experience it to truely understand and solve it. Shade343 said that i shouldn't try converting others, i didn't, i merely provided an excuse for SBSK for his parents, apparently, SBSK made a false claim. And i once tried out homosexuality. believe me, i truely hate it. But to help a person, you'll have to know how the person feels. Did you tried being a gay before? I guess not. Once again, im not forcing my ideas, rather, my suggestion is rather submissive and low toned. I am not a preacher, but just another suggester in this forum. But, no matter what, if what i have said offended you somehow, somewhere in your heart, i am sincerely sorry. I just speak my mind.<br><br>Anyway, back to the topic. How to motivate oneself? =) interesting question. So far, no one has perfected the formula, as every single individual is different from another. A orphan may want to experience love, and from love he would achieve motivation. A child born into a loving family may want to have grand ambitions to achieve motivation. Motivation varies between every individual, depending on what they have, what they want, and what they wish, simply translated as : 1) Present 2)short term goals 3) future and some others their past.<br><br>Aaron, from the frequent posts you wrote in "Aunt Agony", i can derive that you have a great understanding of the human psychology, and a heart that likes to help people during their dark periods in life. Reality can be seriously boring and repetitive, and all you can do now, is to try to change your mindset. Try to think work as a learning process, like studying in school, observe different people's attitudes and research mentally why are they like this, remember their faces and give them an big smile everytime they come back, treat it as a responsibility, busying yourself.<br><br>Self-motivation is one thing most singaporeans lack, because of the safe environment that singapore provides ( compared to other countries ) Most singaporeans may not like taking risks, unless they seek grand ambitions that are not achievable by small time businesses. Try planning a schedule for yourself, set yourself short term and long term goals. Short term goals maybe like "today, i must successfully deal with 10 customers" etc. It really works, and it motivates the most boring jobs.. Well, except for accounting  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> long term goals such as "i want to be promoted before the end of my job attachment" etc. A good combination of long term &amp; short term goals  would not only provide self-motivation, it would also boost self-confidence if success rates of completing the goals are high  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Aaron, you may want to try pursuing that love you were talking about, it would be a good experience, no matter what the outcome is. Just keep yourself busy, and take responsiblity for every single mistake you do, soon, your desire to change yourself for the better would be a great source of motivation.<br><br>Happiness, love, inspirations, hope,  faith, trust, and so on so forth are factors of motivation too. Try looking for them in your present life. Think positive, smile more, laugh more, be more easily satisfied. Stay happy k? Do not be so depressed, this forum may be your answer to your lack of motivation, you'll never know. I wish you all the best in life, and sincerely hope you'll find your motivation ASAP  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Goodnitez and take care~</div>

Once again, im not forcing my ideas, rather, my suggestion is rather submissive and low toned. I am not a preacher, but just another suggester in this forum. But, no matter what, if what i have said offended you somehow, somewhere in your heart, i am sincerely sorry. I just speak my mind.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Wow. I've definately NOT tried being a gay before. I like to try things for the sake of experiencing new highs,(excluding drugs/cigarettes), but being gay is a bit out of the question.</span><br><br>Anyway, back to the topic. How to motivate oneself? =) interesting question. So far, no one has perfected the formula, as every single individual is different from another. A orphan may want to experience love, and from love he would achieve motivation. A child born into a loving family may want to have grand ambitions to achieve motivation. Motivation varies between every individual, depending on what they have, what they want, and what they wish, simply translated as : 1) Present 2)short term goals 3) future and some others their past.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">I've been doing some soul-searching, and watching some naruto. It seems that perhaps, i just want to be recognised for who i am... </span><br><br>Aaron, from the frequent posts you wrote in "Aunt Agony", i can derive that you have a great understanding of the human psychology, and a heart that likes to help people during their dark periods in life. Reality can be seriously boring and repetitive, and all you can do now, is to try to change your mindset. Try to think work as a learning process, like studying in school, observe different people's attitudes and research mentally why are they like this, remember their faces and give them an big smile everytime they come back, treat it as a responsibility, busying yourself.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Thanks  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  I do try to observe everything that happens, just that once a while i get very tired, and don't feel like doing anything. That's what i'm talking about. When people say they run out of "steam".</span><br><br>Self-motivation is one thing most singaporeans lack, because of the safe environment that singapore provides ( compared to other countries ) Most singaporeans may not like taking risks, unless they seek grand ambitions that are not achievable by small time businesses. Try planning a schedule for yourself, set yourself short term and long term goals. Short term goals maybe like "today, i must successfully deal with 10 customers" etc. It really works, and it motivates the most boring jobs.. Well, except for accounting  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> long term goals such as "i want to be promoted before the end of my job attachment" etc. A good combination of long term &amp; short term goals  would not only provide self-motivation, it would also boost self-confidence if success rates of completing the goals are high  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Aaron, you may want to try pursuing that love you were talking about, it would be a good experience, no matter what the outcome is. Just keep yourself busy, and take responsiblity for every single mistake you do, soon, your desire to change yourself for the better would be a great source of motivation.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">That's true. I don't have any goals in life. Hmm, i should start setting some i guess, but once again lack of motivation to start goals... ah~~<br>That love is already lost.<br>I've changed quite a bit since i entered my poly life, and i'm still changing. For the better i hope. There's a chinese saying, "For every journey, it starts when you take the first step." Its the first step that's a bit hard to take sometimes.</span><br><br>Happiness, love, inspirations, hope,  faith, trust, and so on so forth are factors of motivation too. Try looking for them in your present life. Think positive, smile more, laugh more, be more easily satisfied. Stay happy k? Do not be so depressed, this forum may be your answer to your lack of motivation, you'll never know. I wish you all the best in life, and sincerely hope you'll find your motivation ASAP  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Goodnitez and take care~ </strong><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Hmm, have i stated that i feel rather emotionless for some time? I haven't felt happy for a long time, not because i'm sad, just because there's nothing in life to get truly happy about.<br>Love? I haven't experienced love in any form before... strange isn't it? Or maybe i have, but didn't recognise it...<br>Inspirations? Hope? Faith? Trust?<br>Hmm, i'm a truly practical person, maybe because of the events that have happened in my life, but generally i take each day as it comes.<br>Sometimes i feel like i'm on anti-depressants =_="'<br><br>I'll start setting some short-mid-long term goals soon. Hope that would perk me up. Thanks for the help Ledikusa  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </span><br><br></blockquote></div>
