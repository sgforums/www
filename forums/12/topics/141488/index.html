As a friend you could only advice but not chose what she wants in life.<br><br>My advice for you now is to get ready for your final exams. The results of your exams will follow you throughout your life not her. I know is tough for you but I hope you will think for your furture.<br><br>I too made the same mistake in taking too much time off to deal with girls. In the end my result was very bad and the girl went away. I was lucky that with my hard work I managed to recover from my mistake. It was not easy and I had to face up to the fact that I had to show my poor result everytime when people ask me for it<br><br></div>
