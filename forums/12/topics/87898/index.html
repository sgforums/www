When one is in a relationship... U got to be able to handle many aspects... Ur prob wif ur gf, ur studies or work etc. Coz, sometimes, there are bound to be friction or unhappiness btw the both of u... Then if u r unable to control ur feelins, how r u able to cope wif ur studies or work?<br><br>u have a very gd grp of friends who r very concerned about u... U shouldn't avoid them or give them tao tao attitude... Think of urself in their shoes... One of ur gd friend is in the worst of mood, N he sorta of tak it out on his gd friends wif his moody attitude... Tis already kinda of hard to tak it, yet, all of u all are concerned about him, his studies n his happiness... Hop tat he will buck up, n be his normal self... Yet their concern is not appreciated n yet, is sorta of given the cold shoulder...<br><br>Rejection is part n parcel of life... If she is meant to be urs, she will be urs... No pt forcin things... Mayb if u really can get tog, but tat doesn meant tat u will be happy both tog... It doesn mean tat u will be happy all along... U may think tat u both can get along very well... But surely, there is no perfect relationship in the world...<br><br>U r still young, studyin i presume... U still got a long way to go... Immersing urself in studies n cca is a gd thing, but don over tire urself, or neglect ur friends... Sometimes, if things get too overboard, u may jus lose not only the gal u lik, but a bunch of gd friends too...<br><br>People changed rapidly, esp in ur adolescent yrs... She may seems to be the perfect gal in ur eye... But few yrs down the road, i think tat ur likin of gals will changed totally...<br><br>Rather, u should focus on ur studies, get gd grades, gd degrees... In the future, get a gd job... U will be flooded by bountiful of gals! U willl have no lack of suitors...<br><br>Try to forget her... It is hard, but u should try, ur best to slowly forget her... concentrate on other things... Even if u wanna think, u shouldn't let it affects ur mood... Eg, i usually put on a front, no matter how sad or unhappy i am... Usually in my private moments, b4 goin to slp, etc, then i start thinkin of watever tat hunts me or hurts me...<br><br>i wish u all the best... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
