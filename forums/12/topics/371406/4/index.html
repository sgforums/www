              <p>I think that man deserved to have his "marriage" broken to piece wat. You think that man is deserving of sympathy meh ? Can you stop using your dick as a brain ?</p>
              <p>And since she aborted ONCE before.. why would that IDIOT shoot his sperm into her womb AGAIN ?????? You got consider this point or not har ?</p>
              <p>Sorry to dissapoint you hor. I got a lot of married men approach me before, and I always tell them that I will report them to their wifeys if they do not stop lah.</p>
              <p>All of them use the same old story lah.. Their wife don't treat them well lah.. contemplating divorce lah.... wife very bitch lah... all kinds of sad story to gain pity lor. But hor.. too bad lah..I not naive girl leh..... LOL.. !!! Hear already also bored, at least use a bit of creativity lah.</p>

              <p>Talking about which, to my understanding, it is not right to break into a relationship according to you.</p>
              <p>To the guy who is involved in this situation, his wife did not mind the affair and will not break the family because of this. If you are TS's friend, you would advise her to carry on what she is doing?</p>
              <p>Knowing the fact that a family might be broken and the upgrowing of the child would be compromised just because TS want to make the guy's life miserable by wanting him to hate her.</p>
              <p>Knowing that TS's current state of mind is unstable as there are emotional waves that pregnancy can cause and that TS wanting that guy to hate him is like wanting him to feel for her.</p>
              <p>As I mentioned before, hating a person is impossible when you do not love/care for that person. TS would fail, by making herself miserable for the guy in question, I would say, would not care a dime about her.</p>

              <p>If a man has no intention of breaking up his own family.. why would he fuck outside with another woman and make her pregnant TWICE ?</p>
              <p>Yes indeed.. I know women can be very emotional especially during their pregnancies.</p>
              <p>TS may be emotional.. but we the forumers need NOT be.</p>
              <p>I have already mentioned in my previous post that she cannot make that man love the child, just as she cannot force him to love her. And none can make one hate another if one does not feel hatred towards a person.</p>
              <p>Look beyond her emotional rants and seek what are the rights a mother must fight for the child.</p>

              <p>I think you got a personality problem.  And its definitely something very wrong with you to keep pressing people into the mould you want others to think and behave.</p>
              <p>And as mentioned, you tend to dictate.  If thats not a sign of self centredness and attempts to force and control.  I do not know what else it is.</p>

              <p>Okay, an affair would not be an affair without a marriage in place. There are always people who mess around even they have a marriage in place although they have no intention in breaking their current family. That however does not limit to guys only.</p>

              <p>It is because if she think she is not financial stable and unable to upbring the child by her own, she should had aborted the child like the first time round.</p>

              <p><br> I would say the same logic applies to you.</p>
              <p>But since you think you are right.  I got nothing to
              argue.</p>
              <p>How much will you prefer, to have your own partner/child/family
              members, be stalked by someone obsessed with him/her irrespective
              of any sexual relations happening.</p>
              <p>How much do you think you will prefer, to have someone
              'love/hate' you/your partner/your child, sending you/your
              partner/child informations which you do not like, or making
              connections which you do not like?</p>
              <p>Are you the all magnimous wife, that tells the hubby:  its
              okay lah, go for breakfast, dinner, supper with some other woman,
              even if i know that some other woman is interested in your
              hubby?  And you are happier when that happens?</p>

              <p>You ever fight paternity case before ah ?</p>
              <p>DNA test only one week. cost less than 1k. How long can a paternity suit drag ? You mean the lawyers must go to trial and fight their cases and wait for the judges to decide if the father is indeed the father or not ah ? LOL !!!!!</p>
              <p>All the court need to establish paternity is a DNA test result. No need to fight until face green green between the two sides lawyers.</p>
              <p>You must be very poor issit ? LOL !!!</p>

              <p><br>Trying to behave like a bigot, does not mean you are not one. J.</p>
              <p>And since you mention it as a paternity case, then we should go back to refering this issue as related to legal issues.</p>
              <p>and no matter how long the DNA test takes, nor how much it costs.</p>
              <p>The hurdle to get a paternity test in the first place on a unwilling person, is what I mean about how much and long this legal proceeding will take. ie. court order.</p>
              <p>And in case you are confused with whatever drugs or alcohol you are on now.  Or that you are in some sort of lack of sleep situation.</p>
              <p>In order to get a paternity test, for the father to take, you need a court order. (Which I believe is what you suggested to TS).</p>
              <p>That takes time to file papers and bring it up to mention in court.</p>
              <p>And in the event this is going to happen in Singapore.  Because TS and the man is not married,  the man is married to someone else.  It wont even get a mention.</p>
