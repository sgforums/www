              <p>I doubt if a male would bother about being made bankrupt or fear the legal time and costs taken to do so. But what is stopping him from impregnating every women on the street is women themselves. Not all women, espacially modern women, would cheapen themselves to being carpet for men to walk all over them.</p>
              <p>However, I do agree that when a female had sex or gets pregnant by a male outside of wedlock, the male must bear the full consequence for the action and reactions caused.</p>
              <p>This is not something preachy or of moral debate, but a responsible and matured determination to correct a wrong done, more so to precious budding innocent human life soon to come into the world, regardless of who is the biological father. </p>
              <p>We are not animals, but civilised beings, and must protect the innocent, espacially our young, or else we are no better than beasts of the wild, and should rightfully be treated as such to be mocked and chastisize for life.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>So what you are essentially saying is that men do not have self-control nor any sense of integrity, but relys on the moral level of women to not go around behaving like horny animals ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And if we are to throw a man into a pitful of immoral women, then he'd be on a unstoppable rampage to impregnate all the women there ?</p>

              <p><br>It's understandable from the all the posts that she need to seek legal advices since the male party is not willing to acknowledge the fact that the child is his. And such, the lawyer would be engaged first.</p>
              <p>Then after the letter is served, the male party chose to ignore, then she would need to proceed with court proceeding...</p>
