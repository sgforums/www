              <p><br> It's understandable from the all the posts that she need to seek
              legal advices since the male party is not willing to acknowledge
              the fact that the child is his. And such, the lawyer would be
              engaged first.</p>
              <p>Then after the letter is served, the male party chose to ignore,
              then she would need to proceed with court proceeding...</p>
              <p>Thus most people would just move on. Cos legal fees would be a
