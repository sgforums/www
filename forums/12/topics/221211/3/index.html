            <div class='col-md body'>ATTENTION ALL PPL and that includes Claire.....<br><br>After so much reading on the links....the blogs....the forums....it makes me confused...<br><br>Read this....<br>********************<br><br>Hi Claire,<br>I'm afraid you are mistaken. No one is accusing you, Doug or whoever of anything, i am merely trying to point out a few discrepancies in the entire letter/premonition thing.<br><br>Date and Timeline versus rationale<br>1) Your first post in your blog was dated 16th November 2006 at 12:49 PM.<br><br>2) Doug first post in ohgenki forum was dated 17th November 2006 at 12:15 PM.<br><br>3) Strangely enough, the manner in which Doug's 1st posted in the forums was to seek the views of others yet he strangely enough fail to mention anything with regards to the letter.<br><br>4) Presuming he sent the letter after 17th November, then how could it be that you receive the letter on 16th November? And if he had sent it earlier, why then does Doug bother to seek advice when the deed is done and over with?<br><br>5) It still does not make sense why Doug refuse to make contact with you when he bothered to send you a letter. The direct link to your blog was coincidentally provided by 'heartbeat' who coincidentally is a new member in ohgenki forums yet also happens to be from TalkBack forum.<br><br>As much as i respect the unknown, you, Doug or any individual who might be involved in this matter, does the entire thing appear logical?<br><br>It is clear that Doug repeatedly claimed to be sane and not a stalker etc in the ohgenki forum thread but the manner in which he revealed his past course of actions seems a little irrational. Would you not agree?<br><br>As for 'heartbeat', perhaps he/she might be a coincidental person though the account is questionable. Interestingly, Mr Pry sent me a PM too in KeepTouch forums.<br><br>"Nice observation but... You think you know what's coming.... you don't have a clue."<br><br>And once again, coincidentally Mr. Pry is a new member in KT forum with only 1 post and he sent me the PM at 12:04PM today. See any time pattern?<br><br>I do believe that there are many things beyond human comprehension but isn't there a tad too many discrepancies and coincidences in this matter? *shrugs*<br><br>PS: Claire, if you are honestly an innocent victim in this matter and would rather play it safe. I suppose you ought to avoid whatever Doug suggested. However if Doug does contact/meet you, it might be safer to have someone you trust 100% nearby.<br><br>*************************<br><br>so what makes me puzzled is that....is Claire making this up?or is it real?its not uncommon to have de javu coz i too had a couple of times....or is this another final destination drama o rama? who noes....<br><br>but wat i advice is.....approach ur family 4 advice....then if u r to scared to face e pro alone...seek help frm e police...not NPP...but experts...even if u wish to face this person...alwys remember to bring ur family...my advice summary is don face alone...this concerns bout ur life....its better to seek police n family...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Mr. Pry, I have never seen a more poorly executed viral marketing campaign. I think whoever hired you really wasted their money. And you sir should really go back and do some retraining. You suck. You really put us off. You completely screwed up on this one. You think by doing this you can stoke people's interest to watch this movie?<br><br>Do you know what this forum is? This is for people with real problems, not a channel for you to spam your commercial junk, let me remind you that. What you've done was completely distasteful and disgusting.</div>
