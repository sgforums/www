Those who have experienced the feeling describe it as an overwhelming sense of familiarity with something that shouldn't be familiar at all.<br><br>There is much speculation as to how and why this phenomenon happens. Many parapsychologists believe it is related to a past-life experience.<br><br>Maybe in his past life he knew you.<br><br>Freaky that he is having visions of you in an accident. Maybe you should take some precautions. You never know. I guess I am a little superstitious about these kind of things.<br><br>I have experienced it before. When I was in egypt certain places seemed familiar but I've never been there before. Quite wierd but very real. Anyone else ever experience this sort of thing? </div></blockquote>actually, i have. When i meet someone, or go somewhere, 10% of the time i would feel that the place is extremely familiar though I've never seen it before.</div>
