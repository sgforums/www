              <p>At least you recognised you need to do something, that's the first step. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"></p>
              <p>Start by thinking of something you enjoyed doing; prephaps walking, dancing, or kite flying or even bus spotting, you can find many of them in this forum . and then you can join a soical group and meet new people.</p>
              <p>Of course, it's much easier said than done, you may feel very uncomfortable at the start.  You need to push yourself out of your comfort zone to combat the shyness. </p>
              <p>Try to look confidence psychically. Swing your arms when you go out walking. Stand up stand and straight and you will feel confident naturally. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"> <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              When patients feel at their most vulnerable, Head of medical
              social services at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) Ms Esther
              Lim steps in to help them make sense of what is
              happening.</span></p>

              patients may have tried to take their own lives or showed signs of
              wanting to do so. Ms Lim also helps families cope when they have
              lost a loved one.</span></p>

              39-year-old's helping hand is extended not just to patients, but
              also to hospital staff who face challenges at home or at work, for
              instance, if they have been abused by a patient.</span></p>

              she pioneered a programme in SGH to train health-care and social
              work professionals in suicide intervention. It is now also offered
              in SingHealth's Postgraduate Allied Health Training
              Institute.</span></p>

              becoming a social worker in 1995, Ms Lim, who leads a team of 85
              medical social workers, has received more than 15 awards. Last
              year, she was one of two recipients of the Outstanding Social
              Worker Awards given out by the Singapore Association of Social
              Workers.</span></p>

              working in the emergency department years ago, I saw how a crisis,

              <p>(1) financially, livelihood. are you having finacial problem for your basic necesities? meals, education lodging etc? you said you not a loner, do you are yu addicted also to other actvitie sthat do not interfere with your inability to socialize?</p>
              <p>(2) you need to channel this negative energy into doing something that do not require you to interact much. like a hobby or sports to start with. then expand your social circle from this hobby sports or activity you do. in this way likeminded individuals will have similar topic to start a conversation and keep each otehr company active.</p>

              <p>a few advises, if it helps...</p>
              <p>1) try to remain in treatment, with treatment the symtom is more controllable which equate to better employability..</p>
              <p>2) frankly when looking for job.. not much job option as getting employ is slim.. But is not immpossible.. can start with like fast food restauarant.. my encounter is happiliy working in F&amp;B..</p>
              <p>3) seek family service centre and CDC help.. Family service centre can offer you some additional counselling when you need to and at same time may help you to find work, CDC can help you to find work... but do note, getting help from them does not means job will come automatically you too need to put in effort....</p>

              <p>Now my question is about getting job.</p>
              <p>At 24 years old, with a completely blank resume except for
              name/address/bad O-level cert, how can I even get a job? I am not
              good at anything at all. My life since young has been spent
              entirely in depression, anxiety, fear, guilt and hatred.</p>
              <p>I cannot remember the last time I smiled. I even forget my birth
              date because I have never celebrated my birthday as far as I can
              recall (maybe only when I was born, that’s it).</p>
              <p>In the very rare chance I am accepted for job interview, what do
              I say to the hiring manager if he asks why am <span>I
              24</span> with blank resume, no job experience &amp; no tertiary
              education? Should I confess that I been spending my free time at
              <span>IMH</span> and <span>CGH</span>? Should I
              tell him about my mental disorders?</p>
              <p>Even if I do not reveal that I have any mental disorders, within
              the first few hours or days at a job, it will definitely become
              apparent. That is the nature of my conditions. Any stranger or
              person who interacts with me will instinctively know that I am
              abnormal. That is the main reason I am avoided and outcasted by
              people, because they sense a deep darkness and abnormality in
              me.</p>
              <p>If I can even get discharged from NS because none of my officers
              can put up with me as I screw up everything everyday (and I never
              got punished even once), how easy it would be for a normal employer
              (who has no compulsory obligation to his employee) to fire me from
              a job?</p>

              <p>If a person with Down Syndrome and other handicap can find a job, i'm sure you .. with all limbs functioning can also find a job.</p>
              <p>You just need to be very honest when you apply for a job.</p>
              <p>Your employer needs to be realistic about expectations.</p>
              <p>The problem with your condition is that you look like a normal person. So your potential employer will expect you to perform at a normal level.</p>
              <p>When you fall short, due to your condition, they will be dissapointed and feel short changed.. that's why they let you go.</p>
              <p>But if you start off with realistic expectations .. giving consideration to your special conditions..they will expect less of you.. and when you perform as expected.. they will not be surprised.</p>
              <p>Of course, you have to also be realistic about your personal expectations.. since you are well aware of your special conditions.. you need to set realistic expectations of what your potential employer is willing to pay you.</p>
              <p>There are jobs out there and employers out there for people with similar conditions. You just need to find the right match.</p>

              <p>TS, have you ever thought about arts? Like drawing to express your feelings?</p>
              <p>You can write songs too. You can write, right? Maybe you can join a song writing course and be a songwriter. </p>

              <p>TS, if you can write such a detail account of yr problem (even asking someone doing on yr behalf), there is certainly hope for you. </p>
              <p>Don't take big step as to think about "what is your future". Take a small step first....</p>
              <p>I have a friend who has similar problem..but maybe not as serious as yours. She is on medication and now working in a ticketing counter. No stress..</p>
              <p>Tell yourself, i m going to focus and work for a day successfully. I will control my emotion for a full day. Next focus to work successfully for 3 days....a week and so on.</p>
              <p>Give yourself an objective or aim why you want to do it. Have a religion to fall on would also help you.</p>
              <p>Wishing you all the best !</p>

              <p>Now my question is about getting job.</p>
              <p>At 24 years old, with a completely blank resume except for name/address/bad O-level cert, how can I even get a job? I am not good at anything at all. My life since young has been spent entirely in depression, anxiety, fear, guilt and hatred.</p>
              <p>I cannot remember the last time I smiled. I even forget my birth date because I have never celebrated my birthday as far as I can recall (maybe only when I was born, that’s it).</p>
              <p>In the very rare chance I am accepted for job interview, what do I say to the hiring manager if he asks why am <span>I 24</span> with blank resume, no job experience &amp; no tertiary education? Should I confess that I been spending my free time at <span>IMH</span> and <span>CGH</span>? Should I tell him about my mental disorders?</p>
              <p>Even if I do not reveal that I have any mental disorders, within the first few hours or days at a job, it will definitely become apparent. That is the nature of my conditions. Any stranger or person who interacts with me will instinctively know that I am abnormal. That is the main reason I am avoided and outcasted by people, because they sense a deep darkness and abnormality in me.</p>
              <p>If I can even get discharged from NS because none of my officers can put up with me as I screw up everything everyday (and I never got punished even once), how easy it would be for a normal employer (who has no compulsory obligation to his employee) to fire me from a job?</p>

              <p>you cannot started working in normal industires. nothing with blank resume. but worry thing is the incredible hulk inside you.</p>
              <p>go join some welfare or handicap schools. start small. what is the nearest thing you like to do? turn it to some form of work for a living.</p>
              <p>now its getting normal getting ajob. youhave no other family commiments should be okay. its all up to you. while you can take medicine timely, don skip it, keeping a fresh open mind is the key.</p>
              <p>i do doubt your medical conditions though. cant socialize but still cannot be alone? to my knowledge schizoids are never alone, and they usually wont mind withut company.</p>
              <p>yors this tupe are nothing lah. just start small. IMH anyone can go in. its problem of the mind. 'depress' people also can go in. the mind is so compaex. unless you wanna go police station test the lie detector - wed see if you really go problem truth or not. dont tok about army lah, army all sorts of monkeys also got.</p>
