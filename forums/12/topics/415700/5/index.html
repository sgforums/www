              <p>Anyways, in this present job...it was still really bad. Like, I ran away and also, I hid in the toilet. And they told me to go outside to do waitressing and the customers got really angry with me. (I was in the kitchen but did really badly)</p>
              <p>The younger people were all so good at working and all. All I did over there was hiding and running and standing. People over there were imitating me and made it come true for me....all I can do was to stand there and let them 'ridicule' themselves.</p>
              <p>I really can't do F&amp;B. It's really tough for me. I have to think for people and people have to think of me. I can't read body languages well and I don't understand alot of things human related.</p>
              <p>I just want to quit this job again. Please really do suggest a much, much simpler job.</p>

              <p>Go work in a factory then.</p>
              <p>Some of them pay really well.</p>
              <p>Go look in the classifieds or smth. Kaki Bukit/Jurong there got alot.</p>
              <p>BTW, if you plan to continue living in a human society, then social skills are a MUST. If you insist that you cannot learn these skills or don't want to pick them up, then you might as well go live in the Jungle.</p>
              <p>The easiest and cheapest solution to your problems is to improve your social skills/EQ. Unfortunately, it seems that you cannot comprehend this.</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>And please don't tell me that it's impossible, becoz I've been there and done that.</p>
              <p>If your solution to every problem you encounter is to give up, then I can say that nothing in life will change for you. No fairy godmother is going to come down and give you everylasting happiness. You're gonna have to do all this yourself.</p>

              <p>I really give my best serious and you know what? There's this young person that told me that I'd probably work for 1 week and quit. You know what? I bet she's going to report that to the management and they are going to fulfil it for me soon, just like yesterday, a mere part timer asked me to come to work during the night and I came and she smiled slyly at me. (Because I just asked if she's the supervisor and she just said yes)</p>
              <p>Many things I did here, they ask and I give them and they just say yes,yes and then they just made it self-fulfiling for me. I can't avoid all of them because once they ask me and I tell them, they just 'give in'.</p>
              <p>How do I give myself a chance when people at work don't give it to me.</p>

              <p><br>I don't think you understand what I'm saying.</p>
              <p>Then let me repeat it again. IMPROVE YOUR SOCIAL SKILLS. Plain and simple enough?</p>
              <p>You think that other people cause you to be miserable, but in actual fact, YOU are the reason why you're miserable. You're above 18, not some 10yo little kid. I think it's high time you learn to fend for yourself.</p>
              <p>It'll be too complicated for me to type out everything here. So I'll sum it up with this =&gt; Look beyond yourself. Right now, I can say that you only see yourself. You don't see others. You don't know how they feel. You only know how you feel. You don't know why they treat you the way they did. You only know you've got plently of excuses for your behavior. If you fail to understand people, then people will not want to understand you.</p>
              <p>Don't expect others to give first. You do the giving and the sacrificing. And if you succeed, people will naturally give back to you.</p>
