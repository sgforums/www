I still don't agree it's different lifestyle...don't make sense. If you have love, you can compromise. It can be either side is stuborn or the love has died off or care too much about their selves rather than make this relationship try to work out.<br><br>Lifestyle differences doesn't make you love less. I have seen cases of couples with different lifestyles together really put effort to work on the free time to spend with each other. Lifestyle differences is just an excuse.<br><br>doko</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My opinions:<br><br>1. Guys come to this forum to whine coz they dun have other revenues or sources to vent their frustrations. I suppose they feel uneasy with their male counterparts if they were to tell them their frustrations as it is a social stigma that guys should be macho and not behave whiney. Thus, forums are a good place coz nobody knows who they really are.<br><br>2. Most people come to forums with problems and asked for solutions. Some came for solutions whereas some came to rally support for their decisions.<br><br>3. Gals normally won't tell guys what she is unhappy in the relationship coz they think that if the bf really cares about them, he should be more inquisite or more sensitive in observing what makes her unhappy. But, little do they know that guys are rarely equipped with the ability of sensitiveness. Thus, gals become upset when their bfs still seem nonchalant about the whole issue. So, gals should actually tell guys what they are unhappy about and not let guys guess.<br><br>4. Sometimes when a relationship fails, its not because they are uncompatible in characters or such. It is because they have taken the relationship for granted. They thought that if the other partner really love them, they should "sacrifice" for them. But they have forgotten the way they behaved when they first fall in relationship.

But it needs to occur first. Nothing lasts forever. I liken &lt;<span style="color: red;">Bontakun</span>'s&gt; signature about love. Both parties need to put a lot of effort to maintain this relationship. It's a two-way thing. Not the guy giving in too much nor the girl too. Respect, trust and understanding for each other is essential. If one party breaks the trust, the relationship loses it's strength.<br><br>If the guy treats the girl well and respects her without being a doormat, I don't see why the girl should treat him back the same way unless she has an attitude problem.<br><br>That's why I never feel that a breakup is as simple as incompatibility. I view it as an excuse. With regards to your elements such as goals, objectives, character and personality issues, I feel that everyone is an individual and has different thinking. It's about compromising with one another, coupled with how much love both parties have for each other. Respect and support is essential.

Not necessary to go to expensive restaurant.  Going to somewhere affordable, cosy.  You could try going on dutch, but from the view point of females, think for the first date it is only good that the guys offer to pay (especially this is a date, a date means the guy is seeking opportunities to impress the lady he likes).<br><br>Do be sensitive, caring, attentive, communicative during the date.  To quote you a real life eg, a friend went on a date with a guy.  The guy brought her to food court, this was OK for the lady.  The guy told the gal that he can't afford to buy her meal and without asking her what she would like to drink, he went ahead to order coffee for her.  This friend did not enjoy the date and said that after drinking coffee she had stomach upset.  So, do be sensitive to the  other party during date.  I can't understand why the guy can't afford say spend  below $5 to buy a meal in a food court for the lady, OMG!</div>
