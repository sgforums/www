My question is, how is the guy going to communicate when the girl don't want to talk when everyone is empahsising on the importance of communication?<br><br>Married: Are you telling us your marriage problems or are those problems you have stated those problems of other people?<br><br>doko<br><br></div></blockquote>Hi, Doko  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Nice to talk to you again.  Well, there are girls behave that way you mentioned above.  Guess the girl is not ready to talk or just don't feel like bringing it up, or she is afraid if she brings on the subject he will not be able to take it or get angry or hurt.  Well, if she is not ready to talk may be wait till she is in good mood and so happen you two are on the same topic or things relating to the topic you could gently, tactfully ask her again.  Hee hee, I usually will communicate on what's on the mind unless I am not prepare to talk about it.  Communicate is of utmost importance in any relationship.  If we don't make things clear and depend on assuming - then like what a man told me b4 "just making an ass out of you and me" (oops, sounds rude but that's what was told by him).  I agree with this saying.<br><br>Me, I am just quoting what happen to my friends' marriages.  Sigh, don't know why man can go on sleeping with other woman even after wife confronted him and he promised he won't do it again.<br><br>There are many differences between male and female that's why it's not easy to keep relationship going.  I do learn a little from the books by JOhn Gray.  Just to share a bit - he was interviewed on radio and he mentioned that his wife said it is OK to look at women but don't drool.    There are far too many things we have to learn about from both genders and hope after learning we could put these to practice then there will be less stress and fewer problems.<br><br></div>

If not, there would not be more divorces and breakups or guys having problems chasing girls.<br><br>Don't get me wrong. They are still good. I still believe there are certain things that are missing from his books.  And I would like to thank you for posting.<br><br>doko</div>
