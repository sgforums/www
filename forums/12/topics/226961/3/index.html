You need IQ ,EQ, patience and yr six sense to woo a gal.  Gal are more sensitive to guys reaction, maybe not all. You need to pay more attention to their body language and respond on time. Someone in other forum mention those born in 80's r strawberry generation, abit abit also cannot tahan!<br></div>
