Not necessary to go to expensive restaurant.  Going to somewhere affordable, cosy.  You could try going on dutch, but from the view point of females, think for the first date it is only good that the guys offer to pay (especially this is a date, a date means the guy is seeking opportunities to impress the lady he likes).<br><br>Do be sensitive, caring, attentive, communicative during the date.  To quote you a real life eg, a friend went on a date with a guy.  The guy brought her to food court, this was OK for the lady.  The guy told the gal that he can't afford to buy her meal and without asking her what she would like to drink, he went ahead to order coffee for her.  This friend did not enjoy the date and said that after drinking coffee she had stomach upset.  So, do be sensitive to the  other party during date.  I can't understand why the guy can't afford say spend  below $5 to buy a meal in a food court for the lady, OMG!</div></blockquote>Rane<br><br>Nice nick you have there.

You can treat all you want but you have to know her preferences and she has to more or less understand yours. Going to a place which she don't really like to eat is not that nice right?

If restaurant is out, then of course food court would be a better place to bring her rather than hawker centre.   Choose a nice food court.  If you notice, nowadays there are food courts which are rather quite pleasant to eat and chat there.  For eg, foodcourt at wisma, and few others located in shopping centres.<br><br>for your info, the guy who went out with the gal is not poor.  Come on he is working, think he is rather stingy, not willing to spend a few dollars on the first date! Not as if gals expect expensive food every appointment.   If he is stingy on first date, then he will be stingy the whole of his life liao!!!!   So far, I don't see any stingy guy change.

It definitely takes two to clap in any relationship.<br><br>Dating:  Come across mummy's boys, spend too much time with buddies, stingy and have never bought Valentines' Day/birthday presents, can't be trusted, flirt with other gals, want girlfriend to stay home and not go out, self centred, not caring.  Refuse to communicate when there are problems.  Bf is insecure.<br><br>Marriage:  Don't help to do housework and look after kids, everyday come back home late - 2 to 3 am and expect sex (unemployed).  Gave hubby $ to start business for 2 times, hubby continued to take things for granted and still ask for more $.  Hubby comes home everyday after dinner play computer games and refuse to take care of kids.  Extra marital affair.  Wife unemployed but still continue to look for job, husband is insensitive and uncaring told wife off saying that she is lazy, refuse to look for job and does not help to provide her financial need during her unemployment.<br><br>Well, well, the above are just some of the problems in a relationship.  We need to be open to each other's needs, moods, and problems to improve the relationship.  If one party refuses to do so, then relationship won't work.  Nobody is perfect, but whenever there are issues or problems to be addressed, both parties must be mature, objective, sensitive, understanding and proactive to sort things out.<br><br>Hope the above help you to have a clear picture of those things that happen in some relationships.</div></blockquote>Great examples!<br></div>

But it needs to occur first. </div></blockquote>True.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by dokono:<br><br>Nothing lasts forever. I liken  signature about love. Both parties need to put a lot of effort to maintain this relationship. It's a two-way thing. Not the guy giving in too much nor the girl too. Respect, trust and understanding for each other is essential. If one party breaks the trust, the relationship loses it's strength.<br><br>If the guy treats the girl well and respects her without being a doormat, I don't see why the girl should treat him back the same way unless she has an attitude problem.<br><br>That's why I never feel that a breakup is as simple as incompatibility. I view it as an excuse. With regards to your elements such as goals, objectives, character and personality issues, I feel that everyone is an individual and has different thinking. <span style="color: red;"><strong>It's about compromising with one another, coupled with how much love both parties have for each other. Respect and support is essential. That is really love, not attraction. </strong></span><br>doko</blockquote>Well said.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Men, when will u grow up?  Yes, mere attraction cannot or does not necessarily means relationship will last!  Think most of the time, in general (not referring to every female huh) females are the ones who give a  lot in a relationship, while the vast majority (not referring to every male) of the males are just not.    Why why!!!<br><br>Me can't stand those men who refuse to help in housework and marry the wife just to get her to do housework!!!</div>
