Maybe you don't know him well enough before starting this relationship, hmmm.  I feel that you should give him a chance to change, confront him and tell him u r unhappy about the way he's treating u.  If he really luv u, he will reflect on his behaviour and even showered u with more care and concern than you hav expected.  Give it another try...<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>doubt it. someone who can say such things to fren "you are a f**king ass***e", lest to say a gf prolly has no manners or proper upbringing at all. i doubt many of u out there have frens who are rude enuff to say such things to pp they know.<br><br>my guess is such a person is pretty close to an ah beng who will never change so drop him while u can.dont let me guess it, he prolly hit u a couple of times before? sounds like a potential wife beater to me.<br><br>[This message has been edited by userid (edited 02 June 2002).]</div>
