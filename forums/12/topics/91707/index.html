Dun patch up too fast if the only reason to is that both of you HAD good times.<br><br>Have a good heart-to-heart talk. find out the real problems (e.g. whether she's afraid about commitments..tired etc)....also lend a listening ear about her busy schedule...b understanding and help her whatever you can along the way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Relationship is not only about love, its about commitment too. Both of you must be willing to go through good/bad times with each other. Whats the point if you only stay for good time but break up the next momment theres a little hardship.</div>

After chilling, she regreted? It really wonders how on earth can your relationship survive future hardship, especially it couldn't even bypass such simple issue?<br><br>She needs to understand and evolve her attitude towards her own love affairs - develop a new mindset for it.
