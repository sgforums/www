No doubt about that. Just read between the lines.<br><br>4) Your local gf has been very good to you. However, you are being a jerk by not returning her the favour. Thus, you are not worthy of her.<br><br>5) Actually the solution is very simple. Just think logically with your head. And by head, i mean the one on top. Not down there.<br><br>6) Please practice safe sex. Especially with such people.<br><br>7) Stop being blinded by lust. After work, go out play play nevermind. But know what you have and appreciate it. Don't be stupid.</div>

And back in your own country, you are wondering which girlfriend you should marry.<br><br>I don't think F confused your life dude. She just confused you, that's all. You have a woman of 5 years and you are willing to throw her aside for a quarrelsome , flirtatious relationship that came together simply because somebody got knocked up. So what even if you were in love with F, who had a relationship with a married man. And she was messing around with you until they broke up. Doesn't sound like you know anything about her at all mate.<br><br>And you know what sucks, is if you do choose F over your long time girlfriend S, you'd better be ready for the consequences. All the consequences. Since F has dumped all her boyfriends and she is now pregnant with your child, you have no more choice but to let S go. Then when your marriage with F falls apart because she gets bored with you, you will go back to S and F will go back to the Caucasian boyfriends she has been flirting with. Her admirers will take her back because she is probably hot and attractive but guess what, S won't take you back because you're nothing like Brad Pitt.<br><br>What you probably need to do now is marry none of them and think long and hard about the word Loyalty. Just another story about unavailable people betraying partners they are supposed to be loyal to, that's all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>quarelling+ lying = low interest rate on you. If she really loves you, will she quarel + lie? Anyway, she is using the baby to tie you up. U must ensure to wear condom every time ma but you prefer raw sex. In other word , i can say she has a good plan. I also think that she is making up the story about those rich ang mo la to raise her status and lie to you that she loves you. I comfirm after she suck ur money dry, she will run. Be careful.<br><br>If u want a wife. No need to be so pretty. Personality is very important cos she is ur life time partner. If u sianz about your girl, then go geylang and have some free hot fark but wear condom pls.</div>
