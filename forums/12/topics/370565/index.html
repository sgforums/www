              <p>Edit: The original post is posted to gauge what the reactions of people will be like to sociopath, as part of my personal research. A sociopath is someone without guilt or conscience. I had posted the same post in a few other forums.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I decide to stop my test when someone reported this post to the authorities. I think that is way too serious.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, I never kill any animal. I do kill insects but never torture them.</p>

              <p>I think you may have some psychological problems. I heard from my lecturer that people who feel no guilt for doing bad things suffer from some psychological conditons. Seeing a psychiatrist and taking medications may be the best course of actions for you.</p>
              <p>2ndly, I will advise you to stop freezing innocent animals to death. It is against the laws to ill-treat animals. You may get into troubles with SPCA.</p>
              <p>3rdly, I will say feeling is  not everything. You can feel excited at hurting others and yet not hurt others. You may not feel guilt, but the fact that you are asking for help, shows that you at least have some ideas of what is right and wrong.</p>
              <p>Try controling your excitement, by finding something else to do. Do charity works, contribute your time to doing good things.</p>
              <p>The actual deed itself matters more than any feeling. If you do good works even though you feel like doing evil instead, your acts of good works outweight your feelings of evil.</p>
              <p>That is the preciousness of free-will. You can choose not to act on your feelings/thoughts.</p>

              <p>What is guilt and what is conscience? I truly wonder because I don't think I have either.</p>
              <p>I love to catch insects in my containers and put them into the burning pots. I love to watch my cockroaches, lizards, grasshopppers struggle to survive while I increase the fire of my burning pots. I love to watch them wiggle around until they eventually died. I love to tear off the shell of a snail, as carefully as possible so that the snail will survive without its shell. I love to release the snail without the shell back into the wild. Somehow, I do not feel the least bik bad about what I am doing. On the contrary, I find it exciting and fun to torture these insects.</p>
              <p>Once, I came across a stray kitten outside my condominium. I carried it home and put it inside my refrigerator's freezer after drenching it first in water. The thought of the kitten freezing to death made me excited and happy. When I opened the freezer, the kitten was in ice. I thought of the ice kitten as a wonderful piece of art work.</p>
              <p>Since that day when I first froze the kitten to death, I had bought a number of hamsters from a petshop and did the same to them. The way the hamsters looked after they were frozen always fascinated me. I would draw pictures of these frozen hamsters, and composed story about them. I loved to think of how they slowly froze to death.</p>
              <p>I loved to look at violence. I loved to see heads being cut off from the tv screen. I loved to read up on the different types of torture instruments. Sometimes, I would imagine myself as the torturer, inflicting pains and terror on the people living around me. The thoughts of someone dying in pain and terror fascinated me to no end. I wrote many stories about men and women, and children and babies slowly dying after they were being tortured.</p>
              <p>I love the fact that God created hell, and I love to think of the billions of people being burned forever and ever. I wished I was God so I cou ld do the same thing to people. If I were God, I would put everyone of my creation in hell and my hell would be so much more colourful than his one. I would freeze some of the people, burn some of them, tear some of them apart and think of many, many ways to make my creation suffer.</p>
              <p>Because of my love to torture, I think all mankind are born evil. I also think of God as being evil.From as young as five years old, I had already had a love for torture. I never felt anything like guilt for what I love. If it is not because of laws, I may have become a serial torturer.</p>
              <p>How do someone like me develop a conscience? I don't even know what a conscience is. Sometimes, I feel so out of place. I feel like I do not belong in this world. I see my family members and friends acting out in horror against child abuse and serial rapists and I think something must be wrong with me, because I feel excitement instead of horror. I pretend to be horrified to appease my family and friends, but in reality, I am excited about child abuse and serial rapists. I love to think of how the victims suffer. Sometimes, I even think of torturing my own family members and friends to death. Such a thought excite me.</p>
              <p>I know something is wrong with me, and yet I do not know how to change myself. The only thing that fascinates me about Christianity is when I think of how much pains and sufferings Jesus went through before he died. That is the only thing that kept me going to visit churches at times. I will think to myself in my own mind about how Jesus was in so much pain while I listen to the pastor preached about Jesus' crucification on the cross.</p>
              <p>Do you know how I can feel guilt, or not feel so excited about someone's pain. I so badly wanted to be normal. Thanks for your help.</p>

              <p>Aye.. a serial killer in the making.</p>
              <p>A psychological disorder that has no cure. As your thirst for torture increases, your victims will no longer be small animals..but gradually human beings.</p>
              <p>The only place you belong to is the gallows, or put away for life in a prison. For the crime you have committed and will commit.</p>

              <p>I love the fact that God created hell, and I love to think of
              the billions of people being burned forever and ever. I wished I
              was God so I cou ld do the same thing to people. If I were God, I
              would put everyone of my creation in hell and my hell would be so
              much more colourful than his one. I would freeze some of the
              people, burn some of them, tear some of them apart and think of
              many, many ways to make my creation suffer.</p>
              <p>Because of my love to torture, I think all mankind are born
              evil. I also think of God as being evil.From as young as five years
              old, I had already had a love for torture. I never felt anything
              like guilt for what I love. If it is not because of laws, I may
              have become a serial torturer.</p>
              <p>How do someone like me develop a conscience? I don't even know
              what a conscience is. Sometimes, I feel so out of place. I feel
              like I do not belong in this world. I see my family members and
              friends acting out in horror against child abuse and serial rapists
              and I think something must be wrong with me, because I feel
              excitement instead of horror. I pretend to be horrified to appease
              my family and friends, but in reality, I am excited about child
              abuse and serial rapists. I love to think of how the victims
              suffer. Sometimes, I even think of torturing my own family members
              and friends to death. Such a thought excite me.</p>
              <p>I know something is wrong with me, and yet I do not know how to
              change myself. The only thing that fascinates me about Christianity
              is when I think of how much pains and sufferings Jesus went through
              before he died. That is the only thing that kept me going to visit
              churches at times. I will think to myself in my own mind about how
              Jesus was in so much pain while I listen to the pastor preached
              about Jesus' crucification on the cross.</p>
              <p>Do you know how I can feel guilt, or not feel so excited about
              someone's pain. I so badly wanted to be normal. Thanks for your
              help.</p>

              <p>What is guilt and what is conscience? I truly wonder because I
              don't think I have either.</p>
              <p>I love to catch insects in my containers and put them into the
              burning pots. I love to watch my cockroaches, lizards,
              grasshopppers struggle to survive while I increase the fire of my
              burning pots. I love to watch them wiggle around until they
              eventually died. I love to tear off the shell of a snail, as
              carefully as possible so that the snail will survive without its
              shell. I love to release the snail without the shell back into the
              wild. Somehow, I do not feel the least bik bad about what I am
              doing. On the contrary, I find it exciting and fun to torture these
              insects.</p>
              <p>Once, I came across a stray kitten outside my condominium. I
              carried it home and put it inside my refrigerator's freezer after
              drenching it first in water. The thought of the kitten freezing to
              death made me excited and happy. When I opened the freezer, the
              kitten was in ice. I thought of the ice kitten as a wonderful piece
              of art work.</p>
              <p>Since that day when I first froze the kitten to death, I had
              bought a number of hamsters from a petshop and did the same to
              them. The way the hamsters looked after they were frozen always
              fascinated me. I would draw pictures of these frozen hamsters, and
              composed story about them. I loved to think of how they slowly
              froze to death.</p>
              <p>I loved to look at violence. I loved to see heads being cut off
              from the tv screen. I loved to read up on the different types of
              torture instruments. Sometimes, I would imagine myself as the
              torturer, inflicting pains and terror on the people living around
              me. The thoughts of someone dying in pain and terror fascinated me
              to no end. I wrote many stories about men and women, and children
              and babies slowly dying after they were being tortured.</p>
              <p>I love the fact that God created hell, and I love to think of
              the billions of people being burned forever and ever. I wished I
              was God so I cou ld do the same thing to people. If I were God, I
              would put everyone of my creation in hell and my hell would be so
              much more colourful than his one. I would freeze some of the
              people, burn some of them, tear some of them apart and think of
              many, many ways to make my creation suffer.</p>
              <p>Because of my love to torture, I think all mankind are born
              evil. I also think of God as being evil.From as young as five years
              old, I had already had a love for torture. I never felt anything
              like guilt for what I love. If it is not because of laws, I may
              have become a serial torturer.</p>
              <p>How do someone like me develop a conscience? I don't even know
              what a conscience is. Sometimes, I feel so out of place. I feel
              like I do not belong in this world. I see my family members and
              friends acting out in horror against child abuse and serial rapists
              and I think something must be wrong with me, because I feel
              excitement instead of horror. I pretend to be horrified to appease
              my family and friends, but in reality, I am excited about child
              abuse and serial rapists. I love to think of how the victims
              suffer. Sometimes, I even think of torturing my own family members
              and friends to death. Such a thought excite me.</p>
              <p>I know something is wrong with me, and yet I do not know how to
              change myself. The only thing that fascinates me about Christianity
              is when I think of how much pains and sufferings Jesus went through
              before he died. That is the only thing that kept me going to visit
              churches at times. I will think to myself in my own mind about how
              Jesus was in so much pain while I listen to the pastor preached
              about Jesus' crucification on the cross.</p>
              <p>Do you know how I can feel guilt, or not feel so excited about
              someone's pain. I so badly wanted to be normal. Thanks for your
              help.</p>
