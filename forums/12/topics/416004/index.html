              <p>Please heed my advice -- DONT.</p>
              <p>I have also been an avid maplestory player in the past. I know how it feels like, the feeling of self gratification and accomplishment, the exhilarating and relaxing time spent in it with virtual or real friends. But in the end, you would be left without nothing but loneliness and regret for your entire life.</p>
              <p>Knowing that your studies are already jeopardized by excessive gaming, I think you have already realised the negative impacts gaming has brought to you. As any other addiction, I know it's still very difficult to stop, but you <strong>must</strong> quit. Too many lives were already destroyed by gaming.</p>
              <p>I strongly encourage you to google "gaming addiction stories" and read some of them. Besides that, I find that those who lack determination often has not powerful enough desires to start with. Apart from gaming, what else do you like? Have a meaningful and significant goal in your life, and believe me, <strong>gaming does not and cannot last forever</strong>. 99% of addicted gamers would wake up one day and only find it to be too late. Their life was half gone. I was fortunate enough to have wonderful parents who stopped me in time. Perhaps you can approach your parents?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the end, games are nothing but meaningless long pages of computer programming. All those colourful &amp; attractive graphics, the quests, the leveling up, the abilities. They are just meaningless sequences of 26 alphabets &amp; 10 numbers that will make you regret for life. So please quit it once and for all.</p>
              <p>Best wishes.</p>

SMLJ, on wow you battle it out with proper duels or battlegrounds and go @(!@!*&amp;$!@@!@ and say : ' soz... must be my internet provider............. '. ( and cursing from inside cause you found out you can't win him because of your class ).</p>
              <p>And how about 25 man or 10 man raids, which you face fucking huge bosses with high def graphics. And encounters with extremely cool soundtracks that make your heart go thumpthumpthump. And go : ' OMFG LAG, ta ma de this red service provider, telling your guildmates, "sorry storm in my area" .'</p>
              <p>And how about the sense of achievement when you down the latest raid boss after dying for 100 times in a row and almost sitting at the edge of your chair.</p>
              <p>All these sense of achievements are never going to be attainable for the average person. Maybe some jerk downtown that made facebook. But not me at least, i know where i stand.</p>

              <p>I played during my J1 and I nearly got retained (Maths C:Physics:D F.Maths:AO GP:C5)</p>
              <p>Fortunately I worked hard in my 2nd year and got a couple of "A"s.</p>
              <p>If you are enlisting soon, then by all means go ahead, since you will be tekan soon anyway. You will likely find gaming/clubbing a good way to destress yourself when you bookout.</p>
              <p>However, maple is VERY addictive, and not easy to stop. I actually destroyed my own PC once just to stop myself from mapling.</p>
              <p>And I got back to playing it again during the holidays between my previous sem and current sem when my brother ask me to get a prz to heal and hs him. The only reason why I managed to stop playing when this sem starts is because I manage to spam others till my BS reach lvl 200, and there isn't much else for me to achieve.</p>

              <p>A goal isn't there set for you all along for you to "no my goal" at some point of time. Dare to dream, dare to put in hardwork, dare to achieve &amp; believe in yourself. Find a worthy long term goal or your life would be just another ordinary mundane one amongst the billions. Then gaming shouldn't be a problem.</p>

              <p>Then don't play.</p>
              <p>Since you play before, you should know how addictive it can be. Besides, since you are going for further studies, you should not let maple drag you down. </p>
              <p>Studies &gt; Gaming, and games like WOW and maple will keep you hooked like a fish on a rod.</p>
              <p>Try to spend time exercising or going out with friends. Playing sports regularly is also a good idea as well. You can volunteer your time to help out those who are less fortunate, since you have the time (and hopefully heart) to spare for them.</p>

              <p><br>Sibei suey sia. My acc also kena hacked. Sian. Now o lvls finish wan play also buey sai play lohh. At first quite addicted to maple, but i still can manage my studies. Ever since kena hacked, then i quit alr. If you wan to get out of this addiction, pray hard for someone to hack yr acc...cos by then, you will feel so sian that you dun wanna carry on playing liao(cos you need to restart all over agn). Since you say yr frens also nt playing, then all the more dun play alr la. But i can understand u esp. now is the holidays. Or if you really really wan play, try playing private servers<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png">.. can easily obtain high lvls and gt lotsa cash at a short period of time. Try to manage yr time well though, i'm sure u are alr a young adult now, and thus you should now wad are yr priorities..so studies hard first, play hard later. There seems to be something pulling you back though, issit maybe u gt a gf in maple? LOL:3</p>
