Currently, I still dun have a clear answer.<br><br>What's your view?</div></blockquote>Basically, there are 2 types of motivation, the extrinsic and intrinsic.<br><br>Extrinsic motivation involve materialistic which do not last, but yet very powerful at times. Money is a good example of extrinsic motivation. As you are motivated because you get the reward if you do it well. But money or materialistic motivation may not be long, once removed, there is no urge for motivation.<br><br>Instrinic motivation involve emotion, usually it last for a long time, a pyschological effect that makes one wish to do it over and over again.<br>Such motivation do not need money, all it need is sincerity and understanding, example like when a teacher praisied  a student of him improving on his school work, care for him, the student tends to be motivate to perform better, and he will always keep in his mind. Same goes to work, if you get a good leadership superior who knows how to motivate you, he/she care for you, understand you, praise and recognise you for your good work, you are very much motivated to work for him or the company even if the paid is not up to mark.<br><br>As Love is an emotion, therefore it fall under intrinsic motivation, if you have a good relationship in bf and gf, you tends to be happy and more lovely, and naturally more motivated to do other things.<br><br>There are many tools and programs being designed such as the maslow's hierrachy of motivation, Hezborg's motivation factors etc etc.<br><br>Self motivation can also fall under intrinsic or extrinsic, example, alots of sportmen uses intrinsic motivation to excel themselves to win in sports, such as,  i trained so hard, now is the time, i must try my best, i must try to win it for my parents and family, to bring glory to my country, they also uses extrinsic to motivate themselves, such as if i won this race, the money i get, i will buy a sport car for myself, i must do it.<br><br>However motivation can lead to fatal consquences when one do not understand the meaning of failure, u can motivate yourself to work, love, train or study hard, and if the outcome is a failure where you get sacked, lost or failed, it may demotivate you to depression.<br><br>Therefore, it is important to know yourself, your limit, and your goal in life before motivating yourself to excel, and as for goal, ensure it is reachable before embarking on it. Just like you hv to look at yourself in the mirror, do some reflection both physically and mentally, and ask yourself, where are you now, what are you going to achieve and what you need to achieve it. If you want to go for a gal you like, you need to do a research of yourself, do you fit in, what you need to change, what are the motivation factors you should adopt to make yourself going forward.<br><br>Angel 666<br>Human Psychology<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Motivate yourself by setting goals and what you want to achieve. You can also compete with people to achive greater success in what you do. What I mean is competitiveness could act as a driving force for you as long as its a healthy one. For eg. when you see your friend working very hard in studies, you would naturally feel motivated when you choose to compete with him. Its like the burning desire will make you do things better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The power of thought and belief make a lot of differences. Your perception.The forces that drive any behavior are pain and pleasure. We tend to behave in a way that will move away from pain and gravitates towards pleasure. No one like pain, unless you like pain.<br><br>Your perception of yourself is important.If you see yourself as hopeless, you will think and act as if you are really hopeless. Thus unmotivated.When you see yourself as top achievers, you think/plan to reach the goal and act confidently. Thus motivated.<br><br>People can be motivated with goals and plan/steps to reach the goals. Cos they know where they are going. By knowing how and where they are sailing to, with a certain level of certainty in mind, they can also be motivated.<br><br>Motivation does not come from the only the object which included the rewards/ other factors or only yourself. It is the <span style="font-style: italic;">relationship</span> between the objects-subject where this motivation comes about.<br><br>Someone once told me when you think happy thought, you will be happy. Motivation comes with desire and this desire can be based on alot of things like rewards, love, self-actualization, sexual needs, survival needs etc.<br><br>Also can try NLP.. there is to re-condition your mind to perform at peak stage and to re-condition your mind to believe that pain is actually pleasure. Attitude towards something matters a lot too. If your attitude is positive, you tend to attract positivity which is also pleasurable to our senses.<br><br></div>
