She got nothing to do with you except as friend, so dun be stupid and do so much for her ya, as frens is ok, but love cannot be force. Please be more apprehensive about lover and frens ya. Never assume love until you are sure, if not one sided love is hard to bear...unless you ask for it. Like me, she has her right to choose her bf.</div>
