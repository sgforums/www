            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm ... (personally) just feels that there's no reason for a breakup to be caused by a third party. Anyone who gets involved with the third party actually causes harm to all three persons, rite? Unless the person is a darn a$$ who only care abt himself/ herself, then only those who loved him/ her gets hurt.<br><br>Personally I have seen a few cases. From these cases, all the three persons suffer. Sometimes it ends well, mostly it doesn't. But then ... its hard, very hard esp when your r/s is going all the way down hill ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> . I know cos I been there, and sort of still there ... ... For me, I am still trying to forget someone while working out my r/s. Although I dun know how the other party feels abt me, I guess it is best to leave the stone unturned. Dun want to bring misery yet to another person. Hee, as if the person will like me like that, ha (- a sad attempt to cheer myself).<br><br>Anyway, back to the topic ... I would be very upset (well, if the r/s is still good). However, should be able to get over it someday, soon. I feel that I shouldn't want to waste my time on someone who turns his/ her back on me.<br><br>If it had happened to you, please get over it. Move on with your life ... You will see the sunshine after the rain.</div>
