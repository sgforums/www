            <div class='col-md body'>sometimes...its hard to understand. A third party doesnt mean that he is a bad person, or a cause to your breakup. Perhaps its something that you have done wrong or lack of. For everything that happens, think before you act. Its hard to acheive but its something that most people tend to forget.</div>

But I just don't know why she just decided to give up so suddenly. and so persistently too. no matter what I do to convince her that we can still try to patch things up. But now with the third party, things became more complicated. I have suddenly switched my role as the main cast to the third party... don't you just hate it how life likes to play these tricks on you?<br><br>In my case, I feel bad because i believe that if I treated her better, and I do think I have already treat her quite good, maybe not good enough, If I actually took enough time out of my job to be with her... maybe she would not let go so easily. My only regret...<br></div></blockquote>I underwent the same thing as u....felt remorseful...i regretted my actions....i called and called..and persuaded and persuaded...but in the end it's still futile...<br><br>I was caught by surprise too...she was wif me for 8 years...thought she would be with me forever.....then just gone....I regretted a lot...that I should have shown her more love....<br><br>But now...it's too late...we gotta except that it's too late....and to move on.<br><br>Take this: If u really love her...u really gotta let her go.....since u have done everything and she's still insistent....it's showing her love and respect..........let it go.......I have done it.....pain...but still must do it... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
