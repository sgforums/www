              <p>Do you think you will ever out grow this obsession of yours ?</p>
              <p>Your ex-girlfriend must think you are too childish the way you acted in the video.</p>
              <p>I have a friend who is very obsessed with superman. He's already into his 40s , and he keeps a room just to store and display the figurines and collectables.</p>
              <p>He has a wife and 1 kid already.</p>

              <p>I think not advisable to patch up. you still 21 nia.. try locking up all your costumes in a box and put under your bed lo.  the key give to your parents or whoever can hide for you at your house. That's if you want to lose this imaginative self of yours.</p>
              <p>I think you should try going into the acting industry too..</p>

              <p>You are not a rare case lah. Typically a person who likes fantasy characters sees a little bit of themself in the character.</p>
              <p>The fact that we live in a very rigid society in SG probably makes you feel very stiffled, hence occasionally you want to escape into this world of fantasy. There's really nothing wrong with that, as long as you don't get so sucked into it that you cannot differentiate virtual from real, which I doubt you are that serious yet lah.</p>
              <p>I'd say it's more of a hobby than a weird fetish. As you grow older, you will mellow down but your love for the fantasy character will not go away. So perhaps you can try approach her again when you are less obssessed with your hobby. Because a woman can feel very left out when you are too into your hobby.</p>
              <p>Wearing costumes to movies is commonly practise in the western country. You should see during the Harry Potter and Transformers screening.. almost EVERYONE wears the costume to the movie theater.</p>
              <p>To people who's never seen such behavior will surely find it odd, but for me, it's very normal.</p>
              <p>I think you should just enjoy what you like to do for now. Perhaps it's a good idea to throw away/destroy that video, so people cannot use it to blackmail you later.</p>
              <p>You don't like to join cosplay.. is probably because you are a shy boy. Cosplay requires a cosplayer to be actively involve in group outings. You're quite the loner right ?</p>
