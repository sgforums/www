              <p>Spectralizer,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take it as a compliment when your friend ask you for help.</p>
              <p>If you are not smart or lousy in your work, nobody would bother coming to you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I remember in Spiderman movie, the uncle says something like , with special abilities comes special obligations/responsibilities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you feel that you are being taken for granted, it is about time you speak up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If they don't offer you a thank you, ASK for it before/after you are done.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When my colleague ask me for help , I'd always jokingly say " I'd wouldn't mind a cuppa coffee for this." Then it's up to you to decide if you want to take it or not later.</p>

              <p>Well, if you are looking to be reciprocated, try not to reject their requests, but instead, ask for help from them whenever you need, sometimes even for the slightest thing to get back at them. :twisted: (Say, go down the canteen and get some food for ya etc.) Then if they reject to do so, it would be much easier for you to say the same thing to them and reject to help them as well.  By this way, you would not feel exploited whenever they ask for help from you.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it's really plain rude for a friend to say something like "Hey how to.... nvm i noe u also won't help rite?" to you...wait, how old is he again? I would shove a middle finger right at his face if I were you.</p>

              <p>Well, there's 2 sides to everything. For this case, by not expressing their gratitude can means that they're too close to you and formalities will alienate the relation. It's human nature. Of course it can also means that they are just plain rude.</p>
              <p>Actually i was in your situation last time. It's like a norm. Back when i was in Sec 1, my peers would approach my help frequently as i am like the "role-model" for the class, always achieving good result. Until i got really piss off with all that coaching stuffs, that's when i purposely failed my Tests. And true enough, people stop looking for me as time goes by... But seriously, don't do that. It's hard to get what you've lost. I mean, really really hard.</p>

              <p>Looks like you're still young .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, there are always ppl who dont appreciate your help. thats normal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for me, i will filter out who doenst say anything at all. Cuz i know these ppl just take things for granted. Once i know some1 is this kind of ppl. i will find many excuse to avoid helping him or anything. who cares. blooody hell they think they God</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For me, i will help if they really really need help. if theres something that they can do themself.. i wont help at all and will give excuses. Anyway,u can know for sure if some1 want to take things granted from u..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think bout it again ,TS. Even if they say thank you, would u really think they say it from their heart ? or simply they just say it without sincere heart. just as a procedure to do after ppl help?</p>

              <p>Bad mistake.</p>
              <p>Never give out something without asking for something in return. Next time someone asks you a question, ask them for a free drink at breaktime or some other favor.</p>
              <p>It's not so important at this stage where we're talking about school work, whether they actually give you something or not but get them to recognize that it is not free. If you have time, you can still help them but remind them that there is a price.</p>
              <p>DO NOT GET INTO THE HABIT OF GIVING THINGS OUT FOR FREE. IT IS A BAD DESTRUCTIVE HABIT THAT WILL CAUSE YOU NO END OF SUFFERING LATER IN LIFE.</p>
              <p>Regulate when you can help, eg, say, let me finish this first so and I'll be free to help you.</p>
              <p>Regulate how much help you give, eg, I can explain it to you but you still need to do the other 2 question on your own.</p>
              <p>Organize your help, if 2 friends need help, don't tutor them one at a time, tutor them together.</p>
              <p>Combine all of these and you get. eg, I can tutor you if you need help during recess, after school etc, I charge $x for a half hour if you need my help. I'm also helping so and so in this manner.</p>
              <p>I hope this is of help.</p>

              <p>Hey..</p>
              <p>My opinion is people normally give such response because they want to make you feel guilty and help them.</p>
              <p>There are people who take things for granted.</p>
              <p>When we chose not to help them, they would say we are selfish and unfriendly (i got this kind of comment sometimes).</p>
              <p>However, if you hold your stand, one day they would respect you and understand you.</p>
              <p>You dont need to explain yourself that much.</p>
              <p>Cos some people don't deserve to tell..</p>
              <p>*cheers*</p>
