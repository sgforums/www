A complete Klutz...</blockquote>First thing first, A has to ditch that self-crowned "complete klutz" image if he ever wants to win G's heart. Many girls are attracted to guys who exude confidence, and no normal girl likes being with guys who lament all the time, "I'm a loser (sob)... I don't deserve to be with you (sob, sob)... but could I be your boyfriend (blink pitiful puppy's eyes)?".<br><br>Assuming A can put his "complete klutz" image behind him, the next thing he should do is to reveal his feelings to G. Unless G is the go-getter type (which she does not seem to be), G could not respond till A has served the ball to her court. It is good A knows what he has to do, but if he does not act on what he knows, it is as good as he doesn't know, or maybe worse.<br><br>There are ways to express his feelings to G, even if he finds himself tongue-tied when trying to mouth the words. Here are a few suggestions: He could hold her hand when crossing the road and pretend to forget he's still holding her after that. Or he could slip it in while making lame statements like, "Hey! Look at the old woman falling down... so funny, hahaha... by the way I like you... hahaha..." Or he could simply use the tried-and-tested method: Write a letter. Good luck, A.</div>

Many girls are attracted to guys who exude confidence, and no normal girl likes being with guys who lament all the time, "I'm a loser (sob)... I don't deserve to be with you (sob, sob)... but could I be your boyfriend (blink pitiful puppy's eyes)?".<br><br>Assuming A can put his "complete klutz" image behind him, the next thing he should do is to reveal his feelings to G. Unless G is the go-getter type (which she does not seem to be), G could not respond till A has served the ball to her court. It is good A knows what he has to do, but if he does not act on what he knows, it is as good as he doesn't know, or maybe worse.<br><br>There are ways to express his feelings to G, even if he finds himself tongue-tied when trying to mouth the words. Here are a few suggestions: He could hold her hand when crossing the road and pretend to forget he's still holding her after that. Or he could slip it in while making lame statements like, "Hey! Look at the old woman falling down... so funny, hahaha... by the way I like you... hahaha..." Or he could simply use the tried-and-tested method: Write a letter. Good luck, A.</div></blockquote>Erm, that wasn't wat I meant, I meant how should A communicate with her... He doesn't see her...so all he can do os phone/SMS/MSN... How should A do to make G play his SMS game or respond to his MSN... I mean what should A talk about? How he should start...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

U R da MAN!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>But the main point here is "A" dun dare to call "G". But "A" have to pick up his courage sooner or later to call "G". If "G" really likes "A", she won't think it'll b a nuisance, she just treat it as a time-out from her studying routine. But b4 "A" called "G", he'll need to think of the topics to talk with her, write down in a piece of paper b4 calling her. A phone conversation at 30 mins is good enuff liao. Any longer, "A" will feel the pinch in his bills. Heh heh!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
