Thanks.<br><br>[b]From one month ago:</strong><br>I have this crush on this gal in my company. I had start talking to her when we sat beside each other during a mass coy meeting. We have spoken to each other, but it's only about general stuff, and "safe" topics... nothing too personal yet.<br><br>After the meeting I don't really have the chance to sit down and talk to her again. Nowadays we smile and wave to each other when we meet along the common corridor, or bump in to her at the pantry while getting my milo. But I didn't ask her for her conatact number 'cos I too shy. And maybe because she looks busy and looks like she's in a hurry<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Well I'm from a department where I will be out of office most of the time, depending on instructions, even reducing my chance to bump into more often.. whether in the canteen downstairs or where ever. If I have a choice I bump into her every 2 minutes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><strong>Fast forward to This morning fri</strong><br>Was browsing through surfing sgforums, soccernet, and all the nonsense making me feel bored..<br><br>Clicked to the default home page realised my manager had used my pc and didnt log out of the staff directory intranet<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I have a feeling I did something bad or wrong here....<br><br>I went to the staff directory and looked up her name<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>And copied down her mobile phone number. Don't ask me why I did that, I just felt it's just too good to be missed out at that time.<br><br>When I finished copying down her number, I was elated for about 3 minutes. Then I realised, maybe it's not so good after all.<br><br>Do you think I can call her? What would she think of me?<br>I like her but havent been seeing her around for the past few days.. so was thinking of calling or sms-ing her...<br><br>Is she ill? Or maybe on leave? Or quitted/ sacked?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>The main point is to know how's she doing because I haven't been seeing her around for the past week.<br><br>Would you call her if you are me?<br><br>Thanks for your good advice[/b]</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You only have one chance to begin this relationship on a good impression - to call her means you have given up this chance or worst, incur negative impression.<br><br>Cheers</div>
