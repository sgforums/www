She needs someone by her side..and that means YOU!!!! Try do somethin different to cheer her up....like buy her flowers and get delivery guy to deliver to her doorstep....something surprising yet pleasing. Show her that you r still thinking of her during these hard times. Maybe u have better ideas.<br><br>She n him 3 yrs....no big deal....I've heard worse.<br><br>Always make her feel at ease and comfortable when she's with u.<br></div>
