            <div class='col-md body'>All I can advise is to keep doing what u are doing. give her time. if she really wanna take a break from ur relationship, Let her but remind her that u are here waiting whenever she feels she's ready.<br><br>Don't talk bad abt her bf. it puts u in a bad light.<br>Don't confront her ex (unless she is really getting frighten, and she gives the ok) cos she might not like that u went behind her back indicating u may not trust her<br><br>in these kinda situations u can only:<br><br>1. ask urself whether she is worth all these waiting and effort<br>2. if she is. stand by her and let her know u'll not let her go without a fight but Bottom line u just want her to be happy.<br>3. Protect her if her ex starts to cross the line and try to harm/scare her.<br><br>Love is not an easy game to play!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sentguy:</div><div class="quote_body">hi guys.. i really appreciate so many of u giving me suggestions and listening to my problem... let me explain the situation now..<br>this is actually the 2nd time that he is back for her.. the 1st time he came back..i used all my persuasion powers and skills to ask her to give us(my gf and me)more time and it was a success...<br>During the 1 month that he did not come back to harrass her.. we were very happy.. i could see her smile radiently..truely... and it hurts me now to see her so upset.. confused...<br>Yes u guys might say, if she is undecided, then obviously she doesn't love me as much as love him. But, we are a 3 months couple, they are 3 years... so i really do not expect her to forget him so fast.. im willing to give her time.. as much as she needs... oh and yes to clear up the point, i went after her only AFTER she break with him.. so i was not the 3rd party.. its fair and square and above board..<br>Her point of view for wanting to break up with me is that.. she feels its unfair to me when she is with me,and she still thinking of him sometimes.. For my point of view, im willing to give her as much time as she needs.. simply becox i love her.. (no,not her body, we haven't had any sexual contact)<br>And about the suggestion of 1 brother here to speak bad about her bf, i can't do it. It would sound really bad that i purposely speak bad about her ex and that might have a negative effect- she might think im a 'small air' guy to do such things. Honestly, i don't hate him on a personal level, i just hate him for making my gf so upset..so xinku..making her depressed..<br>Im sorry guys(and girls) that this is such a long post..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote></div>

He does all those stupid things on purpose. (If he wanted to die, y wait till ur gf attach to u then say he wana die?? Shld have done so long ago.) Like what many have said, he is plain jealous and cant stand ur bf having a new and nice guy like u.<br><br>Keep standing by ur gf and like many day dun give her stress but do not totally dun care as well. Tell her that u love her and will take care of her always. If she can, try to persuade her to see the situation as what we all see it. That way i am sure both of u will feel better.<br><br>As for the ex, I guess hes going to be a loser forever if he continues to harass ur gf. Too many people in this world, they need to be tot how to face reality.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, your gf is definitely confused and would be totally stressed out.<br>Secondly, you don't want to contribute to her stress.<br>Thirdly, you will need to released her of her problems with her ex.<br><br>So, why don't you 2 take a short holiday somewhere and enjoy yourself. Even a week in Bali or Phuket or even Perth, Hong Kong etc. This will take both your mind away from her ex for a while. Being far away from her ex is also good for her so she has no chance to "accidentally" meet him.<br><br>Then during the holiday, talk to her and tell her that you understand her predicament and you are there to help her through. Also, slowly let her enjoy your company. Make her feel that you need her more than she needs you.<br><br>If possible, get a SIM card of the country for her so her family can still contact her and that her sg phone is turned off.<br><br>Whatever you do there, just enjoy each other's company. Slowly, she may feel that you are more important to her than her ex.<br><br>Good Luck.<br><br>PS.   May be good if you can let her ex know that both of you went on a holiday together AFTER you come back.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To brother babyboy, just want to extend a really warm thanks to you,for your opinions and views, and to all other brothers, thank you very much. I feel better now, im glad to hear im on the right track. Indeed, im not giving her any pressure, am setting her free to think about it. In fact, i told her to think over it slowly and not make a hasty decision. If she still decide to break with me, i will accept the decision and not mess up her life(like what her ex is doing). I told her i love her and hence if breaking up makes her happier, then so be it and i will accept it. But again, i also said im not giving up without a fight, so yes i can only try to pretend to be happy myself, and talk silly jokes to make her laugh(even if its only temperory), and yes i've already check out the tours. Might be going to bangkok for a few days to R&amp;R, hope the tour proceeds on smoothly. Let her get away from S'pore so won't see or hear from him, or think of sad things so much.<br><br>Today just went out for a short walk with her, she still has the very 'sian' face, and sadly, she doesn't seem to hold my hand as much as she did before this incident. Felt very upset but i still put up a brave front and try to make her laugh.. cannot let her know im so sad because if i don't give her support at this moment, who will? Even if she might leave me, i still can't bear to see her sad. I just want her to be happy.<br><br>She said its difficult to forget because its 3 years..did many things together and went many places together.. so go to any place also will strike up memories of him. I said i willing to give her as much time as she needs but then again, she don't sound convinced that she will forget him. I also said its normal to have such feelings.. like 'nostalgia' feelings.. and hopefully they will fade away slowly after a few months/years ( thats if she haven't break with me..)<br><br>Right now, im doing all i can to fight to keep her by my side. At the same time, im sad to see her to 'sian' look(prob depressed but trying not to show it). And i still need to fake to be happy to cheer her up. What a struggle.. not easy.. but im going to push my chin up, suck thumb and DO IT!!!<br><br></div>
