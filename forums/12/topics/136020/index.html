Just say that u will always be there for her and love her too. If she is confused, let her have some time to think abt it. =) I am sure she will know that u are the one for her.</div>

He may cherish her if he gets her back, but definitely not the positive way. Do not give her up, i faced this situation before, and i respect the girl's decision to break with me and she went back to her ex BF.. In the end, what happened was what i Hated myself forever. That guy keep going to her house to play with her body, and after that just left, And this happens EVERY SINGLE DAY after i broke with her. Don't Give that guy another chance, you are being unfair to both yourself and the girl you truely like. Whatever happens, Don't Give up on her. Take CAre</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sticky situation.. Think she's really confused right now.. But hey bro, i'm a man too, and i know it's hard to take. Fight, and what if she says u are interferring her problems and being violent. Don't fight, ppl call u a pussy.<br><br>But 1 thing i notice, if she really has let go of the previous r/s, she probably wouldnt even bother being upset. Bro, i know it sounds damn 'nan ting', but maybe her heart has this empty space left behind by her ex that u didn't fill in.<br><br>Anyways, hope everything turn out fine. Good luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ledikusa:</div><div class="quote_body">That guy is merely out to get back at you. He is plain jealous. He wants her back, but not for the purpose of love, but sexual favours. He may cherish her if he gets her back, but definitely not the positive way. Do not give her up, i faced this situation before, and i respect the girl's decision to break with me and she went back to her ex BF.. In the end, what happened was what i Hated myself forever. That guy keep going to her house to play with her body, and after that just left, And this happens EVERY SINGLE DAY after i broke with her. Don't Give that guy another chance, you are being unfair to both yourself and the girl you truely like. Whatever happens, Don't Give up on her. Take CAre</div></blockquote>Don't hate yourself man.. She was the stupid one</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe you have to talk to the guy face to face about it. Also, it is not good for ex bf gf to patch things up as there will always be this suspicion lingering in the relationship.<br><br>Just spend time hugging your gf and consoling her.<br><br>Wish you luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys.. i really appreciate so many of u giving me suggestions and listening to my problem... let me explain the situation now..<br>this is actually the 2nd time that he is back for her.. the 1st time he came back..i used all my persuasion powers and skills to ask her to give us(my gf and me)more time and it was a success...<br>During the 1 month that he did not come back to harrass her.. we were very happy.. i could see her smile radiently..truely... and it hurts me now to see her so upset.. confused...<br>Yes u guys might say, if she is undecided, then obviously she doesn't love me as much as love him. But, we are a 3 months couple, they are 3 years... so i really do not expect her to forget him so fast.. im willing to give her time.. as much as she needs... oh and yes to clear up the point, i went after her only AFTER she break with him.. so i was not the 3rd party.. its fair and square and above board..<br>Her point of view for wanting to break up with me is that.. she feels its unfair to me when she is with me,and she still thinking of him sometimes.. For my point of view, im willing to give her as much time as she needs.. simply becox i love her.. (no,not her body, we haven't had any sexual contact)<br>And about the suggestion of 1 brother here to speak bad about her bf, i can't do it. It would sound really bad that i purposely speak bad about her ex and that might have a negative effect- she might think im a 'small air' guy to do such things. Honestly, i don't hate him on a personal level, i just hate him for making my gf so upset..so xinku..making her depressed..<br>Im sorry guys(and girls) that this is such a long post..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
