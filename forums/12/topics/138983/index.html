What do you think?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Fate itself sometimes is not enough; especially astrologically speaking, if your birthchart indicates more important lessons (or very powerful Saturn, would be worst if afflicted with Pluto, influence) to achieve else-where. Although more often, it could be too much receptive duality within the birth chart that creates a very passive attitude towards BGR, thus losing your chances completely to surrounding, circumstances or others.<br><br>Congratulation, cause in my dictionary, there's no such thing as Ming Zhong Zu Ting because there's always freewill to counter against it.<br><br>Freewill?<br><br>If fate is not sufficient, that means love MAY not happen in passive mode. It's like a chemical reaction; fate itself is one solution, while your potential mate is the other solution. The catalysis to speed up or probably to create the reaction would be your initiative to<br><br>I) Widen Social Circle.<br><br>II) Start dating different people (please note that its possible to date WITHOUT telling yourself that you like her and stuff. Sometime when you date a friend in pure platonic intention, you learn something about what you should or not do in a date. It also expands your experience to handle woman in a one-on-one situation, increase your knowledge on where to have a good time, improve conversation skill, blar blar blar.)<br><br>III) Activately seek to improve your personal 'marketing'. You are like a product of yourself, waiting to market to someone suitable so that she could see the goodness in you and ultimately accept the product - which is you. You are inadequate now, seek to narrow that gap. That would also serve to improve your confidence and overall feel.<br><br>How do you know you have tried your best yet? IMHO, you didn't even reach the bare minimal to build that 'catalysis'. Do not give up just because of your coming age, people's wedding, etc. In simple, DON'T let circumstances bring you down just because things are happening around you - you are YOURSELF. Your relationship runs in your own hands, therefore you write your own tale in your own book. Obviously, you would be different from others.<br><br>P.S: When you resigned to fate, nobody would tell you otherwise, for you account only to yourself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks for the wonderful views and professional consultation esp by Yunhaier  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>i'm starting to feel better as i know i'm not alone. i have agree to come in terms of relationship one has to be pro-active and not leave it to fate totally. Instead of playing the waiting games, just get out and know more people.<br><br>To tell the truth, i have already tried some of the solutions suggested, but in turn i faced rejections or the other way around. its difficult to find the right match, because the older u are, the more factors you consider.<br><br>i would try to think the whole thing as a process u need to been through / experience in life, thats why there is so many sad songs in the world.<br><br>somes say the harder you seek, its harder u will get.  in regards to social life, i hardly go to group outings these days, maybe old friends. i not an expert in dating because i'm just a quiet engineer who returns to home everyday after work.<br><br>not many believe in platonic male/female relationships based on my experience, in the end the guy might take a liking to her and get hurt instead.<br><br>material wise, i realized that there is no limits of the money you can earn. how to define stablity in this economy where most of the jobs are contracted these days. but i would say i'm in good hands for now.<br><br>arrggh:<br>i sympathy with u, i have seens many years of relationships been blown away. but hey u are still young, there's a saying man at 30 still a tiger,  still can start afresh.<br><br></div>
