              <p>Hey, i'm new here. so please treat me well :)</p>
              <p>there was this girl i met when i was in sec 1, so it was like a love at first sight. that girl and i grew really close, and become couple-like when i was in mid sec 2. but the thing is that she had never really treated me well, I've always been the one. friends who can sees how well i treated always tell me to leave her, or not treat her too well, cos i'm like a puppet to her. she already have a bf, and i'm like his replacement/spare tire. although i know that i'm just a spare tire, i couldn't leave her simply because it's already love. her bf hates me, because i seem more like a bf, compared to him. </p>
              <p>and here's where my prob steps in..</p>
              <p>i have a classmate whom i wasn't really close with, and at times when i'm really sad, she'll come to me and comfort me, try to cheer me up etc. she earned my trust really quickly, and i told her about the first girl. [so now, let the first girl be M, and the second be A]</p>
              <p>A constantly checked on me, and texted me to keep me company, and not too long later, i realised i fell for her. friends who knew i liked her also told me to go for it, since she's a really awesome girl. and she knows that i like her, cos one of my friend told her.</p>
              <p>it's been about half a year since i fell in love with her, and now i still love her alot.</p>
              <p>but she and i fell out a month ago, and she heartlessly walked out. she apologised a couple of days later, but until now, we haven't talked. talking to her would probably irritate her, and i don't wish to irritate her.</p>
              <p>I've lived most of my life, alone. and i was really glad when she promised to never leave me. she's like, a treasure in my life. someone who understood me so well, someone willing to sacrifice for me, and a very selfless and mature person. i don't wish to lose her..in fact, i wish to be with her D:</p>

              <p><br>Open your mouth then start by talking to her as you normally does lor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you really don't know how to talk to her, then forget it...because you're NOT READY for her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just suck more thumbs until you can figure that out.</p>

              <p>You can try to be serious. It might not last for many reasons.</p>
              <p>People usually aren't scared to talk. They're just afraid of the outcome.</p>

              <p>I get the impression that you might be a little too in touch with your emotional side and very vocal about it to your closed ones, which might irk them and let's be honest, if a girl wants to find such traits, that's where her best friends comes in.</p>
              <p>And perhaps it is your assumption that you might irritate her, so try your chance? And if it didn't end up well, time to let go and move on. I bet doing badly for Sec 3 streaming would hurt more than breaking up with the chio bu of your secondary school.</p>
