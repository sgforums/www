              <p>Dude..what you are experiencing now is not true love, but rather its simply infatuation or romantic love. It is just like a drug, it gives you a sugar high and fills your world with rose coloured glasses when she notices you and gives you an instant crash when she doesn't. It is not just a teenage problem, even adults suffer from it as well.The thing about infatuation is that it will cool off as fast as it starts.</p>
              <p>You have 2 options now. Tell her what you feel about her and be honest about your feelings, if she rejects you, so be it.If she doesn't, all the best.</p>
              <p>The otherway is to apply the principle of no contact, which allows you to grow over your emotional trauma. Tell her that you need some space to settle down your mind and that you are not going to contact her for awhile. But take note that this tool is not for playing mind games or acting dao. It is really for you to straighten out your mind and think logically. The only problem is in overcoming your own temptation to contact her and that requires alot of mental strength.</p>
              <p>So good luck~</p>
              <p>Btw, don't fall in love with every girl that shows concern to you. Think logically, not emotionally.</p>

              Its like u like that person u don't have to be with that person. Just be that person's guardian angel and watch her from a distance. So long as you know that she's fine and happy and you are happy.So its up to you whether u wanna be that guardian angel or u wanna take up your courage and let her know how much she means to you. We humans , live once therefore cherish any chances you have to make clear with her if you do really wanna be with her. Don't live life with regrets yeah ?

              <p>Haha, time is not an issue, neither are looks or skills or personality to give you a reason to have a romantic attachment to a person. This is what I believe is important:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Are you prepared to handle the emotional trauma when she is not by your side.</li>
              <li>Are you capable of ignoring your emotional thoughts and replace it with logical ones when the time comes. That is what you will have to endure.</li>
              <li>Are you able to care for someone without hurting yourself mentally? Liking a person carries a burden. Are you ready to let go when the time needs you to.</li>
              <li>I do not encourage acting as a guardian angel kinda thing. It will backfire on you ultimately when you see that she has moved on with her life and you are still stuck there. Move off like a gentleman and make it a clean break. But keep your lines of communication open, so that when she does need you, you are around to help her. But at the mean time, make it a clean break.<br></li>
              <li>Finally, don't put her on a pedestal. Meaning don't treat her like a goddess. She is just a human like you and me, treat her as such and you will find it easier to talk to her. <br></li>
              </ol>
              <p>All the best~</p>
