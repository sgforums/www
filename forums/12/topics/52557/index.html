There are some out there who just want to find the right girl and do it with her only. Reguarding to what you said "all in mind is juz sex. use up liao juz throw one side. this had made most girls not virgin liao. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">" which is not totally true because if some of you girls didn't want it then you would still have been virgin right. It takes two hands to clap... so don't blamed it all on the guys although there are some jerks and creeps out there exactly like how you girls put it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, this is steorotyping right?<br><br>What about some gals who only go clubbing with the following on their mind:<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> finding 'carrot heads' to pay for their entertainment for the night<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> allowing themselves to be targetted?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> and perhaps, go clubbing with ONS on their mind?<br><br>Let's not characterised everyone according to what you might have seen on a grp of people, coz it's never fair to the rest who are not like that.<br><br>I don't think you like it if I were to say 'All guys are bastards' right? Which I dont think so, coz there're bound to be good guys out there, likewise for girls as well.<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth. Look at the bigger picture... dont be too judgmental based on what you see on the surface, basically, be more open minded and receptive. You cannot condone things people do, likewise, not everyone can accept what you're doing as well...<br><br>Bottom line, dont burden others with your own set of standards... no offense intended, neither keen on any flaming session..<br><br>/exits<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ben-i:</div><div class="quote_body">Guys only go clubbing with sex in their mind mah... what else? sex,drugs and alcohol... live the high life!</div></blockquote></div>
