Those who believe in fate and not doing anything abt their lovelife is just trying avoid their zero courtship skill and the inabilites to search for their true love!</div>

Denial is something time will heal.. when u have the urge to call ur EX .. dont! Assign a friend u can call instead. Don't try getting back! Just delete every single contact.. all the photos.. all the letters and be brave. After all this comes acceptance, and you will look back and learn that you have grown stronger.. next breakup will be easier to handle then the last.<br><br>yeap... i do agree... no point keeping those memories which will in return hurt you more... if got letters... burn eh... got contacts delete em.... if got photos... post them on porn sites! hahahha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Be &gt;&gt;PATIENT&lt;&lt; and get to know your interest really well before u commit. If you 2 are meant to be together it will work out by itself. Don't need too many tactics... Oh yeah, stay away from people that already have bf/gf, trust me its very time consuming and very messy.. even if u have loads of time u can do something more productive.<br><br>Breakup:<br>This is how it goes Sadness --&gt; Denial --&gt; Acceptance.

Always be optimistic.. do not dwell on any negative thoughts. Never let your Girl/Boy R/S be the center of your life, have a good balance! Don't need to worry about meeting Mr or Mrs perfect.. its funny but fate will bring u to him/her eventually.<br><br>Keep all these things in mind and good luck to ur relationships!!!<br><br></div></blockquote>patience patience patience<br></div>
