              <p>Hi AnimeSakura,</p>
              <p>I will suggest that you take the poly route, but only after you have decided which course you are interested in and wish to take. I will strongly advise you not to take the private institution route, for even if you get an "A"-lvl certificate at the end of the day, that does not mean your results will be good enough for you to enter a local university.</p>
              <p>Sometimes it is that one or two subject which will drag you down in JC, despite the fact that you are doing very well for the other subjects. I do have a friend who did very well for her Mathematics, but not for her Chemistry and Biology. (Please do note that she was taking "A"-lvl using the older system which only requires 3 subjects.) Instead of choosing to be retained for one year, she went over to Singapore Poly to take up accountancy.</p>
              <p>Currently, my friend has graduated with 2nd upper class honors from accountancy from NTU, and in case you are interested, these are the cut-off points for NTU's degree courses, including accountancy, for 2008.</p>

              <p>perharps the real question is how strong of the urge do you want to take the JC route....</p>
              <p>Sometime when a person fall off the wagon all it takes is just to stand up again.</p>
              <p>During my NS time i known of this guy who look much older than anyone of us...than over the 1 year i learned that he retake his JC because he wake up and decided to change subject of interest.....</p>
              <p>So the million dollar question is what do you want? If you know the path than is not a waste of time.</p>

              <p>U don't even need be top 10%, personally i think i'm top 15-20% of my cohort and i still got into local uni. Partly becos alot of top scorers choose to go overseas to study and chemistry is not a very popular course compared to some others in uni.</p>
              <p>For science and engineering courses especially, i recommend the poly route since poly students are more experienced and better equiped to handle all the practical stuff in uni unlike the JC students who just have a very blur look and some even now at 3rd yr are still not very confident in lab though its ALOT better than yr 1 where u can enter a lab and immediately find out who is from poly and who from JC without even asking.</p>
              <p>Most poly grads who do not get into local uni can easily get places in overseas uni and graduate alot earlier than from local uni or as u say they can go out to work.</p>
              <p>More options compared to JC which is either u go into uni or u are totally screwed.</p>

              <p>NTU Accountancy should be 1 of the hardest business course in singapore to get into.</p>
              <p>If u have 3 As, it shouldn't be too hard. Did u ever try?</p>
              <p>Accountancy like all business courses does not have any pre-requisites so whether u from science or arts background will not change anything. I've friends in accountancy who did not even did POA or any form of accounts course until they got into ACC yet they are still doing well.</p>

              <p>Hi Chris,</p>
              <p>It is not extremely difficult to get into a local uni, as you can see from the cut-off points which I have posted up previously. If you are aiming to enter NTU Accountancy though, it will be tough but possible for someone with three "A"s for "A"-level.</p>
              <p>Instead of entering CIMA, I will strongly advise that you apply to attempt to enter NTU's accountancy first.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p><br>AnimeSakuraTM (I hope you're a fan of Cardcaptor Sakura!), you shouldn't limit your future paths to only a few options that is has been controlled by the Education system and the peers in your environment.</p>
              <p>Truly, an average Singaporean student can only have so limited options to decide for their own paths in their future. Surely future itself can't be made up of such a few narrow paths as depicted the Education situation which you're in.</p>
              <p>If you have the financial to go private, then I would encourage you to take that further by pursuing a tertiary/university education overseas. Get out of your education prison and see the world for yourself. Feel the outside world for yourself and broaden your own perspectives and do not hold tightly onto your traditional Singaporean competitive values.</p>
              <p>The world is large and it's really is, and I'm sure you will be amazed and truly open up your own horizons if you truly made up your mind to be different from your peers who could be uncomfortable leaving their safe, secure shell and their ambitions is to only become just like everyone else around them ... only to be slightly better than everyone else around them.</p>
              <p>Failure is a situation only determined by the surroundings which you have believe to place yourself into. You may be a failure in your surroundings like Singapore, because of the strict rules in place upon your surroundings, you have been labelled as a failure, loser, handicap, under-achiever. Move yourself away from your surroundings and move onto JB (Johor Bahru), and do you still see yourself as a failure once you have relocated from your surroundings? A true failure is someone who is rejected by all the surroundings no matter where he goes, and I'm sure you have a true potential talent within yourself which you have not yet ventured upon or discovered it yet.</p>
              <p>Bear in mind you can only fly as far as your finances allowed. And make sure you come back and tell people A' -WHAT?- Level when you can already have a direct entry into many universities with only your O' -OK Only- Level certificate. </p>
              <p>Do not be easily defeated by your surroundings or the surroundings which has been put in place to easily control and contain people like yourself.</p>
              <p>If this surrounding doesn't fits your purpose like fitting a shoe from a shoe shop, then you must realised it it time for you to move onto a more suitable surrounding or find a more suitable shoe to fit in other shoe shops.</p>
              <p>Your surroundings or peers will almost never tell you to move on as they are true committers of social respect and they will NEVER try to sway your bad decisions in your life. However, when you finally tries to make a sound decision based on your own judgement, you will find there are many liberators of 'truth' who will try all sorts of methods and ploys to ensure that you stay on your own path and stick to your own line like all of them.</p>
              <p>If you want to stay in line and be nice? Take a number and join in the queue ok? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><a href="../../../users/252776">AnimeSakuraTM</a> no worries. I been through what you are experiencing. My advise is be sure of what you want. If you want to go poly make sure you go to the course you are interested. For me I am also retained by my JC and I chose to go poly and now I in NUS. Acutally it not hard to go local Uni via poly. For me I think it much more fun than JC. Yup..</p></div>

              <p>One never gets what one wants <strong>one gets what one is</strong> - what are you being most of the time - the answers would come to u. U may go to U/poly/ .... makes no difference.</p>
              <p>The past mistakes are simply gone - one cannot undo but one can certainly <strong>unlearn</strong> one's ways/habits and understand and make wise choices.</p>
              <p>Without understandin, without accepting warts and all of ONEself one is always going to faced with this - anxiety - which will in no time wear one out.</p>
              <p>PS _ If u find yourself comparing - then know this lar - it is VERY unhealthy - u will always feel that u are not good enough.</p>
              <p>If u feel inclined .... do read up - Nathaniel Branden n Wayne Dyer - i m merely recommending - the 'trip' is yours and yours alone</p>
