            <div class='col-md body'>I think you're being a little too harsh on yourself, in spite of your follies.<br><br>For a start, how old are you?<br><br>From your description, your latest squeeze - and understandably so at 24 - has just commenced on her journey in life where she gets a good mix of what life has to offer. The fact she yearns for freedom and not knowing what she wants clearly suggests that. Now, dealing with someone like her would obviously require a totally different tact compared to handling women in their late 20's looking to settle down. In view of that, if you're of a reasonable age to settle down and are actively looking to do so, this relationship is clearly a mismatch from the outset. Rather than criticising yourself exhaustively, why don't you just get a grip that not everything in life is within your control? Clearly, your partner's maturity is one of those things.<br><br>That said, I would say the point about whether you've what it takes to hold on to a relationship isn't so much about you being grossly accommodating or excessively intolerant. IMO, an issue of concern would be how far you are prepared to go to accommodate a woman in your life, rather than accept the fact it was a mismatch to begin with. Beyond your behaviour smacking of desperation, <strong>I certainly wouldn't imagine it prudent for you to compromise your principles and values (by that, I don't mean being rigidly regimental and chauvinistic obviously  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) for anything or anyone, much less a woman</strong>. Ultimately, for anyone seriously looking for a lifetime partner, I'm sure settling for someone who isn't prepared to stand his ground on the most fundamental issues in life is the last thing on their minds. This isn't a matter of trying to alter your behaviour to come across as <strong>challenging</strong> (which you seem to want to do now) to sustain a woman's interest for the sake of doing so - it's a matter of simply standing your ground and having the courage to be yourself.<br><br>In essence, to reconcile and address your woes, you've got to first determine the person you are and be who you are. That's what's within your control. What is beyond your control would be what your potential partner seeks in a beau - that is what you need to accept and come to terms with the fact that only women whose life values and beliefs complement yours are worthy of your pursuit. For those who don't fit that category, you have just got to give them a pass. It's high time you stopped hammering a square peg into a round hole.<br><br>After all, what good is it for you to attract someone who cannot accept your true self?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
