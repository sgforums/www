Don't allow yourself to be upset over such an incident. Give yourself some time to sort yourself out and don't start looking out for another relationship because you are not ready for one. Study hard, keep yourself fit by exercising and playing outdoor games with your friends, and do anything to enjoy life. Love is not meaningless, it has to do with giving and sacrifice. Don't confuse romance with love. Once again, don't give up on yourself. Although you may fail hundreds of times, but it's okay to fail. Everyone fails. But if only you can start picking yourself up each time you fall, there'll surely be a light at the end of the tunnel. Be strong!<br><br>Good luck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

So lets zoom in onto him. What sort of person is he? do you and him share common interests and stuffs? hmmm...  can the frienship bet you and him weather ups and downs?<br><br>though you like him and he also confesses that he likes you, but how accurate and how certain is he, on his part? maybe he's uncertain at that point and don't know exactly what he wants.. that's why now the repurcussions arise.. if he's really fallen for you, then he wouldnt have keep you waiting and waiting.. like fishing you know... throw out the bait, yet pull back the line// .. or meybe this is just the way he is? it's just that you din noe? coz some times, different ppl will have diferent "attitude" and it's only after a while it becomes more apparent to the other party... well, all these are just my personal views.. for your reference nia...<br><br>cum on, dont be disheartened... you'll definitely find your mr nice and right guy yea?!.... why hurry? you should instead concentrate on your studies, achieve good grades, parents happy, you happy, everybody happy.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>also, dun let your emotional mind overrides your conscious reasoning mind... do constantly tell yourself not to dwell on it so much, though it's inevitable you'll think of it... minimise the thinking and move on with your studies...<br><br>cheers...<br><br></div>

This is great; but a sad thing is that a portion of these people doesn't know how to seal a BGR relationship after that. It is like a salesman knowing how to talk and convince you about his/her product, but unable to do the proper closure of the business deal - <strong>this boils down to nothing</strong>.<br><br>Every chase has a life chart - the actual relationship should start when it hit the climax of the line chart because interest will gradually die down unless Art of Seduction is involved for another purpose; then it will be a complelely different thing.<br><br>You are probably a lady who doesn't fear revealing your own feelings to a guy, but still prefer to wait for his initiative on the decision to be together. Asking if you are on the rebound, it's a possibility. But I am pretty sure that you stand exactly on the line - you are a potential, but lack one small, yet important element that prevents him from making his final move. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">So near, yet so far kind.</span><br><br>You may wished to date him out privately and speak to him. Cease group outing and focus more on private dates - afterall, the personal attention is greater. You may want to communicate and make things clearer since most of the conclusion are purely blind thoughts from your side.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
