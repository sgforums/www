              <p> U seems unable to click with the remaining, cos u have not met a true person being not shallow and true of him/herself. The environment u are in maybe a reason. Expand yr social circle. Seek a better social cirle which may let u met the type of person u want to met.</p>
              <p>Example: Do u think u have a high chances of meeting a homely and obedient gal in a pub/clubbing?</p>

              My stand has always been that if even you yourself look down upon yourself, then probably there'll be no one left in this world who'll look up upon you.
              
              If even you yourself have no confidence in yourself, continue to think lowly of yourself, then don't expect other people to do otherwise.
              
              I agree that we do live in a judgemental world. Even I myself is guilty of judging others all the time, be it purposely or not. But at the end of the day does other people's judgement of us matters? No. 
              
              In the end it's your judgement of yourself, how you see yourself, how you want to live your life that matters.

              <p>Hey.. I felt the same way as you did this morning. But i told myself to behave like myself.. Not someone else. Its hard.. But once you have done it, its a smooth path all the way down. Keep this ancedote in mind, everyone feels that loneliness and is always constantly finding ways to fill up that hole with anything and everything. The best way to start a conversation without ending in silence would be first come out with a common topic, etc. Sports, Politics, Entertainment. Then ask HER/HIS view on the issue.. Then listen, afterwhich you begin to speak your side of opinion... Then calmly discuss every denials and objections and so on so forth. Always keep a relaxed attitude and speak calmly.. Don't rush to give your point of view or interrupt.. And most importantly, whatever you speak, make sure you really do have a certain amount of interest in it, if not, you'll sound really fake, and that seriously turns people off. When many people starts talking to you in one go. Don't panic.. Always remember to stay calm. Decides who has a bigger priority in your life and focus on him/her.. ignore the rest.. seriously.. they would probably join into your conversation with the chosen guy/gal. When seriously out of common topics to talk about, there is always the technique of shifting subjects/topics. For example you could suggest go getting a drink or some titbits to munch.. Or you could excuse yourself to go to the latrine to touch up a bit or wash your face and be in a totally relaxed position. When you are refreshed, you can always start the conversation rolling all over again. Its not about the quality of information given to each other when in a causal occasion, its about the interaction. And yes, stay flexible. When anything doesn't go according to what you planned, don't panic and try to bend back the conversation to your advantage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In conclusion, 1) interest in the subject 2) relaxed attitude. 3) stay calm~! a bit of emotions here and there won't hurt either~ 4) Apply techniques (if any) 5) "escape from conversation when you feel that you're losing it. 6) Flexibilty!!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you have any other doubts or queries feel free to leave me a pm, i will be more than glad to answer your questions. Most importantly, Happy chinese new year xiaobunbun, may your life be filled with wealth, good health and happiness.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>It's not that I do not want to retake O's. But I felt really wasted, wasting time doing things that I don't like, that's why I start going out to work. Besides, i want to pursue my own hobby instead. But you see, I am waayy too different from the others. So yes, there is always a big disparity between others &amp; myself. For example, I find facial piercings a good way to accentuate an appearance, but I know most of them would brush it off as 'wild' or 'nonsensical' or even, 'ugly'.</p>

              <p><br>everyone is different. something that u think is beautiful, someone else might deem it as ulgy. so what?? it's ur life not theirs. beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder though. what is there to be wasted abt? frankly speaking, time is not too much for anyone in the whole wide world though. the time is not going to stop for anyone. and it will not turn back for anyone. if u have indeed understand the importance of qualifications in Singapore, then you would have made plans for your future though. u want to pursue your own hobby can but then can ur hobby let you survive. sometimes in life we do what we need to do, not do what we want to do.</p>

              Dear Bun Bun,Must learn to look forward in life despite of past failure. Don't let past failures cloud your perception and lead you into thinking that the current situation is fixated and you can't do a thing about it now. The path that you are currently treading on is perhaps the less-travelled and probably is harder than most of us. However, life never promise us that it is a bed of rose. Sometime, we must learn to fight for what we want. Sometime mistakes are made so that we can learn to be a better person in the future.. when we know how to avoid making the same mistakes again. Victory/depending on your meaning of success will somehow tastes sweeter when you make some achievement with much effort and hardship. 
                                      
              Never give up when the tough is going and of what others are saying and treating you.Reflect on their comment/attitude and judge for their true value. If it is true, learn and if it isn't, let it go. And lastly, there are many successful people who does not succeed in life with a degree. Don't let past academic failure brand you as a failure. Taking failure into a postive light can serve you for a greater purpose for a better life in the future.. Who knows ?

              Hi I think it cool to be different. No matter what you did, there are always people who will label you as ugly, wild, shy, stupid, smart, successful, failure, chio etc etc. It will always happen in the society and "different" people just have to learn to accept there kind of thinking and attitude as norms.
              
              And oh yeah, for facial piercing, you will be limited for employment that required neat, clean and regular appearance. However for some, they don't see there as a limitation.
