Learn to make friends everywhere.<br><br>Money does the talking, not emotions!<br><br>Dont get affected by the surroundings. Be heartless.<br><br>'Fake it till you make it.' You still need to be of certain calibre to fake it.<br><br>Do not ever have regrets in life. Not even guilt.<br><br>Do a clean job everytime. Leave no clues behind.<br><br>Keep your mouth shut when you're not asked to talk. Talking all the time doesnt make people think you're smart.<br><br>Work alone if possible. More people means more implications.<br><br>There are no free lunches.<br><br>Do not kill straightaway. Play with them first. Always put on a smile. </blockquote></div>
