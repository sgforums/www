            <div class='col-md body'>Hi people,<br><br>i have faced alot of pain as i grow up. I had grown up feeling disappointment with both myself and people. I had stopped opening my heart up for a long time, perhaps for.. 7 years..till i met a fren who i really treasure alot but recently, we break up as friends. I still have friends who are there for me. However, i can't bring myself to open up/warm up to new people and people who are nice to me.<br><br>I was bullied in primary one, then was kind of taken advantage of in secondary school as i haven't met the friends that could appreciate me as who i am,. When i am in jc, i had grew even more antisocial. I was kind of outcasted in jc and had developed a kind of " don't talk" with people anymore, whenever i am in a group.  Fortunately, i had met frens in society club that i can count on during my jc.<br><br>My mother has a very strict and unloving influence on me. I had learnt to be unaffectionate with myself and people and it does not lead happiness. I am not a  very friendly person. People say i look fierce.<br><br>I feel pain.. cos i have met new friends who are nice.. and i could really like to get to know them better but i always felt this distance with people. I, on the other hand is also tired to deal with " ren " /people but yet i want to get to know them.</div>

There was this particular scene when Leo and Jennifer were talking about the differences between a good and bad guy, when Leo said that basically, they are all humans, just that we are differentiated by our actions.<br><br>What I am trying to say is that as humans, we are only different because of what we do. You should try to open up more. Like u say, u have friends in JC, talk to them more. Say what u wanna say(but of course, think before u say), and let them into ur hearts and mind. Let them know wat u are thinking, and only then can they know u better, and make the friendship bond even stronger.<br><br>Letting people into your heart may not be easy, due to some experiences or people around you. However, that shouldn't be a barrier or excuse for u to stop opening up because u are depriving people of the chance to know u, be ur friend, and love u for what u are.<br><br>Never give up letting people know u, because u never know when you will experience the joy and beauty of it.</div>

However, i had felt low very regularly and have developed the feeling of NOT opening up to people. It is a habit that i had developed since my jc years and had began getting used to it. Suddenly being alone and no talking seems natural to me.<br><br>i had often felt that i want and should be leave alone cos my participation in this social world will bring suffering to myself and others. Just let me bear the pain that i had feel alone. I do not want to burden others with my problems. However, when i am in a group or had met a person who has been treating me really nice, i really feel the urge to do the same back. However, if i am not feeling well, how can i react well to others? I feel awkward and uptight when i meet new people in a social situation.<br><br>I always feel this distance with people or should i say i tend to reject and push people? becos i do not want them to suffer to know me cos i am a person with problems. </div></blockquote>every1's the same<br><br>as for me<br><br>i tend to do better in 1 on 1 conversations.</div>
