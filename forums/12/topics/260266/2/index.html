            <div class='col-md body'>well, imho, feeling a kind of indequacy has to do with ur self-esteem.<br><br>i used to have really low self-esteem, and i really dun want to talk to people. In my jc times, i was so scared to talk to people, that sometimes, i avoid taking buses with even some of my male classmates, so that i can avoid the hassle of small talk.<br><br>now, i can confidently talk to a stranger (although i still be some discomfort), and i can socialise anywhere, anytime, anyone. it took a long way, but if u are willing, u can overcome the problem.<br><br>for starters, i would like to recommend this book called "6 pillars of self-esteem" by Nathaniel branden. Its really comprehensive, and offers great advice.<br><br>Hope this is of self to u.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't bash yourself for being a little more introverted than the average person.  Don't force yourself out of your shell too fast - you will be lost.  Take things one step at a time.. go out in small groups of 2-3 people who have something in common with you, plan activities ahead with them so that there's minimal chances of awkward silences.  I know that once awkward silence comes, it usually stays and kills your mood too :p<br><br>Lastly, cheer up, think of positive goals and how you want to achieve them.. you sound quite under-motivated :p</div>
