Initially ,we started out as friends and gradually became close friends such that we spend quite alot of time together yeah.<br><br>Recently i guess  half a year ago or so, our close friendship become strained. He sort of stopped talking to me for like almost half a year without any apparent reason except for one ridiculous one that my ex-best friend told me about that he keep away to test who i like.  By the way, at that time i got two close guy friends, he is the one of them.<br><br>Then, after quite some time of not communicating, i went to visit his blog and he was like saying : He don;t know the reason why is he keeping away but i still catches his eye that kinda thing.<br><br>Over the last few months, he started dropping hints again like always trying to get close , be there for me when i am sad meaning watching in silence, and even recently keep like engagin in eye contact. But i am afraid that i am thinking too much and maybe it might just be a game for him you know like to test out how good is he...<br><br>Though i have tried to remind myself how hurtful i was when he left me , i just can't stop thinking about him.<br><br>To add on to that, i am in a relationship.<br><br>Yeah.  I have tried to talk to him once but he seems rather reserved about his actions. It's very obvious when you know a person like you and i trust my instincts pretty well.<br><br>There was this one time that we went out for dinner. He just asked me to ordered whatever i like even though he knows that we were not be able to finish yeah. That day, he was quite happy but he tried to control his smile.When he send me home, he was sort of reluctant to go as if there were something that was keeping him<br><br>So what's his motive now for trying to get close again ? Btw , we haven;t talked like for one year. And everytime he tries to get close, he doesn;t talk as well just keep looking.<br><br></div>
