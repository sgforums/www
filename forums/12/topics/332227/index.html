              <p>i would like to hear especially the opinions of guys.</p>
              <p>what's your take on someone who went all the way to where you live to meet you once, but converse not regularly over the months thru sms and msn, who told you that he's obviously attracted to you and that "i shd know", one who articulates well, has experiences of friends to share, one who says he didn't like to be contacted via phone calls due to the nature of his prev job where he had to be on phone for long hours and that his health "suffers", but ask "why didn't you call?" on the topic of "women have needs too", asks me whether it would be the last time he sees of me, yet never set a date &amp; time to ask me out.</p>
              <p>Though he did once out of a sudden sms, ask me to go along with him the next day for something he needs to handle &amp; due to the confusion of all these mixed signals, i didn't reply. And hours later he suddenly told me that he couldn't make it either. Days after, he told me he had gotten his stuff done already. And when i assume that he had forgotten all abt wanting to meet me for the 2nd time, he gets offended and said dun ever think that he's forgotten abt it all. He sometimes takes hours to reply a sms and sometimes never replying at all. After several weeks of non-contact, he initiated contact thru sms passing on a forwarded joke when he had previously told me he's not one into such impersonal stuff as he "type all the messages personally" himself. And then after some exchange, he sms "not to expect anything from you but you have not been forgotten".</p>
              <p>Tell me, what kind of guy do you see here?</p>

              <p>if one day he wakes up his idea and realises u are not the one for him, both are gonna suffer.. so might as well nip this in the bud.. or rather, dun even start it altogether..</p>

              <p>regarding what maxtor said.. <strong>maybe that guy is a player.. trying

              <p><strong>now i see it does work.. </strong> coz like maxtor said, u really

              <p>it only worked because i tot of him as someone caring and responsible already before hand. That is why this "half cold half warm " confuses me. No girls like a downright jerk and no girls like a guy who depend on a girl solely for approval either.</p>
              <p>Maybe this guy is really into game-playing (i read somewhere that if you feel like it's a game, it probably is) but i'm not. For game-players, i have this to say, fine if you want to play games and i know some girls do too. But i don't toy with guys looking for sincere relationships or friendships, so go look for players of your own kind.</p>

              <p>If you intend to seriously target him, I suggest don't, look for a better person.</p>
              <p>If he is to be just an acquaintance, accept him as he is. Towards friends, be forgiving. They come in all manners of shape, size, and personality.</p>

              <p>i would like to hear especially the opinions of guys.</p>
              <p>what's your take on someone who went all the way to where you live to meet you once, but converse not regularly over the months thru sms and msn, who told you that he's obviously attracted to you and that "i shd know", one who articulates well, has experiences of friends to share, one who says he didn't like to be contacted via phone calls due to the nature of his prev job where he had to be on phone for long hours and that his health "suffers", but ask "why didn't you call?" on the topic of "women have needs too", asks me whether it would be the last time he sees of me, yet never set a date &amp; time to ask me out.</p>
              <p>Though he did once out of a sudden sms, ask me to go along with him the next day for something he needs to handle &amp; due to the confusion of all these mixed signals, i didn't reply. And hours later he suddenly told me that he couldn't make it either. Days after, he told me he had gotten his stuff done already. And when i assume that he had forgotten all abt wanting to meet me for the 2nd time, he gets offended and said dun ever think that he's forgotten abt it all. He sometimes takes hours to reply a sms and sometimes never replying at all. After several weeks of non-contact, he initiated contact thru sms passing on a forwarded joke when he had previously told me he's not one into such impersonal stuff as he "type all the messages personally" himself. And then after some exchange, he sms "not to expect anything from you but you have not been forgotten".</p>
              <p>Tell me, what kind of guy do you see here?</p>

              <p><br>If u are not sure of him, why not u try to see him out more and understand more of him? Rather than not sure and thinking of jump or not jump?</p>
              <p>Hint him out for dating. Or MSN him and communicate with him more to understand more of him.</p>

              <p>i dun think u will like playing games but if u think he does and u like him, try this. send him a forwarded good night msg one night. and then for the next few days dun call, sms, meet him. if he sms u dun reply, he call u dun pick up. n if he asks u out just say u're busy ...... try it. it might work.</p>
