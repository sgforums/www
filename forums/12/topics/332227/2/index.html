              night. and then for the next few days dun call, sms, meet him. if
              he sms u dun reply, he call u dun pick up. n if he asks u out just
              say u're busy ...... try it. it might work.</p>

              <p>i tried that already. He does reply. That's why it's so confusing. And he will never call due to his "health" reason remember? He has never actually set a time and date to ask me out except to say via sms that he would be free next month, or he would be free probably next week etc, but I see no concrete plans coming at all, it seems like just some throw-off lines that he'd utter without meaning to. We communicate well as in we both tease each other using words and are never really direct over msn and sms. But somehow or rather, I'd always feel a stumbling block between us in spite of all that. It was as if I couldn't get a direct answer out from him as he's very clever with words and I feel he dodges here and there even though he said I could ask him whatever I want. Hence in the end, it seems as good as not asking at all.</p>
              <p>Enough of an eye for an eye, I dun wanna sacrifice my big beautiful eyes for that. I see no sincerity, so I'm bailing out.</p>
              <p>So all of you think he's playing games with me? So I'm not alone in thinking this way?</p>

              <p>Sometimes half the fun lies in not knowing. If you think about it, there's nothing much to lose from replying a simple sms. It's just basic courtesy and 5 cents each. </p>
