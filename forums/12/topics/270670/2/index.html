Use this time to ask B out as a friend for outings. Without the bf status is easier for you to go out with B. B is tired of A constant sticking to her and she wants her freedom. Be there as a friend for her. Take your time let B feel that being with you is much relax and have much freedom than being with A.<br><br>Most important thing is to be patient.
