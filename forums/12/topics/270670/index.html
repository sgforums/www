And also, I wonder why is there a need for such histrionic attempt to build a plot around a possibility?<br><br>FI has kinda sum up everything in her own words; why are you even worrying over a problem that has not yet materialise? It's good to keep that in view, but not to the extend of fretting over it as if you are truly facing that crisis now.<br><br>I think the most injustice you could ever do to your relationship is to lie low as if it's criminally abominable to engage in your chosen love - it goes to any relationship that cannot keep it's presence glorious. In fact, when you do something like these, you are effectively conveying to people that there's something terribly unglamorous or even fishy, and this aura might actually be the reason that A turns away from you two. Previously, you three were good friends and now that you and B becomes an item, you close up your world and 'keep secrets' among yourselves?<br><br>Now tell me, who's really pushing people away?<br><br>Do you seriously think that you could keep this from her forever by doing what you are doing now? That's utter naive.<br><br>Why bother so much about people's comment? I can tell you that most of the time, it's probably just part of a typical conversation. Probably you are the one adding more meat to this 'bone'.<br><br>Why live your love according to people's expectation?<br><br>If there's something you need to learn out from this: learn to be true to yourself.

If u want to have a r/s with B and befren A... <span style="color: red;">the key is B and A must come out with some sort of a "silence" agreement (meaning they are willing to be fren even if B is ur gf and A understand that)</span><br><br>So u think is the highlighted phrase achievable?</div>
