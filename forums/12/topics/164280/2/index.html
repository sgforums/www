From <strong>MY</strong> experience, it's the other way round. I mean, she showed all the signs above, but in the end I found out she just treat me as friends.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I have crush in her before that. I was very kind and friendly to her (or so I thought), and she found me as a very good friend. That's why she started to became very close to me, hence she showed all the signs above, so I thought it's the chance for me to confess my feelings to her, which is the mistake I did. She doesn't smile when sees me, sms me when bored, tell about herself or find me out anymore... I don't think this friendship can go back as it was before....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
