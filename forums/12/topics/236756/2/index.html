Suddenly I dun feel like her best friend anymore.<br><br>But I decided that frens come and go, you will meet so many more people in your life, they might never give you the special feelings she gave you last time, but they are also special in their own ways, no?<br><br>You cant force her to be close with you now that she is spending more time with her bf...just occupy your time with other things and other people, and if she cherishes your frenship, she will come crawling back to you in a while when she gets tired of her bf  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
