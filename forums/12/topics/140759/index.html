            <div class='col-md body'>it's ok to feel weak and vulnerable sometimes... it's ok to feel like you need someone to be there. it's ok to feel disappointed when the one you love isn't there when you need him. but ultimately, dun let it affect your r/s. know that you not only have him. you have other friends to depend on when he can't be there. cheer up.</div>

Isnt this the time when your friend come in? morover, you can help her to get over her breakup faster if you spent more time with her. women feel better by talking over a problem.<br><br>spent more time with your friend is the advise i give.</div>

Cheers!</span></strong>[/b]</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You feel alot... but does he knows anything on what you have written in this post?<br><br>Insecurity? Or lack of proper communication, which give rise to the insecurity?<br><br>What's security? Is there such thing as 100% secured? Even if he is around, technically speaking, you still wouldn't achieve the 100% secured marking because there isn't such a thing. When he is away and you feel vulnerable: are you experiencing some kind of situation that causes you great emotional distress and needed him very much? Or it is just because he is 'missing'... away on mission and this causes emotional inbalance?<br><br>Soon is right about a boyfriend's responsibility to be there when their gf needed them to tide over critical emotional times - but this only applies to the above former. As for the latter, the underlying problem actually lies with the gf themselves. To rush back in the middle of his mission and to satisfy the latter's problem is what we call in Mandarin 'Zhi biao bu zhi ben'. And eventually, there are more missions to come, more days of longing... and the old problem crops up again and again... and again...<br><br>P.S: Does this insecurity comes with your past experience with guys (or past relationship) or does it appear because of him (your current relationship or probably only him alone)? Virgo has this tendency to think-too-much to the extend of being irrelevant. And being irrelevant is bad, especially for relationship - sprouting scenarios, characters, possibilities, etc that ain't there... but existed in your mind. You may like to communicate this thingy to him, for he may have yet to know the structure of your thinking and emotions. This will likely to cut your fear and insecurity by quite abit, through effective communication.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
