Or it is just because he is 'missing'... away on mission and this causes emotional inbalance?<br><br>Soon is right about a boyfriend's responsibility to be there when their gf needed them to tide over critical emotional times - but this only applies to the above former. As for the latter, the underlying problem actually lies with the gf themselves. To rush back in the middle of his mission and to satisfy the latter's problem is what we call in Mandarin 'Zhi biao bu zhi ben'. And eventually, there are more missions to come, more days of longing... and the old problem crops up again and again... and again...<br><br>P.S: Does this insecurity comes with your past experience with guys (or past relationship) or does it appear because of him (your current relationship or probably only him alone)? Virgo has this tendency to think-too-much to the extend of being irrelevant. And being irrelevant is bad, especially for relationship - sprouting scenarios, characters, possibilities, etc that ain't there... but existed in your mind. You may like to communicate this thingy to him, for he may have yet to know the structure of your thinking and emotions. This will likely to cut your fear and insecurity by quite abit, through effective communication.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers  </div></blockquote>when i m ill, when i met accident, when i must get injection &amp; therapy, when friends around me are always occupied with bfs. when i have no family to rely on, when i always wanted to do alot of things with him.

You had lost the previous relationship suddenly, without explaination like you have mentioned, and lingered much in a terrible mess. This sudden, unexplained lost is somewhat re-portraying the emotional scene right now, with your bf away on a long mission - 'missing' but with reasons.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The heart probably feels a similar picture and trigger a defensive alarm with you wanting him back to your side so badly, to end the mental and emotional torment. </strong></span><br><br>You have to acknowledge that something is wrong, either with you or the dynamic of the relationship. And either one has to compromise and sacrifice to allow better cruise of your love.<br><br>P.S: Do <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NOT </strong></span>substitute a face-to-face talk through a hasty phone conversation. Since the topic is pretty heavy and require much emotional thinking, it is better for him to complete his mission, meet up in some good environment and speak out. Since you have some time on hand, you may like to plan what you want to say to him, think about your options available and possible complications or consequences.

For me, my case was quite bad that I did not communicate with my ex at all.

But then its too late cos shes aready over him and in a rls.<br><br>It will be good to tok to him abt ur insecurities. If u cant wait, just tell him the nxt time when he calls.
