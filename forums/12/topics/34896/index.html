Let me enlightened. Firstly: Never put too much trust in friends - learn how to use enemy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Be wary of friends, for they will betray you more quickly - for they are easily aroused by to envy. They also become spoiled or tyrannical. But a former enemy will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. In fact you have more to fear  friends than enemies.<br><br>Then you have to re-create yourself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Do not accept the roles society foist on you. Re-create yourself by creating a new identity, one the commands attention and never bores the audience. Be the master of your own image rather than letting others define for you. Incoperate dramatic device into public gesture and actions - your power will be enhanced and you will be seen larger than life.<br><br>Learn to keep people dependant on you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>To maintain independence, you must be needed and wanted. The more you are relied on, the more freedom you have. Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity and your have nothing to fear. Never teach them enough for their cannot do without you.<br><br>Once this is succeeded, make them come to you - use baits if neccessary.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>When you force the other party to act,  you are the one in control. Its always better to make your opponent come to you, abandoning his own plans in the process. Lure him with fabulous gains then attack - you hold the cards.<br><br>Finally to assist you to cripple them, use selective honesty and and generosity to disarm your victim.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>One sincere and honest move will cover a thousand of dishonest ones. Open-hearted generosity bring down the guard of even the most suspicious people. Once selective honesty opens a hole in their armor - you can deceive and manipulate them at will. Followed by a timely gift - a trojan horse - will serve the same purpose here and they will be utterly destroyed.<br><br>1 Strategy in 36 Stratagem of War - Man Tian guo hai - make sure your doings in invisible to the society. Work underground and strike in the night - only attack when you know you will destroy them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Cheers *Evil mode on*<br></div>
