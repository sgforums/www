Hmm... if he is a sensitive person, and the Japanese have a lot of racial pride... it will be pretty devastating to him. A friend of mine who read the book was quite affected by the graphic portrayals. and she's neither Japanese or Chinese.<br><br>So again... be sensitive ba. Perhaps you can explain to him you didn't give him the book out of any personal hatred! Just that you have heard such books on WWII is rare in Japan, so you gave him and it was unintentional.<br><br>Ultimately, you can't avoid handling the topic ba. Its a bit controversial.
