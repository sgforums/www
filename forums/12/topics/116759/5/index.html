Do you really love her..? Or do you love yourself more...?<br><br>If you really love her and has genuine concern for her, you should just be happy for her or at least be kinda enough to really wish her all the best and let her go for now....<br><br>Alternatively. I would like to tell you that there's little much you can add to your 'story' for now. Little much of much good to either party... May there used to be betrayal, wasted efforts and abandon.. You realise that you're not totally clear of faults too... Accept it. At this point if you still don't wanna just admit that your boat's sinking, you'll just sink along with it...<br><br>Be happy now that she's happy with her current bf and search for your own happiness at the same time... You can just stand down there and wait. Chances are 'happiness' won't just come to you...<br><br>There's no turning back for now.. Time to move on or stay to await your own 'funeral'.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br><br>I have been to JB with my friend recently for shopping spree which I have always been with my ex. I have pass by alot of shops , photo booth where I and my ex used to take trading cards photos. I realised something, even I and her have broke up, everythings seems to be running or moving as usual or make it this way, the earth is still moving. My heart hurts so much that it seems to stop somehow. Why? I really dont know. Maybe she has drifted further apart from me since I last receive her very last email before every communication ends.<br><br>To Devil 1976, tan_william, icepole, parn, and of course not forgetting Project_D, I have not taken your advices for granted, I have learnt alot from this traumatic nightmare for how much I did for her, if she can so easily do such things for me, this is how she takes me for and also how lightly she takes a relationship. I learned that life is really short. Even if I still live in the past, the earth will still keep moving, she is still enjoying, whats the use of bringing out the past which she has taken it for granted? Though its hard to swallow, I have somehow managed to do it gradually. Maybe I am soft or maybe I am forgetful, she is moving away from me day by day.  I wish that my next relationship last and hopes that things turn out well and will not ends up in such a drastic situation.<br>In the meanwhile, I will find something which I have been wanted to do since when I am single back then especially when I have a stable job and a stable income now.<br><br>I will not forget you guys and gals for giving me such great advices and also showing your patience for I have been nagging repeatedly. Like what my friends told me, time will show to her that I am a better man, trustable and reliable man is better than someone who can bring joy to her cos I have shown her that I can go through hardship with her.<br><br>I will still make myself present in sgforum. Maybe, if anyone in future who met with such similar situation, I may be able to provide a helping hand. Wish me luck in my future. Thanks to all.</div>

I realised something, even I and her have broke up, everythings seems to be running or moving as usual or make it this way, the earth is still moving. My heart hurts so much that it seems to stop somehow. Why? I really dont know. Maybe she has drifted further apart from me since I last receive her very last email before every communication ends.<br><br>To Devil 1976, tan_william, icepole, parn, and of course not forgetting Project_D, I have not taken your advices for granted, I have learnt alot from this traumatic nightmare for how much I did for her, if she can so easily do such things for me, this is how she takes me for and also how lightly she takes a relationship. I learned that life is really short. Even if I still live in the past, the earth will still keep moving, she is still enjoying, whats the use of bringing out the past which she has taken it for granted? Though its hard to swallow, I have somehow managed to do it gradually. Maybe I am soft or maybe I am forgetful, she is moving away from me day by day.  I wish that my next relationship last and hopes that things turn out well and will not ends up in such a drastic situation.<br>In the meanwhile, I will find something which I have been wanted to do since when I am single back then especially when I have a stable job and a stable income now.<br><br>I will not forget you guys and gals for giving me such great advices and also showing your patience for I have been nagging repeatedly. Like what my friends told me, time will show to her that I am a better man, trustable and reliable man is better than someone who can bring joy to her cos I have shown her that I can go through hardship with her.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">I will still make myself present in sgforum. Maybe, if anyone in future who met with such similar situation, I may be able to provide a helping hand. Wish me luck in my future. Thanks to all.</span> </div></blockquote>Thanks for your last note.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>3 things I would like to bring out for now... And hope there after you'll successfully set sail for your life...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>1. After whatever she've done to you. She's not worth it. Be glad that she's gone. In fact a blissing in disguise.<br><br>2. You've not totally lost. You've got experience to learn from. And not forgetting that you were ONCE HAPPY with her before. Though at present, it shouldn't matter anymore. Take it as you're just paying for all that. Like people often say.. "Nothing's for free in life."<br><br>3. Understand that there'll always be failures in life. Even after you've gotten over this one, there would be a chance that the next one might hurt you equally or even more. "Don't be afraid. Don't give up."<br><br>Wish you luck in your future endeavours.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Or worse... It's always better to be mentally prepared and have a wider range of acceptance for how things might turn out to be.... It don't necessarily have to be a negative form of thinking...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone, I know this is a learning experience, I will not accept another girl as yet, not so soon, only when I have feelings for her and understand her well before I will go after her. I dont want to go after a girl which I dont love her as much as when I go after my ex. Though different feeling but I want to make sure that the feeling is there before I make the next move.</div>
