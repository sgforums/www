Seems to have experience more hardship than I do.<br><br>I must admit that I am stil very unbalance in handling my feeling. Time do drift my ex apart from me. Didnt see her and hear from her ever since all comms put to halt.

            <div class='col-md body'>well, look at it from another perspective. at least you realised it way before you are into the marriage. also, plans do not always go according to what we've planned. that's the turning point. make another plan again. it's abt how you handle and manage it. and it's about choice again.<br><br></div>

But its because of how she treats me and betray me for what I have done for her, giving me nasty remarks, ask her new bf to send me nasty sms, accepts him so easily, not even considering of how much I care for her during the period I and her are together and worst of all, plan so well how to dump me,, how to forgive and let her go? I know I may lost the chance if the girl I am going out now stops waiting for me. I am trying to build up courage and feelings too.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi tan_william, sorry to hear abt what has happened to you, I also saw her photo in friendster too in december and her new bf photo. Understand how you feel. My ex has blocked it away from and only those who has connection with her can view the photos. I think I will set a time line to really let her go thoroughly, I hope. As for the new girl, I am not ready, just wait and see.<br><br>I shall not forget what has happened to me and what she has done to me. I may forgive but shall not forget.<br><br>Believe it or not, it is becos she left me, series of events happened that lands me in a stable job. I believe its god got eyes to see what misery I have gone through. I was blessed with a stable job but its up to me to move on.<br><br>Really hope that I will be blessed with a good girl, a girl who treasure me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>naturally, there will be a certain amount of anger, injustice, regret or even guilt when a r'ship has ended. overcoming the hurt &amp; pain from a failed r'ship doesn't happen instantly. you have to deal with your feelings in a calm yet courageous manner.<br><br>if it's over, learn to let go. never easy, but you just gotta try. what other better option than this? any strong reason to back your better option? why look back at why this &amp; why that? do not let the past damage you. make peace with your past so you can love and trust again, not now maybe but in the future.<br><br>Life is about falling down and getting up again. Get back up, refine yourself, and go pursue what you really want (with hope and gusto, of course).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ptw:</div><div class="quote_body">She has been my gf for abt 2 yrs. Just recently broken up. She left me for another guy during my exam. I am a working adult but doing a par time course. She encourage me to do it but sh has alot of problem but I suffered with her till she found a new job.<br><br>I helped her in her resume writing, teaches her how to tackle interviewers qns. I am so happy that she has found a new job and thought that all effort put in was well paid off. I have to struggle between work, study and also her personal prob. he was not that type of proactive girl who will take the initiative to do what is necessary.<br><br>The next thing I knew from her friend after we broke off was that during my exam leave struggling for my papers, she knew a guy from the net. We broke off eventually. She claimed that she broke off with me before accepting nother guy. I was very hurt, very very depressed. I have to struggle btw getting over her, struggle btw work, study and finding new job cos I am on contract employment basis (all alone).<br><br>To make it short, I was converted to permanent staff eventually but I just feel lonely. I am ok but have not fully recovered from it. Feel numb rather than sad. I knew a girl and have tried going out ith her but just dont have any feeling (if that the correct word to use). Still thinks abt the wonderful times I have spent with my ex, just comes into my mind occasionally. Pls help me. Feel so empty...<br><br></div></blockquote>She left you because she doesn't love you anymore or she felt that you didn't love her anymore. She has her own reasons for leaving you and some of her reasons which you might never find out about.<br><br>She might be still grateful to you for all the help you have given her all these years, but gratefulness simply doesn't evolve to love most of the time.<br><br>If you still love her, win her back with your love. Else, time to move on and start paying attention to other girls who has been with you all this while. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck, hope you are feeling better now...it's been a while since that unfortunate incident fell on you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Parn,<br><br>I have thought of this issue before too, she is a girl who dont think much in depth and worst of all, even if she dont love me, a normal girl will not end a relationship so nastily, using me to prove to his new guy that she is loyal by allowing him to sms me. Sorry, not to defend myself, I just dun think thats the right way,<br><br>I will let her go once I have settled myself down. Theres nothing I can do.</div>
