            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks tan_william, why I want to vent my anger and pain in sgforum was that I really need to shout and after I shouted it out and the encouragement I received, I felt relieved. Believe it or not, I thought f proposing to her last december, too fast and too harsh for me to take this pain.<br>One motivating factor that kept me moving on was that her family called me during my reservist and apologised for what she has done. Talk abt friendster, when she decided to break up with me, she changed her status from attached to single, I ask her why, she told me its normal and I stupidly believe her. Why I am able to stand up on my feet was that her family ( I dun want to specify who, she may be reading, I dun want any family quarrel) told me that I did nothing wrong, its her who wants to leave me. They encourage me to move on, they told me I am not fated to be with her. Painful but I felt relieve, they told me that I did not do anything wrong.<br><br>If she can know and accept a guy so easily from the net, I would have dump her when she met with so much problems. I am not that sort of guy and I will never will.<br><br>I must admit that Iwas really very poor back then, really no money to treat her for goodmeal or enjoyment. She was a good girl back then, very understanding, gave me all the encouragement and motivation, We tried evry means to save money, or rather she saves alot of money for me. Even till our relationship ended, I did not spent much on her, but she dumped me cos I got no time for her, cant chat for long wth her. I can only speak through actions.<br><br>I remembered one day when I knocked off from work, so tired, I went to her house straight with my bermudas, t-shirt and slippers, help her wash car, so romantic right, after washing, I went back home which is abt 12am. There are many things besides this which I have done for her. Dun hurt me until like this when she plans to dump me.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Project D and all Friends,<br><br>Sorry for bringing up bad memories.<br><br>My cousin ask me what happen during CNY and he thinks that its not worth feeling or even think of how much she has done to me. He said one thing, she is clever in one way to have planned out everything that benefits her and hurts me. My cousin shared the same view as you guys and gals, time will heal, but going through the period really suffering.<br><br>I may have the appetite to eat, drink and go out with friends but the feeling of being stabbed multiple times and left to recover is really unbearable, still haunts me at times.<br>I am not a guy who go for relationship just to so call "play play" , if cant click, find another girl, dump her kinda person. She has so much problem, I went through with her, I did not think of dumping her except at times we quarelled but I still gave her the security that I will not betray her.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> What have I done to deserve this?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi tan_wiiliam and icepole,<br><br>glad that I start to open up but the feeling as compared to chasing after my ex is different, different as I am not as enthusiast when I am after my ex. furthermore, although I am with her, there is emptiness in me. My heart tells me that I am not ready, not as yet, there is something I have to settle first, like what my cousin told me that I will only settle my heart not becos I have move on but rather when I know that she has made the wrong choice. I dun know is it true.<br>Or rather see her suffer for making the wrong choice, then I will move on. I think its abit too cruel. What do you think?</div>
