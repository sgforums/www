            <div class='col-md body'>I believe anyone can be very soft hearted when their ex start crying and apologise for what they have done. Unless really hate her deep into the bone. Very contradicting, she hurt me yet I may want to help her if anything happens to her.<br><br>tan_william, I agree with you, I really dun want to be a spare tyre too.</div>
