            <div class='col-md body'>Overcoming a failed r'ship is never easy. At certain point of time, painful memories may flood back. However, you must know that you live for yourself. Gather the strength you never know you have. Rediscover yourself.<br><br>It may not be a suitable period for you to start dating again now as you may be undergoing a 'rebound' effect. Clear all your thoughts. Believe in yourself that you've got the capability to move on WITHOUT her. Someone out there, your right one, is on her way to you. Someone who will appreciate you for who you are and will not be easily tempted by other factors.<br><br></div>
