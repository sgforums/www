            <div class='col-md body'>Sudden loss of a loved one is one of greatest pains on Earth. Words are not always necessary for consolation, sometimes an understanding touch on the arm or shoulder could bring on more solace. If you are religious, prayers do help immensely.<br><br>This may not be an appropriate time to ask, considering how distraught you are, but I am just curious: If Sera was in the front passenger seat, Viola was sitting behind her, and Remy was behind driver Ah Lao, do you know what was the nature of collision impact that could result in Viola remaining  relatively unscathed while Sera and Remy sitting diagonally opposite to each other were mutilated in the accident? I couldn't help thinking the scenario'd have made more sense if Remy was sitting behind Sera instead.<br><br>Anyway, it's not really significant -- I was just trying to imagine the collision scenario. Take it easy.</div>

Perhaps the best way is Not to say anything too much nor too deep to remind her day &amp; night of her loss.  She probably already has many people doing that.<br><br>Instead, a pretty card with a short para or message may do much more.  Something along the lines of, "Anytime you need to talk, please don't hesitate to call, even if it's in the middle of the night" etc may do much more than alot of sad words.<br><br>People need time to heal, it's best to let them be.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Tuatau:</div><div class="quote_body">Sudden loss of a loved one is one of greatest pains on Earth. Words are not always necessary for consolation, sometimes an understanding touch on the arm or shoulder could bring on more solace. If you are religious, prayers do help immensely.<br><br>This may not be an appropriate time to ask, considering how distraught you are, but I am just curious: If Sera was in the front passenger seat, Viola was sitting behind her, and Remy was behind driver Ah Lao, do you know what was the nature of collision impact that could result in Viola remaining  relatively unscathed while Sera and Remy sitting diagonally opposite to each other were mutilated in the accident? I couldn't help thinking the scenario'd have made more sense if Remy was sitting behind Sera instead.<br><br>Anyway, it's not really significant -- I was just trying to imagine the collision scenario. Take it easy.</div></blockquote>Yeah. I find it weird even after my dad explained it to me.<br>When the car saw the container, the driver turned steering right. But itÂ’s already too late; the left head of the car hit the container. Sera got hit. (Then because of the speed heÂ’s going, sort of likeÂ… recoil back the other direction. Well, that's what I think. I don't understand why it went the other way too.) It turned a 360Â° left till the right rear of the car hit the right side of the container. I was told that the car cut through the container, and stuck in it. And the top cover of the car got ripped open too.</div>

A ghastly sight the scene must have been.<br><br>Looks like Ah Lao had been driving very fast to generate that kind of impact upon collision with the container truck.</div>
