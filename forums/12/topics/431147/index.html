              <p><br>u already make yourself seem like a retard when u replied to my topic, but anyway, thats old story..</p>
              <p>maybe the problem could be from your diet? some people i know who are caffeine addicts try to stay away from coffee before slping.. that includes sweet things like chocolates..</p>
              <p>planking only makes u more awake, because your body n spine is stretched straight and that makes you more alert, plus the attention from strangers, adrenaline rush.</p>
              <p>30 years old considered mid-life? then every decade of people's life will have crisis liao.</p>
              <p>plaza sing doesnt seems that entertaining (at least now) to me..</p>
              <p>could try social clubs? i dont know yet, never try before.</p>
              <p>aussie ? people wake up at 5.30am just to wash up and be on the road to work or school. and u cant slp at 4am. u sure u could adjust to life there?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>lols... gerberad sounds more like scolding him rather than giving him advise.LOL... well i tink ts u lost some drive and some motivation due to certain reason which i dunno and probably u dunno. Mayb u nid to do sth else other than the norms u do so that u'll be able to find interest in it. Or mayb u nid a goal in life.</div>

              <p>To TS,</p>
              <p>You are sick and tired of your life.</p>
              <p>You have no aim in life and wonder what should you go for.</p>
              <p>Try something new for a change.</p>
              <p>Like the movie in "Yes Man"</p>
              <p>To learn something new or find the next stage of life, you got to let loose and try things that you never try before.</p>
