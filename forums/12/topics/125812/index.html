            <div class='col-md body'>Before: sms me bout averaging once a week (at one point everyday for 1 week, that was after her visit to singapore)<br>Now : Nil (close to a month from her last sms,reason,can't send over)<br><br>Even if there's no sms, there'll be an email once awhile, and I call her up once a week...to maintain some form of contact.<br><br>Now, I did not send sms to her, as she told me her phone can't receive, network problem, she ask her service providers also can't give answer. Told her to email me but tats bout 2 months e emails didn't arrive. She only can email from net cafes and sometimes, error when sending out emails. Now, I hear no news and reply, sigh<br><br>She's busy at the moment with her summer school stuffs. However, after I visited her at her country, I felt abit different when I came home. Things weren't what it's used to be. There wasn't just enough time to talk to her when I visit her, her studies<br><br>Everytime I call her at night, she seems so busy to me, I can feel it.<br>She only can converse with very simple english (listen can, reply abit problem)<br>Sometimes I wonder, why girls sometimes behave hot n cold towards U?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps she is really busy? Maybe she needs some time to herself? Who can tell what a woman is thinking all the time? Even other women also don't have a clue at times.<br><br>If you sense her discomfort next time you call her, first ask her if she has any problems with you calling her. If she clams up, tell her you're aware of her discomfort and will probably call her again some time <span style="font-style: italic;">much</span> later. If she still has nothing to say to that, then you just say goodbye and carry on with your life as usual. That not only cuts her the slack she may have wanted, but it also gives you some time to cool down and clear your head.<br><br>And maybe when you call her again at the promised time, both of you would probably by then have a better idea where the relationship is heading.<br><br>Of course not everybody would do this, but that's what I'd do. Life is simply too short to waste so much time and energy clinging on a person who doesn't appreciate the effort. Give her the space she wants, and save some dignity for yourself. Good luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi thanx for your reply,<br>well, the problem is... sometimes we have difficulties understanding what each other is trying to express (language barrier) face to face is easier, but not over the phone.. and thats really quite a problem cox she's not in sg...<br>Well, maybe I'll just leave her alone for sometime, and call less often.. I dunno<br>, it just ain't feel e same anymore, sigh....sometimes I feel, inter-country relationship isn't really simple, language, location, different culture of expression... it relly takes alot of time n effort</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by dirge:<br>sometimes I feel, inter-country relationship isn't really simple, language, location, different culture of expression... it relly takes alot of time n effort</blockquote>You're right. Long distance relationships are indeed difficult, and require lots of time, effort and money. I just attended a close friend's wedding couple of months back, and guess what? His wife comes from England, almost like half a world away. He has chalked up so many miles flying that he qualifies for upgrade every time he goes on a trip. And the phone bills... thank heavens for VoIP. It's a good thing his wife is now living in Singapore with him -- he didn't have much left to spend on other things else before that.<br><br>Point is: Long distance relationships <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> work out at times, even if the odds may be as high as of Singapore getting into the World Cup. Give her some space to breathe first, then reach out for her again. If you still feel the same intensity for her then as you do now, and you could still sense that she has something for you as well, then it may not be a bad idea to go with your heart and persist on.<br><br>Oh, one more thing. Phone calls may help to maintain contact, but nothing is more sincere than physical contact. "Out of sight, out of mind." My friend wouldn't have stood a chance if he didn't fly over to meet his then-girlfriend regularly. Make some effort to visit your friend overseas or invite her to come over for a short stay. You could even organise a trip abroad together, if both of you could afford it.<br><br>You could fail, but at least you would not regret for not trying. Or you could succeed and end up sharing your life with the special someone whom others have spent entire lifetimes searching. No matter how the relationship turns out, your life has been made richer for it and who knows -- it could perhaps be the most unforgettable experience you'll ever have.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys..thanx for the replies.. I like this paragraph<br>"You could fail, but at least you would not regret for not trying. Or you could succeed and end up sharing your life with the special someone whom others have spent entire lifetimes searching. No matter how the relationship turns out, your life has been made richer for it and who knows -- it could perhaps be the most unforgettable experience you'll ever have"<br><br>However.. being human the dominant species.. somehow or rather, still hope that it would be better to be together rite.. but then.. I guess to try it out would still beat sitting n thinking of worse scenerio.<br><br>But then again.. she's still a student and haven't really seen the working world yet.. so still quite optimistic bout her having the same thinking when she graduated and step into the working world. Would the thinking of " I prefer sg guys than puchai" be there when she start to work?</div>
