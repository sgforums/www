Let her know that you love her and get her to accept you. Let her know that you have no interest in 'B'.<br><br>2nd, let 'B' understand that love cannot be forced. Let her know that you really love 'A'. Tell her that love shouldn't be selfish. You're sorry for your decision but you hope she would wish you well in your relationship instead.<br><br>'A' is the crucial character to be convinced here. If you can't convince 'B', then just go along with 'A'.... Spend more time with 'A' not only of both your own world but also infront of friends... Especially B's and A's.... REMEMBER.
