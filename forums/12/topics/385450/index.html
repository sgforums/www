              <p>Hi Lyris,</p>
              <p>Trust is a very important factor for a relationship to succeed. The actions of your partner will only create strains in your relationship, and calling you names certainly does not help at all.</p>
              <p>Bring your partner to see a relationship counsellor, and have him/her talk it out with the two of you, since your partner is unlikely to listen to you. The most important thing is for him to understand that a relationship is build on love, trust and commitment. Lacking any one of these can easily cause a relationship to crumble apart.    </p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Lyris,</p>
              <p>While trust is a must. It is something you must earn.</p>
              <p>While you may think the relationship is crumbling because of his insecurity, perhaps it could be your need for " secrecy" that's creating distrust and destroying the relationship?</p>
              <p>For a long term relationship to last, being open to each other about your daily life , helps a lot.</p>
              <p>Does he gives you access to all his personal communication archives ?</p>
              <p>Why won't YOU offer to give him access, to earn his trust ? When you offer to share willingly, he won't need to harp on it so much.</p>
              <p>Is there something in your sms or emails you don't want him to know ?</p>
              <p>If you think this guy is not someone you want for the long term, then it is understandable you guard your secrecy so fiercely. Your boyfriend will figure this one out soon enough.</p>
              <p>Remember, passwords can be easily changed. Is your relationship with this guy worth it ?</p>

              <p>Sharing password and such is fine. But asking to see your SMS all the time shows that he does not trust that you will not fool around outside. I bet he probably checks your mail twice a day to see if there is anyone asking you out.</p>

              <p><br>Usually I only allow such things to happen once, if your partner is a very insecure and possessive person by nature, there is no way you can do to help him except to leave him and help both you and him to stop all the future pains in your relationship.</p>
              <p>I must admit that many Singaporean guys behaves like this ... I did not say all Singaporean guys, just many of them only.</p>
              <p>Successful at work or not has absolutely nothing to do with his ability to handle his own relationships.</p>
              <p>I would advise you to leave this childish boyfriend of yours for your own good, regardless whether he's your boyfriend or husband. Guys like him only end up doing more harm to any girls who ended up with him and it's fair for you to leave him for your own good.</p>
              <p>Whether you realised it or not, you are already in an abusive relationship and if you want to suffer in silence like a maid, you are free to do so and go ahead to continue to waste your youth babysitting this useless guy of yours when you could find real happiness with someone who knows how to treat you well.</p>
              <p>You only live once, so don't allow him to be a greater mistake in your life and only realised it after you had his children.</p>
              <p>Guys who doesn't knows how to appreciate Girls for who they are, truly does not deserves to be together and enjoys the love offered by the Girls.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I must warn you, alot of like-minded childish guys in here would prefer to see you ENSLAVED at the hands of your childish guy than help you find your own happiness sincerely.</p>

              <p>OP- It depends on whether or not you are bf/gf or married, as your post doesnt specify. I think it's bf/gf, but not 100% sure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are bf/gf, then you can tell him once- what you're doing shows you are insecure socially, and you dont trust me. I really like you, but you're insecurity and neediness is killing us. If you keep nagging me, I'm going to break upwith you.</p>
              <p>Then show him a couple of websites explainging how his loser behaviour turns girls away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are married, then you cant quite threaten him with breaking up, but hopefully he's mildly mature and he'll listen to you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In both cases, since telling him face to face is not easy for many people to do, try handwriting it in a letter for him to find and read, so he has time to take in the message, and there's time for the emotions of anger, rejection, hurt etc to go away.</p>

              <p>My advice to you is to, treat him as fellow person, with generic needs and expectations.</p>
              <p>Some things you may take the extreme (or in another case, taken for granted) if you had something in common for a long time... may happen to anybody even families.</p>
              <p>But for guys, some of us are mainly control freaks, what I suggest is to give him a set of rule:ultimatum with associated rewards:punishments on paper and practice and communicate that to him, STRICTLY.</p>
              <p>Make sure he knows you are a principled person, and hence that guy would have less "issues" if you gone "astray". Also possible to probe for the issue if he continues to be paronoid.</p>

              <p>My advice to you is to, treat him as fellow person, with generic needs and expectations.</p>
              <p>Some things you may take the extreme (or in another case, taken for granted) if you had something in common for a long time... may happen to anybody even families.</p>
              <p>But for guys, some of us are mainly control freaks, what I suggest is to give him a set of rule:ultimatum with associated rewards:punishments on paper and practice and communicate that to him, STRICTLY.</p>
              <p>Make sure he knows you are a principled person, and hence that guy would have less "issues" if you gone "astray". Also possible to probe for the issue if he continues to be paronoid.</p>

              <p>You'd be correct, and I already wrote I agree with using breaking up and a proper strategy to get him to change, except that I realised we only have one side of the story.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It might turn out that there's a love triangle with another guy involved, or perhaps she's cheated on him before, so he's a bit more careful now. And some girls flirt and flaunt quite openly, so maybe she thrusts her boobs at everyone and he's a bit uncertain where he stands.</p>

              <p>Lyris, I had an ex who is like your current boyfriend.</p>
              <p>This kind of guy is a "red flag ALERT". I would suggest you don't carry on with the marriage. There are TWO issues you need to be wary of.</p>
              <p>First, All these "paranoia" has nothing to do with his "insecurity".</p>
              <p>Rather a need to find fault with your past, so that he may believe that  he is "better than you". ---An inferiority complex.</p>
              <p>He needs you to be flawed. The present you may be "perfect" in his eyes, but you had an "im-perfect" past.</p>
              <p>A breakup will be more painful to him, than to you.</p>
              <p>If you marry him, in the future when you have arguments , he will blame it all on you and what you had done in your past.</p>
              <p>So, buyers beware.</p>
              <p>Second,  your whirlwind courtship, contributes to his need to <strong>judge </strong>your integrity based on your past... simply because there wasn't sufficient time to get to know you better during these few short months.</p>
              <p>I'd suggest, both of you spend the next 6 months or 1 more year really getting to know each other better. Leave the past (before this courtship) behind.</p>
              <p>Tell him that you need to get to know HIM better.Put the marriage plan on hold for now. Having a marriage plan ADDS pressure on him to probe more intensively , as he needs to figure out if you are indeed the right one for him, during this period prior to marriage.</p>
              <p>Observe, and see if he is still this way after spending the extended time together.</p>
              <p>If he is still nit picking your past flaws.. then it's truly time to let the relationship end.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi Lyris,</p>
              <p>You are thinking too much about the past. The most important thing is how he is treating you currently. The way that things are, your relationship will break down as soon as you are unable to tolerate his bullying anymore. </p>
              <p>Before that happens, you may wish to seek the help of a counsellor, and have him/her talk to your fiancé, though if things really didn't change, it will be for your own good that you leave him.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
