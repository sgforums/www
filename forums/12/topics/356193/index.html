              <p>hello all,</p>
              <p>I have just gone steady with a girl, it is my first relationship
              and all is going fine, we are happy together but there is a problem
              that has been bothering me for a few months,ever since I got to
              know her.</p>
              <p>let me state that I am a straight male and like ordinary people
              I experience lust, the problem I face is that I have almost no
              sexual feeling towards my girlfriend although she is reasonably
              attractive by my own standards. I am not sure what is wrong but I
              can rule out impotency since I still have a need to watch
              pornography .Also, I am only attracted to women and know for sure
              that I am not homosexual.</p>
              <p>This has not affected our relationship as she is against
              pre-marital sex but nonetheless I find this troubling for obvious
              reasons.</p>
              <p>I am wondering if this is a case of an overly suppressed oedipus
              complex whereby feelings of lust and love are not allowed to
              overlap.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sorry if this seems complicated...</p>
