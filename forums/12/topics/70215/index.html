Why she still want to keep hold of me?<br><br>Few questions<br><br>1. She seems do not want to lose me (either as a friend or someone special which only she knows) and yet cannot answer any questions to my invitation to ask her out!!??<br><br>2. She told me she had moved on with life but she still remain the same thru some questions I pose to her and her "indecisiveness" in answering them. Basically she cannot get over herself!<br><br>3. I feel that there is basically no way to win over her if she chooses to remain where she is now....living in her own world.<br><br>Really sian and well, I have open up myself to new options but at tge same time, i just want to keep trying my luck on her again.<br><br>hear from U again. yunhaier.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Yunhaier:<br><br>May I know the reasons on why she still wants me to keep in contact with me. She used to hint to me not to forget her (I do not know why she wants me to do so till now)but when asking to go further.....she keep mum.<br><br>In a normal situation(most cases), the 2 will not be in contact after a quarrel/breakup but she still expects me to do so????<br><br>During the argument, I did told her "For the past 6 months, did U have spare a thought for my feelings?" ...she also keep mum.<br><br>When I asked her "will u commit yourself to a R/S, she told me YES but when I congratulate her, she also keep mum??<br><br>The strange part is the answer to that question "When can U come out (given a time frame to her)?"...It seems that this question holds the ANSWER to the WHOLE STORY what she is thinking.<br><br>I shall make my own assumption and please comment to my answer<br><br>1. If she say YES, she knew of my intention and she knew she is NOT READY to commit to any R/S till this moment of time.<br><br>2. If she say NO, she feels I will leave her which she DOES NOT want to see that to happen.<br><br>The BEST SOLUTION is to keep mum...keep me pending so that I can still be around? Am right to say that?<br><br>I also can say, she does have feeling for me but FEAR that I will hurt her again when she commits herself to me?<br><br>U mention to me that she is reading those sad roimance Novels to remind herself NOT TO FALL IN LOVE DUE TO HER SAD PAST...I feel that U are almost right after all..Any comments?<br><br>Hear from U so that I can chat with U more.....Thanks</div>

Why she still want to keep hold of me?<br><br>Few questions<br><br>1. She seems do not want to lose me (either as a friend or someone special which only she knows) and yet cannot answer any questions to my invitation to ask her out!!??<br><br>2. She told me she had moved on with life but she still remain the same thru some questions I pose to her and her "indecisiveness" in answering them. Basically she cannot get over herself!<br><br>3. I feel that there is basically no way to win over her if she chooses to remain where she is now....living in her own world.<br><br>Really sian and well, I have open up myself to new options but at tge same time, i just want to keep trying my luck on her again.<br><br>hear from U again. yunhaier.</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Ok, a virgo - a woman whose love is stimulated through the use of mental energy. Mercury her ruling planet, tend to make much more rational usage than emotional ones. She is the kind woman where there are conflicts between the mind and heart because they show different directions. Her inability to answer your question is because of her inability to make a decision to follow which side of her soul.<br><br>To explain the whole chunk of astro-like rubbish above: She demonstrate an unique quality that I would like to bring explain in details. You mentioned that she had undergo a bad relationship crisis which direct reduce her faith and morale in love. She is unable to release herself from her rigid form of experience, yet when you appear, she is not willing to let you vanish because you seemed like an opportunity into the future.<br><br>Future will seemed dark until you venture and seek the source of light. She is unable to leave the shores, yet she hates her present situations. (If she has Saturn affliction Moon - she will feel that love is a form of suffering. Worst if it's in sign of Pisces. Mental and emotional state will constant receive this message: To love is to suffer)<br><br>I can't remember what possible solution I had posted the previous time - I can only say this: if one method don't work, try something else. It seemed to me that you have always been employing pressuring-making-her-LL way of communication when it comes to her. You had already knew what's her problem - keep 'testing' or even asking question that you know she cannot answer will bring you nowhere. <strong>In fact, she will sink deeper into her emotional haven and you will never get the answer/result you desire</strong>. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Do this: Do what she wants <span style="text-decoration: underline;">minus</span> those questioning. If she wants to be friends, then remain as one. Mentally, always presume that you both are friends irregardless of what may happen in the future UNLESS she confess to you about her liking and probably you may like to post it here or PM me. How she wants to define your relationship with you, how she sees love, etc - don't matter here. By being with her like a normal/good friend - you will gradually shape, influence and change her thinking.<br><br>You don't even have to directly mentioned anything.<br><br>Tension will brew if her liking for you is there.<br><br>Of course, during these period, you are free to date other ladies as well. No promise, no liability, no relationship, no nothing. BTW: You don't have to tell her that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

It's a whole package and everything has to be considered - which I cannot explain in mere words.<br><br>Do not make it seemed as if you are trying to change her, <strong>she will resist your attempt</strong>. Go with the flow, influence and induce. Drop the I-know-your-past-and-I-am-here-to-tell-you-the-right-thing attitude towards her. You see, since you know her situations much better than other people, you should learn to work around it instead of lamenting that she should move on. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>We all know that we have to move on from our failures in love. There would be 3 possibilities: The one that stayed back, the one that take break every now and then, and the one that moved on. But the tactics we employ is much more critical than simple words.<br><br>P.S: If previous method don't work, try something else. To tame the stubborn woman, you have to earn her respect and to do it is <strong>not </strong>to challenge her to make her see reality. This form of reality will gradually by shown from you and whether she is willingly to give it a shot - its really up to her. The more you push, the more she go against your force. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

In the woman's preception, she will be sinking in this message "urgh, man don't understand woman at all.' But in fact, understanding doesn't mean you have to do anything and understand doesn't mean that you have to resort to 'usual logical' way of handling it. (What I mean by logical is via your common sense. When you got a burn, common sense will tell you to dip your finger into cold water for a moment, before wrapping it, or leaving it as it is.
