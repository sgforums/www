Mercury her ruling planet, tend to make much more rational usage than emotional ones. She is the kind woman where there are conflicts between the mind and heart because they show different directions. Her inability to answer your question is because of her inability to make a decision to follow which side of her soul.<br><br>To explain the whole chunk of astro-like rubbish above: She demonstrate an unique quality that I would like to bring explain in details. You mentioned that she had undergo a bad relationship crisis which direct reduce her faith and morale in love. She is unable to release herself from her rigid form of experience, yet when you appear, she is not willing to let you vanish because you seemed like an opportunity into the future.<br><br>Future will seemed dark until you venture and seek the source of light. She is unable to leave the shores, yet she hates her present situations. (If she has Saturn affliction Moon - she will feel that love is a form of suffering. Worst if it's in sign of Pisces. Mental and emotional state will constant receive this message: To love is to suffer)<br><br>I can't remember what possible solution I had posted the previous time - I can only say this: if one method don't work, try something else. It seemed to me that you have always been employing pressuring-making-her-LL way of communication when it comes to her. You had already knew what's her problem - keep 'testing' or even asking question that you know she cannot answer will bring you nowhere. [b]In fact, she will sink deeper into her emotional haven and you will never get the answer/result you desire</strong>. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Do this: Do what she wants <span style="text-decoration: underline;">minus</span> those questioning. If she wants to be friends, then remain as one. Mentally, always presume that you both are friends irregardless of what may happen in the future UNLESS she confess to you about her liking and probably you may like to post it here or PM me. How she wants to define your relationship with you, how she sees love, etc - don't matter here. By being with her like a normal/good friend - you will gradually shape, influence and change her thinking.<br><br>You don't even have to directly mentioned anything.<br><br>Tension will brew if her liking for you is there.<br><br>Of course, during these period, you are free to date other ladies as well. No promise, no liability, no relationship, no nothing.

Currently, it is she who does not have the faith in me (I understand all these) and I alone also cannot do much. Life is unpredictable and no one can predict the future and if I were to go into a relationship, I am also taking the risks of a breakup etc.. it hurts but this is part and parcel of life that everyone had to go thru. If she is to stay at her "comfort zone"..she is getting to NOWHERE and escaping from reality which I will not give myself a chance if the potential ones come by.<br><br>Yes, I am opening up myself to more openings <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Yunhaier's comments:<br>I always like to say this: Words are simply words. Even if she can't answer you - it's mere conflict with mind, heart and soul. What she want to say is restricted by promise/committment phobia - so therefore its natural for her to behave this way.<br><br>I started to remember that I did mention to her before that I need to go back for my reservist (Provided Yunhaier and the rest are local Singaporeans who understand this term) and she sounds anxious. the same goes to I had plan to further my studies and she quickly asked "Are U leaving Singapore"?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Leaving seems to be the word she HATES and well, I am the main Actor in this drama. My close lady friend did mention that "This gal is a bit selfish as she wanted to keep U by her side and yet do not want to commit". I told my close lady friend that "Well, she is in a dilemma and it is so clearly seen that NO MATTER WHAT HAPPEN, she still wish I am around in her life.<br><br>Thru this association with her, I really seen/experience the sadness of someone who can't make decisions for herself. It is definitely a lesson learnt for me.</div>

Currently, it is she who does not have the faith in me (I understand all these) and I alone also cannot do much. Life is unpredictable and no one can predict the future and if I were to go into a relationship, I am also taking the risks of a breakup etc.. it hurts but this is part and parcel of life that everyone had to go thru. If she is to stay at her "comfort zone"..she is getting to NOWHERE and escaping from reality which I will not give myself a chance if the potential ones come by.<br><br>Yes, I am opening up myself to more openings <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Yunhaier's comments:<br>I always like to say this: Words are simply words. Even if she can't answer you - it's mere conflict with mind, heart and soul. What she want to say is restricted by promise/committment phobia - so therefore its natural for her to behave this way.<br><br>I started to remember that I did mention to her before that I need to go back for my reservist (Provided Yunhaier and the rest are local Singaporeans who understand this term) and she sounds anxious. the same goes to I had plan to further my studies and she quickly asked "Are U leaving Singapore"?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Leaving seems to be the word she HATES and well, I am the main Actor in this drama. My close lady friend did mention that "This gal is a bit selfish as she wanted to keep U by her side and yet do not want to commit". I told my close lady friend that "Well, she is in a dilemma and it is so clearly seen that NO MATTER WHAT HAPPEN, she still wish I am around in her life.<br><br>Thru this association with her, I really seen/experience the sadness of someone who can't make decisions for herself. It is definitely a lesson learnt for me.</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You have a good analysis of your own situations and even if it doesn't work - good work because you gain insights about some issues in love.<br><br>I am sure you know what to do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Yes, I can still keep in touch with her but at the same time I am looking out for potential mates for myself (must be fair to myself) currently.<br><br>As for her case, some suggested that she had already given up in life and is just cheating herself (her heart) that she had get over the past etc... Well, I can only do that much (I had done so) and it is up to her to decide.

            <div class='col-md body'>Even though people often say gals and guys r different but the fact is many tinks guys and gals tink alike. Try putting yourself in her shoes, maybe you can understand her better. Imagine if you had also once be hurt by countless of girls, you will have the fear in you too, when it comes to committment or involving in a new relationship. I believe the same goes for her, Of course, another alternative will be hurting other innocent people who come into their life for the hurt they once suffered. People live because of motivation and because of love. With your repetition of questions only adds pressure to her. I believe you do not like to be pressed for an ans too. This is just going to trigger the anger or perhaps the hatred she had in her.<br><br>1) Her expectance of wanting to stay but afraid to be with you<br>her past relationship was prob first sweet followed by tears so she worried in your case, history will repeat itself. however, part of her stills hopes for a miracle to happen but afraid to try or believe.<br><br>Actually anyone with a bad encounter can change their lives totally for the future. What she might had suffered through might not be what you or anyone esle can understand the pain she had been through esp if she had once been physically hurt by guys, there is already a breech of trust . And trust, even for other people takes a very long time to build it back and for some people, this might not even be the case even they ascend to heaven.<br><br>She is prob engaging in her world, too afraid to step out for fear of being hurt but she hopes for love, concern and understanding in her own way.<br><br>By pushing her, you already show the lack of concern(maybe to her point ). try it doing her way. Even though it might require alot of patience to all the tantrums she might throw but if you are determined to change her, you have to use the soft way perhaps? She will slowly grow to change her concept.<br><br>I used to be like her, even till today. I am still afraid. Cause the hurt is too much to bear. My bf could repeat the questions I don know how to put in words again and again and it drives me crazy. words can be misleading and lead to a misunderstanding. Trying to explain may detoriate the situation. So i rather keep quiet. When he nice, I suspect he is entertainig me... Well, when you are too hurt.. any imaginations might surface w/o ur knowledge. But I still feel warmth even i verbally denies when he gives me love and concern and understading and metally support. Its alot of hard work on his part. and that sometimes triggers his temper I cant really take.<br><br>If she is really hurt give her some time, don push it too hard because even if she nods her head to be with you you might end up slashing each other throats because she hasnt move on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Angles, Yunhaier and all who responded to me without fail:<br><br>Yes, Thanks for your reply. I understand her problems and the problem is she DENY. She told me she had already moved on....If she does, must she wait till today??? (loophole again). Her friends had introduced her to many guys before me but all she cannot accept and the only reason she can give is: the 2 CANNOT Click...it is a LAME excuse...The TRUTH is she can't forget her EXs, the hurt from the Bad Relationships with guys...and the problems she had with her family...Why can't human Beings faced reality?? Why choose to escape from the real problems and keep bluffing others??<br><br>She told me although she keeps saying/mentioning negative views about guys but SHE DOES NOT MEAN IT...All of U believe this statement? I won't believe it even if I was beaten to death as the loopholes lie on she even tell all these statements to her close lady friends and by the way she is very close to those friends as she trusted them more than her own family members!!! How pathetic.<br><br>She used to tell me the 2 of us (me) can click but during the last argument, she told me can click does not mean can accept me and when I probe further...she cannot answer me and insists I keep in contact with her. My close friend told me to ignore THIS Request and move on so that I can get over and recover. She basically does not know what she wants after 6 months..... I understand she still have no confidence in me and scare I DISAPPOINT her again and chose to remain on the safe side (As what Yunhaier had mentioned) so that she will not be hurt but indirect she is getting to NOWHERE. This is the PRICE to pay<br><br>My close friends indirectly hinting me that I am WASTING MY TIME..she is not worthy of my time and why spend efforts on a person who had already given up in the 1st place?<br><br>My friend's email to me:<br><br>Don't you know that life itself is dramatic. Lots of people goes round<br>denying their true feelings. Thought that they are protecting the other party but in fact only hurting each other more. If your lady friend is forthcoming, you wouldn't have all this problems now right would you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If you don't mind me saying, do not try to use your concept and ideas and think that it will work for her. Different people have different circumstances. She might think that by not answering you, she is doing the right thing. She is of a mature age, she should know what is good for her and what is not. I know you think that is a<br>waste that this relationship doesn't bloossm. But don't you think that even if she accept you, there will be constant comparison between you and her ex (by her). I'm sure you will not stand it. Haven't we come to a conclusion that she just wouldn't move on. Pity...... only if she could let go......<br><br>Like you say, time will heal, I mean you... not her, she seems to dwell to much into the past. You tried but fail to move her. Look from the other point of view, you and her are not meant to be......I know some things are easily said than done, but i'm sure you can prove to her that you can move on.And maybe by than she would be able to realised that she can move on too.<br><br>Well, I had done my best and each time whenever the result is not in my favour, I will be very sad..........Sian. This incident had taught me a lesson - A lady's heart is very complicated..very difficult to understand.<br><br>Any comment?</div>

I know u are not a lady and so I reply this message.<br>The email that U read is from my LADY friend who helped me to analyse the situation.<br><br>If U think moving on in her theory means forget about the bad past, then U are wrong. Do U think she had forgotten the bad past?<br><br>1. she read those romantic sad novels to remind her that those ladies in the olden days suffered a lot...she is reminding herself of her sad past and NOT TO GET INTO A RELATIONSHIP again!!!!<br>Yunhaier analysed it for me and after I associated with her, I discovered that what Yunhaier that told me thru this forum is rather applicable. I told a story(true one) about a guy cheated a gal and before I could finish it, she quickly said "It is all guy's fault"!!!<br><br>She is VERY NEGATIVE about guys and this secrets she had successfully hidden away from many people until she met me and I some sort of knowing some clues about it after associating with her.<br><br>Few Questions/statements to ask U/let U know:<br><br>1. She told me personally" If a relationship goes wroong, it is all guy's fault"!!!!<br><br>2. She told me "Guy's promises cannot be trusted"!!!!<br><br>Do U think if a gal keep saying all these negative remarks, she is READY for any R/S?<br><br>Do U know she did mention to me her EX will do this ...do that for her etc etc.............?<br><br>The TRUTH is her memory about her past (I do not know how long from 2004) is still as fresh as today....<br><br>A person who is pledge with this mentality is NOT READY for anything.<br><br>My LADY friend who wrote the email tells me that she "might" compared U and her EX if the 2 really get togther which she feel is very unfair to me..........Put yourself into my shoes and think" How would I feel"?<br><br>She had some problems with her Dad at home which I don't want to mention her...... it is all becuase of a woman. (Clue liao)<br><br>She told me she had a regular beautician who is a lady and she told me she DON'T WANT TO BE TOUCH BY GUYS!!!!! How jia lak...<br><br>LOOK HOW SHE SHUNT HERSELF FROM GUYS......LOOPHOLES AND PROOF AS WELL.... No way to deny<br><br>Giving herself here means "No longer interested in a R/S".<br>Yes, she is very close with her lady friend which I know.<br><br>Like what U say: "keep me by her side" is that she can't find someone better......... How would I feel?<br><br>She is few years my senior and till today she still can't think??<br><br>To summarise all these:<br><br>1. She had very negative views about guys and given by this fact, Do U think her heart is ready?<br><br>2. Her bad past had already get the better of herself that she is now living in her own world becuase of that<br><br>3. Her negative views about HOME has already made her feel that there is NO WARMNESS at all in HOME.<br><br>My lady cousin mentioned that since she is from a HOME where there is no warmness, do U think she DARE TO build her own family in future?--don't forget her lack of confidence in guys --- A Good Point.<br><br>That's All I can say as the majority of my friends and cousin say it is not worth as she is basically finished in this life.<br><br>The only question is:<br><br>If I met my right one and say a few months down the road, "out of a sudden" she comes back to me... WHAT SHALL I DO?<br><br>My answer is it is no longer possible as I already met my right one and I do not wish to take the RISK to accept her if out of a sudden she regrets, I ended up with NOTHING. I do not wish that to happen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>erm... really don't understand. Anyway I belong to the female species. Lady?perhaps.. my age should me ard thr.<br><br>Well, negativity towards guys does not mean she is has not move on or for whatsoever reasons. I known people who had fallen get into relationships stayed but if you asked them something abt guys(sth bad) their reaction will be same like hers.<br><br>Bus, some tinks are harder to understand when we are being third parties but do what you tink is best for yourself.<br>If she has been hurt so badly by guys and have such negative attitude towards them shows that she cant b the one initiating breakups. How can one be upset if they are the one who initiater the breakup? Maybe a little for some but that pass fast. So if someday she be with you, she will unlikely be the one who wants a breakup unless she those vengence kind who takes it out on other guys for the misdeeds she suffer.<br><br>you see, family education is impt, her father isnt showing her a gd example of gd guys plus her personal experiences, negative remarks aint surprising. Imagine if you had a mum like tt, wat wld u tink of lady? same tink isnt it?<br><br>if she is a person who had problem forgetting her past than why does she has so many past relationship? She will just have one, failed, dwell in it and refused to move on. Swear that she never want another boyfriend.<br><br>Third party can only give advice base on what we hear. We didnt experience wat u had been thru with her and words often can be misleading. People when complaining tends to pamper themselve more so when there is anger and frustration in u, u will see tinks diff, sometinks others might felt tt it is ok.<br><br>like you nv been thru wat she had been thru, so u won truly understand and feels y she is reacting in such negative manner.<br><br>Anyway, just do what u tink is best for urself.<br>If not, just  tell her straight in the face that all her actions are making you pretty annoyed.Sort tinks out with her if you could. Tell her its her final chance. You cant do that to her forever. See wat she has to say. If she still keep quiet or watsoever. Than just focused to do ur own tinks and let nature take its own course before you turn mad trying to change her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, from what I know. She had 2 relationships and the last one she "claimed" the guy cheated on her by having another gal outside?

(To put things simple)<br><br>Well, whether she can recover or not is up to her as we can't help that much.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by bus:</div><div class="quote_body">To Angles, Yunhaier and all who responded to me without fail:<br><br>Yes, Thanks for your reply. I understand her problems and the problem is she DENY. She told me she had already moved on....If she does, must she wait till today??? (loophole again). Her friends had introduced her to many guys before me but all she cannot accept and the only reason she can give is: the 2 CANNOT Click...it is a LAME excuse...The TRUTH is she can't forget her EXs, the hurt from the Bad Relationships with guys...and the problems she had with her family...Why can't human Beings faced reality?? Why choose to escape from the real problems and keep bluffing others??<br><br>She told me although she keeps saying/mentioning negative views about guys but SHE DOES NOT MEAN IT...All of U believe this statement? I won't believe it even if I was beaten to death as the loopholes lie on she even tell all these statements to her close lady friends and by the way she is very close to those friends as she trusted them more than her own family members!!! How pathetic.<br><br>She used to tell me the 2 of us (me) can click but during the last argument, she told me can click does not mean can accept me and when I probe further...she cannot answer me and insists I keep in contact with her. My close friend told me to ignore THIS Request and move on so that I can get over and recover. She basically does not know what she wants after 6 months..... I understand she still have no confidence in me and scare I DISAPPOINT her again and chose to remain on the safe side (As what Yunhaier had mentioned) so that she will not be hurt but indirect she is getting to NOWHERE. This is the PRICE to pay<br><br>My close friends indirectly hinting me that I am WASTING MY TIME..she is not worthy of my time and why spend efforts on a person who had already given up in the 1st place?<br><br>My friend's email to me:<br><br>Don't you know that life itself is dramatic. Lots of people goes round<br>denying their true feelings. Thought that they are protecting the other party but in fact only hurting each other more. If your lady friend is forthcoming, you wouldn't have all this problems now right would you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If you don't mind me saying, do not try to use your concept and ideas and think that it will work for her. Different people have different circumstances. She might think that by not answering you, she is doing the right thing. She is of a mature age, she should know what is good for her and what is not. I know you think that is a<br>waste that this relationship doesn't bloossm. But don't you think that even if she accept you, there will be constant comparison between you and her ex (by her). I'm sure you will not stand it. Haven't we come to a conclusion that she just wouldn't move on. Pity...... only if she could let go......<br><br>Like you say, time will heal, I mean you... not her, she seems to dwell to much into the past. You tried but fail to move her. Look from the other point of view, you and her are not meant to be......I know some things are easily said than done, but i'm sure you can prove to her that you can move on.And maybe by than she would be able to realised that she can move on too.<br><br>Well, I had done my best and each time whenever the result is not in my favour, I will be very sad..........Sian. This incident had taught me a lesson - A lady's heart is very complicated..very difficult to understand.<br><br>Any comment?</div></blockquote>Hi Bus,<br>You know wat, u sound like a freaking big contradiction to me...For one you are not a freaking prosecutor trying to find loopholes in her arguments. The last thing  she needs now is to have someone tell her she is in denial etc...So wat if u catch her contradicting herself? That makes u feel freaking good about yourself knowing that the reason the relationship is not working out is purely her fault??<br><br>The reason why u are complaining so much is because u too cannot move on...You yearn to be with her but yet she is non-committal....You too are ironic dun u think....you said u are opening up to the possibilities of other relationships, wat not crap etc...but is this true? If this is true, you would be following up on this thread endlessly.<br><br>Your words to her can hurt..the way u are pushing her just tells me how rite she is to be non-committal towards u...u deserve to undergo more "tests"...</div>
