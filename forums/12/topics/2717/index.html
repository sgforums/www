I can't bear the thought of someone else in her heart. But it seems most guys always feel their first love is the best.<br>Sometimes I think of my ex. It's not because I miss him, but becoz the hurt from it is too much.<br><br>------------------<br>**I want u to be with me.....<br>be with me in the morning...be with me in the nite...with me when its dark out...with me when its light...<br>I want u to be with me...no matter what we do...just keep this reminder...of how much I love u...**</div>

As long u don try to patch up with ur ex and take gd care of ur gf now, i think nothing will happen , y not try telling ur current gf this see wat she thing (provided ur gf is an understnading one)<br><br></div>
