As much as your project requires his commitment, I agree with him that he would need his own life too.. If he's really dating, I don't see why that shouldn't be part of his commitments?<br><br>Seems like you're still having some communication breakdown with him in certain sorts? Perhaps you should re-read some of what I've previously posted to you?<br><br>By the way, am I becoming a mountain-tortise here...?

            <div class='col-md body'>opps sorry long time no update.<br><br>yup like last week i think, we ok liao. i think last tues or wed. we quarrelled v badly. then we said out our unhappiness. then we resolved it...well for 1 week at least. well, i dont rmb what he did during this period of time. it was like after quarreling we had pretty much resolved our conflicts. asked him go check the GV tix price since weeks ago still not done. so reminded him. over the weekend we did our parts. i did the poster and feedback form, he did the flyers and supposed to do excel database.<br><br>mon morning ask him whether he checked the price liao, he still said no.<br>mon night he said he got report to rush, ask me do his part of the project. i said ok lor i trust him, he go do his other project report, i do his part for him.<br><br>then after that we compiled...well i did la. then nothing much happened until like tues when our boss came down to campus.  i just rmb. he said he will do this excel database over the weekends, and guess what happened! he told me after class, simon you do the excel database show boss tmr.<br><br>ask him settle the looseends, he go meet gf. 2pm gf go class liao then come find me, ask me dota with him. Zzz so ok lor dota lor cannot always talk work must foster friendship first. but that time we still got parts not done yet.<br>3pm meet boss, talk liao ok lor we went home. seems like the bosses think v highly of him because his parents own a family business. seems like money talks in this real world. i always wonder what he will be without his parents' money. i admit i just pure jealous haha. but i do know that he is pretty much a NATO person in this project. haha then best part!<br><br>tues i fell sick, so i didnt talk much to him online. wed i went school sick and all.<br><br>wed :he wanted to go dota i dont want saying i too sick to go out. so i came home straight after lesson. but i did told him to go book the booths from the Estate people. he no reply. i sent in an email to our boss after showing our tutor. he say what got 6 things left to do, split half , each do 3. but he no inform me of any work. how nice...<br><br>thurs: today i woke up, i got a "this idea is suicidal! we cant use it!" reply from my boss. ok lor. i got the msg. she also want us to send her the poster designs so that she can print them out. partner in class, so i ask him for approval. he said aiya no need approve 1 la. you just send. but i needed some details like whose phone number to use for the quiz and venue of roadshow. he told me , not booked yet. and the phone number, use the company de, why i no listen in meeting. waa read liao super angry. i respect him thats why i ask him, and also because i forgot, and he give me this kinda reply. but i told myself, no matter what i cannot angry. so i no reply him. in life sh|t happens, he is one. now boss just sms him saying the posters are ready for collection tmr.  it is high time he start doing something besides taking minutes. so far this fellow only talk, take minutes and use taiji throw all the work to me. i have been doing most of the work lately, and i dont want to be exploited. lol. lets see what have i done.<br><br>been to more than 5 meetings with tutor and boss<br>done all the emails<br>came up with most of the ideas , while he refined and improved some.<br>met the logistics people and estate people.<br>doing a lot of his part<br>i cant rmb liao. this is more or less like my log. he needs to be chased to do work sia. monday need put up flyers and he still no go approach the estate mgt for approval. ask him book like will kill him. is not i dont want book, but i want let him experience what i went thru. i told him i under a lot of pressure by being the contact person, he went like<br>O haha you dont know how to handle the pressure la. if me i will not be so easily pressurized.<br>then i told him why not you do it?<br>he said, because they(boss,tutor, estate mgt) no email to him, then he cant prove his calibre.<br><br>but when ask him go do it, he hem haw and use taiji. Zzz<br><br>i thought we had settled our differences, but it seems not. i tried my best, thats why i did his part without questioning him. and now like this... cant take it man.<br><br>like i mentioned tmr will have to go meet boss at Yio chu kang to get the posters at 2pm. he will skip morning lectures, then come to 3pm class. i want ask him to go take since he stay woodlands which is closer and since i will be at school, it will not be convenient for me to travel down to YCK then back to school. but how should i go about doing it?<br><br>i intend to ask him, you free tmr? coming lecture? to which he should reply, Nope. then i will say since you not coming down, then can you go meet boss tmr? she 2pm at yck want us collect posters.<br><br>then he should reply, why me? why not you?<br><br>my reply will be because i am in school and i attending all the FP lectures.<br><br>after which i lazy go predict. but i dont think he will go Zzz. also the reason why i want him go estate ytd or today is because they got a form for our company to sign, and to do so need to go YCK. i hope he has gotten the form or else headache...<br><br></div>

From how you get your work distributed and done, to how you handle, interact or manages people...<br><br>Remember he's like 50% of your human resources. How much of that 50% you can utilise would depends on how you plan and work on it.<br><br>I can understand that you're probably under quite alot of stress and pressure, but trust me that 'stress' and 'pressure' is also a good form of experience. Also, if you think you've chosen a wrong person then learn from your mistake? I've seen and heard lots of people kpkb about project partners, but the bottomline is if you can't afford to change partner(s) for better options... Then what's the point of kpkb? Rather spend more time trying to thrash things out with your current partner(s) and in handling your work than kpkb right? Just try not to make the same mistake again... Then again, as you gain more experience with larger projects involving more people.. You'll realise in no time that nobody's really quite 'perfect', and it's really rare that you can get someone you can probably utilise FULLY and EASILY. If such a person exist, he / she would have probably been grabbed already... Rather then kpkb over and over again, try to find a more permenant solution to things? i.e. Management.<br><br>If I am you, I would probably be keeping a work log or something? Just 2 columns maybe? 'Work to be done' and 'comments'? But be objective in your comments section... Don't put it like your 'complaint book'... When 'problem' is massive and repetitive, people going through it would soon have the idea... But of course, you might have other 'smoother' ways of handling things? Maybe then you could just go ahead?<br><br>During my main final year project back in poly, I had 2 partners. Things were REALLY BAD when it 1st started off but as we tried to utilise the opportunity not only on 'work' alone and also as opportunity to get to know each other better as friends and individuals... Things just got better. In the end, we didn't get really fantastic marks... But we've completed our project with LOTS of helping each other and gained 2 friends at the end of it... So you go do the Maths?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
