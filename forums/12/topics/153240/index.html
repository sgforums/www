We can help abit by donating some coin on flag day, but if you gotta be sad everyday because of all the sad things around is really very tired man. That how life works.<br><br>If you gotta wake up everyday and think so sad man hai.. people around you wont dare to talk to you, because of all the gloominess on your face man. Try to liven up and be more positive about life! Wake up everyday and tell yourself you choose to be happy today and walk around with a smile.
