            <div class='col-md body'>Be careful how you choose... with guys, things don't always seem the way they do on the surface...<br><br>Situation 1::It's your birthday...<br>Type A --&gt; He buys an expensive gift which you've always wanted. <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">-He's rich and you're just one of the many 'material girls' that he has.  Dude's just trying to get into your pants</span></strong><br>/Type B --&gt; He bakes a cake all by himself &amp; gave it to you. <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">-Henpecked or probably just made a mess a home which he'll get you to clean up, using his effort to bake the cake as an excuse.  Again, just trying to get into your pants</span></strong><br><br>Situation 2::You're crying cos' of some unhappy matters.<br>Type A --&gt; He offers you tissue papers &amp; tries to console you.<strong> <span style="font-style: italic;">-A normal guy who doesn't really know what to do and was probably really bad at consoling. And chances are he made you feel even worse </span></strong><br>Type B --&gt; He understands your problems, becomes very upset &amp; might even cry with you. <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">-Wuss.  He probably likes guys as much as you do.</span></strong><br><br>Situation 3::Cos' of some ridiculous matters, you were put into jail.<br>Type A --&gt; He bails you out. <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">- A rich dude who's not so smart. </span></strong><br>Type B --&gt; He joins you in jail. <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">-He doesn't have a choice, he was arrested trying to pick up a hooker at the red light district.  If he's in the same prison as you, he's not a he!</span></strong><br><br>Situation 4::You like a particular song very much.<br>Type A --&gt; He buys you that CD album.<strong> <span style="font-style: italic;">-He's rich but probably won't be soon, seeing how he spends money like it's water.  Probably not too smart either.  You can download it (legally) online, maybe even other songs you like too.  Get one of them printable CD's and make it all nice and stuff.</span></strong><br>Type B --&gt; He sings you that song. <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">-He's either very good at it or he's like all the bad American idol "auditionees" who has never actually hear themselves sing. If he's the former: He might be rich but he sure the hell is cheap.  If he's the latter:  He's just plain cheap.</span></strong><br><br>Situation 5::When you're busy with something at home &amp; thus unable to meet him,<br>Type A --&gt; He did not call/sms you cos' he's afraid of disturbing you. <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">-He's just out with the boys or some girl and could care less about you.</span></strong><br>Type B --&gt; He will call/sms you to find out how's your work going on. <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">-He's checking up on you, making sure that you're actually busy doing something and not some guy.  Or just making sure your whereabouts so he doesn't run into you while he's out on a date.  </span></strong><br><br>Situation 6::When you're feeling hungry at home &amp; you tell him about it,<br>Type A --&gt; He told you to cook some instant noodles or eat some bread first, then bring you out later for dinner. <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">-He's out on a date and wants to make sure you don't bump into him.</span></strong><br>Type B --&gt; He rushed to buy a packet of chicken rice to your house, but both of you stay rather far, so it's gonna take a long time &amp; you might probably die of hunger. <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">--He's out on a date and wants to make sure you don't bump into him.  He'll also show up way late and have bought something else and he'll use the long distance as an excuse so he's get more time with his date.</span></strong><br><br>Situation 7::You told him that you're unable to sleep,<br>Type A --&gt; He asked you to try counting sheep or read a book until you feel sleepy, &amp; will gradually sleep (it works). <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">-Logical or he just wants to get you off the phone so he can get to humping some girl.</span></strong><br>Type B --&gt; He calls you &amp; both of you chatted throughout the night. <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">-He's done humping the girl and can't sleep himself. </span></strong><br><br>So how would you choose now?</div>

The party and people?  A last minute job.  He had the party not knowing that you would be coming over and just saw you walking in.  To cover his tracks, he turned it into a 'surprise party'.  You'll realise later that none of the people are actually your friends and the girl to guy ratio is 3:1. </span></strong><br><br>Situation 2::You're crying cos' of some unhappy matters.<br>Type c --&gt; he accompany you, lend you his shoulder and eventually kiss you, making it an unforgetable night. <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">just trying to get into your pants</span></strong><br><br>Situation 3::Cos' of some ridiculous matters, you were put into jail.<br>Type c --&gt; He get the queen counsel from europe and sue the police force. <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">The Queen Counsel, is actually a group of stripper whores from Europe and Sue is from the 'Police Force' who's famous for her handcuffs.
