This lingering feeling and emotion wrapped your heart partially and regardless of whoever is to come, you will always have this soft spot for your ex. Look - it has already been years and yet you are still feeding on past memories.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Why did you both break in the first place since you did loved her so much? I am sure she didn't did things that foul the relationship badly like two-timing, etc - thats why you still held her deep within your heart, however think! - It has been years since the both of you went on separate ways - what makes you think she is the same Helen last time? Time change people change money talk... her feelings for you might not be = to yours to hers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Advice?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I feel that people should all move forward instead of walking to and fro - you don't advance in this way. In the first place, if both really treasure the relation - breaking wouldn't have occur. The fact that it did is because conflicts that deemed and 'seemed' unsolvable and breaking off seemed to be the only option left. (For some rare case, maybe its better, but its only that 8%).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Eve and you belongs to two different world? That is a tricky part because people tend to stick with one another with similiar characteristic, etc. Unless God gave you a chance to speak with her, etc and she find you interesting and *WANTS* to know you better - you stand a better chance. If not - it would be rather difficult.<br><br>Phrase of the day: You never try, you never know - the only <strong>regrets </strong>in life is the things you never attempt to try.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
