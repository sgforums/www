            <div class='col-md body'>When I see your thread title and before reading this, my mind was like saying "there goes without saying!"<br><br>Of course Love still exist after marriage. It all depends on both parties. I really dislike how people view Love, or even marriage these days. Why should one follow the "trend" whereby everybody would give excuses like "oh, so now there's high divorce rate, I don't think a relationship can last!" or "oh, what? stay committed? How could I? No one is sure of the future, why should I be so dumb!", and etc. It's rather dumb. I mean, if EVERYONE in this world are to think of that, won't you feel it's such a waste that people would start to treat relationships lightly?<br><br>Anyway, in my opinion, I would say that a marriage can last long not because of the "responsibilities" but in fact the Love and Bond that both has..After marriage, both couple can still do the lovey-dovey stuffs and still be in the "honeymoon" stage.<br><br>However, of course, this does not apply to situation whereby both doesn't really love one another initially but are forced to get married,etc...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It depends on both's personality and situation that they were in.<br><br>Generally there are two kinds of love: Conditional love and unconditional love.<br>Pure love is similar to the kind of love a mother feels for her child. When the child is young, the mother is happy to care for all its needs, even though the child cannot give much in return. On the other hand, if we love people as long as they are nice to us but stop loving them when we no longer get what we want, the love is no pure but mixed with attachment and selfishness. This is called "conditional love" becos it involves demands and expectations.<br><br>The love that i saw in my parents are unconditional love. Even though both are not perfect people but they get along without much argument, care for the family, for one another. I think it takes tremendous amount of love for a couple to stay together for long. As we all know, living together with another human being can cause much fiction and arise of conflict of interest.<br><br>Just don't let hatred, grudges and ego blinded you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>love still exist after marriage. but i guess couples tend to lose the friendship they once had before they got married.<br><br>what attracted both of them to each other in e first place? and what got them to decide to be married to each other? it's love, isnt it? i think most of them tend to forget the wonderful memories they once shared.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course love still exist after <strong>marrying</strong> or settling down not after marriage. If after marriage means divorce liao <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>What married couples go through especially like what my wife and I are going through is call 'ember' love that means it's still burning hot but slow and steady like the ember. You do not see the actual fire going on but it's there and it's intensely hot and it's hard to put out even when douse with water. Picture a forest was on fire and even after a heavy downpour the chances of the forest start to burn up again is great. Why? Because of the embers simmering hot below.<br><br>Now for youngsters or couples that are in the middle of a courtship, the love they experience are known as 'raging' love or 'lie huo' in chinese. Their kind of love is like the physical fire, burning and burning away, igniting anything or everything in their way BUT if they aren't careful their fire will be easily put out. A simple thick 'blanket' can do that because their love cannot withstand the trials and errors.<br><br>Actually love is one part of the marriage package. Love comes with understanding and accomodating to one another too.<br><br>Ok, that about sums it up and I hope it answered your query <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sure does, love do exist after marriage, and infact some even become stronger.<br><br>I use to see, both locally and overseas,  old/mature caucasian couples holding hands together, helping each other, and even kisses each. It really warmed me that love do exist till the end of time, they alway have my admiration and I am so envy of them. Hope that i can find a love partner and end my old age as lovely as them.</div>
