              <p>I was reading about nuclear warfare today and something freaked me out. The movie ''Threads''. I did not even watch that movie, but when I read it's plot on Wikipedia, it already freaked me out halfway through. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threads</p>
              <p>What if... a nuclear war happened right now, and things go out of hand... What if a bomb is randomly shot here into Singapore? That movie sounds so real with it's aftermaths and effects of a nuclear war.. people being operated on without anasthetics.. cities in ruins and dead bodies all over the place.... I feel so creeped by that movie and it's making me worry... The bleak storyline itself is already scary... :(  I'm so scared &gt;:&lt;</p>

              <p>I would advice you to learn to manage your emotions better. A 14 yr old kid doesn't face much stuff but as you grow older, you will be expose to more and more different situations which might be problematic for you if you can't change.</p>
              <p>NS especially might be an issue if you are easily emotional and mentally weak.</p>

              <p>Doesn't mean every single job is suitable for me and what i want to teach.</p>
              <p>There are thousands of tutors in Sg yet there are always jobs some people just don't want to take.</p>
              <p>Anyway, why the hell i want so many students to make me vomit blood for? I have enough to make me consider blood bank visits</p>

              <p>I was reading about nuclear warfare today and something freaked me out. The movie ''Threads''. I did not even watch that movie, but when I read it's plot on Wikipedia, it already freaked me out halfway through. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threads</p>
              <p>What if... a nuclear war happened right now, and things go out of hand... What if a bomb is randomly shot here into Singapore? That movie sounds so real with it's aftermaths and effects of a nuclear war.. people being operated on without anasthetics.. cities in ruins and dead bodies all over the place.... I feel so creeped by that movie and it's making me worry... The bleak storyline itself is already scary... :(  I'm so scared &gt;:&lt;</p>

              <p>Actually, you brought up a rather relevant and critical issue of our times, something some will face - fear of a presumed future.</p>
              <p>Many had watched the fantastic movie '2012', and some had came out of the cinemas chastened and downheartened, for they believed that this is what will happen come 2012, with the conspiracy theories floating around on the alternative medias. The vivid graphic displays of destructions were of great help to fire up such needless fears.</p>
              <p>And it was such fears that made the recent Climate Change talks go relatively smoothly saved for the questions of funding, for those images of destruction were fresh on the mind of millions who had watch the movie, a known international box office hit, even though there is no way climate change could cause the kind of simultaneous destructions only computerized special effects could create.</p>
              <p>The movie, along with mainstream media, influenced greatly the acceptance that climate change is a reality, which may be a good thing for we oughta to do some housekeeping on our own spaceship called Earth, as it hurtles deeper into the universe with our milky way galaxy, of which our planet and solar system had never been the centre of it.</p>
              <p>That you could visualised and frame a picture from textual words perceived by the author of a book alone proves that you have a vivid sense of imagination, and such imagination spooked you.</p>
              <p>It is a blessing, but if you do not know how to control or counter it, it may be your own doom, if you allow your imagination and beliefs to run unchecked. One way to counter it is NOT by disbelief, but by robustly challenging the assumptions of the books by logic and reason, based on science and established facts, critically analysing every aspect narrated by the author.</p>
              <p>Simple example:- if the author claims a nuclear missile destroyed New York, you must know how much damage an actual nuke can do, how big the city is, and how a person can simply 'detonate' a nuclear device, with the almost near impossibility for a tom dick or harry to even see such detonation device with the kind of highest security to be even near it.</p>
              <p>Should the worse happened, you will either be protected by reinforced shelters, survived to rebuild a better world, or be vapourised instantly if caught in the open unaware, without a worry about death, let alone your future.</p>
              <p>So, either you confront your fears or fears will consume you and be made use of by others.</p>
              <p>Take care.</p>
