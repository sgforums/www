I also believe it can happen. But impractical. Its very hard to find a true love. By the time you found your true love, you would have spent alot. But i dont think that money attracted girls are suitable for me. If i got a girlfriend who is materealistic, i would have become extremely poor, cause im a spendthrift myself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> And i might become arrogant if im rich. I prefer a simpler lifestyle, say have a family, a car and a home is sufficient for me in the future. I also have no interest in attracting girls using money, i just think its lusting. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> Btw any girls here who thinks " my BF must be filthy rich"? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

Money only makes them lust for you, not love you. What i believe is how you treat the girl and how you talk to her. Communications are always important.

I love techno songs actually as well as some cantonese songs. My sis said that if my girl asked me about some Jay's song, i wont be able to answer any of her question, and may piss her off.

You can still read a few on Jay Chow songs AND still listen to the techno and cantonese songs. Just more songs to your music library. That's all.<br><br>Cantonese songs eh? Know how to sing them?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>You can also opt to listen to Zhang Dong Liang song... but actually I sugges you listen to a variety of songs and see which music you are more "emotionally" attuned to. Not all pop or R&amp;B or other kinds of songs can get your mood going.<br><br>Take your time. There is no hurry. Though its good you ponder over what your sis said for she is following certain trend. In the near future she will tell you another thing and many other things.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I think i worry more abt yr young sis. She is those more of the 'follow the trend ' Type. What most people do commonly she will follow. If all her surrounding friend attached,I believe she will have the urge to get attach and get a r/s just for the sake of following the trend. She might be get cheated and u know..Lost ********... Please take care of her. Btw,u are absolutely ok and u r still very young. 16yrs old to get attached is still too early to me.If u want a good and more of stable r/s,20plus will be better.
