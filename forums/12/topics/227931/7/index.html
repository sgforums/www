This is what i think. After school, my fwens sometimes go BBalling right? I will follow them loh, but me wun be playing BBall, instead i will be playing wib BMX bikes, do a little stunt, that's all. I cant spend too much time on BBall, as it takes time to train well and time is what i lack this year(but i can still go into r/s....hehe), since im doing my Os this year. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  Cycling i can do it well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> MBX stunts (flatland as they call it) are equally cool as well, as well as dazzling. And also, people who do flatland are cool people. They dont lack girls' attention. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> I see alot of boys who are cycling fanatics yet they aren't short of girls attention.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Besides, BMX bikes and BBall go along well, as i sometimes do see BMX bikers alongside with BBallers.<br><br>So maybe i can intro myself to those girls after doing some cool stunts at the BBall court without having to play BBall. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

What gals want to see is pro stuffs. Like those ultra cool stunts. Otherwise girls will laugh at you saying u are a noob. Really....Or worse, they think you are just trying to show off. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> That's why i prefer cycling, which i have more confidence at. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Im extremely afraid of being embarrassed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> I got one female cousin which i rmbr what she say, "WAH!!! He pro sia" . At BBall, they look at ur skills, not because you are just playing it. That's what i believe. Then some people(boys) got attitude prob. You thrash him already he give you a KPKB face and like want beat you. Then he like showoff his skills. This people are not to be trifled with. If you say "OI! Look what look??!!" I can assure you he will call his gang and beat you up. I would rather do flatland tricks by myself than to stir up trouble, as said by chinese term " Duo yi shi bu ru shao yi shi". It kinda piss me off when people stare at me with angriness and KPKB face when they are the ones who lose, and its a fair competition.<br><br>And FBI!
