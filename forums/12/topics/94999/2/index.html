If you let it continue to hinder you at every step, then it would be an even bigger mistake as one would be clinging onto the past and having endless nightmares. Acceptance doesn't mean condoning. It just means "oh I've erred" and the acknowledgement of making an error in judgement is more often more invaluable than lamenting oneself repeatedly for the mistake. One has to have the courage to forgive oneself for the mistakes but not in the sense that one forgives oneself easily after every one and just kicking it out of the system. Gotta remember that mistake one made and be able to say "I've made this mistake there and then because of this this and this and I'm truly sorry for doing that that and that but I've learnt from the mistake and never made it again"</div>

There must be something very "serious".<br><br>Well, you are super selfish, you just want to feel better. Well, she still be there, and (perhaps) her life are ruined. Even you are forgiven, and you forgive yourself, her scar in heart will be forever.<br><br>Why whould I write all this? Well, I have been hurt once, deeply. If something that make you can't "forgive" a person that you "trusted" most, you can imagine, what he has done.<br><br>You are just selfish.<br><br></div>

If "she" dont want to forgive u, pls lor...let it be. "she" is entitled to feel hurt (for some time) and you should responsible enough to leave her alone and brace urself up so u wont be a nuisance.<br><br>we dont wan to so called "redemm" ourselves just to make ourselves feel good. thats what i call the easy path. the hard thing to do is to move on....which i think u should. u will breathe easier.<br><br>i know of pals who cannot sleep and drink for years until someone they "betrayed" forgave them. so for years, they indulge in a falsehood of self-pity and subconciously evoke pity from others just so they would feel better.  to me (personal opinion) that is selfish.  being selfless is so honor ur words and heart and behave like a person. move on.<br><br>anyways....i am a fan of the yellow ribbon project. so i talk like this.<br><br></div>

Cos from the way you posted, it doesn't seems that you are really sorry for what you have done to her. In fact, it seems to me that you are merely seeking a way to make yourself feel better and forgive yourself. What you need is not her forgiveness but an excuse for yourself to get away from all the things that you have done to her.<br><br>You might find a temporary excuse to forgive yourself in this forum. But deep inside you will know that your conscience will keep coming back and haunt you whenever you feel alone and empty in your heart.<br><br>I would suggest you to go and seek her forgiveness. I do not know what wrong you have done to her. But the only permanent solution to redeem yourself does not comes from you or anyone here. You will need her to forgive you first before your conscience can actually forgive you and you can forgive yourself.<br><br>One tip though...''Words doesn't means anything and actions cannot hide your true feelings''. Use actions to show her that you are sorry and when she have forgiven you, you will know it because your conscience will tell you so. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
