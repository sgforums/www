It's miserable for you to keep dwelling on and on to the fact that you are not forgiven by the person but you must remember that you have already sought forgiveness. You would have done your best in trying to redeem yourself when you have realised your folly but the other party does not want to give you that chance. Therefore, rather than just falling into the abyss of self pity and condemnation, it is better that you move on and let the scars of the incident slowly heal. Sure, they would  nv heal fully but just know that the you've already admitted your mistake and it's the other party who refuses to move on. Leave her behind and move on and know that the next best thing that you could do for her is not to hurt her again and not letting her hurt you too.</div>
