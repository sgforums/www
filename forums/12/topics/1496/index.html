            <div class='col-md body'>Dear eagle,<br>These are some tell-tale signs:<br><br>(1) She will usually be shy to look into your face and when she does, especially when you get eye contact, she will almost always smile and grin.<br><br>(2) She might talk about someone she likes making it look like its not you and at the same time not willing to tell you who it is she likes.<br><br>(3) She takes an interest in the things you do and say. She starts to remember things in your life.<br><br>(4) She eventually starts to draw closer and you'll find yourselves spending more time with each other.<br><br>(5) She might get very conscious of how she acts, looks and speaks in front of you.<br><br>These are my personal 5 tell-tale signs which I've found many girls exhibit when they like guys.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear eagle,<br><br>I did not take my 5 signs from any website if that question on "what website?" was directed to me.<br><br>Personally, these are the 5 signs that over time, I've found many girls exhibit. On top of this, you must understand that girls are emotional by design. Thus, the way they communicate or hint to a guy that she likes him is through emotions. This translates directly into a lot of care and concern - maybe lots of phone calls as well.<br><br>While this is true for many girls, I find that there are some who break all these rules.<br><br>Joanne advises to just go and ask the girl... well...<br><br>On a more serious note, I think any guy who likes a girl and wonders if the girl likes him needs to consider this liking feeling a lot. Many relationships break up simply because there is a huge rush in wanting to know if the other party likes you even you aren't even completely sure why or IF you truly like the girl.<br><br>I'd probably share something here that is a little out of point but it might help you to counsel others in r/s problems.<br><br>The word is "RELATIONSHIP". Let me break it down to help you. It's seperated into 2 parts:<br><br>1) RELATION<br>In essence, there must be a relation between two people. For example, many people who get attached don't REALLY know their gf's or bf's much. They continue the relationship in hope that this will be the girl who completes their life or makes their life a happier journey. However, before you can relate to someone else, you MUST be able to relate to YOURSELF. That's another problem with many. They don't love THEMSEVLES enough.<br><br>2) SHIP<br>Every relationship is like a voyage into the unknown. Have you seen ships going into storms? Everyone on board becomes panicky. However, notice the captain. He knows his ship. He loves his ship. He trusts his ship and he is not afraid to show his fear and concern and yet he still clings on to the ship in spite of the storm.<br><br>This scenario is true for relationships between a boy and a girl who truly love each other. In every love relationship, the LOVE creates an environment for past hurts, fears and pains to surface. Thus, many who start off in love, often find that love HURTS. That's so true! Why? Because LOVE HEALS. Many try to run away from the issue when their relationships encounter problems. However, real love will heal the hurts and things that surface, because LOVE is designed to heal your past hurts. So you can decide whether you want to be like the passangers on the ship who cry out, or be like the captain who faces the storms in the journey and CLINGS on to the ship.<br><br>In closing, every ship has a captain... in love, it takes two to drive a ship.<br><br>Bon voyage!<br>Daniel</div>
