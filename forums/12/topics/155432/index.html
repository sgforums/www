Is it hindering your personal confidence of approaching her?<br><br>If the above is yes, then I would advise you to stop pre-thinking about some insanely impossible relationship scenarios.

Start from a short yet simple and friendly conversation and see how's her response and your behaviour.<br><br>Since you're studying at the moment, I would advise you to concentrate on your studies first...else if she knew, she won't be touched by what you've done for her. She will view you as a silly and immature person who doesn't know how to prioritise your life.<br><br>Good luck, success in everything doesn't comes easy and free. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

There's no way any of us, except for other rich people, can afford their shopping and lifestyles..<br><br>And whoa, why are you taking cab home everyday, eat what she eats? Are you trying to be like her, or are you so deeply infaturated that you don't know what you're doing?<br><br>They say being in Love is using each others' strengths to overcome each others' weakness, and being unique, etc.. but at this rate you're slowly becoming her.. which is quite a scary thought.<br><br>There are alot of things that can happen, and alot of things which may not happen. She may not want you to pay for her shopping bills if she knows you're not able to. Well, the thing is she has to love you first before anything can happen.<br><br>Once she loves you, i don't think she'll want you to pay for things you can't afford. Right? Besides, maybe she'll get used to eating at foodcourts and stuff.. you'll never know.<br><br>Just get and know her first, and make a difference in her life.. Good luck</div>

You're not really getting nowhere close to knowing her better but just trying to find out things about her in your own sense... BEFORE I CONTINUE.. Pls take care of your promo EXAMS 1st....<br><br>You're THINKING ALOT on what kinda person she MIGHT BE... That won't really get you anyway pretty much nearer to her... If you want, REALLY go and KNOW HER... As a friend or aquaintence... As someone whom she can know your existence of..... Meanwhile... REMINDER AGAIN... EXAMS 1st....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Here is someone you hardly know, and she already has that much power to change you into someone you are not.<br><br>Love is not about this. Love is about being yourself, of cos change a bit for the better during the r/s to compromise with each other, but it will never be to this extent. You shudnt feel forced to spend more just because you want to know her. You are putting on a facade in front of her, trying to be helpful, trying to look as if you are as rich as her...but for what?<br><br>You are not even being yourself. And love is supposed to free you from any mask, any facade that you are wearing.<br><br>Reflect on this, and you will see why I think this is foolish.</div>
