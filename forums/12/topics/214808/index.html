This will avoid misunderstandings, white lies, ex-bfs developing rekindling passion, etc...<br><br>Since it's just normal friends, I don't see the problem with this approach. Also, being open about friends build trust in a relationship. Indirectly, it also signal to the ex-bfs that the gf and bf is happy together.</div>
