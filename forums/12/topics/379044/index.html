              <p>I have lived in Sg all my life , and i was trying to suprress my desires for a long time with regards to relationship in the past.</p>
              <p>I have never been in any relationship before as I still can't find the right guy. When I say the right guy , it means someone who have to have looks. I have been very attracted to japanese since young. Koreans later, when korean movies came to Sg channels. To say the truth i had never been attracted by any Sg male artistes in my life, Sg guys are really not my cup of taste. I notice I have always been genuinely attracted to fair skinned guys with smaller eyes in the past coupled with attractions to caucasians as well if it is the big eyed guys.</p>
              <p>Life is becoming rather depressing to me as I am very lonely. Also in terms of culture, there is not much here. It's very boring place to be in. There are few occasions where i saw some China guys who are tall and fair skin and very good looking in Sg mrt train. It is such a pleasure to look at them. I am so happy for the influx of foreign talents in Sg so that MRT rides are not boring anymore.</p>
              <p>The thing is i don't know how to start making friends with the guys i had interest in. Most of them seem so incontactable as they are merely strangers, but strangers which left a yearning in me to want to know them. I am approaching early thirties and almost half class of my school mates are married now with babies.</p>
              <p>I know I will never marry a guy whom i have no physical attraction for and i am rather old now. Most girls marries at 23~30, life here is so boring and becoming depressive now. Because much as I like japanese guy, i don't know how to have one, and do u think u can help me ? Because i am getting very sick and bored and depressive of things here. Sg man are very weird to me, it seems till my love life is completed, I can start living normal and feel more complete in my life as a woman.</p>
              <p>I know there are significant differences in the northern asia facial features, theirs are more sharper features &amp; more defined cheek bones, and bony contours on their faces instead of the roundish and flatter face which are not as chiselled in the soouthern part of Asia. In terms of complexion they have fairer and nicer skin and nicer build. And yes! the northern part has very nice and attractive eyefolds of singlelids arching upwards coupled with their angle of bony contours of their eye region which is very attractive to me and so different from the southern people.</p>
              <p>I really need help because the situation has reached to a point where i just find Sg sucky to be in because I can't find any men here. It is getting rather bad as I feel like sleeping and never waking up, no motivation, no meaning to everything if I can't get what I want in this 5 years time.</p>
              <p>Do you think it is possible to marry late and have healthy birth and how much later for a woman? I really want to have kids and I am already 28. I am now feeling very sick and down. Pls help me. Most of people i know told me that Jap guys only go for jap woman , is it true ? Where can I go to have the possiblity of dating them ?</p>

              <p>Ts</p>
              <p>i suppose if u are pretty and desirable enough</p>
              <p>u would not encouter such a problem because there are plenty of plenty of choices for u.</p>
              <p>u will be able to compete with jap and korean women also .</p>
              <p>but look at u now........never been in a relationship..</p>
              <p>idealising wats love suppose to be..lol</p>
              <p>i not sure whether to laugh at u or show pity dun blame me for mine harshness</p>
              <p>because u , yourself are inficting pain on urself by limiting ur choices</p>
              <p>and ...........please be reminded</p>
              <p>if u have the looks to demand , demand it if dun then go temple pray pray..see got luck anot that a handsome jap guy will come and pick u up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>OK...</p>
              <p>but heres a piece of advise from the bottom of mine heart.........</p>
              <p>IF  u really really wanted wat u want...i suppose u need to be prepare to pay the price...</p>
              <p>want to have a jap bf?? ......learn japanese first..</p>
              <p>go their country stay or see see, look around</p>
              <p>another thing would be of the decline in merriage .....alot of japs guys choose not to marry , i suppose  u can go japan to Man hunt..But learn japanese first please..</p>
              <p>Also, if u dun look good enough or want to increase ur chances of getting hitch....maybe u can go plasitc sugery??</p>
              <p>because...i suspect that character wise.....u would only open up to guys that are attractive to u..so better to bump up ur looks factor.</p>
              <p>worst come to worst u can...get a usless Prc northern chinese bf , if u can finanically sound.also ar..japanese guys not tall,average ard 1.7m for ur generation one those late 20s to mid 30s.u mention u like tall guys.... i knw this because mine japanese fren not tall at all -_- and his classmates in the international sch also not tall</p>
              <p>here all.....if u really want to have and possese a japanese bf.....i think...u need to try very hard...really hard..if u die die wan u need to take actions that have impact..</p>
              <p>BUT remeber ............u only live life once,if u wanna pursue ur "dream"  u shld do it soon since u no longer young . i am sorry i scold u in the first part of mine reply...but i am saying wat i mean..manytimes reality may be harsh and we may succumb to the temptations of deluding ourselves hiding in our little world,...but look at it from another way, if u face up to reality , ur preception of wats happening will be sharp,with accurate information u will be able to make better choices that will lead to ur desired effect.</p>
              <p>good luck .... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Do you think it is possible to marry late and have healthy birth and how much later for a woman? I really want to have kids and I am already 28. I am now feeling very sick and down.

              <p><br>U don't deserve our sympathy. Continue to be left on shelf. Since u are already into late 20s. Yr love shall not be puppy love and based solely on look and appearance. U will be miserable if it really happens. Chararcter and how he cares for u shall be the most important factor. I don't deny looks may play a part but as long as he don't look monsterous, I think is ok.</p>
              <p>But if u continue to be stubborn and wanted to look for a superstar looking bf and expect him to be good/treat u well plus with intention of marrying u.</p>
              <p> U can continue to wait as long and just like most of singaporean waiting to strike the first prize for singapore pool Toto.</p>

              To say the truth i had never been attracted by any Sg male artistes
              in my life, Sg guys are really not my cup of taste. I notice I
              have always been genuinely attracted to fair skinned guys with
              smaller eyes in the past coupled with attractions to caucasians as
              well if it is the big eyed guys.</p>
              <p>Life is becoming rather depressing to me as I am very lonely.
              Also in terms of culture, there is not much here. It's very
              boring place to be in. There are few occasions where i saw some
              China guys who are tall and fair skin and very good looking in Sg
              mrt train. It is such a pleasure to look at them. I am so happy for
              the influx of foreign talents in Sg so that MRT rides are not

              are merely strangers, but strangers which left a yearning in me to
              want to know them. I am approaching early thirties and almost half
              class of my school mates are married now with babies.</p>
              <p>I know I will never marry a guy whom i have no physical
              attraction for and i am rather old now. Most girls marries at
              23~30, life here is so boring and becoming depressive now. Because
              much as I like japanese guy, i don't know how to have one, and do u
              think u can help me ? Because i am getting very sick and bored and

              the roundish and flatter face which are not as chiselled in
              the soouthern part of Asia. In terms of complexion they
              have fairer and nicer skin and nicer build. And yes! the northern

              <p>Hi MinTan,</p>
              <p>I know that this your personal choice and I have absolutely no right to prevent you from doing so, but I will strongly suggest and hope that you will think through clearly before making such a choice. </p>
              <p>Having a handsome or a cute face does not mean that a man has a good heart or will treat you well and love you. There are many women who choose to go after these men, without actually finding out what kind of a person they are first, and ended up losing both their body and their money to these unscrupulous scums. </p>
              <p>If you are truly persistent in looking for such a man, then I will advice that you try to find a job in Korea/Japan first, and get a working pass and work there for a while first before making any decision. To be a PR in these countries, you will have to live there for at least 10 years, and a citizenship is given only if you married someone who is a citizen.</p>
              <p>I certainly hope that you will not regret your decision in the years to come.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>In my opinion, she does not need a boyfriend now lar. Even if she does have one or gets married - whether it is Chinese, Japanese, American ... add on, no difference. Why? She is completely oblivious to her conditioning, bigotry n prejudice. The latter traits in her will eventually derail all 'that is'. She is looking for a 'thing' not a 'alive' human being lar. Sth to parade and feel and delude that one has arrived.</p>
              <p>She needs to work on herself first lar - eg, unlearn all these 'crap' that is infesting her now lar. Otherwise, no difference, whether 'waiting' or married. One carries what is within - unresolved/unreconciled - it will surface lar</p>
              <p>As an aside ;</p>
              <p>When one has a 'crowd' within him/her how can one relate to another ONE especially in a relationship/marriage. Imagine, the other has also a 'crowd' in him/her. Hence, the constant struggle to work and keep it alive.</p>

To say the truth i had never been attracted by any Sg male artistes in my life, Sg guys are really not my cup of taste. I notice I have always been genuinely attracted to fair skinned guys with smaller eyes in the past coupled with attractions to caucasians as well if it is the big eyed guys.</p>
              <p>Life is becoming rather depressing to me as I am very lonely. Also in terms of culture, there is not much here. It's very boring place to be in. There are few occasions where i saw some China guys who are tall and fair skin and very good looking in Sg mrt train. It is such a pleasure to look at them. I am so happy for the influx of foreign talents in Sg so that MRT rides are not boring anymore.</p>
              <p>The thing is i don't know how to start making friends with the guys i had interest in. Most of them seem so incontactable as they are merely strangers, but strangers which left a yearning in me to want to know them. I am approaching early thirties and almost half class of my school mates are married now with babies.</p>
              <p>I know I will never marry a guy whom i have no physical attraction for and i am rather old now. Most girls marries at 23~30, life here is so boring and becoming depressive now. Because much as I like japanese guy, i don't know how to have one, and do u think u can help me ? Because i am getting very sick and bored and depressive of things here. Sg man are very weird to me, it seems till my love life is completed, I can start living normal and feel more complete in my life as a woman.</p>
              <p>I know there are significant differences in the northern asia facial features, theirs are more sharper features &amp; more defined cheek bones, and bony contours on their faces instead of the roundish and flatter face which are not as chiselled in the soouthern part of Asia. In terms of complexion they have fairer and nicer skin and nicer build. And yes! the northern part has very nice and attractive eyefolds of singlelids arching upwards coupled with their angle of bony contours of their eye region which is very attractive to me and so different from the southern people.</p>
              <p>I really need help because the situation has reached to a point where i just find Sg sucky to be in because I can't find any men here. It is getting rather bad as I feel like sleeping and never waking up, no motivation, no meaning to everything if I can't get what I want in this 5 years time.</p>
              <p>Do you think it is possible to marry late and have healthy birth and how much later for a woman? I really want to have kids and I am already 28. I am now feeling very sick and down. Pls help me. Most of people i know told me that Jap guys only go for jap woman , is it true ? Where can I go to have the possiblity of dating them ?</p>
