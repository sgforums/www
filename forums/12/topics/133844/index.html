            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Chillz88,<br><br>Poor thing, I sympathise with your situation, a long-distance relationship is very bittersweet.  The joy of meeting &amp; spending time together is all the more pronounced, &amp; hence cherished, due to the agony of the long separations apart.<br><br>Can she return to SG during her school vacation?<br><br>In the meantime, although it's hard, take good care of your health.  How do you think your gf would feel knowing that her bf has No appetite, &amp; is moping, pining away for her?  What would you feel if your gf did the same thing?<br><br>Nowadays, long-distance international calling cards come with cheap rates for Australia.  Why don't you buy a card once a month &amp; call her?  I think you have about 3 to 4 hours' talk time with 1 card.  She can do the same over there in Australia.  These cards are Not that expensive, about S$10/- each.<br><br>Do special things for your gf.  Buy a little notebook (nice 1 please, you'll know why later), &amp; jot down your thoughts everyday, including your feelings after every conversation.  That's what I did once, treating my bf like a diary, &amp; every entry began with "Dear XXXXXXX"...  When you've finished your diary, paste a little note on the last page that says something like, "You always feel close".  Then send the journal off to your gf.<br><br>This will give you something to look forward to, imagining your gf's smile &amp; tears of delight when she receives it : )<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by chillz88:</div><div class="quote_body">yar.. studying there.. each yr for the past 2 years we met 1 month or so only during her holidays.. and sometimes for 1 week in May..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You dont need some kind words, you need a sort of wake up call.<br><br>Long distance relationship is very very hard to maintain, unless you are seriously loaded and can pay for all the telephone bills ahz, the air tickets ahz, and so fore.<br><br>In addition, its like you're leading your life in a totally different environment from hers, she's studying, you're going to shouting KILL KILL KILL in your camp. She'll also be meeting new people, and you will too, except for the fact that yours consist mainly of guys. Then you also wouldnt have so much free time for the first 9months of your ns life if you are going to be a specialist, first 6months of your time if you're going to be a man, and first 12months of your nslife if you're going to be a officer.  It's because you're be on course and when you're course your time is tightly packed that at the end of the day, you'll take a bath and be left with like 1 or 2 hours if you are lucky before you sleep.<br><br>Do consider the pros and cons of having a long distance relationship, ask yourself do you want to continue having this relationship, and then decide lorz.<br><br>Best wishes to you.</div>
