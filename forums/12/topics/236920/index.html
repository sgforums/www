And if you cannot take such truth at face value, you should also avoid asking, if that's where the conversation led... to the truth of her past.<br><br>You dated her, being oblivion to her past, and fell in love. Now that you knew her a little more, you felt like you are being compromised. When love juxtaposed chastity, it seemed that a piece of membrane has more consideration than love itself.<br><br>If you cannot look beyond the subject of virginity, then I guess your love is probably worth just as much.<br><br>And if you decide to treat her any lesser than before, I suggest you give this relationship up because with such narrow mindset, it will likely to haunt you forever. Although you have the right to desire a virgin mate if you are one yourself (otherwise you are just another hypocritical, typical-MCP guy), <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>I think it's also fair for her to want a man who appreciate her for who she really is and love her as a complete entity and not selective in nature. </strong></span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

U will most probably raise this matter up in times of quarrel, and this will only show the gal just how narrow-minded u are.<br><br>Now, I am not saying that u are narrow-minded, but the thing is,you have 2 let it go, and not let it bug u, or else it may cause tension and conflict btw u two in the future.</div>
