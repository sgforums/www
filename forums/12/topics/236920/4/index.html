How to forgo her history? Had any one of you had the smiliar situation as me? Thanks in advance...</div></blockquote>i am exactly in the same situation as you.<br>i guess it is all in the mindset of oneself.<br>as for this one, i find it very hard to trust her after what she told me.<br>but in the end, its how you feel that matters.<br>if you really love her, i don't think you would mind.<br>as for this one, i am battling myself everyday.<br>sometimes, i really drive myself nuts.<br>hopefully, you will be better than me.<br>all the best dude.</div>

How to forgo her history? Had any one of you had the smiliar situation as me? Thanks in advance...</div></blockquote>Be careful ... Do not be swayed by the people telling you what to do here. Only you yourself know whether you truly mind your GF's past or not. Abstaining from sex till marriage is a value and a personal choice. Being "easy" and casual on sex is a personal choice. Valuing virginity is also a personal choice... Its hard to say who's personal choice is correct and whose is wrong.<br><br>It is very clear by you posting here that you do mind alot that your GF is not a virgin. If you get swayed by the people here and proceed with your relationship, your trouble will still not go away, it will probably just be temporarily forced down to fester... only to explode spectacularly one day in future during a lover's squabble, doing irreparable damage to both of you.<br><br>In short, only you know best.<br><br>For me, I am the old fashion type. I think sex is exclusive and something very special only to be shared with the love of your life. I have had sex with only one woman in my life, my wife... and prior to our marriage, I am very careful reigning in my lust for beautiful woman. The only circumstances underwhich I will accept a non virgin is if the girl is a rape victim.</div>
