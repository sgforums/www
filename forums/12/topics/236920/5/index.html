She is my 2nd girl, the 1st wan was from online so we don't meet up often, and I had never experience sex before, to worsen the circumstances, people often say sex is enjoyable and distress effectively from stress. Upon viewing censor scene from particular drama/movies, my mind often flash back the memory of her being touch, penetrate, blow job, moaning, finger...<br><br>You told me love her and accept for who she is, I tried my utmost but still no effect.</div></blockquote>You mighty be too immature to be having a relationship if you have this kind of attitude.</div>
