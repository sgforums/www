            <div class='col-md body'>If you ask me, anything can happen, esp. in luv relationaships, but first you must know and understand the real meaning of luv.  It may be redundant to you now, but luv ain't juz developing a likeliness for the other party, it actually encompasses several key factors, such as whether you can tolerate and change all his weaknesses to strengths, thus admiring him even more in future to a stage when you will not not feel tired of him. You must be able to giv him support whenever he needs it, of course you must realise when he need someone to giv him concern which is actually how sensitiv you are to his needs.  Ask yourself what type of concern do you actually want?  Don't just say you fall for a guy cos this is infatuation.  You must really be comfortable and get along extremely well with him.  You may have noticed that some whom can be really gd frds with you isn't suitable to b your lover, know why?  You may not have been exposed to his daily life and mayb you can't stand some of his habits and imagine if you were to live with him...<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To tell you honestly.. i tink it's very difficult lor.. not impossible.. especially in the guy's point of view. I ended my relation wif a ger who is 6 years my junior at the end of last year. She was 16 then.<br><br>There are many reasons..<br><br>1. it seems like i'm taking care of her most of the time. more like a big brother to her.<br>2. she doesn't seem to really understand wat i'm talking about when it comes to sharing wat happened in the day/week.<br>3. sometimes difficult to be physically together. my work commitments and her studies, her parents.<br>4. ask yourself these questions. Wat do u see in this relation? what do u want from it? where do u see it heading? compare them to your guy's answers.. are they in the same direction?<br><br>I'm just stating my point and experience.. not tryin to decide for u...<br><br>good luck.</div>

But i'm willing to try..<br><br>actually, i wanna know something..firstly,how do i get his attention ?? how do i get him to look at me as a more mature gal then what my age shows?<br><br>cuz my frens have said that i am indeed more mature in some aspects, that could be the reason why i'm more attracted to older guys..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually i dun encourage relationships where there is a large age gap b/w the two parties.. i have been thru this before lah, although it's not alot.. just nearly 5 years..<br>i do have frens who had bfs that are 12-15 years older than them, n none of the relationships succeed..<br>usually, the guy will treat the ger as little ger n will not tell her his problem in his work or what happened in the day as he felt that the ger woould not understand.. therefore as time passes, the relationship will not turn out well as there is insufficient communications b/w the 2...<br><br>another factor might be n which happened to my fren is that the guy is actually attached but just that he didnt tell u... my fren was wif this guy for almost half a year then realise that he has been cheating on her all these while.. hmm..<br><br>however, there are always exceptions.. perhaps u should try out n see if u two can get along.. n hor, u want to attract his attention ah? hmm.. i think hor, be more caring towards him.. perhaps, buy lunch or cook lunch for him if possible?</div>

Like Joanne have mentioned as the AGE GAP widens, the CHANCE for NON-UNDERSTANDING and FRICTION can also occur..... As a GENERAL rule of thumb, AGE GAP is relatively more SIGNIFICANT when the AGE of the 2 parties involved is YOUNGER, and relatively INSIGNIFICANT when the AGE of the 2 parties are HIGH. 2nd GENERAL rule involves the INTERPHASES of of a HUMAN AGE, eg. When a baby grow into kid, a kid into adolescence, a teenager into an young adult etc. When AGE DIFFERENCE cross or have a POTENTIAL INTERPHASE ahead, a CHALLENGE is there.<br><br>PERSONALLY. I would NOT disagree with your relationship, but I would also NOT encourage it. Despite the fact of your individual maturity, it is also a COMMON MISTAKE for young girls to hold a CONDITIONED LOVE FRAME in their mind. Such a MENTALITY would also render their dreams SHATTERED when they fall in love ESPECIALLY with a much more SENIOR guy. Are you READY for FAILURE?<br><br>A 29YO guy would MOST PROBABLY have much MORE EXPERIENCE than you.... LUCKY if you meet with a NICE guy. If NOT? I bet it's HIGHLY POSSIBLE that he can twist you around? You CAN be WARY of him... Be CAREFUL of him... But THEN AGAIN, isn't this a GREAT CONTRADICTION to the MEANING of LOVE... Which is suppose to EMBRACE TRUST...? See the CONTRADICTIONs arising...? Not a very good sign huh? But STILL, it's YOUR LIFE... The DECISION is UP TO YOU... No DIRECT RIGHT or WRONG here...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I WISH you LUCK?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I've come to a conclusion that the only person that can really help is your own self.
