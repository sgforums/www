            <div class='col-md body'>as a guy ... i do feel that older man attracts young girls more too ..<br>maybe.. at the monment this guy is able to provide what the young girls needs... older guy are much quieter and seem like more manly.more protective, seem like they listen.. can afford more things ..lucky got transport got home.... does things with most focus .. that why young girls tense to compare young guys who they feel they are less mature.. to the older guys.. even a few years different is alot..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Be it 17 or even if she is 37. If you always see her as a 17 year old. she will always be a little sister.. but if you see her as a person, it's a whole different story.<br><br>What I think of life now and how I think of life when I was 17 isn't very much of a difference, maybe plus here and there.. but the core value is still there.<br><br>I've seen girls even if she is 30s is still very like a kiddy still.. (I'm still wondering how her husband(just 2 years older) handles her, everytime see them like big brother scolding little sister)<br><br>Hey, even a 29 year old can be kiddy if one wants to be. it's how you want yourself to be.. (mostly being set by the social circle norm as how one is to be.)</div>

Add this to the housewife and house husband role(ok, that's after marriage) won't one party be talking about house work and the other party be talking about how one's job sucks..<br><br></div>
