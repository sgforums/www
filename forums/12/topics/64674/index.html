            <div class='col-md body'>I know this girl by the name of Lynn when I had my first meeting in this new company. She is one of the business associates that we have dealings with.

One thing for sure, I would think that I am rather average looking and did not really impressed her that much.<br><br>Months passed, and chances came by whereby I managed to get her cell phone number through business dealings. Initially, we sms and emailed each other about work and slowly progress towards more personal stuff.<br><br>Eventually, we had our first date. It was really smooth sailing and the more I know her, the more I fell for her. She would tell me how hurt she was due to her previous relationship. We would sms each other almost every night and chat once in a while on the phone. Though I was the one who initiated most of the dates and smses, I was already contented that she would go out with me. We went out together to do shopping, movies, dinner, etc.<br><br>Then came a day, whereby I need to travel aboard for a business trip for about a week. I try smsing her when I was abroad but she did not reply at all. When I call her, she said that she is moody because her ex came back to contact her. I was really devastated then, my whole world seemed to explode.<br><br>When I came back, she no longer email me and seldom sms me. She seems to drift away from me further and further but I have no idea why. Though I still ask her out, it seems that she always placed top priority for her friends' appointments compared to mine. There was this outing whereby she told me that her ex kept smsing her, wanting to patch back but her heart has already die. There are times when I felt like giving up thinking that she does not have any interest in taking this relationship further but its always these subtle hints that kept me going strong.<br><br>It has been 3 months since our first date, and now I was really tired, mixed, and vexed.. not knowing what to do next.

She'll probably need you to walk her out of it (if you intend to start a chance into a relationship with her). And the story probably won't end from there. Can expect more hardship for the relationship and problems from her.<br><br>If you're feeling hurt and weak, I'll advise you to step out of this one. This probably won't kill her. She'll just cling onto friends and probably won't be touching on a BGR relationship for a while.<br><br>Not a simple task.

You had already mentioned yourself - you couldn't imagine being her friend, furthermore a girlfriend, so please understand that whatever time spent you had enjoy with her is purely a BONUS. On her side, she truely has her right to reject/accept advances.<br><br>Under art of seduction - if I were you, I wouldn't give up at all. I don't see this as a rejection - I see this as a essential phrase that will take place. Top ten mistake that man always make - to presume success whenever things are going smoothly in matters of the heart. If there are two things in life that are definitely not absolute, it has to be love and life. Come on man, if she doesn't go through this now - you mean when she is with her next bf (assuming that you are her next bf), you want that to happen during that time? Hell no?<br><br>Advice? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>'She says she is the slow type' - (Especially if she is Virgo, Capricorn or Taurus) - never force haste onto the chase. Take gradual, steady advances. YOU CAN SUGGEST A MEETING, but never pressure her like making statement that you would like to meet more often. Seriously, that is so anti-seductive. To respect her choices without making claims, yet feeling for her at the same time is godly.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You want to impress her - you got to let her feel that she would be able find comfort in you.<br><br>When she finds your company not only enjoyable, but also comfortable, she would be able to be herself. The next thing you have to do is just to upkeep them.<br><br>P.S: Obviously she is putting you behind because of her current love issues she has to handle by herself. The more haste and pressure you apply, the more you lose your chance of winning this. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it seems to me that u are always thinking abt yourself... spare some thots for her<br>complaining that she dont give u enuff time from your own point of view, not spending christmas with u. in the first place, who are u to her that she need to fulfill what u expect from her?<br>her life dont revolve around u only<br>and even if she wants to give u a chance doesnt mean that she has to spend all her time with u or meet your expectation of amout of time spend with u<br>she will prioritize her own events and distribute the time accordingly<br>if u add more pressure to her at this point of time, u will fail definitely... listen to the rest be patient, go slow, treat her as a friend...<br>since u know that it is impossible for u 2 to go further at this moment, then let this thot go for the moment and support her from a friend's position only when she gotten over her past then u think abt it...</div>

It's about spending your life with friends and people who's worthwhile. (I would lean onto this conclusion <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">)<br><br>Many good advice given here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Mine will be: Set your rules and play your game. She's not likely to fall for a guy whos falling helplessly falling in love with her.<br><br>Refer to Yun's advice: Suggest meetings and don't ever ever give pressures. No one would feel genuinely comfortable if he/she is pressured to oblige in certain favours.<br><br>Key to note: Advance very slowly - you got to build that comfort level which the both of you started at first. And please, don't tell her that you are falling for her(Throw that idea away first, till she reacts).<br>She's not interested in BGR.....she wants someone whom she can be comfortable with.<br><br>Be that somebody whom she finds you worthwhile...you'll earn a wonderful non commited relationship. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>All the best.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
