You must have been through some trauma that contribute to this effect or maybe it is just your preception that is rooting you down. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Everyone fear being betrayed and being hurt - but majority ain't letting it bring them down. Being TOO wary over people is a fault because most of them ain't what you think they are to be - but you PONDER to such extend that 'Believing is proof' whereas in reality is nothing but the mirage of your imagination. You acted in self defence by trying to plot against them to find out eventually that you are actually plotting against innocents. People finds you vicious and would stay minimum contact with you.<br><br>You are what you believe... all these problems does exist in the world, but the thing is letting it pour all over you ESPECIALLY when you NEVER even been through like 1/2 of it - its like drowning in your own preception. You are choking yourself, putting yourself in a shoe of darkness, but in reality everyone is moving on, and you are left behind. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>You know why you fear to love? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>'You fear to love because love to you is a weakness. By revealing your own feelings and thoughts, you feel that you are subjected to the person's mercy. When he leaves you, you will be stun and totally lost - which confirm your original thoughts and that makes you never to fall in love again.'<br><br>All I can say is... those who never fail in relation are those who never tries. Yes, you can remain the stage you are now and reject every single potential and still be defensive. At the end of the day, you gain nothing. There is no such thing as the most secured relation where you feel totally protected emotionally, spiritually and physically - you want happiness, you have to take intellectual risk. Only go with someone who is serious about relationship and deep down inside you, you know that he is able to fix your insecurities and give you quiet happiness.<br><br>You have to learn to release yourself from your mental prison - because only you have to power to do so - nobody else can. My advice and others to come is like the key to the prison - you have to unlock it yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers<br>(Prediction skills in testing - Are you a scorpio or a taurus?)</div>

REAL problems that is. like Yunhaier pointed us, its just your "mental prison". its only "in your head". you can't let something like that run your emotios down. you have to stay strong. i wouldn't say "survival of the fittest" here cuz that again is really a metaphorical way of saying it. so the way i see it, things aren't that bad. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

In the end my parents were called to school and eventually the misunderstanding was cleared up.<br><br>These are all scars that were left behind in my childhood. They will never be erased from my memory, or I do not know how to get over them.<br><br>I can hardly find anyone around me whom I trust. Alone, it is truly difficult for me to stand up again...<br><br>I don't remember being loved by my parents. I can hardly remember being loved by anyone even though it's not like my parents disliked me or ignored me. My friends, my best friends... have even drifted away from me after we went to different schools. It is difficult to find another because of my caution towards everyone around me...</div></blockquote>You haven't seen much of the world... you only seen some negative side. Truthfully, if you have seen every single thing on Earth, you would have notice there are more positive aspect on Earth than negative ones. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The first thirteen years of your life is crucial in shaping that kind of character and thinking that you will have for the rest of your life. These are what you call scars... sure it will be difficult to change that kind of preception, but it is DEFINITELY possible. Nobody says it is going to be easy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Astrologically, the fixed aspect in your sign limits and hinder your initiative to change - but that does not mean that you can't. Best/good friends are not easy to find - you realise, and of course when you find them - treasure it. Don't seek friendship because you desire someone to depend on. Friendship is like love - the more you crave, the more it wouldn't come to you. You have to lead a better life than this paranoid belief that is fused within you - then only people will see you as more positive and will, at the very least, speak, approach and communicate with you. Who would want to befriend someone who is suspicious of everyone, ever-so negative, plotting or even grouchy? Isn't it contridicting what you wanted - finding good true friendship/love/etc? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So what does this tells you?<br><br>For your case, don't look at the situation as in people drifting away from you... ponder why this is happening - Self reflect. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You have to learn to release yourself - the best way is to occupy your mind with something else. Go work, learn something new, hang out, etc. Because your mind has nothing to occupy and will keep thinking of such mundane issues. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>*One positive aspect I going to point out - you post your problems, people advice... see? There are good things around - it is just that you are too blinded with your self thoughts that you failed to noticed them. Even next time when you have problems you could post it or private message me or anyone, I am quite sure people would advice you the best it seemed for you* <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
