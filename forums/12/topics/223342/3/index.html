Im trying to defend the marriage. If he is really drunk, then what? I mean, some people really cannot control themselves when they are pissed drunk. Maybe that guy lost form.

Then you can whack him hard.<br><br>That's why the best she can do is not say anything. Anything you say or do will have a karmic effect on the marriage.

It would be easier to question and talk in that sense because you do value this friendship and it would be easier to settle this between just the two of you. I don't think the situation has gone out of hand that it requires you to discuss this with your best friend, if you could possibly settle this yourself.<br><br>Cheers</div>
