Lemme ask you guys a qn.  <span style="color: red;">Does being drunk make whatever wrong thing a person does right?</span><br><br>So if one day, a drunk man and molested your gf, is it ok?  you letting him go juz cos he said "hey dude, im sorry, i was drunk"?<br><br>P/S:  I do not know if he was drunk.  but he went to bed at 1am, his wife went back to sleep at 2:15am and he opened my room door at 3:10am.</div></blockquote>This question reminds me of a question I used to ask after I got into a tricky situation with my ex-crush/one of my closest guy frens...both of us were drunk, and he tried to do sth to me which i never expected him to...and the next morning, I tried to console myself by saying that he did nothing wrong, just dat he is drunk and unconscious...so doesnt know what he is doing (this is a guy I used to like very much, I am still amazed at my stupidity for still trying to stand up for him even after that incident)<br><br>But after I got over the whole thing, I realize that being drunk shouldnt be used as an excuse to do something like this. As long the guy can still walk around and go into your room, I do not think he is totally drunk to begin with. Drunk means unconscious, unmoving and not being able to move at all. If he is still moving, means that he might have already had the intention to do this kinda thing to you in the first place.<br><br>This is indeed a delicate situation, esp since it involves your best fren. You can discuss it with her, but be prepared for the worst consequence (losing the frenship, after all most women will choose to believe their husbands and delude themselves into thinking they are innocent rather than listening to the truth by someone they consider an outsider). You can tell her the whole story, but say that it is up to her to believe it or not.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think the best thing to do now is just to let it go. The husband cannot leak this matter out or he will face the death penalty. So its actually quite safe for you to keep this secret from your friend.<br><br>What's more, from the way you wrote in your previous post, your friend would most probably deny all these happenings and your friendship will cease to have trust. Also, you did see something. But nothing has been done to you. Let this matter quietly diminish off.<br><br>Please keep us updated on this matter. Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not sure what the others are thinking about but i certainly believe your woman friend must be told about this 100%. And u can even pre-empt all the lies by warning your woman friend about it. We have to be concerned about the welfare of your fren and  other potential victims too. Whether she deludes herself should not be your primary concern.<br><br>On balance, the guy is not drunk. Never be in contact with him again. The advice to "keep things formal" when he is around is utter rubbish. You wouldn't want him within a mile.<br><br>The only thing left is to decide whether to file a police report. I'm not sure about the ramifications but whether or not he is drunk is up to the police to decide. And there'll be a formal record of what happend.<br></div>

That is for your own good. Like what other say, your bf will kick the balls out of the guy - end up your bf will get in trouble with police. Your side of story will not hold up, as it is just your words, no witness also you been drinking, also he did not force himself on you ........ I mean is just consider - you manage to run from your room to his bedroom then the roof and down out the house. If he seriously want to grab you, you think you can run all over, so your story is weak.<br><br>Look at the way you describle your friend and your lifestyle can afford drinking  that much at a go, private house, diamonds .... you think your friend will want the bubble burst and give up everything and her face ?<br><br>Frankly your friend husband is not drunk, if drunk person will sleep like a pig already. Maybe like some other say - drinking that much liquor and that type of lifestyle may have given him a wrong message.<br><br>At this moment no one is sure even if the wife is into it also. You should know nowaday, at some crazy folks is into those stuff.<br><br>Frankly my advice is just stay away from the husband and that house. Also drop drink with them. As for your guardian angel, maybe you and him should just confront the husband secretly, and settle the matter quietly... just give him a warning ...<br><br>Think the best for everyone. No point in telling more person.<br><br></div>
