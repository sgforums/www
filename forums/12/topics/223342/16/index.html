But I do not advocate violence. Besides, I do not want to get someone into trouble (because these people are also not the dumb arse you beat up. They are professionals, managing directors and such and would not let these things go lightly) nor do I like to burder others with issues I can handle myself.

The trauma from a sexual harassment is really unimaginable unless you have experienced it yourself.<br><br>The first time i had encountered that was 2 years ago, and the culprit was my boss' boss, during a company dinner. (Note: no alcohol was involved that time cos dinner had not even started.) He was one of the top men of a big organisation in spore, i would never have imagined it. I excused myself and glued myself to my boss the whole dinner. Immediately after the dinner, dashed to the car and sped off. I had a car accident. His harassment did not stop there until i resigned.<br><br>This case is different. It involved people whom i know and i trusted. Or i thought i know, or i thought i could trust. Like i said, i really had been shaken a bit, but guess that is all anyone else could help me. Now, i really have to pull myself up. This case has sowed the seed of distrust, even for the closest friend, or any male species, honestly. I hope it will not sow the seed of paranoia, or of being jaded.<br><br>I'm goin to close this chapter. I want to thank some of you here in sgforum for your kind words and support. For throughout this period, i had no one to turn to other than you cos all my trusted friends, for one reason or another, are all overseas. I really had no one to turn to. Didnt want to worry my family. I didnt want to tell my bro for fear that he will really go whack that guy up too. So, my most sincere appreciation, thank you again.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>i am moving on, i wrote this morning.  And forumites talk to me after that, what you want me to do?<br><br>Tell them, sorry, my problem solved, i dont need to talk anymore, so stop talking to me?  Cross the river and dismantle the bridge?!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>You can be harsh, but please do it with fairness, not malice.<br><br></div>
