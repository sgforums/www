            <div class='col-md body'>Before I start, I would say that the GUY IS AT FAULT.<br><br>It doesnt make a difference if he is drunk or not. It still wrong. But still, I feel that we should know if he is or not.<br><br>To do this, i would suggest the following. It would be up to you to decide if you wanna act on it.<br><br>Talk to him, with his wife present. Talk to wife in private first, tell her your concerns, ("maybe he is drunk, so he doesnt know what is happening, so ya, I wanna let you know first. Nothing happened, but then i want to knock some sense into him dear.... haha....") some stern dialogue, but include some humour so as not to tense her too much.<br><br>Have your bf with you if possible. So that all parties can take note of how serious the problem is. Have your bf with you for the dinner as well. Inform him to look sharply at the husband.<br><br>After that, get the husband out for dinner, if he appears normal, proceed. If he appear edgy, proceed with extra caution. This might means he was sober and he knew something was coming. I will leave it to you as to how you want to reveal to the couple.<br><br>If he was sober, then I leave it to you. Most rape cases are done friends/family of the victim. So ya, the chance is quite high? Report to the police? Or settle with your friend. I am sure your friend wont have a nice time after that.<br><br>If he was drunk (maybe he is acting, and most prob he will, but this time round, nothing went wrong. Thank God.), end it off with a joke maybe if you are willing to forget it. But then leave a warning (maybe you bf can do it) and you yourself, make sure dun ever stay over again. If he was acting, you have no idea what he will do the next time.<br><br>I dunno, but arrows  are flying all over in this topic. To TS, if you feel that bad over this, talk to your bf more. Cut off contact for some time first, forget about this. Or its that bad that you want to report the guy, go ahead. Its your call. The guy is at fault (from your story), drunk or not.<br><br>However, if you are going to report, evidence? Hard to get I would say, unless you know of a spycam in your room.<br><br>All in all, glad that you managed to get away that night unharmed.<br><br>JMHO.<br><br>Well Wishes.<br><br></div>
