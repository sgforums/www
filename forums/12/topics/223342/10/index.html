Neither am i for the idea on the use of violence.  But i think my bf deserves to know the truth.<br><br>Okay, going forward, what should i do?<br><br>Have decided, there is no use in talking to the husband, unless im ready to accept some excuses or counter-accuations.  Which i have no time for, and i am not interested.<br><br>The question now is, should i tell my best friend?<br><br>i should not tell her because,<br>* it is not good for her marriage.  It really hadnt been a easy road for her to find this someone who loves her, willing take care of her for the rest of her life.  Will this break her marriage?  Will this scar her marriage?  I do not want to be the one who is responsible for wrecking it.<br><br>Lastly, if i do not tell my friend, the husband can actually have a chance to rethink his action, and mend his way.<br><br>I should tell her because,<br>* she is my best friend.  i owe her the loyalty to tell her the truth.  she deserves to know the truth, and from thereon, decides what is best for her.  She could choose to be deluded, but at least, she is given a chance to make that decision.<br><br>Lastly, on a positive note, if i tell her and she chooses to take it positively, they can seize this opportunity to understand the problems in the marriage and work it out.<br><br>Good vs Right?<br>Love for her to have a good life vs Loyal to her?<br><br>Now it is time to weigh which should i pick.</div>

At times, she does do things that irks me.  As with any other relationship or friendship, no one is perfect.  But a few days later, i would be fine and things are back to normal.  Again as with other relationships.  And i also believe that she does put up with me in some other ways.  No one is perfect.<br><br>Our friendship has gone beyond liking already, if you get what i mean.  There is bonding and deep emotions too.  Then again, looking at the situation, no point crying over spilled milk.  What has to go, has to go.  Im juz thinking of the best way to handle this wreckage.<br><br>And yes, their marriage is their responsibility.  It wasn't my action that created the problem.</div>
