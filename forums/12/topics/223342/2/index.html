            <div class='col-md body'>Well.<br><br>Depends on how well you understand your friend and depends on how much you think of this husband that your friend married I guess. Was he chasing you to HUNT you down or was he chasing you to explain the situation after he realised what a bad mistake it was? Cos I think if he really wanted to chase you down, he probably would have caught you.<br><br>All men think with their dicks sometimes. And some men end up thinking with ONLY their dicks occasionally. Its stupid but it doesnt necessarily make them bad men.<br><br>It would be a pity to tell her this, end up she refuse to believe you (for face), wreck the friendship between the two of you, and because of growing distrust, end up in a slowly breaking down marriage without a good friend to stand by her. This is worst case scenario of course. Cos chances are, if he confesses, he would claim he was drunk - and the awkwardness is just going to strain the friendship between you and her anyway.<br><br></div>
