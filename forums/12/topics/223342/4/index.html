            <div class='col-md body'>My advice is that whatever happen you must avoid the husband from now on. Just be formal with him and dont get friendly with him in any way. Just keep a distance and keep the contact to a minimum.<br><br>It is very likely he will make up excuses to cover himself. All men will do that. Remember when Bill Clinton got caught he made up many excuses, and it's the same with all men. It's impossible a man will admit and embarass himself.<br><br>Therefore I see that it is pointless to talk to him or to try understand what actually happened that night. This is because there is a very high likelihood that the main person, the husband, will be making up stories to cover himself. Whatever come out from his mouth will not be truth, but damage control.<br><br>Therefore it is useless and meaningless to interview him or talk to him. It is in your interest to not trust him in any way or his explanation, and also in your interest to keep a distance from him.<br><br>Regarding your best friend, the wife, hmmm....very hard to say. I think you are the one best suited to know whether to tell her or not, because we dont know her, while you are her best friend who knows her very well for years. So it's up to your judgement from what you know about her and her personality about what to do. Just give yourself more time to think about this carefully.<br><br>Best Wishes,<br>Meat Pao.</div>

Values build up the principles of your own life - and if you compromise what you feel is the most important to you, you will have no peace.<br><br>And if by sacrificing something, something gotta give simply because not only your own beliefs at stake.
