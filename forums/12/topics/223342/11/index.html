I cannot tell how things will pan out for your friend. Nor am I a good example to follow by as I do not take affairs outside of marriage, paid sex and such things lightly.  But its always between the couple and if things fall apart, you are still the victim. Although you might be dragged through mud as one of the possible cause of the breakdown. However, as its been said, if there is no rotting seed, there would not be a poison tree.   My take is, once you close your case, avoid at all cost - you do not need any more sh!t coming your way. People always lay blame, its better you see no evil, hear no evil, say no evil. At least, after this episode, you can stay neutral and protect yourself.<br><br>How I will react if my friend tells me this.  Cannot really tell if the friendship might keep or end. However, it is very hard to swallow if my husband ever engage in such acts and I would feel shame and truly angry at him.  I might also wonder why and if I had played any part if he wish to insult my friend's modesty.  I might even think he's a perv and might even report him to the police myself because as a woman, I think when your husband does things, you will notice. If you choose to be blind, then when he does great wrongs because he knows he can get away with it, then its the woman's fault. Women always have that intuition but women are also foolish. Some are so foolish they choose to ignore the signs and live in fantasy. (my view for such women - let them be. No point telling them because they will play victim and you will be label the witch.)  I might be angry at my friend but when I cool down, I would appreciate the honesty. However, it does not apply to other people or your friend.  To tell or not to tell is up to you. If you feel obligated, then hint your friend and let it be that you had done your best. Don't be hard on yourself for not trying harder to save her. If she does not wish to be saved, there's nothing you can do. Sometimes (personal view) people need to experience hard knocks and such kinds of sh!t to grow up.<br><br>I take it that people come and people go. I weed out people who claim themselves as my friend but turn around and use me at every possible opportunity for whatever they wish to gain from me. I feel I have enough problems on my own much less carry other people's. Besides, even the best friendships end.  To me, for every ending, there is a new beginning.  There are other people who also can be your good friend.  Another personal opinion, as we grow older the concept of 'best friend' seems to fade, the idea of 'best' does not seem to exist for me.<br><br>Life's tough...<br></div>
