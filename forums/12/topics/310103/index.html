              hi guys i have a problem here that i guess is affecting my family relation
              
              i have a brother. well hes a high flyer, went to a top jc n did well for his As n is considering scholarship. CCA record is also good.  Went for enlistment n end up being one of the to[ recruits, garanteed a chance to go OCS. Hes getting all the attention from relatives, friends n girls
              
              u guys must be thinking such a high flyer, his brothers shouldnt be that bad right? Well me being the eldest is the exact opposite. I went to Poly, did quite badly n went for wrong course. My NS record isnt fantastic. I am relatively shy, i have speech problems n list goes on.
              
              Well i admit i am jealous n i even sometimes hope my brother do badly for exams. Yes i know i am a b@stard. 
              
              I am actually thinking of changing myself. Instead of being jealous and being cold towards my brother, how can i change?

              work harder.
              
              When I was little, my mum kept saying how good my cousins were, got so many scholarships, enter the best uni and jc. top flier. I remember how I begged to ask her to shut up but she refuse.
              
              I was doing worst than you back then, studies was like shit but in the end with my hard work, I earn 3 times more then those so call high flyers.
              
              The secert is that they maybe good in studies but they do not know how to work. If you work 3 times harder then them then you can outshine them.

              precisely thats wad i am thinking about, he didnt do anything. its just that i just cant help being hateful n cold towards my bro. he seems to excel in everything he does and i am the exact opposite.
              
              being the eldest, i should lead by example, be a role model for my younger brothers to look upon right?

              <p>No, why should you expect your younger brothers to look upon you?</p>
              <p>You lead your own life, they lead theirs. What's there to compare ?</p>
              <p>What they need is not a successful big brother, what they need is a caring, supportive and loving big brother.</p>
              <p>Just because you don't do as well as your younger brother, doesn't mean he cannot love you as a brother and same goes to you.</p>
              <p> Do you think being hateful and cold towards your brother will make your family like you more ? On the contrary my friend. Financial success does not make people like you more, it's your character that is important.</p>
              <p>Don't let your jealousy continue to ruin your relationship with your own family. If you want to improve your life, instead of focusing so much hate on your brother, you can channel that energy to upgrading and improving your life.</p>
              <p>It is easy to hate, but not so easy to forgive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>I think what you have here is not rivalry and certainly not jealousy. I think basically you are envying him.</p>
              <p>I don't for one single moment would regard you a failure lest you want to feel and regard it that way. In the 1st place you need to love him as your brother, and that love means supporting him as your younger one. Be happy with him when he is successful and be supportive of him when he fails and meets challenging and trying times. Only by learning to love him will you be able to overcome all that negativity that is in you. Remember love and envy cannot co-exist and afterall he is your brother and I am sure he may be performing well in certain areas of his life but I think wisdom can  tell you there are more to come. Then what?</p>
              <p>I am sure you are equally an accomplished individual yourself, although some of your aspects' results aren't in the ideal but you have not given up and still did not go about committing crimes and deeds that will grief your loved ones. Doesn't that count as an good example of an elder brother. Not cowaring out when it matters.  You just have not arrive at the outcome which is expected but it does not mean that it never will. Nothing will remain the same unless you want it to. All things will improve. So take heart and learn to love him as a brother. Stop comparing. Being committed to loving others is the secret to overcoming envy and that itself is a success also.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>People grow envy of somebody success without understanding the amount of suffering/effort that he had to extert behind the scene. I guess what your brother has achieved today isn't like 123 but due to his own effort.</p>
              <p>You can similarly achieve anything if you put effort into working towards it. Blame it on yourself for being what you are now, for being lazy :P</p>
              <p> It is great thing that you have a high-flyer brother! Cos you have a fantastic role model to learn from and, as a brother, he will help you when you are in trouble.</p>
              <p>Don't take family relationship for granted. They are the closet to you in the world and both of you are supposed to look after each other ass when your parents aren't here anymore.</p>

              <p>There's no need to compare with your siblings. A strong feeling to excel better will sometimes sour relationships and disastrous once harm is done. You should feel happy for the success of any member in the family instead. I m sure your brother will feel that way too.</p>
              <p>Is a blessing that u have him with you thoughout these years. At least life is not so lonely after all. Just need to do your best in whatever you do and don't lament over unpleasant past. To be brothers this life is a karma from the past whether is good or bad &amp; whether you like it or not. So cherish it.</p>
