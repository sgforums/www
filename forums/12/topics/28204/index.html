            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,<br><br>I am 25 yrs old and still single perhaps becuase I am feeling interior in myself and thus think that no one is interested to know me at all.<br>This is becuase of my failures in relationship that resulted in me feeling these way.<br><br>Recently, I always got to see a lady on the same bus that I take to the MRT station. I always got to see her several times a months whenever she board the same bus that I am taking.<br><br>She looks mature with her nice makeup and silky blond hair. What attract me most is her attractive eyes.<br><br>Everytime she is on the same bus with me, I will always observe her.<br>In my heart, I really want to know her but wonder if she is friendly enough to approach. I wonder if she is interested to know me too.<br><br>Today I got to see her again, and she is standing in front of me in the bus. It's the same feeling as before as I observe her again.<br><br>Truthfully, I really want to try and appoach her and ask her if we can become friends. But in my heart, i feel a bit reluctant as inferiority thrash me down again.<br><br>Can anyone help me in this issue? How can i approach her in the best way?</div>
