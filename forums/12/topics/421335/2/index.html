And that was incaulcated into their society making them willing to face the reality of life, yes mean yes, no mean no, fail mean fail, single mean single, there should be no room for illusion and dreaming, but it also got it weak point, because human can hardly take the reality in life, they cannot even let go LOVE, Money, Status, and failure. Zen is to test the human tolerance, endurance and conciousness toward the reality of life, however, with the amount of japs committing suicide, it is not a good sect.</p></div>

              <p>I am sure you have heard of forgive and never forget. Time heal all things.</p>
              <p>The truth is Time heal nobody..........</p>
              <p>It is near impossible to forget any unpleasent event/ incident that happen to an individual.</p>
              <p>Share your views......</p>
              <p>My Take is ---- You should not forget the incident or events so that you don't make the same mistake twice. but you can forget the Pain.</p>
              <p>Sometime it is the anger that is holding onto the Pain so just let go the "Pain"</p>
