              <p>Forget is only a loss of temporary memory, our brain is so unique that it alway want to re visit any past special events in our life, be it sad or happy. So, if a person, after going thru a big event of his/her life said he/she had forget it, it is a lie, a self deny, a betray of one mind.</p>
              <p>Forgive is more of an emotion to let the issue settle down, alots of time, because people cannot change the event or could not find a better solution to their problem, they seek forgive to cool down, most of the time, forgive means forgiving oneself than others, cos most of the time, the other dun give a damn whether you forgive them or not.</p>
              <p>Other than physical pain, emotional pain is self make, self suffering and self developed. By understanding the essence that nothing last forever, emotional pain shall cease to exist. On the other hand, pain is also a wake up call, a road to enlightment. It is alway at the brink of the end of life that people realized what they had been doing and going thru with pain is simply nothing but stupid.</p>

              <p>interestingly, I heard a new version to this forgive and forget.U forgive, but u won't be able to fully forget, cause there is a scar.</p>
              <p>the power to forgive is great, but u want still think back when u 'touch' an old scar. but the ill feeling/hatred or etc, may have perished, and U just go on with life.</p>
              <p>it is perfect, if U can forget/forgive, but i don't think it is a big crime per say, if u forgive but n forget.</p>

              <p>If you forgive...forget...wil hurt yer self esteem. Never watch Adam Sandler in Anger Management?</p>
              <p>U must learn how to handle forgiveness thru express anger. If u supress yer anger, then it will hurt yer self esteem, then people will loss respect for u, like Adam Sandler in Anger Management.</p>
              <p>U must deal wif it, it is process. Go scold the person who cause u grievance, then u feel a lot better.</p>

              <p>Master Nun of the Hwa mountain in taiwan: Lingmei, if someone cannot forgive and forget their problem, its agony and suffering to him/her, so how are you going to save him/her.?</p>
              <p>Lingmei: Well, honorary one, thanks for your question (we nun hv to thanks master if she ask us question), I will give him/her a lecture on forgiveness but not forgetting, cos we cannot forget things, which is mind over matters. Hopefully she understood and learned the true happiness meaning of Let Go (detachment).</p>
              <p>Master: Good, but if she still cannot Let Go.</p>
              <p>Lingmei: Then, master, you have to enlighten me, please.</p>
              <p>Master: Ask her to end her life</p>
              <p>Lingmei: But master, our teaching forbid killing of oneself, it is the greatest sins</p>
              <p>Master: Lingmei, there are time you have to do the extreme, if a person come to me with her problems, and after telling her the solution and thesis on Let Go and Forgiveness, she still cannot do it, and ask again. And when we replied Kill yourself, it somehow, enlighted and solve all her problems. And even if she is to kill herself, so be it, we save many others from suffering with her.</p>
              <p>Lingmei: Master, may I ask, what do you mean by she get enlighted when we ask her to end her life when all teaching failed to save her.</p>
              <p>Master: You see Lingmei, people have a motivation factor in them, at time, the more bad you said about them, the more they are motivated to live and fight on. Just like sometime, i said you go and die, it makes you wake up and tell yourself, hey, I am not going to die like this, this is the end of the road, i have to make a U turn and fight on to show all of you that i can make it without ending my life.</p>
              <p>Lingmei: Thank you master for your wonderful insight.</p>
              <p>Master: For punishment to you, tonite you cook dinner for us</p>
              <p>Lingmei: Huh? why master, i did nothing wrong?</p>
              <p>Master: You did not seek my permission before asking me question</p>
