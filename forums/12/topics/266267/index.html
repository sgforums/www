            <div class='col-md body'>I just came back on a 3 day trip to KL. Bought local stuff (kopi, ba ku teh, tea, snacks) back for family worth over $100. She just see alr put one corner. I also bought a bar of chocolate about $18 and put in fridge. She also bochap.<br><br>Then she purposely come into my room demanding to see the pictures I took for the trip. I said it was not ready yet, as I had not downloaded into PC, but she insist on looking at it through the digital cam. Fine then. Then, she kept asking irriating questions like, why I only took the outside of times sq, why only snap at night, why never take the scrnery, etc etc etc. I took all the shots, just that she had no reach them yet.<br><br>Then she look at the gifts i bought for my friends. She saw 5 boxes of chocolates, and immediately ask why I buy for friends but she dun have. (I told her to go compare the price of the chocolate in the fridge compare to the price of the gifts.)<br><br>Then she say am I afraid to let her know I going overseas for fear that she will tag along. (I screamed at her reminding her that I had already proposed earlier this year that I'll sponser a family trip of her choice this year end.)<br><br>I feel that she's always trying to find fault with whatever I do.<br><br>....<br>I'm dam bloody piss off right now.... we screaming at each other<br><br>sigh<br></div>
