            <div class='col-md body'>"If a r/s can be rocked so easily...then something is wrong with the r/s.<br>I'm not saying that you are right by doing so but then again if the r/s is so solid, what's there to be afraid of?"<br><br>To me there is no such thing as a rock solid relationship. There are many things which changes. By thinking that a relationship will not change through time is very wrong idea cause i myself have being through this whole process again and again.  Is the countious effort which both party puts into the relationship that counts towards how strong the relationship will go on through the good and the bad times.<br><br>I have seen the so call solid relationship fell because of neglect, misunderstanding, refusing to learn from past mistakes, bored of the other party, jealousy, unwilling to speak up when one person is suffering and many more.<br><br>"I mean I'm referring to third party lah. Of course if it's other things else then it's a different case. Maybe it's the same. I don't know either.<br><br>What me and my ex-gf case is our family and the nature of our r/s. Our feelings were not affected but our faith towards this r/s is badly affected. It's almost impossible to see the future in this r/s unless we can make it to a point to ignore everything and everyone which obviously we can't or at least my gf can't. It's easy to let go of a r/s but to let go of a real feeling, it's just too hard."<br><br>I do not wish to comment on your case between you and ex. As I believe both of are adults already and you can handle it well. You have weight all odds and now is time to act on it.<br><br>"Kitty, just go with your heart. If you truely love her, then love her. If she love her bf enough, she'll know what to do. Then you'll know her final answer. Sounds a bit bad but life is short. I don't usually advise people to step into other's r/s. But do ask yourself this. Do you love her or like her?"<br><br>Kitty I have said what I need to say and do not wish to repeat it again. You should now chose which path you wish to go.</div>
