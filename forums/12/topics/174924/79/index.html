Honestly I'm quite disturbed when I know that there are guys who confessed their feelings for my gf (ok..ex-gf..pardon me..but I've yet get used to it). I honestly told my gf how I felt about it but I told her I trust her and the only reason why I still chose to trust her is because she never did respnd much to their advances. Most important factor here is I trust her.</div>
