              <p>Hey brother I support you 100%.</p>
              <p>Breaking any kind of addiction is hard, and I know you will be facing a tough battle.</p>
              <p>Btw, I think drinking coffee may or may not be the best solution. Perhaps you will develop caffeine addiction later leh ? Then it will be another problem. You may have insomnia, physical reaction and cravings, and ever-increasing caffeince dosage.</p>
              <p>I have a tip for you,</p>
              <p>If you have time, try to excercise.</p>
              <p>Seriously this is a very good tip.</p>
              <p>Say for example in the late afternoons, go to cycle to the beach........you can enjoy sports, recreation, sightseeing, panoramic appreciation, all in one.......this is what I do.</p>
              <p>After you do this sports, you will feel better.</p>
              <p>Sports is a natural and wholesome kind of "high", it can supplant any kind of addiction. Just try it..!</p>

              <p>You should not think about giving up porn. Because when you do, you think about porn. You can instead say, you will watch porn next week. Put it off, instead of fighting it. But please don't watch it the next week, instead say you will watch it later. But then please don't watch it later, instead say you will watch it afterwards. But please don't watch it afterwards.</p>
              <p>While putting it off, develop another habit. A bad habit cannot be eradicated, it can be replaced, by another bad or good habit.</p>
