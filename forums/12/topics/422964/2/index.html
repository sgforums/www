              <p>There are times on the internet, when clicking the reply button does not make much difference. </p>
              <p>I actually find it repulsive, when so many people bother to reply a single thread, yet none of them profess to have any real-life story to share.</p>
              <p>I am not here to preach, but just... have you been paying attention today? Are you addicted to porn, or are you addicted to the feelings that pornography creates for you? Very often, as my personal experience have come to reveal, it is just the feelings that I was attached to. Porn is like pepper on cream of mushroom soup, the mushroom soup already is murky, and creamy, you add porn to it, you thought it was the pepper that rocks when actually it was just that additional "shiok" feeling that it adds to the soup.</p>
              <p>Lust is inherent in people. It is just... just. You mothers brought boys up in a world showered with emotions, and with all the feelings ingrained in you, it is natural human reaction for a guy (I presume u are), to react when you see the opposite gender. Because the mother's second nature other than to love, is to provide nourishment, be it in the form of milk (!!), security, or company. The problem about lust, is not the pictures themselves. The problems lies in YOUR, yes, YOUR disability to see it for what they really are.</p>
              <p>What are they really, then?</p>
              <p>Well. Actors and actresses!</p>
              <p>They get paid to do the job, to strip, and for the guy(s) to screw the gal(s) or what have you. Dogs don't volunteer, they just get dragged into the studio when the directors run out of ideas.</p>
              <p>If you realise for one, that these are just actors and actresses in life, and after the film stops rolling, everybody turns off the cameras and lights and goes into the editting room where they remove the pimples from their faces, and do scene cutting.. then.. there u got it.</p>
              <p>This is production of the evil-est genre. Yet, when there is demand, there is supply.</p>
              <p>Or like what my best friend did for me to coax me out of my very own addiction, it is not what you do or do not do that is the problem, it is what I do or do not do that is my problem.</p>
              <p>Sure, they are actors, and they dirty the world with their semen and moans, but I have a choice! The REAL problem is when you somehow believe that you have no choice. This is the problem.</p>
              <p>Or so I thought.</p>

              <p>Hmmm...</p>
              <p>It's just that, I want to move on to the next phase in life. I've been stuck in this phase for too long a period of time for me to be comfortable in.</p>
              <p>I want to spend more time on my hobbies and taking care of those around me instead of burning my time away in front of the com and wasting my health, time, friendships.</p>
              <p>I woke up and realize, there's a much bigger world out there than watching porn and PCC-ing. After all, it's a video, it's not real, the only thing that excites you is your own brain stimulating the hormones as if its real.</p>
              <p>Truth is, in reality, it might be harder to get an orgasm, but the rewards, the experience of getting it, the memories you actually personally have, will last with you forever, instead of a porno video.</p>
              <p>In the short term, I experience the high-ness from porn, but in the long run, I felt nothing but emptiness.</p>
              <p>From now on, if I am going to experience an orgasm, it'll be from real sex and all those kinky stuffs you watch on porn. It'll be an actual experience instead of your own mind stimulating your hormones while watching porn.</p>
              <p>I rather regret the things I do than regret the things I've never done.</p>

              <p>I have a confession to make.</p>
              <p>I literally destroyed half of my life, in fact, more than that due to a porn addiction. I threw away friendships, scared away most of my lady friends, didn't have much group outing experiences, emo-ed most of the time, skipped on work duties, late for important things, and much, much more.</p>
              <p>Porn destroyed my morals and the true concept of reality. When I finally got my first girlfriend, I thought I could move on with the power of love. But I had such an over-idealistic thought of relying on her that whenever she did not give me her time I'd drop back into porn. I couldn't confide in guyfriends because if they shared it out with those in my clique, i'm a gonner. I couldn't confide in my galfriends because they would think I'm digusting. I tried sharing it with my family, and it was bad, internal gossip and my female cousins staying away from me was the conclusion. I could not rely on anyone.</p>
              <p>I realize today, right now, that, <strong>IF I DON'T RELY ON MYSELF TO GET OUT OF THIS SHIT HOLE, I WILL NEVER EVER GET OUT OF THIS PORN ADDICTION.</strong></p>
              <p>From now till June, when I move on to another step of my life, I will update this thread on my progess.</p>
              <p>I promise myself, that each day I managed to avoid watching porn, I will reward myself with a delicious drink, like a dark mocha ice blended at Starbucks, or Black Forest @ Coffee Bean, or even a strong brew @ TCC. Yes, I'm going to turn into a caffeine addict, BUT, it's still a much better addiction than PORN, which will continually ruin my life if I CONTINUE ON THIS WAY.</p>
              <p>I need your support. I need your encouragement. I need your motivation. Please. Help me get through this phase of life with your kind words. Thanks.</p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>

              <p>Eh dude, got advice for you lar.  Better porn and pcc than STDs through casual sex.  Its much harder to die from pcc-ing than AIDs. </p>
              <p>Of course, best that you get a girlfriend / wife that enjoys bedroom sports as much as you do.  That way, the safest.  </p>
