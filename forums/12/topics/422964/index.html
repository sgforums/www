              <p>I have a confession to make.</p>
              <p>I literally destroyed half of my life, in fact, more than that due to a porn addiction. I threw away friendships, scared away most of my lady friends, didn't have much group outing experiences, emo-ed most of the time, skipped on work duties, late for important things, and much, much more.</p>
              <p>Porn destroyed my morals and the true concept of reality. When I finally got my first girlfriend, I thought I could move on with the power of love. But I had such an over-idealistic thought of relying on her that whenever she did not give me her time I'd drop back into porn. I couldn't confide in guyfriends because if they shared it out with those in my clique, i'm a gonner. I couldn't confide in my galfriends because they would think I'm digusting. I tried sharing it with my family, and it was bad, internal gossip and my female cousins staying away from me was the conclusion. I could not rely on anyone.</p>
              <p>I realize today, right now, that, <strong>IF I DON'T RELY ON MYSELF TO GET OUT OF THIS SHIT HOLE, I WILL NEVER EVER GET OUT OF THIS PORN ADDICTION.</strong></p>
              <p>From now till June, when I move on to another step of my life, I will update this thread on my progess.</p>
              <p>I promise myself, that each day I managed to avoid watching porn, I will reward myself with a delicious drink, like a dark mocha ice blended at Starbucks, or Black Forest @ Coffee Bean, or even a strong brew @ TCC. Yes, I'm going to turn into a caffeine addict, BUT, it's still a much better addiction than PORN, which will continually ruin my life if I CONTINUE ON THIS WAY.</p>
              <p>I need your support. I need your encouragement. I need your motivation. Please. Help me get through this phase of life with your kind words. Thanks.</p>

              <p>as a former psychology student, my advice is dun take it so hard on yourself, bet you are not the only one addicted, that should calm you now. There is a term call reverse addiction whereby one tried so hard and fast to get rid of his/her addiction and in reverse he/she gets more deep into the addiction. And that can be more worse.</p>
              <p>My suggestion is take it easy, first and foremost, you need some activity to divert your habit or addiction, like former drug addicts, they play street soccers, particpant in charity movement, be a volunteer in community work and so on, it divert their former bad habit and yet bring them back to the society, making themselve from being a lousy person to a person the world needed.</p>

We all graduated and neva see each other. One day, I see him walking by the alley, holding hand wif another guy. Haiz, better watching porn than turn gay gay.</p>

              <p>I have a confession to make.</p>
              <p>I literally destroyed half of my life, in fact, more than that
              due to a porn addiction. I threw away friendships, scared away most
              of my lady friends, didn't have much group outing experiences,
              emo-ed most of the time, skipped on work duties, late for important
              things, and much, much more.</p>
              <p>Porn destroyed my morals and the true concept of reality. When I
              finally got my first girlfriend, I thought I could move on with the
              power of love. But I had such an over-idealistic thought of relying
              on her that whenever she did not give me her time I'd drop back
              into porn. I couldn't confide in guyfriends because if they shared
              it out with those in my clique, i'm a gonner. I couldn't confide in
              my galfriends because they would think I'm digusting. I tried
              sharing it with my family, and it was bad, internal gossip and my
              female cousins staying away from me was the conclusion. I could not
              rely on anyone.</p>
              <p>I realize today, right now, that, <strong>IF I DON'T RELY ON
              MYSELF TO GET OUT OF THIS SHIT HOLE, I WILL NEVER EVER GET OUT OF
              THIS PORN ADDICTION.</strong></p>
              <p>From now till June, when I move on to another step of my life, I
              will update this thread on my progess.</p>
              <p>I promise myself, that each day I managed to avoid watching
              porn, I will reward myself with a delicious drink, like a dark
              mocha ice blended at Starbucks, or Black Forest @ Coffee Bean, or
              even a strong brew @ TCC. Yes, I'm going to turn into a caffeine
              addict, BUT, it's still a much better addiction than PORN, which
              will continually ruin my life if I CONTINUE ON THIS WAY.</p>
              <p>I need your support. I need your encouragement. I need your
              motivation. Please. Help me get through this phase of life with
              your kind words. Thanks.</p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>
              <p>Ockz</p>

              <p>Hmmm...</p>
              <p>It's just that, I want to move on to the next phase in life. I've been stuck in this phase for too long a period of time for me to be comfortable in.</p>
              <p>I want to spend more time on my hobbies and taking care of those around me instead of burning my time away in front of the com and wasting my health, time, friendships.</p>
              <p>I woke up and realize, there's a much bigger world out there than watching porn and PCC-ing. After all, it's a video, it's not real, the only thing that excites you is your own brain stimulating the hormones as if its real.</p>
              <p>Truth is, in reality, it might be harder to get an orgasm, but the rewards, the experience of getting it, the memories you actually personally have, will last with you forever, instead of a porno video.</p>
              <p>In the short term, I experience the high-ness from porn, but in the long run, I felt nothing but emptiness.</p>
              <p>From now on, if I am going to experience an orgasm, it'll be from real sex and all those kinky stuffs you watch on porn. It'll be an actual experience instead of your own mind stimulating your hormones while watching porn.</p>
              <p>I rather regret the things I do than regret the things I've never done.</p>
              <p>Okay, time for a great sip of coffee!</p>
              <p>CAFFEINE OVER PORN! CAFFEINE OVER PORN! GO GO GO!</p>
