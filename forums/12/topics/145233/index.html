I guess is tough her to wait for me before i go in army and out of army last time, and now im upgrading myself, and she is waiting too.</div></blockquote>Just hang in there if you can, but if I were you I wont have too much hope for this relationship. The last 5 years that you have been through with her will be very different from the next 5 years. Be prepared!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am sorry to say that money is a major factor. Most of the girls use the number of present or money you lavish on them to measure the level of love you have for them. They may not mind when they are young but when they grow older, they will realise money is very important. Love may died but money that put into the bank will never disappear unless she spend it.</div>
