              <p>Your friend already told you to leave it alone but you still want to KAYPO!</p>
              <p>There's more than enough evidence above to demonstrate a clear pattern that he doesn't want to talk to you, but you want to go and disturb him.  Now you want to claim he approached you for help? </p>
              <p>I ask again, are you stupid or what?  if you want to lie, do it properly.  With all the evidence in this thread, you must have rocks in your head to believe you can get away with something so obvious.</p>
              <p>Here's a tip: if you want to lie, don't spread your legs so wide and hang an "OPEN 24 HOURS" sign on your arse. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Gendanken: I am impressed because you actually read through all my posting. But did I accurately write what I intend to write? Many things have happened and it is not written down. Personally, I dont think it is conclusive to place a judgement.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Thanks for you help. I already got an answer from my other friends.</p>

                                      advice is for me to leave him alone and best to stay far from him
                                      especially when not show signs that he wants to befriend a
                                      person. Even if he wants to befriend a person, it is best to stay
                                      far away. These people are very dangerous
                                      and especially when they are smart too. One
                                      would never predict what, how, when he would misbehave.
                                      Just be wary of such people and she herself may not have full
                                      confidence in handling them. Dangerous.  </span></p>
              <p><span>Psychological disorder can be genetic and/or nurtured, a
                                      complex composition of both. If it is genetic then there is really
                                      no complete cure, other than drugs. No hope.</span></p>
              <p><span>Friends cannot be made long term with them. Trust cannot
                                      be given because one would never knew...</span></p>
              <p><span>After talking to her, my face turn white.</span></p>
              <p><span>I really want to sequence his genome, but I should just be
                                      wary of him now.</span></p>

              <p>I'm curious about what kind of psychologist your friend
                                      is.  I'm a registered psychologist, and professionally I would
                                      certainly never have told you what she did.</p>
              <p>I'll give the benefit of the doubt here - it's possible that she
                                      said something entirely different and that you've reported what you
                                      think you heard.</p>
              <p>You want to sequence his genome?!  After all that talk
                                      about you wanting to save him from being an outcast, you're looking
                                      at him as a specimen under a microscope?  Just who the hell do
                                      you think you are?</p>
              <p>Bugger violent criminal tendencies - I'm a law-abiding fellow
                                      and I'd love to kick seven shades of shit out of you.</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>I
              agree with you. That friend of lokey's is likely a freshie with little
              or no first hand clinical experience and is just applying her own
              stereotypes.</p>
              <p>I was also a Psy major by the way but I am not
              practicing coz I ended up deciding on a career in translation and
              publishing of books and media instead. If close association and
              proximity is anything to go by according to lokey's standards, I am
              also a Prison Counsellor with access to every prison institution in
              Singapore except Changi Women's Prison (no male counsellors there
              except for very special cases).</p>
              <p>To lokey:</p>
              <p>These guys are just like any
              one of us. You don't have to look at them in a different light at all
              just because they had an so called "atypical" past. Forget the friggin
              yellow ribbon crap, HE IS NOT DIFFERENT. Just deal with him as you
              would with any other person. For every member of society who is
              unwilling to grant them a fresh lease of life, there are plenty more
              who are more than willing to go the extra mile with them. More often
              than not, it is not a matter of "You" accepting "Them" as if they
              desperately need you, but letting nature take its course and allowing
              them to reintegrate without smoldering them. Dear lokey, thank you for
              your messiah complex style obssesion but the key to the second prison
              is really in his own hands, not yours...</p>
              <p>About the expert opinion that your psychologist friend tried to impress upon you about "such people" maiming your life and walking out on friendships, I can tell you from a first person perspective that some of my closest and longest standing friendships are with these people, and we are like brothers. Of the people who left me in the lurch or betrayed my friendship in the course of my life, I must say, sadly, that none are from such a background and all were intelligent and capable people like yourself. Of course, I do not deny the fact that there exists some individuals among gangsters / ex-convicts who will sell you out if the price is right, but who is to say we ourselves are any better? Such despicable persons can be found at any rung of society and it is definitely unfair to slap the label exclusively on them.</p>
              <p>Oh by the way, if tattoos make a person a gangster, then I will probably be a gangster in your eyes, too, if you ever saw me.</p>
              <p>Take off your coloured lenses please. I'm not homophobic (many of my friends are "alternative" but that doesn't make them any less worthy, mind you...) but you really give me the feeling you are not straight as you say. Going by the way you wrote,  it almost seems as if you are on the prowl for a BF and got attracted to this person's tattoos, background, behaviour whatever blah blah, and wants to snag him but yet is held back by your Scelerophobic inhibitions.</p>

              <p>Anyway, Mr lokey Sykologeest Wannbii, ADHD symptomes are not compatible with clinical depression and typically do not manifest simultaneously in a single subject, and I seriously do not think any psychiatrist would diagnose a person with bipolar disorder AND depression at the same time coz it's a rep. Do you even know the acronyms you are throwing about like shurikens?</p>
              <p>Considering the way you followed through with this juicy but pointless conversation you probably have 1, developed the coping mechanism for ADHD or 2, you were misdiagnosed as a kid, or 3, you have a very interesting instance of a delusional mental state in which you attempt to identify with a target group of people afflicted with an ailment, which until today is still a cause for debate and controversy amongst health professionals as its existence cannot be established. I can recommend some excellent psychiatrists for you if you want.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">First. I don't treat that gangster friend of mine as a gangster or ex-gangster anymore. A friend is a friend. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Both friends (ex-gangster or psychologist ) have mentioned that gangsters can be dangerous and violent, armed with knifes. And I was told to be careful dealing with them.  He say it himself and mentioned he is sort of the better one. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Gangster tattoo is different from artistic tattoo. I can see their differences. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Sad to say, his tattoo is a typical gangster tattoo, all messy with no theme. Like rojak. I ask him to put on more clothing when out in the public and also to remove some away. LOL. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The fact I dont ask about his past much, especially about the gangster's life. All the questions that I ask him was to check if he is dangerous to be with. The end conclusion is that he is fine.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">His behaviour, quite ok to me. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Why the concern? My friend's mind is pretty messy. </span><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">He is very fragile. I really in fear that he would commit suicide, if his girlfriend left him or his parent pass away, or I have say something wrong what make him upset. </span></p>
              <p>And I am quite vexed on how to help him on this aspect. </p>

              <p>"Very egoistic and weird guy. Do you have any friends at all?"</p>
              <p>lokey, are you talking about yourself?</p>
              <p>Anyway, Mr lokey Sykologeest Wannbii, ADHD symptomes are not compatible with clinical depression and typically do not manifest simultaneously in a single subject, and I seriously do not think any psychiatrist would diagnose a person with bipolar disorder AND depression at the same time coz it's a rep. Do you even know the acronyms you are throwing about like shurikens?</p>
              <p>Considering the way you followed through with this juicy but pointless conversation you probably have 1, developed the coping mechanism for ADHD or 2, you were misdiagnosed as a kid, or 3, you have a very interesting instance of a delusional mental state in which you attempt to identify with a target group of people afflicted with an ailment, which until today is still a cause for debate and controversy amongst health professionals as its existence cannot be established. I can recommend some excellent psychiatrists for you if you want.</p>
