              <p>ok. If "society outcast" is inappropriate then what is a better
              term to use. To me, society outcast just means people who do not
              follow the norms of the society.</p>
              <p>Wrong, I think people is just people, some of my friends are
              already dead at 16, 27 so what is there to say?</p>
              <p>One of them is in Changi Prison, I just feel that I can do so
              much more before another of them do something wrong again. I really
              don't know, these people are out of logic. By the time the police
              catch them, even the best lawyer is useless.</p>
              <p>I never say that they cannot contribute to society. If there is
              a communication problem then how does people approach them. How to
              even interact with them in the very first place</p>

              <p>Start with respect. I do not know how you found out he is
              an ex-ganster and had  up to sec 2 education. do not see him
              that way. treat him like another mate, a fellow guy who shares the
              same interest, i.e. going to the gym. there is no need to dumb down
              your speech with him. you might just have to speak a bit slower if
              you tends to rattle on a little. if you sense his vocabulary is
              limited, use common words that he could understand. there is no
              need to talk to him like a child. he might not be as well educated
              as you are, but he has life experiences that you probably never
              had.</p>
              <p>be genuine. be honest. if you do not understand what he is
              trying to express or certain terms he uses, ask him to clarify
              for  you. most people do not take offence if they can sense
              you are sincerely trying to communicate rather than mocking their
              command of the language. by doing this, he is likely to feel more
              comfortable to clarify with  you if he doesn't understand
              any words you use.</p>

              <p>it's interesting you want to start a friendship with an ex

              <p> My first impression of him was actually "bad"... (someone with overwhelming tattoo and ... hummm)  punch me if you want. Yes I was bias. 
              
              </p><p> Then one encounter, I left my gym locker keys somewhere and somehow he return the keys to me. So therefore he is not so bad after all. I tried to communicate with him loh. 
              
              </p><p> I prompt him some question he reply so eventually I get to know him better. First time talking to such people in my life.</p>

              <p>1) Assume that you're dumb<br>2) As an extension of 1), approach your interactions with people with the view that you're there to learn things from them<br>3) As an extension of 2), shut up and listen - if you're too busy talking you won't be able to learn anything<br>4) Also as an extension of 2), understand that they are the ones doing you a favour by providing you with their company, not the other way round.</p>

              <p>1. He is not dumb. You are not smart. that's just you hallucinating</p>
              <p>2. Having tatoos doesn't mean he did gangs.</p>
              <p>3. He may not like to speak in perfect english. That doesn't mean he has low education level. Even if his education level is low, that doesn't mean he is dumb.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seen plenty of such people in the army. They are the same as any other people, except they may be more crude in their actions and words.</p>

              <p>my cell member's kids are in gangs. still in gangs. one of my platoon mates is a gangster too.</p>
              <p>in my opinion, they are friendly in a superficial manner.</p>
              <p>when you try to talk about serious stuff with them, like their future, etc, they tend to zone out, nothing really goes in, although they said "Yes yes. understand" then they'll try to switch topic to something else.</p>
              <p>they pretty much live for the moment, they can be impulsive. and they love talking about fights and drugs.</p>
              <p>in the face of jail time, they pretty much resigned themselves to it, justifying it as "before i walk this path, i already know either i die, or i go jail, but i choose this path, so i won't regret".</p>
              <p>they don't really regret their actions, not until they realise they have wasted their lives, usually they just deny or try to distract themselves from thoughts of regret.</p>

              platoon mates is a gangster too.</p>
              <p>in my opinion, they are friendly in a superficial manner.</p>
              <p>when you try to talk about serious stuff with them, like their
              future, etc, they tend to zone out, nothing really goes in,
              although they said "Yes yes. understand" then they'll try to switch
              topic to something else.</p>
              <p>they pretty much live for the moment, they can be impulsive. and
              they love talking about fights and drugs.</p>
              <p>in the face of jail time, they pretty much resigned themselves
              to it, justifying it as "before i walk this path, i already know
              either i die, or i go jail, but i choose this path, so i won't
              regret".</p>
              <p>they don't really regret their actions, not until they realise
              they have wasted their lives, usually they just deny or try to
              distract themselves from thoughts of regret.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>summary: they are fun, if you want someone to accompany u for a
              drink, but long lasting friendship is hard.</p>

              <p>Somehow I understand from him, that their thinking is quite different from me/us. 
              
              </p><p>I/we can think in long term aspect in projection to 10, 20, 30.. 50 years down the road. But their thinking is only limited to now. Got money means ok already. 
              
              </p><p>He cannot postulate that when his son grew up what would his son think of him. I predict that it would be very sad, for this son to be like him or condemn him. 
              
              </p><p>I think he is still young so even if he do private O level he can get up to poly and uni and reach the same status as I am at 27. I don't understand why he just condemned himself as "I cannot make it one/ I cannot study one". I don't understand why he cannot see that after going through some education would break his earning limits so that can earn more money comparing to doing hard labor. I don't understand without O level, even he want to sign on army also cannot be done. I don't understand that his family belongs to middle income so funding is not an issue. I respect his view but I just don't understand him. 
              
              </p><p>I actually conclude that these people don't have logical thinking or some kind of thinking skills. The problem is I don't think he is dumb at all.   
              
              </p><p> Somehow I believe that he has some aspect and view of life which I am kin to know. Somehow I suspect he is actually trading option at night and earning big money. lol. He is somebody special that why I can more curious to know him. He has certain aspect and he is not as simple as "ex-gangster" that is on the surface. 
              
              </p><p> I don't actually treat him more superior than me somehow he know something I don't know. And interested to know more.</p>

              <p>Hi all,<br> 1. Ignore him completely because he is a low-level creature not
              worth the effort --&gt; I was thinking that why the yellow project
              failed because the society treat ex-criminal as outcast. Should I
              follow the crowd?<br> <br> 2. Give him more time as these people are slow so to know him well,
              give him more time. How long do these people take to know each
              other to get to friend level? I only take a few ecounter I can
              treat him as a friend. But he humm.<br> <br> 3. Try to accommodate him as his language dictionary are limited
              --&gt; so his speech is limited things therefore I don’t understand
              him but our communication already break down.<br> <br> I think he is someone worthy to know or befriend with so how I

              <p>Is there a book called "how to communicate with society outcast

              day for the sake of being polite either.</p>
              <p>so ya, get off your moral high horses la.</p>
              <p>TS is just being honest about how he feel, which is more than i
              can say for the rest of us</p>

              <p>There's no moral high horse to get off.  This guy's wading in here claiming that people fear and admire him when all he's done is get on their bad side, and then God knows who he's trying to impress with this Mother-Theresa-blessing-the-poor-wretches-with-her-divine-presence routine.</p>
              <p>Maybe he's being honest about how he feels, but he sure as hell ain't being honest with himself about what he sees - people are just avoiding him and for good reason, but he reads it as their fear of him.  I honestly don't know whether to laugh or puke.</p>

              <p>Somehow I understand from him, that their thinking is quite different from me/us.</p>
              <p>I/we can think in long term aspect in projection to 10, 20, 30.. 50 years down the road. But their thinking is only limited to now. Got money means ok already.</p>
              <p>He cannot postulate that when his son grew up what would his son think of him. I predict that it would be very sad, for this son to be like him or condemn him.</p>
              <p>I think he is still young so even if he do private O level he can get up to poly and uni and reach the same status as I am at 27. I don't understand why he just condemned himself as "I cannot make it one/ I cannot study one". I don't understand why he cannot see that after going through some education would break his earning limits so that can earn more money comparing to doing hard labor. I don't understand without O level, even he want to sign on army also cannot be done. I don't understand that his family belongs to middle income so funding is not an issue. I respect his view but I just don't understand him.</p>
              <p>I actually conclude that these people don't have logical thinking or some kind of thinking skills. The problem is I don't think he is dumb at all.</p>
              <p>Somehow I believe that he has some aspect and view of life which I am kin to know. Somehow I suspect he is actually trading option at night and earning big money. lol. He is somebody special that why I can more curious to know him. He has certain aspect and he is not as simple as "ex-gangster" that is on the surface.</p>
              <p>I don't actually treat him more superior than me somehow he know something I don't know. And interested to know more.</p>

              <p>A human being doesnt even understand ownself 100%, on wat grounds does one expect to understand others?</p>
              <p>I, for one, was being categorised &amp; condemned.  I hated it &amp; still do.  Therefore, I play my part not to do the same to others.  Mayb u really do not hav the intention, but ur usage of words disturbed me greatly.  If u sincerely wanna be fren to someone, stop being a saint, bcos not all wanna be helped.  They may jus want a listenin ear or simply, a presence.</p>
              <p>U are able to describe him..i wonder why do u say there's communication breakdown then??  Or are those things abt him are purely ur assumptions? </p>
              <p>Try doin tis instead: Treat all as a storybook, for everyone has their own life story.  Slowly digest &amp; turn the pages carefully, their story will reveal.  Do not judge them by their cover.  Get it? </p>

              <p>Another thing,  if u decided tat u hav no interest in their story, it's perfectly ok to put it down.  Do not force urself to read on, it's an insult to the author.  Leave it as it is for others who appreciates.</p>
