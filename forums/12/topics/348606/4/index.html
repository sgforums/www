              <p>just an update. <br><br>Personally I think my friend looks ok but I certainly hope so.<br><br>Anyway for people who dont understand and dont know what I am talking about. <br><br>Normally people who joined gang have conduct disorder, CS (before 15) <br>and after 18 years old if he still have difficulites in compliance with society order then he will have Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). <br><br>refer to: http://www.alliance1.org/home/neuroscience_full06.pdf<br>refer to: http://www.blisstree.com/geneticsandhealth/maoa-gene-linked-to-violent-behavior/<br><br>MAOA Gene Linked To Violent Behavior <br><br>"The researchers found that high levels of antisocial behavior were<br>strongly correlated with a combination of low levels of MAOA and<br>severe maltreatment. Some 85% of subjects with both risk factors<br>ended up displaying antisocial behavior. People with high levels of<br>MAOA were far less likely to turn out this way. On its own, however,<br>the low-MOAA allele does not automatically lead to antisocial<br>behavior. In fact, people with the low MAOA allele who experienced<br>no maltreatment as children were no more likely to become<br>antisocial than those with a high MAOA allele." <br><br>refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAOA<br><br>What is MAOA? Monoamine oxidase A. In layman terms, the gene that shut down neurons --&gt;neurotransmitter (norepinephrine (noradrenaline), epinephrine (adrenaline), serotonin, and dopamine). This is also the same enzyme that is used to degrade drugs in the liver. <br><br><em>Common Sense, right! If someone who is "normal" , he will become violent with no apparent/little reason , defiance and does not listen.</em><br><br>So yes. Genetic gangster.</p>

              <p>Hi all,<br><br>I recently encounter a new guy at gym who is an ex-gangster and only sec 2 educated? I find it very hard to communicate with him? In fact our communication went so bad that there was a breakdown. I am quite vexed as I first time encountered such a problem. Any solutions from the masses?<br><br>Some of my thoughts<br><br>1. Ignore him completely because he is a low-level creature not worth the effort --&gt; I was thinking that why the yellow project failed because the society treat ex-criminal as outcast. Should I follow the crowd?<br><br>2. Give him more time as these people are slow so to know him well, give him more time. How long do these people take to know each other to get to friend level? I only take a few ecounter I can treat him as a friend. But he humm.<br><br>3. Try to accommodate him as his language dictionary are limited --&gt; so his speech is limited things therefore I don’t understand him but our communication already break down.<br><br>I think he is someone worthy to know or befriend with so how I should solve this problem. Any ingenious idea?  Thank you.</p>

              <p>There is an update. I misunderstood him, <strong>He was not an EX-gangster but a gangster.</strong> 369. A gangster or mobster, meaning a criminal who is a member of a crime organization. This guy can go on on gang fight, injurying others without feeling
              remorse. Stealing, Selling drugs, illegal cigrattes without feeling
              guilty. To him just like brushing teeth and eating meal.</p>
              <p>This guy is already 19. So he has Antisocial personality
                                      disorder (ASPD). In layman terms, character of a person who perform illegal act, without feeling guilty and against social norms. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fully understand why I cannot communicate with him. A SHEEP telling a WOLF not eat ME but eat grass. LOL. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>His IQ got no problem. He was a Sec 2 EXPRESS student. Communication as in conversation was not the problem. This guy kept on lying, here and there, hiding the truth. Therefore
              things he said was not coherent. So I was confused by what he say.
              Therefore cannot compile the things together to piece up a story.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know that the 3 dots on hand is 369. The funny jap word is 369 logo.</p>
              <p>Any1 know that does a question mark "?" and a single dot means?</p>
              <p>He has 6 - 9 fishes (KOI) on his body --&gt; Meaning?</p>
              <p><strong>Should I condemned him? Is there any hope in him?  </strong></p>

              <p>Oh, I see!  So the medical profession is the world's biggest scam, is that it?  After all, why pay someone to diagnose and treat you when your flu diagnosis trumps what they've learned through years of training at universities and hospitals? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Of course you don't need a medical licence to see that someone has a cough.  The problem is that you've just shown that you can't tell the difference between an illness and a symptom, and that display of utter and complete ignorance perfectly illustrates why you need to leave it to the pros instead of trying to pass yourself off as someone who knows something.  Are you going to use your medical expertise to point to your friend's mole and declare that he's got skin cancer?  No?  Why not?  After all, you don't need a medical licenceto to tell him that he's got a mole, do you?</p>
              <p>This leads perfectly into your bringing up the DSM.  If you think that just looking at that one tiny section of the DSM proves your point, to the extent that you don't feel that you have to "spell out everything", you obviously have no clue about how the DSM was designed and how it works.  I said it before, I'll say it again - leave it to the pros.</p>
              <p>What do you mean I haven't said anything constructive?  I've already pointed out how your running off half-cocked is about as useful as rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic, and I've already given you the most constructive piece of advice possible: ABANDON THE FUCKING SHIP!</p>
              <p>You really are pathetic, taking little bits and pieces from random selections off Google searches and trying to make yourself sound like you know what you're talking about, to the laughable extent that you're sending out invitations for research partnerships.  It's obvious that you have no concept of how stupid you sound, but that's your own problem - why visit your misery on this poor fellow who's done nothing more than turn up at the same gym as you?</p>

              <p>What makes you so sure ppl b4 15 join gang is 100% got CS?<br>*Join gang does not mean hv to go round fighting or creating havoc or public enemy,it can be for friendship or other reason like protection in sch?(jus that he choose to enter gang for friend or he LL got force in) * Join gang also can make money or to get certain jobs for some special ppl..Or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>you have only seen</strong></span> those that join gang will only fight ?</p>
              <p>Ppl after 18 is 100% got genetic ASPD? lol...<br>Selling drugs,stealing without feeling remorseful...Different ppl hv diff mindset, some might steal because really no money,when he got money he wun go hungry.(It might become a cycle for him so he might not feel remorseful as long as he dun go hungry &amp; dun get caught&gt;sell illiger cigarettes or drugs).</p>
              <p>It could be you came for a well to do family,study alot,hv many knowledge in books, but it might just be you lack of certain life experiance of what others go through which made you have this thoughts?<br><br>And i dun understand is why are you so concern about him?Why would you want to condamm him?You dispise him?Or you want to help him to become a better person?</p>
              <p>EDITED:I also wonder how u know he is never remorseful after injuring others?You are him? If no, how are u able to know what he is thinking at the point in time when he is ..say taking a brick hitting a guy's head?or he tel you he never felt guilty?If he happen to tel you that, what make you so sure that he is telling the truth?Mayb he guilty but just dun wan to let you know to save face? If you also dunno what he is thinking or understand him, how come you can type to say he will not be guilty?</p>
              <p>If given an eg: Your gf say she is at home, you wanted to gv her a surprise be appearing at her door,you buy supper to her home,then found out there is a guy hiding under the bed naked. What's your 1st reaction? <br>Run home? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">because you know you might be guilty if you hurt him?<br></span>Hit him?<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Will you feel guilty after hitting him &amp; say sorry to him? or not feeling guilty as he made you angry?</span></p>
              <p>i'm really curious to know your answer: <br><br>Is it due to case to case basis thus you will not feel guilty/not guilty? If it can applied to you, it MIGHT also be able to be applied on your friend :) thus how is it that you say he never feel guilty?</p>

              <p>Actually, I was wrong to say that I dont understand him NOW. If I can predict and project his behavior and actions. And this is really the part that make me worried about him. I should just trust instinct instead of logic for him.</p>

              <p>Oh, I see!  So the medical profession is the world's biggest scam, is that it?  After all, why pay someone to diagnose and treat you when your flu diagnosis trumps what they've learned through years of training at universities and hospitals? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Of course you don't need a medical licence to see that someone has a cough.  The problem is that you've just shown that you can't tell the difference between an illness and a symptom, and that display of utter and complete ignorance perfectly illustrates why you need to leave it to the pros instead of trying to pass yourself off as someone who knows something.  Are you going to use your medical expertise to point to your friend's mole and declare that he's got skin cancer?  No?  Why not?  After all, you don't need a medical licenceto to tell him that he's got a mole, do you?</p>
              <p>This leads perfectly into your bringing up the DSM.  If you think that just looking at that one tiny section of the DSM proves your point, to the extent that you don't feel that you have to "spell out everything", you obviously have no clue about how the DSM was designed and how it works.  I said it before, I'll say it again - leave it to the pros.</p>
              <p>What do you mean I haven't said anything constructive?  I've already pointed out how your running off half-cocked is about as useful as rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic, and I've already given you the most constructive piece of advice possible: ABANDON THE FUCKING SHIP!</p>
              <p>You really are pathetic, taking little bits and pieces from random selections off Google searches and trying to make yourself sound like you know what you're talking about, to the laughable extent that you're sending out invitations for research partnerships.  It's obvious that you have no concept of how stupid you sound, but that's your own problem - why visit your misery on this poor fellow who's done nothing more than turn up at the same gym as you?</p>

              <p>Ok, perhaps I am being too opinated. I should just ask him directly, after all he was seeing a SAF psychologist anyway.</p>
              <p> Last part I dont agree. "Understanding is very important to avoid suspicion!" I cannot condemned a person and chase him away from the gym, that is not being fair to him. Noted, a gangster is a criminal.</p>

              <p>There is an update. I misunderstood him, <strong>He was not an EX-gangster but a gangster.</strong> 369. A gangster or mobster, meaning a criminal who is a member of a crime organization. This guy can go on on gang fight, injurying others without feeling remorse. Stealing, Selling drugs, illegal cigrattes without feeling guilty. To him just like brushing teeth and eating meal.</p>
              <p>This guy is already 19. So he has Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD). In layman terms, character of a person who perform illegal act, without feeling guilty and against social norms. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Fully understand why I cannot communicate with him. A SHEEP telling a WOLF not eat ME but eat grass. LOL. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p>His IQ got no problem. He was a Sec 2 EXPRESS student. Communication as in conversation was not the problem. This guy kept on lying, here and there, hiding the truth. Therefore things he said was not coherent. So I was confused by what he say. Therefore cannot compile the things together to piece up a story.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know that the 3 dots on hand is 369. The funny jap word is 369 logo.</p>
              <p>Any1 know that does a question mark "?" and a single dot means?</p>
              <p>He has 6 - 9 fishes (KOI) on his body --&gt; Meaning?</p>
              <p><strong>Should I condemned him? Is there any hope in him? </strong></p>
