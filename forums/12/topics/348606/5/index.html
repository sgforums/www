              <p>Oh, I see!  So the medical profession is the world's biggest scam, is that it?  After all, why pay someone to diagnose and treat you when your flu diagnosis trumps what they've learned through years of training at universities and hospitals? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Of course you don't need a medical licence to see that someone has a cough.  The problem is that you've just shown that you can't tell the difference between an illness and a symptom, and that display of utter and complete ignorance perfectly illustrates why you need to leave it to the pros instead of trying to pass yourself off as someone who knows something.  Are you going to use your medical expertise to point to your friend's mole and declare that he's got skin cancer?  No?  Why not?  After all, you don't need a medical licenceto to tell him that he's got a mole, do you?</p>
              <p>This leads perfectly into your bringing up the DSM.  If you think that just looking at that one tiny section of the DSM proves your point, to the extent that you don't feel that you have to "spell out everything", you obviously have no clue about how the DSM was designed and how it works.  I said it before, I'll say it again - leave it to the pros.</p>
              <p>What do you mean I haven't said anything constructive?  I've already pointed out how your running off half-cocked is about as useful as rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic, and I've already given you the most constructive piece of advice possible: ABANDON THE FUCKING SHIP!</p>
              <p>You really are pathetic, taking little bits and pieces from random selections off Google searches and trying to make yourself sound like you know what you're talking about, to the laughable extent that you're sending out invitations for research partnerships.  It's obvious that you have no concept of how stupid you sound, but that's your own problem - why visit your misery on this poor fellow who's done nothing more than turn up at the same gym as you?</p>

              <p>What makes you so sure ppl b4 15 join gang is 100% got CS?<br>*Join gang does not mean hv to go round fighting or creating havoc or public enemy,it can be for friendship or other reason like protection in sch?(jus that he choose to enter gang for friend or he LL got force in) * Join gang also can make money or to get certain jobs for some special ppl..Or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>you have only seen</strong></span> those that join gang will only fight ?</p>
              <p>Ppl after 18 is 100% got genetic ASPD? lol...<br>Selling drugs,stealing without feeling remorseful...Different ppl hv diff mindset, some might steal because really no money,when he got money he wun go hungry.(It might become a cycle for him so he might not feel remorseful as long as he dun go hungry &amp; dun get caught&gt;sell illiger cigarettes or drugs).</p>
              <p>It could be you came for a well to do family,study alot,hv many knowledge in books, but it might just be you lack of certain life experiance of what others go through which made you have this thoughts?<br><br>And i dun understand is why are you so concern about him?Why would you want to condamm him?You dispise him?Or you want to help him to become a better person?</p>
              <p>EDITED:I also wonder how u know he is never remorseful after injuring others?You are him? If no, how are u able to know what he is thinking at the point in time when he is ..say taking a brick hitting a guy's head?or he tel you he never felt guilty?If he happen to tel you that, what make you so sure that he is telling the truth?Mayb he guilty but just dun wan to let you know to save face? If you also dunno what he is thinking or understand him, how come you can type to say he will not be guilty?</p>
              <p>If given an eg: Your gf say she is at home, you wanted to gv her a surprise be appearing at her door,you buy supper to her home,then found out there is a guy hiding under the bed naked. What's your 1st reaction?<br>Run home? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">because you know you might be guilty if you hurt him?<br></span>Hit him?<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Will you feel guilty after hitting him &amp; say sorry to him? or not feeling guilty as he made you angry?</span></p>
              <p>i'm really curious to know your answer:<br><br>Is it due to case to case basis thus you will not feel guilty/not guilty? If it can applied to you, it MIGHT also be able to be applied on your friend :) thus how is it that you say he never feel guilty?</p>

              <p>TS if u cannot be real friend with him, then just leave him alone. If u need to agonize over how to communicate and understand him better then u are operating at a different frequency from him, he is from another world, if u two cannot get along then u should move on. If you truthfully feel he is a worthy friend, then u should learn how to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">embrace diversity</span>. If you always think you are better than him, and u always think he is lousy, u actually will make him feel even worse being around with you.</p>
              <p>The way u talk here let me feel you are quite an arrogant person, attention seeking, likes to show off your superiority in order to boost your ego further, pretentious and likes to judge people, label them and think u are always right.</p>

              <p><a href="http://sgforums.com/users/240707">faith07</a>: humm, I think you lost track. The tropic has changed.</p>
              <p>This guy was quite different from the "normal" gangster you see on the street. He was previously an express student. Has much potential, very different. I am sure, even if he remained in the gang, he can become quite a successful crime lord.</p>
              <p>I also suspected he already 19 and hold high rank in the gang community.</p>
              <p>As long as he break out of his concept of being a gangster and "He was useless", then he can do whatever he wants. Even if he does not want to study "O" level he can also become successful. If he really want to study "O" level can definitely make it to Uni with ease. It is just that the FEAR of failure is holding him back.</p>

              <p>Because it seems to me that he's like never had the chance to
              flaunt his vulgarities-scolding talents in real life and is
              using every opportunity to "show-off" his gangster-like skills.</p>
              <p>I believed Gedanken is always on the receiving end of other
              people's vulgarities in his real life.</p>
              <p>Try using vulgarities on him and you will drive him
              suicidal....easily. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I don't use vulgarities cos I'm a nice girl. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
