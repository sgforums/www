              <p>Parn: thanks. but I think you get me wrong. I just typing to stereotype people so that I can communicate with them.</p>
              <p>In the past, the problem with me is that I talk too fast. I can shoot out too many facts like a bullet train. And people just get overwhelming and they feel inferior and try to get away from me (It only take me less than an hour to finish a 3 hour exam paper). People admire me but also fear me. So to correct this, I must slow down my speed of speaking and thinking to accommodate other people.</p>
              <p>I don't really have negative opinions about him so far. He have given me some good impression so I bother to communicate with him</p>
              <p>Yes I trying to say it, I get to know him based on my worldview, so how to break the barrier to get into his worldview. It is difficult but how to? The fact is that I know so little about these people and I don't know how to deal with them.</p>
              </div>

              <p>If you want to know this ex-convict, ex-criminal, ex-jailbird, ex-roti-kosong...and other blah blah blah......</p>
              <p>First you must be prepared to be AGREEABLE with him and ignore your own opinions cos nobody is interested in it except for you yourself. Then you need to ACCEPT his opinions so that you can visualise a glimpse of his worldview and his situation and his past.</p>
              <p>Find a common topic with him, if you really don't have any, then I really hate to advice you to talk about girls with him. I believed when two males meet togther for a chat, majority of that chat content would be about the opposite sex. Unless you're into those Broke Back Mountain nonsense, then you can look for Fantagf...cos HE will show you the way HOME. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>If you find your new ex-murderer is not interested in a chat about the opposite gender, then I will strongly advise you to be on your way home ASAP! </p>
              <p>BUT..........................................</p>
              <p>Why do you need to know so much and befriend this ex-jailbird? Do you know what were his previous crimes?</p>
              <p>What if he's an ex-rapist? Then he can't be trusted alone together with you and your family and maybe even your pets? They might all be devoured by him when you're not paying attention!</p>
              <p>Don't say I never warn you and don't come and blame me later when your pets or any of your family members becomes pregnant unknowingly..... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I hate this " tough love " program. I don't think sending a juvenile delinquent to boys home and hostel or whatever, help the person at all. i think it is a waste of time and it make them smaller and eventually affect their life and cannot carry on with it. A psychological scar that is hard to remove.</p>
              <p>If I was being send to these places, I would react very violently. l am not someone that can control by force or instructions or whatever. I really will kill every one and tear the officers from limbs to limbs. no joke. I don't care if I exhaust myself or I get kill.</p>

              <p><br>please do not misunderstand, as my nick suggest, "tough love" means love of the backside kind. I believe any form of imprisonment as punishment is useless. a zebra cannot lose its stripe.</p>
              <p>i support capital punisment (death sentence) for all crimes</p>

              <p> Heh about "People Fear and Admire Me". This is about other peoples' comments about me. Not my own ideas. People say I say that I speak too fast. And when they ask me about various topic I can tell them things in great great great details, a walking encyclopedia. To them it is like showing off knowledge, horrifying (How come you like know everything like that?). It is very fearful as I also experience the same feeling when I go for conferences.

                  <p>Some of my thoughts
                  
                  </p><p>1. Ignore him completely because he is a low-level creature not worth the effort --&gt; I was thinking that why the yellow project failed because the society treat ex-criminal as outcast. Should I follow the crowd?
                  
                  </p><p>2. Give him more time as these people are slow so to know him well, give him more time. How long do these people take to know each other to get to friend level? I only take a few ecounter I can treat him as a friend. But he humm.
                  
                  </p><p>3. Try to accommodate him as his language dictionary are limited --&gt; so his speech is limited things therefore I donâ€™t understand him but our communication already break down.
                  
                  I think he is someone worthy to know or befriend with so how I should solve this problem. Any ingenious idea?  Thank you.
                  
                  Is there a book called "how to communicate with society outcast for dummy?

                  <p> The interesting thing about this guy is that he read email but he don't reply to email. It is quite daunting for the sender as there is no feedback. I already told him that it is very rude not to reply to mail but he just does not listen. Somehow I doubt that "he know how to reply email ". 
                  
                  </p><p> He has a msn messager account but he never log on, so how do I chat to him online?
                  
                  </p><p> The way he replied to mms from me is either "no reply" at all or a one word "NO". He did not even bother to explain why. If I treat him like my normal friends then I would have stop talking to him. But my guess is that due to his limited language ability. He would not answer things like "Sorry that I am on OT and not able to go gym tonight". However, anyone knows about his language ability do he really meant to be rude or he just don't know how to explain in long sentence?
                  
                  </p><p> Perhaps, they have too much bad experience in the past, so they are wary of strangers who approach them and appear to be friendly. Somehow they are always on guard and try to keep a distance. To make friends with them perhaps requires more patience than usual people. Else I would have ignore him already as he have appeared to be unfriendly and unapproachable. 
                  
                  </p><p> I have been sending him some email, and I also doubt that he understand what I am saying. As the people HERE advice is that I should treat him like my same level, so I write as normal in full and long complete sentences. lol. 
                  
                  </p><p> Somehow after talking to him, I feel that he is quite stubborn (he doesnt seems to be able to accept new concept that well), the way he thinks is also not very logical. How to reduce his stubbornness and teach him think logically. Speaking to him really make me vomit blood. 
                  
                  </p><p> Sometimes, the way he speaks also very rude and rowdy, really make people feel uncomfortable. Would these people change the way they behave? If I treat him like a normal people, then I would have also stop talking to him. 
                  
                  </p><p> Anyone there who understand them better can give me some ideas?</p>

              <p>IMO, if u want to be a fren to someone, u hav to earn his trust.  To earn his trust, u hav to BE IN HIS SHOES.  Look at things in HIS perspectives, rather than FORCING him to accomdate YOUR style. </p>
              <p>Secondly, ACCEPT who he is &amp; wat he's made of.  If he doesnt want to change, then be it.  He's an adult, U are only an outsider, who r u to think u hav the ability to change him??</p>
              <p>Above statements are made in consideration that u <span style="text-decoration: underline;">WANT</span> to be his fren.  If u find him not as good or u "hiam" him, then he'd probably be happier w/o u constanly humpin on his back.</p>

              <p>And I don't think it is right of you to force your "friendship" onto him. Ex-convicts are also human and they have the rights to say "NO" to your "friendship".</p>

              <p> Yes that is the first thing I thought of. And I am fine with that if he does not want to make friend with me. So far all the people that I have met in this gym are friendly and very kin to exchange ideas and pointers. So this guy's reluctance actually make him the "odd" guy, which make him a outcast, irregardless of his background. So the conclusion would then be that this person chosen to be the society outcast and not the society has outcast him. Then this guy would still be as hopeless as before and has never changed.

              <p>Just curious, how do you know this person to be worthy enough to be a trusted friend, when you can't even get into a decent conversation? and the fact is you already judged him by labelling him a ex-gangster and etc?</p>

              <p>Not to be picky, but that's supposed to be "keen" and "regardless" respectively.  I'm not pointing this out for the fun of it - you've hitherto written about how intelligent and educated you are in relation to others around you, and what I've highlighted here clearly puts that into question.  Perhaps taking a reality check would be a good move towards devloping a clearer understanding of your circumstances and how that impacts upon your relationships with other people.  To put it bluntly, you're demonstrating an inflated sense of self-worth, and that could well make you an unpleasant person to deal with.</p>

              <p>So the conclusion would then be that this person chosen
              to be the society outcast and not the society has outcast him. Then
              this guy would still be as hopeless as before and has never
              changed.</p>
              <p>Join a gym, is like joining a club, community, by befriending
              him, we welcome him to our community. It is like going to a club
              house, one would meet the same regulars and we greet each other and
              ask how r u?</p>
              <p>It is quite natural: that a new kid join a new class, the class
              would welcome him and try to talk and make friends with him. But if
              he reject the offer. The classmates will learn that this guy is odd

              <p>Hello, I have one hundred and one thing to do. If he does not

              <p>Actually, I already mention in earlier post. "About why I want
              to make friends with him". One thing is that I find this person can
              be worthy enough to consider as trusted friend. The other is that
              if I don't learn how to understand them, how to make policy and

              <p>Perhaps he doesn't find you worthy.</p>
              <p>Also, whose policy are you making?  Society's in general?  Your own?  Even your use of the phrase "deal with them" reflects how you frame things in terms of a power structure with yourself on top.</p>
              <p>Frankly, you've demonstrated that you've got plenty of your own problems to deal with instead of minding other people's business.</p>

              <p>+ noted I did not give the details of his behaviour.</p>
              <p>he smile when he talk to people. he can talk about his past. he can used email, note how to reply, but lied to me that he never check his mail and purposely dont want to reply. Sometimes he can be extremely aggressive, his face turn like octopus. he can mms long message with explaination, sometimes he just say "no" or no reply at all. he say start to talk about things to me but sometimes he say I dont know you. He call me a stranger after knowing him for 6 months. But days later when I meet him he start to talk about his personal problem. Sometimes, he is very friendly, sometimes he is unfriendly. I catch no ball. He lied to me about his past because everytime I speak to him the details is sightly different. I can tell that he is very smart. I feel that I am talking to 2 persons at different time, one-friendly and one-unsociable. I collected my thoughts, I think that he is actually playing me around. He lied and his words are not consistent. I thought I knew him, but also hardly understand him. I cannot find consistence in him and cannot pinpoint his personality and character. one hand he like to talk about his past, on the other hand he say please respect my privacy. Frankly, I dont know what he want. Plus his violent and dangerous history. I can tell that after 6 months, I dont know he wants and I cant tell if he is still dangerous.</p>

              <p>Everyone "can' be dangerous, so
                      the best solution is just to stay away. Which is a good solution. Why
                      bother to talk to someone when he does not "bother to talk" to you. This
                      is a logical solution. + I dont even know he want to make friends with me in this first place.</p>
              <p>Maybe my friend, mean a different thing, whatever, I just need to know "Just leave him alone"</p>
              <p>Just leave it to the professional. They can tell and diagnosis. I am not a professional in this field, not a social worker, so why should I bother about him.</p>
              <p>My friend say I am insane, why I go and spend time for his guy when I have hardly time for lunch with her.</p>
