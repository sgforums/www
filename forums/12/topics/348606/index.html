I only take a few ecounter I can treat him as a friend. But he humm.<br><br>3. Try to accommodate him as his language dictionary are limited --&gt; so his speech is limited things therefore I don’t understand him but our communication already break down.<br><br>I think he is someone worthy to know or befriend with so how I should solve this problem.

              <p>My thoughts on this matter:</p>
              <p>1) Why do you categorize him as a 'low-level creature'? It is his choice, whether he regrets it or not, but to openly labelling him is indicating to me that you have a poor sense of EQ.</p>
              <p>2) Anybody, be it school dropouts or ivy league graduates, will requires one to know them long enough before you get to know him/her 'well'. So to speak, education level has no effect on the time frame to get to know a person well.</p>
              <p>3) Isn't friendship all about accomodating? You don't expect most of the people out there to be thinking and talking exactly like you, do you? Take it as an opportunity to learn more about his way of life, culture, etc.</p>
              <p>In your 2nd last statement, you've mentioned you think that he is someone worthy to befriend, so I would suggest to go ahead.</p>
              <p>And no, I do not think that there is such a dummy book, in fact, the ability to befriend, I see it as a soft-skill that takes time and experience to develop.</p>
              <p>Regards</p>

              Thanks AFC
              
              AFC: if categorize him as a 'low-level creature" is inappropriate then what you suggest as a better term to link with "not worth the effort "? I meant just figure of speech. 
              
              I don't deny may my EQ is limited so that why must ask other people out here. 
              
              The thing about no 1. it is that is the society ignore these people or these people exclude them from the society.

              <p>Communicating with them.. is not an art.</p>
              <p>Listen more.. judge less.</p>
              <p>You don't have to always give your unsolicited "educated" opinion.</p>
              <p>They are humans.. they have feelings.. pride.. and their own point of view.</p>
              <p>If you are befriending him because you think his pai kia status can come in handy in the future.. you're seeking the wrong guy for friendship.</p>

              <p>Lokey: Maybe just refer to him as a casual acquaintance? Thing about society, doesn't consists only of educated people, we still have all sorts of social classes. Instead of differentiating and discriminating, why not embrace a person irregardless of what class he belongs to?</p>
              <p>Sometimes you see, being rich and powerful doesn't directly translate to happiness for all. Different people gauges things differently.</p>

              <p>It's always a culture shock to meet someone who comes from a vastly different background from you.</p>
              <p>You will be forced to make several paradigm shifts, question your own baseline, and make decisions on your world view.</p>
              <p>This can be uncomfortable and many people choose to take the easy way out by classifying people into convenient stereotypes - as long as they are easily filed and compartmentalise - you don't need to think too much about them.</p>
              <p>Are you getting to know him because in your 'worldview' - you SHOULD
                  get to know some ex-criminal types to 'enrich' your social life and
                  motivated by some altruistic intention ~ then I think by that very
                  premise you have already put him in a mould that you expect him to fill
                  (and disturbed if he doesn't)</p>
              <p>So your questions are healthy - but do remember that this person you met is just an individual. Would be good if you keep in mind that, and don't evaluate him as a stereotype BUT as a person - else it would be grossly unfair to others.</p>
              <p> Not to mention self limiting.</p>

              <p>Parn: thanks. but I think you get me wrong. I just typing to stereotype people so that I can communicate with them. 
                          
                </p><p>  In the past, the problem with me is that I talk too fast. I can shoot out too many facts like a bullet train. And people just get overwhelming and they feel inferior and try to get away from me (It only take me less than an hour to finish a 3 hour exam paper). People admire me but also fear me. So to correct this, I must slow down my speed of speaking and thinking to accommodate other people. 
                  
                  </p><p> I don't really have negative opinions about him so far. He have given me some good impression so I bother to communicate with him
                      
                   </p><p>Yes I trying to say it, I get to know him based on my worldview, so how to break the barrier to get into his worldview. It is difficult but how to? The fact is that I know so little about these people and I don't know how to deal with them.</p>

              <p>Lokey, you've got a major malfunction happening here, namely your severely out-of-whack perception of where you stand in the world.  You're treating other people as being outcasts, inferior and of limited vocabulary.</p>
              <p>Here's a little home truth to chew on.  People neither fear nor admire you.  You're a megalomanic, conceited, partonising twat, and you simply piss them off.  That's why they want to get away from you and frankly, they exercise excellent judgement in doing so.</p>
              <p>On the extremely unlikely chance you actually do want to join society, what you need to do is pull your head out of your arse, perform a reality check of your place in the world, and generally get your shit together and stop acting like a complete wanker.</p>

              <p>Just adding my two-cents worth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Start with respect. I do not know how you found out he is an ex-ganster and had  up to sec 2 education. do not see him that way. treat him like another mate, a fellow guy who shares the same interest, i.e. going to the gym. there is no need to dumb down your speech with him. you might just have to speak a bit slower if you tends to rattle on a little. if you sense his vocabulary is limited, use common words that he could understand. there is no need to talk to him like a child. he might not be as well educated as you are, but he has life experiences that you probably never had.</p>
              <p>be genuine. be honest. if you do not understand what he is trying to express or certain terms he uses, ask him to clarify for  you. most people do not take offence if they can sense you are sincerely trying to communicate rather than mocking their command of the language. by doing this, he is likely to feel more comfortable to clarify with  you if he doesn't understand any words you use.</p>
