            <div class='col-md body'><div id="post_message_60197304">a ex male colleague wanted to keep in contact with me so i dropped him an email. We dont know each other well and hardly talk to one another.<br><br>Well, to my surprise, since then, he has been emailing me almost daily with random rants about his work and academic problems. Then i thought, it seems like a sharing session and i also confided in him about my work problems. so i just give him normal casual email replies<br><br>Then he asked me a question, why am i confiding in him when we hardly know each other well in person and if im attached, i shouldnt be in any form of conversation with him, i agreed and we remained in touch. I make it clear that im single and not looking.<br><br>Today he told me he has some problems at work. As a natural instinct and as a "friend" , i asked if he is willing to share about his problems. He then suddenly gave me a revelation of things :<br>(1) I am a nice girl, he is more willing to share and open up to me given more time<br>(2) he sincerely wants to know me better as a friend<br>(3) he wants our communication to be kept a secret as he wants to maintains his privacy and feaful that our ex colleagues may gossip and have the wrong impression of us.<br><br>Im totally hurted. All along, i was simply replying his email since he took the initiative to send his regards to me daily. Now, he is suddenly maintaining and drawing his distance from me. I didnt send or show any gestures that im romantically interested in him. In fact, i just thought he would make a good confidant, a good friend for me to share my job-hunting woes. It was just normal conversational topics , there was nothing romantic about it. i didnt do anything romantic just simply reply and maintain contact<br><br>Why must he suddenly behaved this way? I felt hurted, rejected and offended, i told him i dont like him and did he think i liked him? He said he appreciate it if i dont mention it, as he doesnt know me well and only take me as a friend. he even added he has no time for relationship now and if he indeed likes me, he wouldnt be explaining it to me..<br><br>i dont understand..why are guys so fast to maintain and draw boundaries and give their stand..when i didnt even say/hint i like the,, it is just based simply on their own assumptions..<br><br>am i so awful as a person that they have to make it so clear so soon that we can only be nothing but secret friends?<br>im hurted for no reason<br><br>problem is i didnt even say i like him, i just reply his email casually....he behaves as if im confessing to him</div></div>

              TS,
              He had his expectations of you though it was never in any articulated or mentioned explicitly, behind the facade of  (only he is privy to his inside) was lots!
              
              Sadly, u seem not to notice that you are in the same predicament as he was or seems to be.
              
              The mutual benefit scheme - unknown to each other is manifesting itself out but not in the manner that both you had expected it to be. hence, the disappoint or whatever you deem well-suited for u or him to label it.
              
              U are hurt, why? if u did not expect him to ....? surely u would not be. The same for him.
