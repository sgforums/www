What if you are Takeshi Kaneshiro? Do you think she will say that? Im amazed how good they are at directing one's attention.<br><br>it's best not to think too much yet at the moment. if u really like her, try to call her less and give her space. They say that 'absence makes the heart grow fonder'. It's true. Call her only to ask her out. See her less.<br><br>Wait for her to call you to ask you out.  Every time she calls you, ask her out. See how she respond. You can tell how much she likes you by accepting your invitation. Other than that, dun call her to go out...yet.</div>

Read your initial postings and how you are fustrated and then read on further till the part you go meet her and to wish you luck. Finally read to the latest posts of yours in here. Can you see something from all these?<br><br>Many of these are more or less solved in the early parts. You still confused as to why she did not reply you for a week? I would advice NOT asking her, but its your choice.<br><br>This is what I read from a post, "She may be doing noveltry?" Supposed so, are you going to give up just because she REALLY did that? Do you want to give up knowing a friend? Do you want to give up future potential friendships if there are people who are  doing noveltry? Give them a benefit of a doubt. If you don't give a chance to them and to yourself, how are you going to do so in the future?<br><br>I assume you two are still schooling right? Then focus on it. This is a good way to get your mind off her for much of the time when you feel fustrated. Friends are for life, there will always be time for many things you wanted to do.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
