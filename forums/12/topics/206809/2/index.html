As some people said I do not want to pressure her or scare her away mah.<br><br>Er...<br><br>What am I supposed to do now? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> [/b]</blockquote>no sorrie to say, you are out guy! Think about it: will a girl who loves you do such things to you? If she does, then i'd say she's stupid cos she likes you. Why would she do that for Pete's sake?!<br><br>The moment a girl blows hot and cold to you, you are out! Get it? She is just simply trying to play around with your ego and your own high interest in her.<br><br></div>
