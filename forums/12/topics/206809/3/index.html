Sometimes girls blow hot and cold doesn't mean you are out. She's just testing you to see if you are concerned about her.

My guess is she's only interested in playing around a bit with you. You can give her a bit of time and see if she comes back, or you can just give up, just treat her as a normal friend and see how things turn out.</div>

(the stuff she said convinced me that she wants to be frens at least!) i dun get to see her in person anymore unless she finally decides to meet up but shes ignoring my requests to go out. (still replies to mundane stuff)<br><br>whats happening man. at first i thought i was bugging her too much asking her out so i backed off when she started ignoring me. but she never got back to me abt meeting up...what gives?</div></blockquote>you know what's your mistake? you are coming off too fast onto her. she is giving u a chance but she wants to take it slow or she doesnt want to go out with u to begin with... which means she has no interest in u in the first place...Until she calls to ask you out, you remain silent guy.<br><br>and she thinks you are trying to date her when u asked her out that's why! but that's her fault<br><br>and trying to confront her shows you are too eager for her answer... you gotta take it easy guy... show like you dun really give a hoot... since she started it she shd end it by initiating contact with you first...<br><br>if ur really are dying to call and ask her better not do it on the phone... ask her face to face if u happen to bump onto her and of course naturally and sincerely... if she doesnt seem to let u know what really happened... then dun push it further... let it be...</div>
