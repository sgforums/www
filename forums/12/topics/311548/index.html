              <p>I've been crushing on a guy for a few years .. Is it adnormal? I've read posts which says crush are just infatuation and shouldnt last for so long..</p>
              <p>Used to be quite close to him when we were in the same school.. .. After being posted to different schools, i didnt contact him for about 2 years.. During that period of time, i would still think of him occasionally. And one day, i happened to browse to his friendster's account and added him.. And.. since then, added him into MSN and such.. However, i find it hard to talk to him as casually as before.. And this has been going on for quite some time...</p>
              <p>I'm someone who doesnt have the courage for confession.. so i just let it be.. Hoping that this feeling would disappear. But now.. Even knowing that he has just attached.. this feeling still stays..</p>
              <p>How to get rid of this feeling? &gt;.&lt;</p>
              <p>PS: Thanks for reading..</p>

              <p>Well...keeping it isn't a bad thing either.</p>
              <p>You'll just be thinking about him for a long long time.. that's all.</p>
              <p>Like you.. I used to be infatuated with a boy in my primary school..</p>
              <p>Till date.. I do .. still think about him.. occasionally. But the intensity of that crush just fades over time.. but will not dissapear.</p>
              <p>I searched for him online.. but to no avail.. my friend told me, she thinks she saw him with his wife and family a few years back.. but she couldn't be sure it was him.</p>
              <p>In my heart.. he still reside in a little .. tiny corner... and when I have some time.. I go visit him there...... a sliver of bitter sweet memory .. like a souvenir from a beautiful place..I'd never get to visit again......</p>
              <p>If I had .. at the right time.. confessed.. and got rejected.. perhaps.. I will finally be able to have closure.. and eventually forget about him.</p>
              <p>Or if he had accepted me.. perhaps.. my path would've been very different.</p>
              <p>A thousand possibilites... awaiting for you to unravel... your choice.</p>
              <p>But since he is attached now. it's best not to go and "kaciao" him .. because your chances will be very very slim....</p>

              <p>I think you should not be bothered by specifics. Just take him as a friend and be casual. It is not an offence to be his friend even if he is attached. The both of you may not end up as husband and wife this lifetime (not confirmed yet) but there is no stopping and/or offense in being good friends.</p>
              <p>I felt that you are too conscious and sensitive to speak out, hence you felt a barrier between the both of you. As I write this I am wondering at the same time if your other half might have decided on another gal because you are perceived as uninterested and you are attached. Sounds familiar? All because neither party wanted to initiate.</p>
              <p>I am no novelist here and I think you might have mixed feelings here. But I hope that this will be able to see it from another perspective.</p>

              <p>Yeah.. i super conscious to talk to him last time.. I dunno what to talk to him when he just broke off with his ex a few years back... kinda feeling regretful... And... "perceived as uninterested" is indeed true as i was waiting for him only..</p>
              <p>But now.. i'm still stuck here.. and now... i still couldn't remove that "barrier" in me.. this is making me feeling worse day by day as he is always online nowadays..</p>
