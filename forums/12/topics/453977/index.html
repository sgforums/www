              <p>You can't air dirty linen when it is folded.</p>
              <p>A mistake is a mistake. An sincere apology is acknowledging that mistake, and not to commit it again. A young person have not learn that yet. But as long as the mistake is realised, there is not need for an apology. But if the mistake is not acknowledge, an apology is of no use. </p>
              <p>Does your daughter realise the wrong, if yes, forgive and forget. Forget about the apology.</p>
              <p>Coerced apology serves only to humilate the wrong doer.</p>

              <p>EMILY HATES HER MOTHER BECAUSE SHE NEEDS TO SPEAK TO HER MOTHER IN MANDARIN.</p>
              <p>EMILY LOOKS DOWN ON HER MOTHER.</p>
              <p>SO THAT'S WHY SHE HAD NEVER WANT TO CLEAN UP AFTER HER MENSTRAL CYCLE EVERY MONTH. </p>

              <p>Emily is growing up, a teenager. neither here nor there. Not a child, not an adult yet.</p>
              <p>Don't want to be a dependent, yet cannot be independent.</p>
              <p>She hates how she is looked upon as. She wants to be her own person. And resents being linked to the mother. </p>
              <p>Its time for the mother to let go, and let Emily be her own person. Let Emily fly, but be there to support her.</p>
              <p>There are things a teenager can't explain. They just feel, and react, and can't put it into words. Parents want openess, to talk like an adult, but they just can't, because they don't know how.</p>
              <p>Yes, she wants to break the mirror, smash it, she hates it. </p>
              <p>She is growing up into her own person.</p>

              Pls dont be so harsh on her. She is your daughter afterall.
              Give her sometime to realise her mistakes. What you are doing now would not hhelp the situation. It might even worsen the relationship. Forgive her.

              <p>You are a selfish mother. No wonder your child hates you.</p>
              <p>All u do is punish and shame, u have no idea how to build love with your child.</p>
              <p>A child will give a selfish parent unconditional love only because he/she knows no better.</p>
              <p>U wish she was dead, but there r times, she wished she was not borned to a woman like you.</p>
              <p>Get a grip of yourself, or u will lose your own child forever.</p>
              <p>Reading through both your blog and her website.</p>
              <p>It is indeed sad that because of your personal ambition, you have suppressed your own child's aspiration. Even sadder, u have set out to destroy her life, simply because she refused to live the life YOU want her to live...</p>
              <p>You cannot set yourself free from your regrets of unfulfilled dreams, by imprisoning her in her regrets.</p>
              <p>Do not think that your self imposed servitude in the past will automatically garner her respect and love.When u give with condition, u will almost always be disappointed by the gratification.</p>
              <p>I feel sorry for you. For u have lost a life time chance to enjoy a loving relationship with your own child. That is the biggest lost to any mother.</p>
              <p> A happy parent is one who lives vicariously through the happiness of their own children. Through their sadness, the pain is magnified 10 folds.</p>
              <p>U r not one who lives a happy life. One cannot give , what one does not have.</p>
