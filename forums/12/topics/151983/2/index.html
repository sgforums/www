I came back hoping to start everything afresh with him and we did... But things isn't as wonderful as last time. He tried his best but his feelings for me is no longer there.<br><br>An sms to him a day and meeting up with him only for a few hrs a week, seems too much for him to bear. He feels pressurised. He requested for his own personal space.<br><br>He says he wants to be fair to me and for him to have his own space. We have been together for close to 6 years. I just can't bear for us to part this way..<br><br>How come a person can change so fast without a reason? Is there really eternality love??

Duty is inclusive of the lengthy time together as a couple, which actually amounts to nothing if quality of the relationship is stale.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Your overseas trip is not the cause; it is the catalysis.</strong></span><br><br>With a sudden surge of freedom flowing through him, the notion of cheating without getting caught seemed so ideal. He probably thought it as companionship, but let me tell you: it is not so simple. Deep inside him, this relationship is already a lost cause, for, replacing alternative companionship is but a reason to allow his conscience to exercise that decision without too much guilt.<br><br>Forgiveness, truthful or even honest confession can take place, but what is Love left in the relationship?<br><br>By now, you probably realize that Love works in a way where trying is meaningless if you don't know what you are trying for. Tried his best? Best in what? Tried for what?<br><br>Pressured? Need personal space?<br><br>Do you see your relationship degenerating?<br><br>P.S: Nothing change overnight; just that you didn't know all these while, changes are constantly taking place.
