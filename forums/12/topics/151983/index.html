Like what you've said above, let go n move on...yea...Move On....<br><br>To heal a broken heart - Hang out more with your friends or make new friends to make your time useful n meaningful.<br><br>You can also hang out yourself alone at any cafe, browsing magazine, free your thoughts...but would be better if with friends..<br><br>You think abt him is becoz for the past 6yrs, he has always been a character in your heart which has already been a part of you.<br><br>Ask yourself this question: What do you love in him?<br><br>Frankly speaking, you don't even need to understand "how come he can take it so lightly whereas you can't".</div>

A moment could take to change a person's life.<br><br>The main issue for his departure is your physical absence. Person of Loneliness is a very very easy victim.<br>One might have thought leaving the feelings on the shelf for awhile, and go look around.<br>However, When one cannot control and maintain his/her feelings. He/her is unable to retrack back to the feelings which was left on the shelf.<br>That is when one needs to decide whether to let go, or relearn how to love again.<br><br>When he have requested for his own personal space. Have you considered or observed if there were any change in your r/s before leaving overseas?<br>Could it be that he wasn't satisfied in certain manners?<br>It could be that 6 years is a long time. Some r/s gets better when they age. Some turn into vinegar.<br><br>Again.<br>Eternal is subjective. As well as love. Also subjective. It depends on your expectations and how you look at it.<br><br>Lastly. Think about it carefully.<br>I don't think this is a sudden departure case.<br>You may not be aware that he might have left you spiritually and emotionally long before you realise.<br><br>Take care.<br><br>Cheers</div>
