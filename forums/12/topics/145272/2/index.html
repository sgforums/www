Certainly not a guy that would interest any gal.<br></blockquote>Not every girl is interested in looks or money. Most smart girls know good-looking guys usually aren't the most faithful guys in the world, and many girls these days are financially independent enough not to be lured easily by a man's wealth. (Rich guys usually aren't the most faithful guys in the world, too.)<br><br>Your weakness seems to stem greatly from your lack of self-confidence. In one recent poll, you've resigned yourself to a lifetime of loneliness. It is perhaps unfair for someone who doesn't know you to say this, but don't you think it could be this kind of negative mentality that is dictating your current shy behaviour?<br><br>Rather than focusing on your weaknesses, maybe you could work on bringing out your strengths instead? Join some activities, open up as you have done in the forums, make some new friends...<br><br>You are in the university and it is probably one of the best places for a student to find a companion. There are so many opporutnities for guys and girls to meet each other for study, meals and play. Besides, the expectations placed upon you would probably not be as high as you are not working. This may sound idealistic, but a lot of graduate friends around me have found their partners in that fertile place. Miss your bus stop and it is likely your search is going to get a bit tougher once you begin your career after graduation.<br><br>You said you could be seeking that "companion" in life. Maybe if you really seek in real "life" and not wait in "heaven", your chances may be higher? You seem to be good in mathematics, you should be able to figure out the probabilities. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Everyday everyone is facing the threat of been backstab, but it shouldnt stop us from befriending new ppl. At least, we learn how to control our emotion more often and level up our EQ.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I understand you might have nervous break down again, how about trying to catch up with your old friends? those who can really click with you since old times?<br><br>Actually i also have friends who are really anti-social and doesnt likes to mix with ppl, but like what i advise them, i will say the same to you: "Be nice to your friends and they will be nice to you."<br><br>Afterall, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">friends and aquintance is different </span>.<br></div>
