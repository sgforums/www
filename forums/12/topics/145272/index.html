It's good that you've waken up your ideas.<br><br>Now, the reason why you r unsure of what your life is about... that is because you haven't set any <span style="text-decoration: underline;">long-term goals</span> for yourself.

            <div class='col-md body'>To CoolMyth:<br><br>Dont you feel lonely when you have no friends?<br><br>Sometimes in life, we do things that we dont like to do, but in the end we still have to force ourself to do it. In this world where we have to evolved around the world, its up to u whether u wanna evolved with us or stay your ground and rant, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">indulge in false hope</span> that there will be people coming to you and pity you.<br><br>Motivation in life doesnt comes out of a sudden. I'm sure deep down your heart, you wish to do certain things while that certain things are not within your reach. Try your best, earn enough money or work hard to get to that thing you wish to grab hold of.<br><br>Friends are the most important part of your life. They bring in hapiness and sadness. They are there when you need them, and they will also not be there when you are in need of help. Do not presume they will come to you even when you maintain the "cool" attitude. No one likes to be make used. Spare an hour or 2, call your friends, have a nice dinner with them, meeting up for a chat, all this kinda small things help. Down to the point, human cannot escape loneliness.<br><br>Dun get me wrong, i'm not here to flame you, but just to tell you this:<br><strong>If you dun make the effort in life, you will never get the things you wanted.</strong><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nice advice there.<br><br>The problem is though I understand the virtues of having friends, I am pretty much used to doing things alone. When I am alone, I feel at peace and relaxed. The optimal condition I like to experience in life.<br><br>I felt sick of all the "friends" backstabbing, personally experienced during army days. Got so bad that I had to make some visits to a psychatrist. For the info, I cannot get too nervous, excited or agitated, or else I'll easily lose control of myself.<br><br>Though I've been "discharged" from my condition, I understand deeply inside that this "condition" is still in there somewhat and I have to take great care not to evoke it again. Hence, my desire to be alone, be at peace and be relaxed.<br><br>I don't understand myself sometimes. Tried as I might, I still don't.</div>
