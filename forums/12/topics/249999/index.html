            <div class='col-md body'>Emotions I feel today:<br><br>Guilt: Once I saw a handicapped woman (polio and mildly retarded) and she was crossing the road. When she neared the pave way, she bent down onto the floor dragging her way to the paveway, and the "green man was starting to blink". I just stood there not thinking much. Later a man helped her up, than i realised she had actually felt that dragging herself to the paveway was faster. I feel so guilty coz she could have been hit by the cars, and yet I had done nothing.<br><br>Most days: Sence of unfeelingness. Esp since I hardly communicate with anyone during office due to generation gap. I think this sense of unfeelingness towards self and others has manifested into my life, like the incident above.<br><br></div>
