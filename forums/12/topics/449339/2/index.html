              <p><br>Kudos to you. You are vry brave to tell her how you feel. At least you are still young and have lots more to go. I am in my mid 30s and really regret that I didn't get the chance to live my youth. Back 4 to 5 years ago, I had a motorbike accident and I had to go thru numerous surgeries and painful physiotherapy sessions. I could not work for 4 years and didn't go out to socialise because I was on crutches and had to wear a back brace most of the time.</p>
              <p>Now I am ok, I can walk a bit but slightly limp (not so obvious). I cannot run or do sports. I really lost a lot of time. I wish i had the chance to meet women and go dating.</p>
              <p>Nowadays, I try to make up for lost time by increasing my social circle. But everyone around me is so young, some ladies in their mid 20s. So its hard to find something common to talk about plus I am shy. Most of my peers are already married and have their own kids. So you can imagine how out of place I am.</p>
              <p>Keep us updated.</p>

              <p><br>I try to join new interest groups to widen my social outreach but these days i also working hard to make up for lost time, as you know, I haven't work for 4 years. Most of my peers are earning more than me. When I go to an old school reunion, I feel ashame because mostly got married and they earn much more than me. I only hang out with those former school mates of mine who are divorcees.</p>
              <p>5-7 yrs younger? Well, i don't fancy those who are below 26 because their minds are not mature enough and they don't want to settle down. However those who are 27 to 29, are normally those seeking relationships but they seem to behave like hot commodities. It is very difficult to befriend them because usually a lot of guys want to know them better. The best age are those 30 or 31.</p>

              <p><br>Redname,</p>
              <p>Since me and you are guys in our 30s, I want to ask you, how to you increase your social circle? Its because most of our friends are already married or attached.</p>
              <p>I am seriously thinking of going for dating agency. It is really hard to find somebody these days. If I am over friendly to a lady, they get phobia at me. If I am not friendly enough, they say I am snobbish. Sometimes, I really don't understand women.</p>
              <p>First step is to increase social circle. Second step to hope that you meet somebody who is open to talk to you. Third step if you can ask her out for a date. But in so far, I always fail in meeting somebody who will like me. Sigh.</p>
