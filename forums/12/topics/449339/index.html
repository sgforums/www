              <p>same gal. i usually take veri long to have interest again in another gal.</p>
              <p>I just want to start talking to her again. she's a nice person and i really enjoyed her company b4 all these happens.</p>
              <p>she might be a soulmate, just that we can't be together in that sort of way. </p>
              <p>my options are open lah, can be together or not doesn't matter. now just try try can be fren or not lor, sekali when i know her better, it's me who will say i dnt want. no one knows what the future holds right? </p>
              <p>now what hinders me is the awkardness when we bump into each other and also feels strange talking to someone again when 2 months nvr contact liao.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: i'm already in friendzone liao mah, so what u mean by wat i do will put me into friendzone?</p>

              <p>Wtf is a soulmate? Come on - forget about her. You can twist and turn but in the end the intention of your heart is so obvious - you want her for yourself. Its either you go after her or you don't - no such thing as a midway strategy.</p>
              <p>Look if you don't want to listen - go crash and burn. This is the only way for you to learn. She already say she just want to be friends with you. You are so stubborn to place all your hopes in her. I am telling you from experience - she's not interested in you. But since you don't want to listen - the only way is you go all out or you don't at all.</p>
              <p>After you confess to her - things are never going to be the same again. How would you feel like - if a girl you are not interested in confess to you that she likes you a lot and then cannot stop pestering you and sticks to you like glue. Surely you will stay a distance while trying not to hurt her feelings or even make yourself look bad in public by rejecting her badly.</p>
              <p>I think the only way for you to learn is to go all out and after her - then you will know the result.</p>

              <p>It is alway the case when we gals do something or initial something, the guys will take it as love or wanting to be in a relationship, but this is not the case, we just want to be friend and stay in contact for networking purpose, and that is the reason we gals tend to be more cautious of our action, because guy like you tend to hallucinate alots when we make a move out of nothing.</p>
              <p>Teasing you for what?? a million or one private house?? Meet to pass something, to be friend, to stay in contact, no big deal, I also go out with many guys to stay as friend, as drinking company, or to pass something or to give them birthday present, it does not imply Love or relationship in the making.</p>
              <p>For a gal, if she is interested in you, Long long already give you signs of Love, not wait till now.</p>
              <p>And even tho we may like a guy, we will not make the move, we want the guy to make a move and go after us, that is the logic of gf/bf relationship. Reason being, if we end up break up or divorce, we can be proud to say, you come for me hor, not that I wanted you.</p>
