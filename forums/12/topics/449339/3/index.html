              <p>but for me really i take a camella to take photos of girls only - and i admit i am a 50yo cheeko uncle - not like those who don;t admit they just can;t do anything better but think they are real photographers - really when everyone;s a photogrpaher - no one is a photographer anymore <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Save the trouble and go for dating agency lah.</p>
              <p>With dating agency you don't have to court/flirt the girl. The agency will arrange for you the girl and she will turn up. Simple as that.</p>
              <p>Seems that the girl you speak of is already attached. I sense that. Or else why she isn't interested in you?</p>

              <p>Leftovers are easier to pick from. Cut down your competition. Who knows? May get lucky. Sometimes could be that a pretty gurl feels safer to go thru a dating agency because she doesn't want to involve her friends or people she know. Dating agency vets the background of your date and even match your suitability to hers and vice versa.</p>
              <p>Real world:-</p>
              <p>You go to real work to pluck the best fruit - you need to be the best to get the best. Then you need to be a real player who knows how to play the game. Not easy when everybody is going for the best: 10 guys going after one pretty gurl. What are your chances? Do the math.</p>
              <p>Then you will need super thick skin. Kenna rejected and hurt many many times. In many silly manner. Some gurls are nasty - they just play a fool with ya. Make you empty your pocket to buy gifts and take them out. Then they humiliate you with 1,000 ways. These gurls do this thing for a living.</p>
              <p>You will also make enemies. If you try to court a female colleague - you run risk offending your co-workers/your boss/other ladies.</p>
              <p>Conclusion"-</p>
              <p>Go for dating agency. You get to skip a lot of stages. Straight to the point - relationship. No need hassle of pursuit/rejection/hurt. If you feel she is not the one, then call it off or she can do the same for you too.</p>

I guess it's <em>even</em> harder when you have feelings for her. But my advice for you is to move on. As in, keep the interaction - between the both of you - to the minimal. It's not easy but it's a start. In any circumstance, you don't play a second fiddler to no one when you feel something is not right. When time comes, she will come to you if she knows she's missing out something good.</p></div>
