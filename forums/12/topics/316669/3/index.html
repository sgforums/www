              <p>The rule of thumb is that you're entitled to your opinion; that is your birthright and nobody can take it from you. But the entitlement does not extend to offensive remarks targeted at others.</p>
              <p>So learn to speak what is necessary and shut the gap up when it's time to.</p>

But at the end of the day, its all in your mind, truly. Treasure what you have because what you are craving for - your ex-girl, is all but fantasy. Females (no offence to all females) are all the same, sweet loving and kind in marriage... plus all the qualities you don't like or like in the marriage. So in brief, move on! think all you want, dream all you want, But ultimately, the present is the most precious. be thankful</p></div>

              <p> </p>
              <p>but when you lose your grip on the reality of what you have and is constantly comparing it with what you don't - then I think basically what this is telling you, is that your current situation have not satisfied you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who's the one who make the choices that led to the current situation? You.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I find it sad that you seem so proud to tell your wife and your friends that she is your second choice. It just goes to show that after the failure of your first choice, you could not make a better choice for the second relationship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't know which is worse - the sadness of a wife who knows she is second choice, or the man who forever condemned himself to a second rate marriage.</p>

              <p>Dun think you are the only forumite here being married has a 'bigger life experience' to generalise that all who objected 'got it all from the book lar' and that you know whats right and whats wrong...wait till your partner one day meets her long lost darling and daydreams about meeting and talking to him again.. i wonder how u will react tat time.. hope to see your post here then....but last thing you'll expect from me would be sympathy ....... :P my ex gf marry and also have baby liao, i also dun kachio her anymore.. its called respecting ones choice...no need to kaypor so much, if she needs me, she'll know how to contact me..not the vice versa ok? ..</p>
              <p>you show Mrs Poolman your ex gf love letters and feel so song to see her jealous..? wah...this point already is enuff for me to generalise what kind of poolman u are...</p>
