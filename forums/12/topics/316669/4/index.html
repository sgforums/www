              <p>It has been like more than 20years during my secondary 4 days and i am still thinking about my ex-gal fren.  Our relationship was very short.  Lets call her Hana A.  Last I heard she is married and have a daughter.  4-5 years ago, we met at Tampines MRT and I am able to email her and talked to her at her office.  Somehow all is now gone.  It stopped just like that.  I remembered giving her 2 books for her to study on EXCEL. I really am looking for her to see and talk to her.  I just could not help it, day and night been thinking of her.  The feeling is not to start a relationship but to just to see her face and hear her sweet voice. </p>
              <p>I am married now with kids but my mind is very disturbed and cannot forget her.  I tried to tell myself that she is somebody else but my mind refused to accept it.  Hope Hana will happen to read this.</p>

              <p><br>I'd like to think otherwise, once you're there, take it as a chance to start anew, you might unavoidably bring up those memories, probably stings, but you have to move on.</p>
              <p>Though I'm supportive of your case, the reason why my advise is sound is because I've been there and I know feelings like these are not rewarded and bring about more negative results than positive,</p>
              <p>but yet, something seems unfinished. Just remember, you gain something, you lose something. While I hope you are able to find her, I hope you don't; though in that case you have to live with that feeling of voidness for quite awhile.</p>

              <p>But if u keep yrself busy and mixing around, u will not much feel it. Going overseas in yr case is the medicine for u.U have to take it even though its bitter but it helps u recover, right?</p>
