The problem with the mass media and consumerism in general is that they propagate the illusion that everyone should be dreaming of a tall, broad shouldered hunk or some pale long haired wisp, bouquets of flowers or candlelight dinners. Such notions are a travesty of the real thing. Who you love, how you love - that's the ultimate expression of your individuality and uniqueness. They will try to ply you with set dinners and package deals, - no brainer solutions, ignore them. Take the time to figure out what it all means, what makes this thing that the both of you share so unique and special. And if it's love*, it will let you know who you really are.<br><br>*I won't use the term "true love" here, because as far as I'm concerned love is true or it's not love at all.</div>
