              My parents are not conservative, and they trust my choice. Biggest issue is within myself, whether I can take it or not in the long term. The thing is, I have not met someone as nice as him in my life.

              <p>in the long term, should 2 people just get married without the blessings of their parents, the strains on relations between parents and their child will be greatly affected. other problems/ situation will arise...<br><br>e.g. no in-laws contact, discord kinship relations, future child has no trust on blood ties/ kinship when grandparents have cut off ties with the parents, thus affecting bonding with own parents when grow up...etc.</p>

              <p>Young people would think in this way. But it is not true. Marriage is about relations between the two families as well. In other parts of the world, the entire clan, tribe, village are also involved.</p>

              <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19px; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">Some people are fortunate enough to have found their soul-mates while others have their soul-mates selected for them.  In South Asia and the Middle East, arranged marriages are preferred over love marriages, which is the predominant system in the West.  In today’s society, arranged marriages are looked down upon because, as many argue, not having the right to choose one’s partner is cruel.  People of the West reason that only the person who is to marry can decide whom s/he wishes to spend the rest of his/her life with, which leads to a successful marriage.  On the other hand, people of South Asia and the Middle East claim that the elders of the family have the final say over the marriage for they have seen the world and know that a successful marriage is not just a uniting of two people, but of two families.</p>

              <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19px; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">Encarta’s definition of a marriage does not mention anything to do with how the partners found one another and who decided they should marry.  According to the definition, Western marriages are just as legal and proper as South Asian and Middle Eastern marriages are, for both types of marriages have either been recognized through a religious or civil service.  </p>
              <p class="MsoBodyText2" style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19px; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">What is an arranged marriage?  It is usually perceived as a marriage that one is being forced into but, in all truth, it is not.  It is a merging of not only two people, but of two families through the process of agreement.  Now, in today’s modern world, there are two types of arranged marriages:  arranged-love marriages and pure-arranged marriages.<a name="_ftnref3" href="http://www.aller-stead.com/martin/pages/FirstComesMarriage.htm#_ftn3"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">[3]</span></a>  An arranged-love marriage is where the couple loves one another and wishes to marry, receiving the permission and advice of their respective parents and family elders.  Here, caste and dowry are not as important as status, both economic and social, and family reputation.</p>

              <p>Young people would think in this way. But it is not true.
              Marriage is about relations between the two families as well. In

              while others have their soul-mates selected for them.  In
              South Asia and the Middle East, arranged marriages are preferred
              over love marriages, which is the predominant system in the
              West.  In today’s society, arranged marriages are looked down
              upon because, as many argue, not having the right to choose one’s
              partner is cruel.  People of the West reason that only the
              person who is to marry can decide whom s/he wishes to spend the
              rest of his/her life with, which leads to a successful
              marriage.  On the other hand, people of South Asia and the
              Middle East claim that the elders of the family have the final say
              over the marriage for they have seen the world and know that a
              successful marriage is not just a uniting of two people, but of two
              families.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19px; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">Encarta’s definition of a marriage does not mention anything to do
              with how the partners found one another and who decided they should
              marry.  According to the definition, Western marriages are
              just as legal and proper as South Asian and Middle Eastern
              marriages are, for both types of marriages have either been
              recognized through a religious or civil service.  </p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19px; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;">What is an arranged marriage?  It is usually perceived as a
              marriage that one is being forced into but, in all truth, it is
              not.  It is a merging of not only two people, but of two
              families through the process of agreement.  Now, in today’s
              modern world, there are two types of arranged marriages: 
              arranged-love marriages and pure-arranged marriages.<a rel="nofollow" name="_ftnref3" href="http://www.aller-stead.com/martin/pages/FirstComesMarriage.htm#_ftn3"><span style="font-size: 9pt;">[3]</span></a>  An arranged-love marriage is
              where the couple loves one another and wishes to marry, receiving
              the permission and advice of their respective parents and family
              elders.  Here, caste and dowry are not as important as status,
              both economic and social, and family reputation.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19px; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Sunita and Chila, two of the three
              protagonists of </span><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Life
              Isn’t All Haha Heehee</span></span><span style="font-size: 13px;">,
              had arranged-love marriages with their boyfriends, Akash and
              Deepak.  Chila and Deepak had courted for quite some time
              before marriage, even though their parents were not aware of their
              relationship, and decided to marry.  They were both Indian
              Hindus which is why their parents agreed to the marriage. 
              Sunita and Akash met at law school and started dating with their
              parents’ knowledge. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 19px; font-size: 10pt; font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 13px;">Sunita and Akash were both Punjabi
              Hindus which is why their parents did not disapprove of the
              relationship... </span></p>

              <p>Why are we talking about aranged marriage. Either way, I still stand by my point that marriage is just between two people. The most basic family nucleus consists of just parents and kids, to simplify. </p>
