This year alone 3~4 times. I got this guy with a female friend approaching me, mistaken me me as a long lost friend, called me some other name, shook my hand, short of a hug <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">. I was quite shock. After some parry here &amp; there, he was very paiseh indeed.
