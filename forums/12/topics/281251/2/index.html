I would say that as long as you are mature enough, it doesn't really matter when or where u got attached.<br></div>

The gal borrow something from you for a period of some 3 months. But then out of the blue, three weeks later, she sms you and say to meet up to return you something. You meet up at the proposed meeting place. But then that gal didn't turn up. Instead another unknown friend turn up in place of her and return you the borrowed item. After receving back the item, you sms the gal and even call the gal, but no reply.<br><br>3. A gal that you know sms you and ask you to be her boyfriend. You reply back and say okay. The next day you meet up with her, she talk to you with a cheeky smile and say "Let's be brother and sister, okay?"<br><br>4. You ask the same girl out for so many times but then in every outing, she always bring her younger brother along and it is just so difficult to strike up a decent conversation with her 'cos she is always engaging in small talks with her younger brother. And you are no difference from a lamp post.<br><br>5. You never hold that girl's hand before. One day, you cautiously hold her hand at the right moment. You are nervous and your hand is shaking a bit already. And then the girl calm you down and tell you not to worry 'cos she is always holding hands with her younger brother.<br><br>6. After many weeks and months of going out with the same girl, you realise that it is always you who initiate the outing and plan out all the activities but the gal never organised anything with you at all in the first place.<br><br>7. You and the gal went to home visit a neighbour. The neigbour ask the gal whether the guy is her boyfriend. The gal replied by saying that he is just a classmate.

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyo, so pathetic must go to the extent of listing the types of rejections.   AFter rejections, one will go through depression and so on.  But don't indulge too long in it.   it is of utmost importance that you learn from mistakes from the relationship and move on.</div>

Doesn't that seemed like 'no life' ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> Even TV also shows this ! Movies aren't spared too ! When the kids play games they say "Wei wei ! Go study go study ! Exam coming liao ! Don't play so much games ! " Then their games all throw away . Then after exams , some of their parents say " Also no games ! Eu scored 90/100 , but lose out to that fatso ?? GO STUDY THIS INSTANT ! Your holiday will be spent on studying ! No playing for you this holiday !" This is too much .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> I know its for our well being , for fear that we might not get a good job , but do you really think forcing your child study would really help ? Even if he has gotten a good job , is he/she truly happy?<br><br>No wonder so many guys have little experience in r/s and is seeking for help .
