            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I have been thru all the highs and lows of BGRs and I just wanna share the types of rejections that I have faced in my life in regard to BGRs. Anyway I have got over them a long time ago and what doesn't kill you definately makes you stronger. For the ppl who are currently in the downs of relationship, I can say that it is very natural and it is just a part of the whole process. In this world, there is no such thing as perfect relationship, but there is thing such as best relationship! ^_^<br><br>Anyway, enough said. I would like to share the rejections that I faced in the previous BGRs and here it goes...<br><br>1. You say you like her, but then the gal in return say she like you too and she also said that she like her classmates, her parents, her teachers, her siblings, blah blah blah...<br><br>2. The gal borrow something from you for a period of some 3 months. But then out of the blue, three weeks later, she sms you and say to meet up to return you something. You meet up at the proposed meeting place. But then that gal didn't turn up. Instead another unknown friend turn up in place of her and return you the borrowed item. After receving back the item, you sms the gal and even call the gal, but no reply.<br><br>3. A gal that you know sms you and ask you to be her boyfriend. You reply back and say okay. The next day you meet up with her, she talk to you with a cheeky smile and say "Let's be brother and sister, okay?"<br><br>4. You ask the same girl out for so many times but then in every outing, she always bring her younger brother along and it is just so difficult to strike up a decent conversation with her 'cos she is always engaging in small talks with her younger brother. And you are no difference from a lamp post.<br><br>5. You never hold that girl's hand before. One day, you cautiously hold her hand at the right moment. You are nervous and your hand is shaking a bit already. And then the girl calm you down and tell you not to worry 'cos she is always holding hands with her younger brother.<br><br>6. After many weeks and months of going out with the same girl, you realise that it is always you who initiate the outing and plan out all the activities but the gal never organised anything with you at all in the first place.<br><br>7. You and the gal went to home visit a neighbour. The neigbour ask the gal whether the guy is her boyfriend. The gal replied by saying that he is just a classmate. After hearing that, you are already looking away.<br><br>8. Sometimes the gal last minute throw paper aeroplanes at you and it is not just one time, but many many times.<br><br>.<br>.<br>.<br>And many many more BGR rejections that I have probably forgotten. And anyway, I have already gotten over all these emo-feelings of these lows and I have already move on with my life and re-creating myself anew to be a better person now! ^_^<br><br>Feel free to add on!<br><br>Have a good weekend everyone.
