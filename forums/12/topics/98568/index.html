I was the lowest class one, she already had 2 guys actively chasing and preassuring her. She had high hopes for either one but none for me at that time. In the end she chose one the other gave up but I hung on and became very good fren and counsel to her instead of that guy.<br><br>And you what, that guy now had more to lose felt preassured and started preassuring her with all sorts of demands she began to fedup of him eventually he also gave up then ony I step in and told her my feelings.<br><br>You just continue be the happy go lucky platonic friend and relax, the key is relax and make her feel relaxed, the more she relax and happy she will like you and tok to you more dun be preassured, you preassure she also will preassure. In a way you also show how steady you are.<br><br>If you are serious Just relax even if she chooses one of them, hold hands, kiss all is still not lost, just continue and maintain in the end guarntee 100% sure will get.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all the replies, really appreciate them. I haven't talk to her much since after that conversation. And I can see that she's avoiding me, I myself is avoiding her too, course, of the fact that I can't bring myself to face her. My plan was to let things cool down, let the dust settles before we talked again.<br><br>I thought of saying sorry to her, but I felt I was only being nosy and insensitive during that conversation. Since that matter happened a few days ago, saying sorry only now would be wierd.<br><br>I thought I was giving her some form of pressure, which I didn't intended to, because, of the fact that I often saw her with that guy, it made me act irrationally, and do things which I didn't mean to do. Meanwhile, if I didn't do anything, I would feel helpless and hopeless, it's like watching something bad happening and yet you can't do anything to help.<br><br>She's not the only tree in the whole forest, but she meant very much to me. So I hope you guys will understand. We were very good friends before, and I didn't want to end it like this.<br><br>Should I talk to her now and act as if nothing had happened, apologised to her, or just carry on with my current plan, that is, to let things cool down first?</div>
