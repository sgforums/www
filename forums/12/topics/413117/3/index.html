              <p>Stress_out,</p>
              <p>What does your husband says about this problem with your housing.</p>
              <p>Your in-laws are trying to boot your family out, maybe to force you and your husband to stop leeching on them and be independent.</p>
              <p>Let your hubby deal with the housing problem. , he needs to either talk to his own parents to let his family stay with them or find other means of long term lodgings.</p>
              <p>I'm sure your in-laws are also sick of their good for nothing son. After all he is going to be 30, a man this age should stop making babies he cannot afford and expect his own parent to raise his children for him.</p>
              <p>If he still cannot provide a solution like what a good man should do , then it's best you go back to your own family home without him.</p>
              <p>Yes we all know, you love him. But that is not an excuse to make your children suffer for his complacency.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a small island, you can still love him while you are living apart.</p>
              <p>If you want to keep saying the babies need him. Let me tell you this, they don't.</p>
              <p>Because he is a lousy example of a man. Do you want your own children to end up with a guy like him ?</p>
              <p>You are able to love such a man because you have low self-esteem, just because you believe you do not deserve better, <strong>does not</strong> means your children doesn't deserve better.</p>

              <p>all these are result of young time flirting around happily, had sex, drink, smoke, partying like nobody business, end up forgetting to plan for the future and set priorty in life and as they age, problem comes in.</p>
              <p>that;s is why i do not admire nor gang up with my young frens who enjoy young life overboard, I mean you can enjoy youth life, but you still need to think and control yourself, if needed, go for courses to upgrade and later have more earner power, or simply think of buy a house as an objective and both can move toward that objectives instead of everyday disco, drink...holidays ...cause and effect hor. Lucky i attended the nunnery course in taiwan</p>

              <p>Most of the youngsters are engaging in sex...parents not at home, siok liao, can have sex all the way. In the end, who suffer? Not the boys, is the girls suffer. Why? Pregnant lah? Abort need money and also painful. Stupid girls only love to fark fark fark. Protect and love your body lah. Why must fark means love your bf? Boys fark fark also still 1 piece, no problem. Girls fark fark finish liao. Dirty and not virgin and wost, go abortion! Think think carefully before you fark fark fark. Protect yourself and dont land into this situation.</p>

              <p>1.  Y is it that you and yr hubby still plan to have a 2nd chid when you are already having problem with yr life ??? did you and yr hubby plan to have this 2nd child and did you and yr hubby feel that you 2 can gave this child a normal life ???</p>
              <p>2. even if you are able to purchse a HDBm, how much are you able to afford paying the house bills / eletrical / water bills / buying a beds . bring yr kids to see doctor when they are sick ?? <span style="color: #0000ff;">i dont believe</span> that <span style="color: #0000ff;">$1200 BEFORE CPF</span> is enough to see you and hubby through all the things you wan unless both side parents helped you every month.</p>
              <p>other might say if others can survior on $1200 along Y not you??? ask them to fuck off cause every 1 is different.  and they dont know that their parents are helping them in other ways. most ppl that gave you suggest doesnt really care about wat is happening to you. they are only KPO to see yr post.</p>
              <p>i believe if yr hubby is taking care of you and himsef right now he might be already starting to feel the stress and might be already brrowing from friends or dad to survior</p>
              <p>i would suggest that you and yr hubby to apply for renting a single units like those in redhill or ToaPayoh which cost $50 right now and the normal bill is also about $50 if i remember correctly , the min <span style="color: #0000ff;">to apply for such flat is a total income for the household is $1500.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">3. enjoy unprotected sex, without thinking of furture ( no flamming pls)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">4. going the wrong road which will end up even worst.</span></p>
