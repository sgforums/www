              <p>Hi StressOut, maybe your last option is your best option.</p>
              <p>Stay at your parent house. But...your hubby need to give your parent some kind of allowances (that allownaces are for looking after the kids and meal and pocket money).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then, you too go and look for a job, office or factory doesnt matter as it will help your hubby alot too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then, go look for your mp again. Both of you, not you alone.</p>
              <p>Ask your hubby to talk to the mp, ask them to look for 1 or 2 room flat. I am sure there are many especially around Redhill or Bukit Ho Swee area.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Agreed with Trouble, dont give up, if both (hubby and you) are willing to work and willing to give the best to your kids, there will be ways that your mps will help you. They wont leave you, your hubby and kids to die on the street.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>Dont blame yourself.</p>
              <p>As old pple said : Your past life owe him the present life. This is faith, you are repaying back to him in the present life.</p>
              <p>Same goes to your hubby.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dont dwell about it anymore, look forward, live with your parents for the time being. Remember to give your parents allowances. And go look for jobs (part time or full time), once everything settle down, go look for your mp again (both of you) and ask for help to look for 2 - 3room hdb flat.</p>

              <p><br>Well, if your hubby going to stay with his parents, I find it nothing wrong wat. Your hubby can still see you during weekend or every nite after work.</p>
              <p>I am sure yr hubby is mature enough to be alone right?</p>
              <p>If wait for 17 mths, wait lah...afterall, your mum will be helping you out too wat. And you can also do your confinement at your mum's place, isnt it good?</p>
              <p>17 mths = 1 yr 5 mth, very fast one....one blink, already gone. Maybe it will take less than 17 mths. Dont give up.</p>

              <p>hey fellow singaporean, thank for reading my post. i have this story to share with all of you which happen to me recently. Please give me a fair comment.</p>
              <p>Im married with 2 kid and due to my age i cant apply for a flat 3 Yrs ago. When now i meet up the age limit, i try my very best to move out from my in law hs as she is selling away her house. I gg to every dept in sigapore to ask for help but no one willing to help. I even went to the MP they also don help. Why should i get this kind of tratment?</p>

              <p><br>First of all, I need to make this statement clear to you.</p>
              <p>"THERE IS NO SHAME IN RENTING IN SINGAPORE"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IF you insist that you MUST own a HDB flat when you know that you cannot afford to own one now, then you need to realise that your expectations are causing you to dig a hole for yourself in your own world.</p>
              <p>As a single-mother, your most priority is to ensure that you have the ability to save and manage with whatever income you have at the present to provide for your two children.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IF you think that your in-laws is able to help you to achieve that purpose, by all means go and betray your own principles and get into good terms with them for the sake of your two children.</p>
              <p>IT's definitely better than selling your body to faceless men or your soul to the devil himself!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You called yourself a Mother of two children and yet you are so messed-up and insensible in your life, what happened?</p>

              <p>You are 21, just married, with two kids, another one on the way, and about to be homeless. What is your husband doing about it? He can follow his mother and it seems his problem is solved. Leaving you in a fix. There are many things you are not saying.</p>
              <p>BTW what race is you husband?</p>
