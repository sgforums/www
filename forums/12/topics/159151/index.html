            <div class='col-md body'>hi.. Thanks for the re-phrase..<br><br>Ok.. From where I am understanding.. There is a chance that she MAY like your company.. But I guess its a little to early to use to word like.. or love.. More like a crush to me..<br><br>The fact she said "She can't see you".. has some "hint" that she misses you.. But whether she misses your company at pub or outside.. That I won't know.. You would need to slowly figure out yourself.<br><br>You can always reply her by saying "We can go out to movie or dinner or something rather than pubbing" That will give you a chance to meet up or have an excuse to allow her to meet up with you..<br><br>Picking up a girl from a pub DOES NOT mean that it is a bad thing.. But pre-cautions in every form must be taken..<br><br>In the meantime.. Slowly let this potential relationship grow.. Rushing will lead you straight to hell..<br><br>Cheer dude..<br><br>All the best.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Greedyman:</div><div class="quote_body">i know i'm stupid, but i think i fell in love for a girl at pub.<br><br>girl A were intro by a hi-bye drinking(very bro after few cup of wine) friend's gf. feel very comfortable when chatting with A.<br><br>my friend's gf hint me that night that the gal find me quite interesting , but it not my style to be aggressive, just manage to hold her hand on the 1st night.<br><br>after that night, i dont know why. i only call her when i going to clubbing on friday  and weekend. maybe i too enjoy/easy chatting and drinking at pub. dont dare to follow up normal dating. she will come alone just to join me and my friends and only stick to me.<br><br>i really want to change our relation for not only clubbing accompany . so i hint her thur sms 3 days ago that i will put a stop for a period from clubbing. but after that she msg back " so i cannot see you again?".<br>*that mean she will be there without me?<br><br>i dont know how to msg her back...till now.<br><br>what should i do <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div></blockquote></div>
