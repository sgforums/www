            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Alba,<br><br>Just some quick words ... if you were to seek legal advice, do it silently.<br><br>The reason I say this is because any competent lawyer would say that you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">might</span> have a claim in assault. Whether your claim will hold water is dependant on further facts.<br><br>As of right now, I would think so because it seems to me that the necessary elements of assault have been made out, and not negated by any subsequent words/conduct.<br><br>SG's legal system advocates mediation; it's not litigation, it's dispute resolution. It would be wise to go down that path.</div>
