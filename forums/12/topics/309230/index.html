              <p>hi, hope everyone can share their 2cents (ideally from life experience).</p>
              <p>ex and i broke up a long time back (i am over the relationship), but my life has not fully gotten back on track. i guess my problem stems from benchmarking my life now, against how it was prior to entering that r'ship; previously, had quite a number of fds and very fulfilling social life - now, i have 1 "fd" who really uses me to advance his career, and free time is spent alone.</p>
              <p>being a rational adult, i figured the logical approach would be to push myself out of my comfort zone and take the first initiative. went online, got ignored. offline, received weird looks and even overheard condescending remarks - all i did was, "hi, i'm x, i'm new around here", and the typical response was "oh" *weird looks* *silence*; and i didn't just chat with ladies, but men too!</p>
              <p>i know, more often than not, new friends are met by way of introductions from mutual friends - but this is really hard to do when i only have 1 fd. more than that, i cannot depend on my colleagues; i'm not an admin staff, the rapport amongst my peers are really poor; they walk into office whenever they want, and leave without saying bye, and some choose to work from home most days.</p>
              <p>staying at home everyday is driving me nuts. literally. my flatmates are on good terms with each other; having dinner together most nights - but though i'm around, i never get invited.</p>
              <p>... i need to breathe.</p>

              <p>Fortunately u sdtill have your flatmates. Tried asking them out first by initiative?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i know how that feels bec for a period of time stayed alone. Indeed man is a social creature unless genetically different when born. SOmetimes admire those people who can self wrapped themselves up and can survive very much on their own totally without interaction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes we definitely have to make that first move.</p>

              <p>You can always join singles club and go for outings.</p>
              <p>Or if you can afford it, try go traveling, you will meet many like minded travellers if you are friendly enough.</p>
              <p>If you are expecting things to happen to you while you sit on your bum "waiting", I'd say you're as good as mold.</p>
              <p>It's ok to ask others out sometimes... don't be afraid of rejections.. just shrug it off and try another person , another day.</p>
              <p>For online conversation, the more secretive you are about yourself, the least likely people(strangers) will want to continue a conversation with you. Unless you come across as a very interesting online persona.</p>
              <p>Try harder.. good luck.</p>

              <p>No you did not.</p>
              <p>You are one heck of a wierd fella.</p>
              <p>Hell why do you even care how they react? <br>Do you owe them your livelihood?<br>Do yourself a favour and live without them. Your flat is for you to Nwa, sleep and make out. Go out and know more people by seriously talking to them with a good heart!</p>
              <p>What Jajabee... or Jojobee (lazy to scroll up) said is true, TONS of outings are available so if you are lazy, you wont enjoy the harvest.</p>
              <p>I remembered a part in Futurama ...God help those who help themselves by Dr Zoidberg</p>
              <p>Are you going to spend your whole life pleasing everyone? Even Dr Zoidberg who is ignored by everyone in PlanetExpress finds it easy to past time foraging on ranchy wastes.</p>
              <p>When I said LIVE WITHOUT THEM, I do not mean go online!<br>Go out and live a life. Life itself is not virtual. Its real! DEAL WITH IT!</p>
              <p>Life goes on with or without friends.<br>If you make good friends, you are lucky. How many here can seriously say they have friends who will die for them (spouses and family members not included)<br>Chances are... very few.</p>
              <p>They have their own lives and so do you.</p>
              <p>WAIT... you are looking for friends or relationship now?</p>
