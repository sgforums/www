            <div class='col-md body'>I have a friend who is turning 21 soon, she comes from a very tradition family and her parents expects her to be home by 10 plus if she has to go out with her boyfriend. She feels very upset as she knows that her boyfriend wants to spend more time with her but her parents don't like her spending too much time with her boyfriend. Although she respects the fact that her parents cares for her, she feel that she has also reached a sensible age where she can decide for herself. She oftens qurrels with her mom over the issue but her mom being very traditional and closed in her thinking, cannot understand her needs as a growing adult.<br><br>Indeed, i told her that all that her does is for her good as she cared but we both know that she needs her independence.<br><br>She felts that she is caught in the middle?<br>Can anyone help her?<br><br>Thanks</div>

If the timing is 10pm, once a while, call home earlier, says 8pm, and tell them you will be home around 1030 or 11pm, saying that you are with a gp of friends..however, dun mis use this method too often.<br><br>slowly, 11 to 12pm..however, from my gal friends' experience, this transition takes ages..so just bear with it lor<br><br>Most imptly, the parents must know she is going out with friends or bf who are trustworthy. So, its good for the bf to know the parents first, b4 attempting to stay out late with him..<br><br>Next time as a mother, will you want your daughther to stay out late with a bf whom you never met b4? or will you be more flexible if she is with some1 u have seen and know? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My advice to ur friend is tat..<br><br>Try not to quarrell with her mum.. The more u quarrell.. It will onli serves to worsen matters.. I'm caught in tis situation many a times..<br><br>Sometimes i think i spend too much time with my bf tat i think my mum got jealous! Coz in the past.. They're used to mi everydae @ home.. Keepin her company practically every dae.. But now.. I'm always out wheneva my bf is free..<br><br>Give time for mother to get used to it..I personally feel tat.. It could be partly worry n.. Jealousy..<br><br>As u mentioned.. Ur friend's mother onli met the bf durin cny? I assumed tat is onli once bah? Mayb instead of goin out.. Ask the bf to come over.. Both of the young couple can spend time tog.. N meanwhile.. Let ur friend's mother get to noe the guy beta..<br><br>B4.. My bf is in Tekong.. Once he's out.. He goes to work.. We been datin for quite long b4 my parents eva meet him.. After meetin few times.. i feel tat their naggin decrease significantly.. Still have alot.. But at least is much beta than b4..<br><br>My mother once said tat the more u argue.. the worst it will become n the more i will go against him..Tat reali shuts mi up!<br><br>If ur friend's mum is okie with it.. try askin.. say.. Instead of goin out.. can he come for dinner instead? or could he join us for dinner?<br><br>When the mother noes the guy beta.. I'm sure things will turn out beta.. Go slow.. Be patient..<br><br>It isn easy to let go..Sometimes.. i think to myself.. we're with our parents every dae.. 4 so many yrs of our life..<br><br>Now tat we met the one we love.. isn it tat we will wan spend every moment tog? why our parents object when they have so much of our time tog liao?<br><br>I realise tat..<br><br>Mayb wat our parents feel is tat.. They r now gettin older n older.. How mani more yrs to go?? Soon my daughter will be marryin out soon.. And her life will evolve ard her new family.. n even lesser time for us.. The onli time we have now is this few yrs b4 she got married.. after tat.. she still have a lifetime with her hubby to be..<br><br>mayb thinkin in their shoes helps us feels beta..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
