            <div class='col-md body'>Hi this is my first post here and i decided to post my problems here after browsing through the forum, knowing how helpful you people are. I dont really know how to start but here goes.<br><br>The thing which has been bothering me the most is the quarrel between my mum and i. It was like a week ago and she wanted me to help her unlock a cupboard coz she lost her key and i wasn't really keen on doing that coz that cupboard was bought not long ago and i didnt wanther to spend money. I asked her to find other methods. After a few days, while i was using the computer, she screamed at me saying i didnt want to open the cupboard for her coz i took her stuffs. At first i told her no i didnt, but she insisted on her mind set. After some time i couldnt take it anymore i quarreled with her. We have not been talking for a week. ( The reason she said i took her stuffs coz a few years ago, out of greed i took her money to buy the stuffs i wanted. And since i lost her trust, even after the years of work i put in to gain her trust.)<br><br>School. I retook my o levels this year as i failed my Mathematics and Science during my O'Levels last year. I always suck in maths and science i dont understand WHY i can NEVER remember formulars and numbers and stuffs, and i am sure i put in hard work. It never stays in there. The fact that i spent nearly 2k this year in a prviate school to retake my O'Levels makes me feel even more troubled.<br><br>Money, I am broke, damn broke and because of my non-fixed school hours, its nearly impossible to find a job. I save up money in order to go out for gatherings with my friends and stuffs when i have the time but it never seems to be enough. My friend owed me a hundred bucks and i have hinted to him that i need cash and ever since i am unable to contact him anymore, and i long treated the cash as gone. On the average my pocket money is around 8 bucks per day and i usually eat my one and only meal at night in order to save money. Alright, it may look like it will be enough to spend but i am a smoker.<br><br>Friends, I really really love my friends from the bottom of my heart but they never seems to appreciate that. When we are alone, things may be better but once we get in to groups, arrows of hurtful comments are passed towards me. I never understand why friends can behave so differently in groups and maybe in pairs. The nasty remarks have really lowered my self-confidence and i never try to speak up for myself because when i do, more remarks follow suit. I have little friends too.<br><br>I have an aspiration of being a columnist/journalist and i have taken my steps but seems like its really impossible and comments from my friends are bringing down my confidence. I used to contact a free lance columnist through e mail and the things she told me makes me feel like giving up too.<br><br>Now this is stupid. I own a 2 year old handphone which is not worth much money or anything like that but it was stolen or something just 5 hours ago. It really left me very very troubled because i am already in a cash flow problem and things like that happens. I know its my part to blame for losing the phone but who wants to lose their belongings?<br><br>I dont know but things never seems to go the right way for me and it seems like i am all by myself.<br><br>Maybe these may be nothing to you people out there but i really need help.<br>I think maybe life will be better off dead uh?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>all i can advice u is, just when you think things can't get any worse, they do... i've learned that life is like hour glass sand... sooner or later, everything hits rock bottom... u cannot choose how u feel but u can choose what u can do about it... think abt this, God didnt do it in one day, what makes u think u can??<br><br>Sometimes it's the things that you can't do, that bring out the brilliance of what you can... what a person hopes for is always what something better dan wat he has... learn to hope for the best, expect the worst and you'll be less shocked what life brings u...<br><br>life is never gud to anyone !!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks guys for all your advice i am feeling much much better now. I guess things will work out somehow. God didnt do it in one day, this struck me. Maybe things are not that bad afterall, or maybe i haven seen the worst yet to be. Maybe like Carpe said, everything hit the rock bottom and things cant get worst. Dragg, its not a matter of open it for her anot, its because i never thought she will make that assumption. Angel, thanks too you are getting hopes up for me and Gerrykoh, I am trying but its never easy. All i could say is that i am smoking much much lesser then in the past.</div>

Why not go to ITE?  When there's a will, there's a way.  Studis is never one way.  O level - JC - uni.  NO!  Me and many of my frens have our own stories.  Some din do well for JC and go poly study again.  Some study private etc etc..  It's whether u are willing to change.<br><br>Frens think that u cannot be a columnist?  Then ask them why.  Why they think you can't?  Are they juz pouring cold water on you or they really see your weakness that makes you not qualified to be one?  Seek and listen to advises and brush up on whatever you lack of.  Confidence is very important.  If you dun have the confidence to do something, you will never succeed.<br><br>And about your mum.. well, a mistaken may be forgiven but not forgotten.  This is very true.  So did u help her to unlock the cupboard?  Do something about it ya.  I tend to neglect my father when he was alive.  Now when I want to be filial and spend more time listening to him, I dun have the chance anymore.  Treasure your loved ones when they are still alive.  </span></div>
