              <p><br>Since you're an ex-fighter (if you really know what I meant), then why are you behaving wimpy like this in here?</p>
              <p>If you are only disturbed by one person, take your fight to that person who started it.</p>
              <p>Unless you tell me you're afraid of your life and what will happened after, then you still claimed to be an ex-fighter of dunno what fight club of what stupid school named yyyy.</p>
              <p>Go and trash it out with the "disturber of your peace" with DEADLY FORCE (Save the small talk when he is apologising for his stupid misunderstanding" and don't forget to thank me later.</p>

              <p><br>There are no secret societies in singapore. I repeat that. They already become a secret to the society already. secret becasue they bang a bit only the police will come get them. The law is too lenient with such people. A slow death should be what scumbags deserve. See too much movies these youngsters also want to be like the stars in the show. people here will not be impressed with the thread starter's story. what fighter? TS and his firends should be glad singapore got a law. if not straight one punch to the face what fighter? illegal betters, illegal gamlbles along, chao school ah beng, disco night club goers, drug sand pills, cigerettes and alcohol, fast ah beng cars and bikes. all the coolness fade when police siren sounds.</p>

              <p>- You are already a JC student, may I suggested that you grow up. All this fighting and gang thingy are nonsense. If you do get into this kind of violence and nonsense.

              <p>- Change A NEW hp number. And ignore him.</p>
              <p>- Since you have a mutual friend, isn't he a friend of your friend, a friend too? So could you ask your mutual friend do something? And why is the friend of your friend, your enemy?</p>
              <p>- Fling a police report is a good idea.</p>
              <p>- Please dont tell other people that  you are ex-fighter or gangster or been to boys' home or RTC and this sort of things, whether it is pri, sec or now. The immediate impression and thrust on you is drop to -100%. People in the society stay away from hooligans, even if it is something that happened to the person in the past 30 years ago. It is not that we look down on these people. We just dont want to get into their affairs, that includes friendship, employment, business and etc.    </p>
              <p>And dont think that teachers are superman !!!. </p>

              <p>I can say that if the gangster beat you up, were they be happy or easy to sleep at night?</p>
              <p>When you beat up somebody, you will not have a good night sleep cos' you dont know when you will get beaten from behind you.</p>
              <p>You will live in fear.</p>
              <p>So, my advise, dont fight.</p>

              <p><br>dn;t worry for him,. i know such ginahs have different age and differnt graddes one. grades in their level of cowardice. this one is only at the attention seeker level. he hs no deatil of his achievement as a fighter in his past *giggles* (i am always amused at how the SS classify their ranks with tatoos, fighters and calss) and provided he i only a ginah teenager. this one will continue with his life if he is studying or drop out without causing much troible. see he write here when he encounter problem that shows he still has a certain level of intellect in making decision or seeking help on top of his urge to show off his virtual fighter status.</p>
