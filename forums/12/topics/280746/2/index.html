Tell her you will call her back in 1 hours time and make sure you do.<br><br>then as time passes by, extend hours in between <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>You must remember that guys tend to relate more to their hobbies, while girls enjoy social company a lot more. That is why she is demanding on your attention - cos in a way, you are a hobby ma.<br><br>However, in time, with maturity, less time on her hands, more responsibilities and more confidence, things will change. Uhh.. which is why I mentioned teenage problem. You rarely see this in women of late 20s and 30s. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
