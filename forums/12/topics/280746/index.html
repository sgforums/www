Dont start by let him guess why you call him.. Guys dun like to guess.. Remembe rthat..<br><br>Start call him then just say things like Hey, How are you doin there? What r u doin.. Hows your day? keep it short enough<br><br>If hes busy with his friend .. just say: Alrite, i shall not disturb u with your friends la.. have fun and take care.. Yea.. it may sound simple,, but if u talk like that, he will even respect you more for being understanding..<br><br>We, guys dont really like gals to act cute or to get attention, what we guys want is an understanding gal, not a gal who want ppl to give attention to them.<br><br>If you got something really important, just leave a message,<br><br>Message is actually the only way to let the person whom doesnt wan to talk to you read it.. YOu can simply say, hey, i got important thing to ask you which is bla bla.. Would you mind to have some free time to help me out? If you dont, its alrite.
