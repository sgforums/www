You can accept the way you are and get on with your life.... no need to care about what people feel.<br>2. Hangout with people with the same orientation and find strength.<br>3. Decide that you don't wish to be this way and seek professional help.<br><br></div>

I wish that I was born normally...</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I gonna quote part of my thesis on Homosexuality from CloUdiSm:<br><br><blockquote>'...It is true that woman are negative (yin) and man are positive (yang) - but the make-up of a human consist of two component, the soul and the body (your physical and your spiritual form).<br><br>Firstly, we must come to a mutual agreement that:<br><br>(I) Everything existed on Earth is natural. As it exists on Earth, it is a natural cycle of nature. Regardless of whatsoever ideology that is taught to us as 'bad', 'evil' or 'unnatural'... in the end, they are natural because it existedÂ…and it is not a myth. The classification of 'Good' and 'Evil' is but a product of man's division. A gay person is not a myth - it existed, therefore it is part of nature.<br><br>(II) Love is the attraction forge between two separate energies, namely negative (yin) and positive (yang). You are attracted to another person romantically because you two are unlike poles, not like poles.<br><br>(III) If we measure masculine and feminine energy on a scale - NOBODY is 100% masculine/feminine. Everybody falls in between this scale. You witness this by having feminine man and masculine woman.<br><br>IV) If you believe in reincarnation, what I am going to say will probably make sense to you.<br><br>MOST people, being heterosexuals or the majority, have similar energies with their soul and body (A man with yang-dominant soul or a woman with yin-dominant soul). These category of people falls in love with the opposite gender (with the exact opposite energy) and attraction foster.<br><br>However, there are a category of people with conflicting flow of energies within them. (A man with a yin-dominant or a woman with yang-dominant). When that happens, there will be constant, unconscious battle between the body and soul - both vying for superior control of the man/woman because like fire and water, both neutralise each other, which is one classic archetype of a person with deep-seated karmic revolving love and relationship.<br><br>I did some self research, with astrology and the speaking to gay people, and realise that there is a certain pattern to it: people falling under this category usually have afflicted planetary chart that spells difficulty or promise much hardship in love and relationship. (Afflicted Venus, Moon and Uranus, Neptune, 5th, 7th and sometimes 8th house is involved). How this is achieve? it is believed that we will be reincarnated into the gender our soul dictates - and of course if our soul is masculine, we will always born into a man and when the energies of our soul and body is the same - we are heterosexual... the common or the majority. After several reincarnations into a guy, if you change one particular reincarnation to a female... there will be a clash between our higher self and our biological make-up because the soul would find familiarity being a guy (and at times, would seek to revert back to this familiar ground), while society and the body works to impart 'new lessons' of being a woman (unfamiliar ground).<br><br>You mentioned that a relationship between two genders is 'unnatural' - remember the mutual agreement? Love is the attraction between two unlike poles? What if the energies of soul between the two gay person is yin and yang separately? Spiritually speaking, you must agree with me that this Love is also natural (albeit physically, we all know that we ain't made for two man/woman to have sex). Next time when you see a gay couple - take some time to observe; you will notice that one mate will be taking on the masculine role (e.g butch) and the other fulfilling the feminine role (e.g. passive). And the roles they adopt reflect the energy in their soul.<br><br>One might argue that the reason for this phenomenon is because a gay couple replicate the model of a heterosexual relationship, in which there must be a 'man' and 'woman' in a relationship. The fact is, indeed, there must be two separate energies before Love can foster. And the two separate energies will divide itself clearly on the masculine and feminine role of the couple. The gay man will not be interested in heterosexual woman because they share similar negative/yin energies in their soul and vice versa.<br><br>Contrary to traditional belief: A gay person could achieve as much, if not better, success than a heterosexual (Career is govern by 10th house/Saturn/Capricorn in natal placing). A gay person is NOT hinder in that manner and anything that doesn't overlap very much with love and relationship (Those affected usually includes: 4th house (Moon, Cancer ruling) - Family is affected, 2nd/7th house (Taurus and Libra ruling) - self esteem and marriage is affected, 11th house (Aquarius ruling) - friendship is affected, 12th house (Pisces ruling) - Unconscious/karma is triggered).<br><br>Then after doing all my self research regarding Homosexuality, or people with sexual crisis; I came to one main conclusion. People being tormented by homosexuality all their life, usually suffer from this: It is a mechanism created by karma, inflicted into a person this lifetime because he/she has been cruel/misuse the power of love previously. To have that force exuded previously and now returning to him/her - the cruelty of love now befall onto the person, suffering his own cruelty/misrepresentation of love he previously exuded....'</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> From there, you probably got two possible long term solutions to eradicate those conflicts. One is as what FI said: you seek your inner self, which is familiar to your soul, accept your original soul and reject current life lesson on your 'new gender' or seek to mollify your inner self by attempting to take on this 'new lesson' and balance out everything from within.<br><br>Trying to maintain 'both world' usually result in subconscious conflicts that would devour you emotionally.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by the.owl:<br>If you are serious, I would suggest seeking counselling, probably got psychiatrists for this kind of thing.</blockquote>You are correct.  Psychiatrists do provide effective treatment for homosexuals.  TS please do not be influenced by the few people in the gay community who want to remain gay.  Being homosexual does affect the quality of a person's life, seek help before it is too late.  Cheapest option is to get a referral letter from the polyclinic.<br><br></div>
