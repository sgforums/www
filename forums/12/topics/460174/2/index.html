              <p>Devoted GAL,</p>
              <p>You really need to wake up from your fairy tale dream.</p>
              <p>I know.. you want to believe you married a Prince Charming.</p>
              <p>But lets be frank , and brutally honest...</p>
              <p>Your man is a S.O.B.. a user... a piece of shit.</p>
              <p>Seriously... after 8 years... of USING you... he still didn't want to pick up the tab.. ROM cost him how much... $50 to register.. WTF.. and you didn't even get a wedding ceremony ? He won't even let you walk down the ailse in your dream wedding gown. Instead he puts you in shitty situation...</p>
              <p>Now he wants to dump you for a make believe china mistress..</p>
              <p>No he doesn't love you.... I think he actually HATES you.</p>
              <p>Yet you still want to get all heart broken , depressed and weak over this piece of shit.</p>
              <p>If you so truly believe you deserve a douche bag like him... you probably do deserve it.</p>
              <p> After 2 years of relationship , and he still havn't propose.. you should have LEFT him already.. MOVE ON to the next interested party.</p>
              <p>8 years of free milk... why would he need to buy the cow ? How cheap can you get ?</p>

              <p>Your story is not very different from one of my friend... The only difference is, she is now dead. died of cancer. Also, her first marathon relationship since secondary school. </p>
              <p>My friend , she also very devoted, went thru NS with him, degree, career .. Etc etc..then , after her husband found out she got cancer... He dumped her.. He told her, he wants children... Now she has cancer..cannot have children.. And scared pass the cancer gene to his offspring.</p>
              <p>Recently I saw her ex, and found out.. He didn't know she was dead. So I told him. His response was. "oh, I didn't know".. Shrug his shoulders and walk off with his new wife. My mind went blank... I couldn't believe how cruel a man can be... </p>
              <p>Girl, u can love a man.. But u must keep your soul. You can love a selfish man, you can also love a tyrant . but in the end..When his heart is cold...he can become cruel.... So..please..... You must take care of yourself.</p>

              <p>Ok. Maybe using hate was too strong. </p>
              <p>What I am trying to say is.. On their current situation.. It's like TS is this ball and chain... Holding back he husband ..Like the prisoner of 8 years.Who.. Found the key to freedom.. But got held back by this "burden".</p>
              <p>If I am the prisoner, I will be annoyed by the ball and chain... And I couldn't wait to shake the chain off... And run towards the big open field.</p>
              <p>So, ok... Perhaps..annoyance is a better word.</p>

              <p>The reason why there's a date line for relationship.. And typically 2 years is very simple.</p>
              <p>There is a category of men... Known as the commitmentphobes... Meaning, commitment phobia...they run away whenever a woman wants her man to commit to her. So, if u are looking for a happy ending... Avoid this type of men, because u will be guaranteed to be disappointed. </p>
              <p>By using the two years as mark. If this guy shows reluctance to commit.. It's time to high tail out of the relationship. </p>
              <p>Two years is also just nice to get to know a person more intimately and is sufficient time to find out if both of u are compatible.</p>
              <p>But typically, if a man is indeed in love with you.. And is not a commitmentphobe... He would have made up his mind to marry u within the first year of a relationship. Some are able to make up their mind within 6 months...</p>
              <p>For ur case... I highly suspect u are dating a commitmentphobe.... And the reason why the relationship can last 8 years is because u never ask him for commitment ... Hence he never need to run. </p>
              <p>But now... With pressures from families.. And moral obligation... He has no more reason not to....And so... He runs. Leaving you behind to pick up the pieces. </p>

              <p>Well, as the movie "Forrest Gump", life is just like a box of chocs, you nvr know what you going to get.</p>
              <p>Bright side is that you know he is not the right one for you eventually. Just move on. Like many here said, once he experienced something new it's hard to go back. Only when he is tired of those new excitements. Unless you are willing to do that, if not then move on and life goes on. Your right one will sure to come along the way.</p>

              <p>I am usually not a superstitious person. But it seems even the deities are trying to tell you something.</p>
              <p>Telling his mother will not do much. Doing so will only create more animosity between you, him and his mom.</p>
              <p>Granted
                       his mom is a responsible person.. but unfortunately, you are not 
                      married to his mom... you are married to the son who is an individual 
                      being.</p>
              <p>Even if his mom sided with you... still she cannot force 
                      him to continue the relationship against his will. And surely, you 
                      wouldn't want that either.</p>
              <p>Better he tell his family himself... at
                       his own time.. at his own pace... ultimately... after you and him are 
                      no longer together... he will need to face them on his own, because they
                       are HIS family.</p>
              <p>As a married person... I am telling you this... 
                      even tho you married "into" his family, and as customary practise.. they
                       "accept" you into the family... remember , it is <strong>customary</strong> only... you don't become their blood, and you never will.</p>
              <p>If
                       there be any reason you done something against best interest of their 
                      son... YOU will be the one they boot out. YOU will be the one they get 
                      rid off. They will not treat you like blood.. so just keep this in mind.</p>
              <p>Again...
                       like I mentioned before.... you need to go live your life..live it like
                       you've been just released from the prison after 8 years of devotion.</p>
              <p>Live life with passion and flare EVERYDAY , like there is no tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Stop clinging on to someone else's dream... go live out your OWN dream.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I be in your shoes... I be telling him... " If you don't want to stay married with me, don't force yourself. I rather a man who wants to be with me... than one who feels obligated to be beside me"</p>
              <p>A marriage is a union of two.. marriage is not a lonely journey...like what yours has become...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like old Fuggazi used to say.. <strong>love is not beggarly.</strong></p>
              <p>Add: when your hubby comes home and tell his mom, he is in love with a China girl, an she is pregnant with her grandchild... Do u think his mom is going to tell him to leave that girl ? </p>
              <p>The first thing his mom will do, is tell u so sorry, but u need to get lost....</p>
              <p>Then what are you going to do? Cry ur eyes out and keep harping on your undying love for your hubby ? Remind them, The 8 years u invested on the relationship ? Keep telling them u will wait and hope one day he will come back to love you again ? You tell me.</p>

              <p>Alvin Tan and vivian lee blogs received too bad critics because they make their online materials like porn and sickening shit. they made a mistake by not hiring me to plan and shoot all their photos and videos.</p>

              <p>Terence Cao is a high profile case...but he is not the first one already.</p>
              <p> I personally have seen so many similar cases... I also talked to some China co-worker about why they don't want to marry China men.</p>
              <p>In China, the government is very very restrictive... if a young couple want to get married, they need to get approval from their superiors.Every aspect of their life is controlled by the government... it's scary.</p>
              <p>The China women folks are FLEEING their own country.. so any foreign men they can find.. they LATCH on immediately.... some even divorce their husbands to get out of China when they have a foreign lover.</p>
              <p>It's a social problem that had spilled out from China and is now affecting foreign marriages as China economy opens up more..</p>
              <p>So,  unless China Govt do something about this, you will have more China women destroying marriages of foreign families just so they can free themselves.</p>

              <p>The more you want to forget.. the more you remember...</p>
              <p>I think you should just stop blaming yourself... yes, your situation is not ideal.. but that's not the end of your world.</p>
              <p>Just roll with the changes... like what we hear a lot... he is part of your fate.. but he is not your destiny.</p>
