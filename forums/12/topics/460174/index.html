              <p>You are a very simple gal... but you married a NOT so simple guy.</p>
              <p>He has big dreams, he has big ambitions, he has big hopes.</p>
              <p>But you are the simple wife... will not fit into his big picture.</p>
              <p>For the past 8 years... he was the typical great guy for a simple gal... but now opportunities has opened up for him.....</p>
              <p>Now, The world is exciting out there for him.. much to explore , much to experience... a simple life with a simple gal just will not do... he wants to walk through that door.. a single guy.. he wants to be freee.....</p>
              <p>With Opportunities abound for him... the glitzy life he envisioned as an expat in the big bad world of China cities.... You the simple gal... seems. too... boring.</p>
              <p>By the way.. why arn't you going with him to China... surely you also want to explore the world, yes ?</p>
              <p>Girl, you have become boring... dust is settling on your hair ... cobwebs are growing between your ears.... you have become the dreaded " Yellow face ah poh"....</p>
              <p>I suggest you let him be... live your life again.. make it exciting again... if he wants to be part of your life... that's his choice... you cannot make him....</p>
              <p>But you need to start breathing the fresh air... put on your explorer hats , sling that world travelling backpack on your back and head out to the wild.</p>
              <p>I would wish him all the best.. and hopefully he finds what he seeks in that fast and furious world .</p>
              <p>In the end... we all just want a little pasture of peace and quiet... with gentle winds blowing in our face... but occasionally... in order to get there... we hav to come full circle in our life.</p>

              <p>You must have mistaken me for the name of your lousy bar, talk cock sing song. Nobody want to go to your useless bar. Boring.</p>
              <p>Of course, it is political. The guy is still single so he is not oblige to remain loyal to TS. However if the guy is married to TS, the guy may just cheat on her with one night stands but won't go farther than that, because he knows he risk losing half his inheritance in any divorce. So he will remain in the marriage. Men are like that.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are myraids of pretty girls in this world. If your hb has a roving eyes, you will soon find yourself in competition with all the females in this world. You always feel troubled and checked on him incessently, which leaves u no time and energy to develop your career or focus on your studies. You will end up depressed and worthless. You should find a guy who believes you are the most special, beautiful and unique girl and will love, respect and give you happiness and attention. Hold your head high and donâ€™t lower yourself to his level by comparing yourself with all the PRC gals. Dont waste anymore precious time. Be gracious and magnanimous and give up everything you have with him including HDB, etc. You wish him all the best. You can let go of him gradually by thinking this way. Love thyself. You deserve to be loved by the right person who comes later in your life.</div>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> I sense your deep pain, hurt and anguish; truly it is a great struggle having to lead a relationship of eight years - only to see this dream shatter into glass pieces seemingly overnight. It is only natural to be adamantly attached to the past and the length of the relationship, especially since the taste of marriage life is about to begin in your new matrimonial home.</p>
              <p>It is like flipping through the next chapter of your personal love novel and, ironically, revealing a chapter of tragedy - and not one of blissfulness.</p>
              <p>It takes two to clap; surely your last effort in trying to salvage a relationship is an effortful feat to protect what’s left of your relationship, just remember that no amount of persuasion, influence or coercion could resurrect a man who has never loved you because you cannot lose something that never exist nor fix something that has never been there.</p>
              <p>Our disappointment and sadness would naturally fall through tears upon this realization. I truly feel you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif">  <br><br>*** <br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> He is contemplating because there are many factors to consider, many things to ‘lose’ and many systemic damage to minimize. In addition, it is likely that you do not have full information or reason for his decision. If he could lead eight years of a ‘loveless’ relationship, my curiosity would be ‘why now?’ Granted that there might be push factors (e.g. he doesn’t love you actually… not the one he is looking for, etc), but I believe there are also events happening, unconscious to you, which generate significant pull factor/s.</p>
              <p>Love is not a gamble; we all take calculated risk. You married him because you love him and not because of chance: there are emotions, experiences, time and investment plough into the fields of love. It is not merely dice rolling, entirely at mercy of luck and chances.</p>
              <p>Other than trying to win back the relationship, I suggest you might want to have a heart-to-heart talk with him and know the ‘pull factors’ at work to understand the terrain of the battle you are fighting on. Only then, you could have better clarity of your relationship and decide what you could or should do about it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"></p>

                      I come to realize love has different levels and rather arbitrary to define.  No one can agree... but i have to point out that the bf you see is through lovey surgary coated lens... Love can be rational so i hope you can protect your own heart more than anything else.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> If it has something to do with his career and strictly not a third party, your position is still somewhat slightly better. However, I do find it contradicting when he said (in your earlier post) that he is afraid of 'falling in love with other girls', which seemed to me that this is somehow inconsistent with his stance of wanting to be career-focus. If that was his reasoning, then he shouldn't be worried about falling for other girls, much more than worried about not advancing fast enough for his career. </p>
              <p>There are a number of possible hypothesis; which is why I say it really depends on what is going on behind screen.</p>
              <p>For example, a man could find growing affection towards another woman but he <em>might</em> not technically be 'having an affair' because nothing is cast into stone. In this case, he is right that there is no third party because nothing has happened. But the circumstances <em>probably </em>made him realized something about the relationship, which has caused major quakes. In that case, career-focus might not be the reason; it also served as a convenient distraction from the real problem, almost like a form of escapism. </p>
              <p>Truly, there are several tracks to this. However, what kind of decision you make depends on how much information you have on hand. The good thing about having more information is that you would discover discrepancy by comparing notes. Out of curiosity, I have a few critical questions:</p>
              <p>I) If he doesn't love you from the start, what kept him going on for so many years? Brutally speaking, is he is waiting for the right opportunity to leap to someone else better? </p>
              <p>II) Are you giving him any form of pressure or obstacle when it comes to his career? If he could cope with having you and his career previously, what made the change?</p>
              <p>III) Does he mean that if he wants to focus on his career, he doesn't need or want any relationship? Or does he not want you only? But he is fine if someone else comes along?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"></p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> If it has something to do with his career
                                              and strictly not a third party, your position is still somewhat
                                              slightly better. However, I do find it contradicting when he said
                                              (in your earlier post) that he is afraid of 'falling in love with
                                              other girls', which seemed to me that this is somehow inconsistent
                                              with his stance of wanting to be career-focus. If that was his
                                              reasoning, then he shouldn't be worried about falling for other
                                              girls, much more than worried about not advancing fast enough for
                                              his career. </p>
              <p>There are a number of possible hypothesis; which is why I say it
                                              really depends on what is going on behind screen.</p>
              <p>For example, a man could find growing affection towards another
                                              woman but he <em>might</em> not technically be 'having an affair'
                                              because nothing is cast into stone. In this case, he is right that
                                              there is no third party because nothing has happened. But the
                                              circumstances <em>probably</em> made him realized something about
                                              the relationship, which has caused major quakes. In that
                                              case, career-focus might not be the reason; it also served as
                                              a convenient distraction from the real problem, almost like a form
                                              of escapism. </p>
              <p>Truly, there are several tracks to this. However, what kind of
                                              decision you make depends on how much information you have on hand.
                                              The good thing about having more information is that you would
                                              discover discrepancy by comparing notes. Out of curiosity, I have a
                                              few critical questions:</p>
              <p>I) If he doesn't love you from the start, what kept him going on
                                              for so many years? Brutely speaking, if he is waiting for the right
                                              opportunity to leap to someone else better? </p>
              <p>II) Are you giving him any form of pressure or obstacle when it
                                              comes to his career? If he could cope with having you and his
                                              career previously, what made the change?</p>
              <p>III) Does he mean that if he wants to focus on his career, he
                                              doesn't need or want any relationship? Or does he not want you
                                              only? But he is fine if someone else comes along?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"></p>

              <p>C'mon lah Yun, don't you see ? That man wants the best of both worlds.</p>
              <p>He wants the cake AND eat it too. Career is a lame excuse... many of my friends have a family AND advance their career overseas....</p>
              <p>But at least he is upfront and honest about it. At least he has some guilty conscience.</p>
              <p>Most married men will just go there.. have an affair , start a new family BEHIND the wife's back. When the wife finds out.. she files for divorce... if she don't... the men continues what he does. until he get caught. ... or until the China mistress calls up the Singaporean wife and tell her to fark off.</p>
              <p>If he can't find a replacement.. he comes home to a wife waiting for him in their co-owned house..life goes on... and he goes back to China to have flings.</p>
              <p>If he can find a replacement.. he divorce his wife.. sell the house... and bring the new wife into Singapore. Worst yet... boot the old wife out of that marital home.. and let new wife move in.</p>
              <p>No China wife wants to live in China if she has a Singaporean husband or from any other country.</p>
              <p>Starting a family in China means.. they have to play by China's rule.. ONE CHILD POLICY and whatever restrictions imposed on China citizens.</p>
              <p>Their foreign policy sucks..and it's almost impossible for China people to leave their country without an exit VISA. The singaporean husband is a TICKET out of theirdraconian rule.</p>
              <p>So eventually... the China wife will want to come to live in Singapore. If TS husband is still married to TS... he cannot get his new China wife a spouse visa.</p>
              <p>The ending is the same... he will have to divorce her ... now or later.</p>
              <p>Sure.. keep the hope up .. maybe he CAN'T find a replacement.. but the chances is very very slim.....the husband is already looking and salivating over the potential and possibilities of his China adventures.</p>
              <p>TS is just his spare tire.. just in case things don't work out for him in China... TS is the fall back wife...</p>
              <p>Just face the reality and move on... it'll be better for everyone. 8 years only... some people spent 10-15 years of their life and still separate.</p>

              <p>Devoted GAL,</p>
              <p>You really need to wake up from your fairy tale dream.</p>
              <p>I know.. you want to believe you married a Prince Charming.</p>
              <p>But lets be frank , and brutally honest...</p>
              <p>Your man is a S.O.B.. a user... a piece of shit.</p>
              <p>Seriously... after 8 years... of USING you... he still didn't want to pick up the tab.. ROM cost him how much... $50 to register.. WTF.. and you didn't even get a wedding ceremony ? He won't even let you walk down the ailse in your dream wedding gown. Instead he puts you in shitty situation...</p>
              <p>Now he wants to dump you for a make believe china mistress..</p>
              <p>No he doesn't love you.... I think he actually HATES you.</p>
              <p>Yet you still want to get all heart broken , depressed and weak over this piece of shit.</p>
              <p>If you so truly believe you deserve a douche bag like him... you probably do deserve it.</p>
              <p> After 2 years of relationship , and he still havn't propose.. you should have LEFT him already.. MOVE ON to the next interested party.</p>
              <p>8 years of free milk... why would he need to buy the cow ? How cheap can you get ?</p>
