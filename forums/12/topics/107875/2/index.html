            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Yunhaier.. your words really hurt but i know that it has been a thorough analysis of what's going on.</span> I printed out your post and had been reading it over and over again till what you said stay in my heart and mind.<br><br>You are right that he is a different man now. His feelings for me are probably twisted and have mutated. He is no longer the simple guy whom I first met. Maybe he didn't scheme his way to hold me captive emotionally to get sex, but the outcome is similar. He did get what he wanted from me. I was simply too weak to resist him. Being 8 yrs older didn't stop me from being indulgent emotionally.<br><br>I agreed too that I was so vulnerable as I had been drained and given too much to maintain any r/s with him for too long on my own. There was no emotional support from anyone. <strong>On this, I want to thank everyone here who had replied and advised. You don't know the tremendous help you have given to me. </strong><br><br>today, i told him via sms that i won't contact him unless necessary. he replied cordially and told me that he would keep in touch with me. since lunch, i had not heard from him.<br><br>i will take baby steps for now. seeing the 'real' him through the posts here has really helped me to stop thinking too fondly of him. Yunhaier's advice is right - memories are to be kept and not lived on. The past is vanished and won't return. What is now is different and has changed from what it was at first.<br><br>Devil1976, I am 8 yrs older than him. That's all I will say. Age really is nothing in affairs of the heart, otherwise, I should have been wiser. Thanks.</div>

Why do u torment urself?<br><br>Just think clearly....what is the direction of ur relationship with him, what does the future hold, can u two be happy together, etc. Get some time alone and think.<br><br>If the conclusion of ur thinkings is that the relationship is not sustainable, then just break off, move on.<br><br>I know u love him alot. But if the two of u cant get together, then just forget it. Move on. It's not worth it. Get busy with work, hobby, go out with friends, meet new people, know more guys. Slowly you will forget him. Dont spend so much time thinking about him. Whenever u start thinking about him, distract urself with something else.<br><br>All the best.<br><br></div>

His feelings for me are probably twisted and have mutated. He is no longer the simple guy whom I first met. Maybe he didn't scheme his way to hold me captive emotionally to get sex, but the outcome is similar. He did get what he wanted from me. I was simply too weak to resist him. Being 8 yrs older didn't stop me from being indulgent emotionally.<br><br>I agreed too that I was so vulnerable as I had been drained and given too much to maintain any r/s with him for too long on my own. There was no emotional support from anyone. [b]On this, I want to thank everyone here who had replied and advised. You don't know the tremendous help you have given to me. </strong><br><br>today, i told him via sms that i won't contact him unless necessary. he replied cordially and told me that he would keep in touch with me. since lunch, i had not heard from him.<br><br>i will take baby steps for now. seeing the 'real' him through the posts here has really helped me to stop thinking too fondly of him. Yunhaier's advice is right - memories are to be kept and not lived on. The past is vanished and won't return. What is now is different and has changed from what it was at first.<br><br>Devil1976, I am 8 yrs older than him. That's all I will say. Age really is nothing in affairs of the heart, otherwise, I should have been wiser. Thanks.[/b]</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Advice are usually words people never wanted to hear.<br><br>And relationship is often the element that causes that.<br><br>P.S: Remain strong... you will be alright. *pat pat*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i didn't succeed in forgetting him.<br><br>we met up very frequently recently and of course, as in the past, we just couldn't stop being intimate...<br><br>i remember what was shared here.. that it's just lust and he's just using me to satisfy his sexual needs. however, it really didn't feel like it was just lust. he was so tender and loving. many would say men are just that in bed but there were many moments of quient intense looks in between when we almost cried together again, naked.<br><br>i denied my feelings for him to him. always saying i do not feel for him at all. i know it relieves him and i am just happy talking to him.. i just don't want him to worry or feel guilty again. though the fact is, my heart still beats so fast and i still get goosebumps whenever i see him in my mind... it had been almost 700+++ days since i first gave my heart away to him. feelings don't just go away? has anyone felt so deeply that absence only sharpens how you feel? sometimes, it's so overwhelming that i'm grateful i have found him but tortured that i can't be with him this life.<br><br>now, no matter what, i just feel so contented every day that we are back in close contact though we promise each other that we'll only be friends... it'd enough for me. i love to see his smile in his sms...<br><br>i know i am silly, almost stupid, but i love him. him, only.<br><br></div>
