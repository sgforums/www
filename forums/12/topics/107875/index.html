To him it might be just only lust.. to you.. you said you love him.. He went with another girl.. and broke up saying he will not see the girl anymore.. what's the reason behind it?? The girl is of his age.. slightly younger.. but why did he choose you over her?? Is there something that the other girl couln't satisfies his needs and wants.. but you can??<br><br>It seems to me.. that he jua wanna make it out with you.. and then again.. he told you he doesn't want to have a gf... but why are you still with him?? He knows that you love him alot.. he knows that he can take control over you.. He knows you will do anything for him.. He got all your weakness... You can simply give him wat he asked for..<br><br>I dunno whether he do really care for you.. or be true to you.. though he might send messages asking about you.. and blah blah.. he can do this jus for the sake of kepping you by his side.. making you think that he cared for you.. He doesnt wan you to go out with others.. As he is afraid that one day you might jus leave him.. and he got nothing form then on.. Age is not a matter.. but if he's really sincere enough you wont have to face such problems.. if Love is accounted for!<br><br>You know and old enough to differentiate all these.. For sure.. you know you will get cheated.. but you still bang your head against it.. Why?? Jus becos you both can satifies each other?? that's all?? jus be cos you wanted to be in a r/s.. and then he came along..?? Are you sure this is wat you want?? Will you still be happy afterall??<br><br>I suggest you settle your feelings and emotions down first.. then seriously think about this so-called relationship you had with him..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for your advice people... i really appreciate them very much.<br><br>This is the first time I receive feedback about my situaiton as my r/s with him had been underground and with the way things are going, it doesn't make sense if i talk to my friends about him.<br><br>he did try not to be intimate with me as he said he was worried if he would hurt me more after we had sex. it was partly my fault to deny my feelings towards him when we talked so that i would still see him. whenever we met up, the chemistry would be so strong that we always couldn't resist each other. it wasn't entirely his fault.<br><br>he told me if i ever allow another man to have sex with me, he would never meet me or ever touch me again. i asked him why but he said i do not need to know the answer.<br><br>as with Magnus, is it true that i should stop being there so that he may realise that he needs me?<br><br>or, he never really needed me..<br><br>Sunrise, i do not know if this is lust or love but when we made out, i felt like i was giving myself to someone who really owns me.. sorry to sound so silly..<br></div>

It's an underground r/s between u and him.  Then what about him and that girl?  Was their r/s open?  How did his family threaten him?  He told you?  Or his family looked you up?  No doubt about that?  Think again, why do both of you end up in bed everytime you met?  And after getting intimate with you, he stayed a distance.  It seems that he is only after free sex.  Besides that, I wonder does he get money from you..He dun allow you to be intimate with other guys..why?  coz he is selfish..Have you ever wondered who else has he slept with?  Or is there other underground r/s that you never know?<br><br>My advice for you is to forget him.  I know it is not possible..but please have a life of your own, engage in healthy activities, make frens..and stay away from him, avoid all contacts with him and never be soft hearted again.  If he ever ask to have sex again, ask him..what can he give you?  Since he dun want attachment..it means he dun want to be responsible.  Words are dirt cheap.  He can act as tho he loves you, he can be loving and tender to you in bed, but after those intimate moments, how does he treat you?<br><br>Don't be silly.  Most people are blinded by love.  But is this an one-sided love?<br>Do you still want to carry on sleeping with him and torture yourself this way?  You deserve someone who truly loves you and able to commit to a r/s.<br><br>Wish you all the best.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

And after getting intimate with you, he stayed a distance.  It seems that he is only after free sex.  Besides that, I wonder does he get money from you..He dun allow you to be intimate with other guys..why?  coz he is selfish..Have you ever wondered who else has he slept with?  Or is there other underground r/s that you never know?</div></blockquote>thanks! come to think of it, his mother never called me up though if she had wanted to, she could have checked his hp for my number. yes, he told me how his family threatened him and objected to our r/s. now that you mentioned this, i'm having my doubts...<br><br>his r/s with the girl is open. he brought her to visit his relatives within a week after they met.<br><br>he didn't get any money from me but i always paid for the expenses most of the time. he would chip in when he could.<br><br>i don't know if he has other underground r/s but when he showed me his hp in exchange for mine to check the smses..  i don't see any from other girls.<br><br>just now, he seemed angry via sms when i told him i may go out with the other guy. 2-3 sms later, he sounded cordial in a polite way again.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Magnus</span>, he said there's no future for us. he always said that i'm pretty enough to find someone else but when i do mention someone else, he will be angry at me and tell me not to spite him. He also told me that he will never do anything that will upset his family. i know i am being silly but the more filial he is, the more i can't bring myself to blame him.<br><br>i do not know how i can openly discuss with him without sounding pushy like how GTO suggested.. neither do i know how to turn away from him completely.<br><br>once i close my eyes, i see his ...<br><br>...and when my eyes are open, i search for someone like him on the streets.. or anything that reminds me of him.</div>
