              <p>hi</p>
              <p>I got a problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>me and my gf have decided to break up when this year end. the reason is cause of our religion and race issues.</p>
              <p>we still love each other but she dont wish to carry on anymore cause she say she's stress with hiding our r/s from her parents especialy her mum.</p>
              <p>she's brought up in a quite religious buddhist family and she's very filial to her parents. her parents live in jb while she live and work in sg.</p>
              <p>as her mum dont know about me, she thinks that she's hanging around with bad company. everytime go out and even seldom go back jb anymore.</p>
              <p>oh ya.. she works shift work with only 2 off day per week. not only is she working, she's also doing her part time degree here. thus making her not want to go back jb even more as her schedule is pretty hectic. but her mum dont understand this part and my gf dont even want to explain to her as she feel guilty not going back. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I want to clarify and take responsibility of her actions to her parents. I got her house phone number. should i arrange for a meet up in jb?</p>
              <p>I cant let my gf know also cause she dont want me to be involve in her family matters. but i think, i should explain everything to her parents from a-z wad happen to her daughter as im part of it.</p>
              <p>from wad i heard about her, her parents are abit racist and stereotype my race. well, i dont blame them.</p>
              <p>i'm having sleepless night thinking whether i should do it or not. should i? how should i go about doing it?</p>

              <p>You have good intentions here - but think it through one last time before you come to a decision.</p>
              <p>Will she be in any form of trouble even if you come clean with her parents?</p>
              <p>Will there be a strain on their family ties between them because there was already deception involved?</p>
              <p>Will she hate you for doing this (even if it's for her own good and because you love her and it's the right thing to do) without her knowledge?</p>
              <p>Don't forget - your girlfriend has already lied to her parents - they might not take such deceit well, even IF you are decent enough to tell them the truth.</p>

              <p>hi</p>
              <p>I got a problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>me and my gf have decided to break up when this year end. the reason is cause of our religion and race issues.</p>
              <p>we still love each other but she dont wish to carry on anymore cause she say she's stress with hiding our r/s from her parents especialy her mum.</p>
              <p>she's brought up in a quite religious buddhist family and she's very filial to her parents. her parents live in jb while she live and work in sg.</p>
              <p>as her mum dont know about me, she thinks that she's hanging around with bad company. everytime go out and even seldom go back jb anymore.</p>
              <p>oh ya.. she works shift work with only 2 off day per week. not only is she working, she's also doing her part time degree here. thus making her not want to go back jb even more as her schedule is pretty hectic. but her mum dont understand this part and my gf dont even want to explain to her as she feel guilty not going back. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I want to clarify and take responsibility of her actions to her parents. I got her house phone number. should i arrange for a meet up in jb?</p>
              <p>I cant let my gf know also cause she dont want me to be involve in her family matters. but i think, i should explain everything to her parents from a-z wad happen to her daughter as im part of it.</p>
              <p>from wad i heard about her, her parents are abit racist and stereotype my race. well, i dont blame them.</p>
              <p>i'm having sleepless night thinking whether i should do it or not. should i? how should i go about doing it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>help</p>
