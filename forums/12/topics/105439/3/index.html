IF you ever found someone you like and you think it is possible between you and him/her, I would suggest you put religion aside 1st. Religion have been around for few hundred/thousand years, it will be around everytime and anytime.

You can accept all her "don'ts" right now, but will you be able to accept that 5 years down the right? When your faith grows really strong? Maybe your love for her is strong enough to overcome all obstacles, that only you'll know.<br><br>As for true love and accepting people for who they are, I do believe that she tries to accept your faith, but is very insecured about her future with you. Perhaps she wants to be assured that you will not abandon her in the name of God somewhere down the road.<br><br>For some reason, people seem to forget that free thinker has their own faith and beliefs too. What do you have to give to accept a free thinker as who she is, except that it's against your faith and belief? This is no more than what she has to sacrifice to accept you as a Christain. On top of that, she has to accept your religious practices? (not that it's anything wrong, it's just difficult to accept everything for a non-believer)<br><br>Marriage and relationship is about love and compromises. The stronger your love, the more you can compromise. However, do you feel happy in compromising all the time? How much is too much for the both of you? Or are you better off finding that someone special who has the same belief as you?<br><br>My honest opinion.<br>Good luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, you need to moderate your life.God does not need so much concrete actions as much as a pure heart and a generous soul towards those you love.By sharing your time with her, it does not make you a bad Christian, rather you are of a more forgiving and sacrificial one.You are having the ckassic behaviour of a new convert, full of zeal, perhaps too much too.Give it a while, elt your life fall back into a balance.Keep God in your heart and let him guide you, and you will realise that you can have both.</div>

Having or not having a girlfriend doesnt make you closer to God. To god, what matters most is whether you have lead a good life on earth. Do Good and Be good. That is more important. And righteousness does NOT mean christian in the bible. you have interpreted wrongly my friend. NO religious books will tell you not to mix with other people from other religion. if a religious book did that, it most certainly ISNT GOD"S WORDS.
