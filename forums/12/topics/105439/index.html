If you intend to marry this woman, she'll be your WIFE in the future.. If you can't learn to appreciate her now, how are you suppose to take care of her in the future?<br><br>If your god knows, I don't think you would want you to ruin your own marriage and future because of him too..? REMEMBER. A relationship with GOD is of ETERNITY and NOT reality. In this world, you'll need your WIFE. In your heart, you'll need your GOD for your spirit... Hope this answers you....</div>

Our religion will shape our belief, our views etc, but you still have to control everything in our hands.<br><br>My fren once told me that a catholic will not touch meat on every friday... y? becos their religion wants them to learn to  appreciate lower grade of food (not sure how to put it into words), in ancient times was fish, becos of the ending supply of fishes. and this practise carried till date. But one might ask is fish the "lower grade" of food now? If no, why did the catholic still follow that kind of practise?<br><br>Please note that this may not be the actually reason y catholic dun eat meat on friday, afterall, i only heard it from my fren. (i'm not a catholic) but this is a good way to show how one beliefs might shape one's view...<br><br>Your gf just want you to show her that you love her... and god wants you to refrain from all these lust .... ii dun know... might be becos that he is worried that you will... hmm.... become irresposible??? anyway, just be true to yourself......<br><br>Cheers!<br><br></div>

Before some of u accuse me, let's juz say that I'm not looking for religion bashing. I'm juz letting u realise that in this world, there are people who don't believe in God and who don't think like you do. FYI, that does not make us lesser in anyway (of coz, christians will disagree  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ).<br><br>quote:<br>"i know you can accept her for who she is. that's what true love is. being able to accept someone for who he or she is."<br><br>Yet non-christians are being penalised by "someone of a higher power" (if he exists) somehow for not believing...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> True love?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>quote:<br>"it appears she cannot do that, kinda shows how shallow her love for you is. if she cannot support your decision which you know is right. which wouldn't have harmed the relationship anyway. she seems to be more interested in the "title" of being number 1. but truthfully, you know that the more you can love God, the more you can love others, including your gf."<br><br>Yeah, I guess everyone's interested in getting that no.1 spot in your heart huh? How 'shallow' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>quote:<br>"if she cannot understand that, and cannot accept you for who you are now, then is she really worth all this sorrow and bullshiat?<br><br>if she wants to leave, then let it be. neither one of you will be happy anyway in this situation"<br><br>yup, relationships are all about compromising.<br><br>While you're still wanting for her to "understand" u, are u 'understanding' her as well? It shouldn't be a one-way traffic u know?<br><br>Have a good talk with her. And make ur decisions.<br><br>P.S &gt; BTW juz noticed that you mentioned that you are afraid of 'losing out in the end'. In this case, IMO this relationship is not suitable for you. Go stick to ur relationship with God, he'll always be with you - you won't 'lose out'. Not many people are able to maintain such a relation while being insistent on something that their partner strongly disagrees.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess being both christian you share the same thinking, at<br>least there is less conflict. Since your gf is free thinker, then<br>both must respect each other on their believes. If both can't do that<br>best to go seperate ways. Unless she loves you enough to give<br>christianity a try....but don't force her into it.<br><br>However, I would think you should exercise certain level of logic with religion<br>don't be too obsessed.

            <div class='col-md body'>When a person suppose to spend more time with god does it just means going to church to pray more often? Or does doing things while bearing in mind the teaching of god be enough. Since god is all powerful and in theory is present everywhere, wouldn't having him in your heart and being in any places means you are still spending time with him?</div>
