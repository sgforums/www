            <div class='col-md body'>halo Mr Doomz,<br><br>i hope you are not doom !! NOW !! whahaha ...<br><br>anyway, I don't think GOD forbids christian dating a non- christian.<br>But what I reckon is that, if you want to be marrying her, you may have to try your might at convicing her to become a christian as well.<br><br>To put some issues into perspective, so as to let you know I understand how you are feeling :<br>When I dated a chrisitian once before. Like you, she's a baby christian. I think that's what they called it. Can one of the christian confirm that?<br><br>Like you, she received GOD with an overzealous desire. Not to say that it's bad; i think anyone should be overzealous in rececving what they beileve to be true. so Plus 5 points for you.<br><br>My issue was much simplier than yur becasue when I was dating a christian, we didn't had sex. we were merely very intimate.<br><br>But Morality is your conflict with god now. The only difference between a human and dog is that a human can control his urges and desires when hormones run wild, a dog merely pump up the nearest bitch.<br><br>To control desires, you need to have a set of believes. And in the case of GOD, you need to believe in him. Saved human sex until after marriage, do not go for the forbidden fruit before you are declared man and wife before GOD.<br><br>NOW that's your problem !!!<br><br>I had been with chrisitan and i have been to their cell group, bible studies. What I can say is that " Oh boy, was I peaceful !!!. the feeling when surrounded by these group of people who shed unconditional love was great!"<br><br>Your issue is that both of you are no longer innocent, your GF wants something as natural as going to the toliet. She wanted sex. For god's sake, think about how you would react when YOU wanted sex and she tells you that Mommy forbids it!!<br><br>What would you have thought during those times?<br>1)She doesn't love you enough to give herself to you<br>2)mommy's girl?<br>3) I am not your No.1<br><br>I want sex....sex!! ..sex!! ..sex !!<br><br>Step into her shoes if she refues to give in to you before all these christian issue came. Do u want to spite her? Do you want to tell her that she doesn't love you. DO YOU .... want to use reverse psychology on her? ..... like she's using it on you now?<br><br>But think about  .... do you still love her, when you say all those things, inspite of every mean things you said to her just to have a little touch with her?<br><br>I think you do....because you didn't go look for another girl.... and I bet she didn't look for other guys as well. And that makes it enough reason to stay with her.<br><br>Look ...  God tempt you with forgiveness and eternity. Your GF is tempting your with love and sexual gratification.<br>You wanted both ... don't you?<br>The pleasures of your GF's soft touch and the sincerity of god's promise.<br><br>Guess what?<br>you can have both ..... oblige to your gf's request, is different from soliciting. Not doing so, is depriving her of her usual needs ..... from YOU ..... and only you...i believe....don't give that privilage away when u worked so hard for it in the past.....remember how you woo her?<br><br>As for GOD, what he wants is a sincere heart that pours out to him. Seek him, pray to him, ..... ask him .... for forgiveness... if he so see that sex is a sin.....<br>If you ask him for forgivess with a sincere heart, ........................<br>I think he may just be move and forgive you ........<br><br>And who says that you can't have the pie and eat it too.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Do you know why Chinese parents so strongly forbid their children from becoming a christian? They are afraid that they will lose their children. When they see their children getting more engaged to christian activities and spend less time at home, they get jealous, and they don't understand.<br><br>The keyword is understanding. Your girlfriend doesn't see God as a religion. She sees God as another girl, who's taking up your time, and she's jealous.<br><br>Give her some time, and slowly bring her over. Tell her to come to church with you, with an open heart. And slowly, she'll understand.<br><br>Just remember, there are many things in life that you may have to wait for a long time.

She has lost four yrs of effort building a r/s with you.<br><br>You've took a holistic approach in trying to convey the message.<br>She didn't accept it...which is naturally.
