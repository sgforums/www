A person who's physically 'quiet' (don't talk much), can choose to express himself / herself through other means... It's always up to you to find out how the person prefers to communicate or express himself / herself, and ultimately to your method(s) of becoming one of his / her audience....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

You may not realise this but it send several signal to the mind and if picked correctly, you may discern certain things you may not know. Body language is also important - packaged with the verbal side of communication - it makes your communication effective. Includes tone, volumn, eye contact, gestures, overall body movement, sitting/standing position, etc.<br><br>P.S: When you communicate, try to do focus more of your weaker aspect of communication. If you are a speaker, listen more. If you are a listener, speak more. Of course, always take lead whenever communication crashes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
