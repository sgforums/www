She will definately pick up cos the ringing will disturb others.<br><br>Talk nicely, don't raise voice or use vulgar language, if in the wrong, apologise first.<br>If she is at fault, tell her that u are not happy about her actions but u still love her.  Listen to her side of the story. Settle amicably.<br>In a quarrel, don't have to win all the time. Agree to a fair compromise.<br>Alway talk it out, don't keep silent &amp; bottled everything up.</div>

In a guy's case, if he does things like that... Often it only shows that he has a bad temper or it can also be that he's really pissed or driven by the girl to his limits liao...</div>

But if you 'feel' wrongly and keep bothering her on that, she might get irritated and even fustrated and you could be penalised for that?</div>
