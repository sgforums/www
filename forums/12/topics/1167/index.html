            <div class='col-md body'>Well...as I always think...nowadays hard to find long lasting marriage...not that dun have but getting lesser and lesser. As people get more and more educated, their sense of responsible towards family is become less and less too. Unlike people in the past...marriage is forever. Marriage bonds the husband and wife till death. But now...no longer the case. People are much more selfish and think only about themselves. They dun even care if they had children or not. They not happy, they divorce...sometimes they never think, can the problem be solved in another way other than divorce? If divorce, what happens to the children? Will the divorce affect the growth of the children? These people can be really selfish and think of only themselves. Some fight for custody of their children, but I'm sure there are some we push the children to each other...both also dun want the custody. Really sad that this is happening.</div>

And the situation is only going to get worse. Why do I say this? Look at the children nowadays. They so pampered and selfish. At my estate, a lot of families got maids...I see little kids scolding their maids, treating them like dirt...making the maid carry so many things and the poor maid, carrying so many things had to catch up with the child...and the child leh? Run fast fast then, scold the maid say she so slow, ask the maid to walk faster.<br>And my friends have seen little kids, around pri 1-2 age, scolding their mothers in public. One of my friend's neighbour will scold her kid for being naughty, then what the kid do? The little gal grabbed her baby brother by the hand and walked out of the house screaming, 'You are not my mother. I dun have a mother like you!'. The children nowadays are becoming more and more ill-mannered.<br>I give tution to pri sch children...and the children are no longer respectful to teachers even though I'm only tution teacher. I remember I used to be so polite to my tutor and so afraid of them. Now leh? The kids are 'ridding on our heads'. My friend the other day went tution at 7:30. The kid wanna watch tv till 8pm, ask my friend wait, my friend angry, so she told her off...the little gal started screaming and crying and went back to her room and lock herself up...the maid so scared cos she dun dare to go ask her come out..scared kana scolded by the little gal. In the end, the little gal call her mom and say she that night no want tution though next day got exam. My friend was so fed up. She went all the way there and got sent back. The mom didn't even scold her or say her daughter was wrong...even allowed her to do such a thing. What has the world become? I cannot imagine what kind of people these younger generation will become in the future. I think, it'll be worse than now.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In economics, we also learnt that humans are selfish by nature. Of cuz according to Adam's Smith Theory of Moral Sentiments, humans stil haf some heart, but the truth is most care abt themselves. They do not haf the heart to care and feel for others. Those who do are a rare lot already. Divorce nowadays is more common. Pple has the knowledge and money to go for divorce. Most can support themselves, no need for a partner to add in to the house income. If not happy, then divorce, they thought.<br><br>But what's the use of marriage in the first place if they not happy wif each other? Shouldn't they know each other inside out b4 marriage, and noe they can live wif each other's pros and cons forever? Y only discover that it is not possible after marriage, making both parties unhappy, and pple at ROM work harder? Unfair, isn't it? They juz think that it easier for them, but they haf created work for many others, more problems for many others, etc.<br><br>------------------<br>Thomas Edison definition of genius :<br>"1% inspiration, 99% perspiration"<br><br>************************************<br>The Eagle<br><br>He clasps the crag with hooked hands:<br>Close to the sun in lonely lands,<br>Ringed with the azure world, he stands.<br><br>The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;<br>He watches from his mountain walls,<br>And like a thunderbolt he falls.<br>************************************</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We are indeed drifting towards the West where marriage is concerned.  My colleagues in the US and European offices do not have spouses.  They have partners and children.   Some children from him, some from her, and others from dunno where.<br><br>Abandoning a spouse, or even being abandoned, is a shame you almost cannot bear in recent past Asia.  But we have grown used to words like "divorcee" and "single parent" now.<br><br>How shall we go forward then ?  As I type this post my heart is still aching from a severe quarrel with my wife.   The second in this week.  It was so bad I took a walk to the car park and wept in car privately so that my children will not see.<br><br>I asked God why my marriage does not look as rosy as those of my friends.  But we hang on.  Marriage is an institution.  If you cannot change your spouse (as we all try to do all the time), we change ourselves a little more first.  Learn a little humility, a little more respect for the other person.<br><br>It is hard.  But never walk away.  You walk out of one marriage, you will walk out of another.  But if you try hard enough, long enough, he or she will notice and be touched.<br><br>No one lives happily ever after without trying very hard.<br><br>[This message has been edited by kentan (edited 07 March 2002).]</div>

Perhaps you should compare your marriage with the more MISFORTUNATE ones...?<br>As much as I would like to agree that people's mentality for marriage might be changing, but this is the NEW MILLENNIUM... It's NO EXCUSE for one to be AN ASSHOLE, but you have to admit that the world is constantly evolving.... IF such a CONCEPT don't have its PROs or reason(s) it would not exist in the 1st place....?<br>No doubt in a marriage, TRYING is VERY IMPORTANT... Just like in ANY BGR... But people learn to THINK, and people learn to WEIGH... LOVE is NOT about weighing.. But sometimes LOVE decays.... Is it all that worth it when your other partner is laughing at you like you're a fool? What's LOVE? What's rationality....?<br><br>.......</div>
