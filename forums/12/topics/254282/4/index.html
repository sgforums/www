TS gf prefers to have sex after marriage, the least he can do is to respect her decision, if he really love her.<br><br>1) a r/s is based on communication &amp; compromise... &amp; not plainly acts on orders.<br><br>2) if a man is in a r/s.. is it rite to see any other gals? not just plainly as frnz?<br><br>3) refer to 1. is all about communication &amp; respect.<br><br>4) whether a man want to be a dog &amp; follow his gf ard &amp; act as a good man in front of everyone is all up to him.. a good man is from the heart.. &amp; not thru' acting.<br><br>5) if he is still in the r/s with someone, is not rite to love or like another gal. but of cos, emotion is hard to control. but if he really love his gf as he stated.. that shouldnt be the case.</div>

If the TS gf perfers to have sex after marriage is fine with me but how long should a guy wait if the girl refuse marriage when the guy try his best?<br><br>1) If a gf refuse to have any form of communication &amp; compromise and her orders are the final words what should the guy do then?<br><br>2) Maybe I did not specific the word "see". The words means to only look at girls and the gf will scold the bf very badly not as in playing behind her back<br><br>3) If communication &amp; compromise is that easy everyone should be having a good relationship now and not fighting over lots of things.<br><br>4) What is the difference between acting and reality?<br><br>a) Acting means that a bf will be able to keep a good guy image and have a relationship but and the cost of his pride and ego.<br><br>b) Reality means if a bf refuse to do the good act he might not even have a gf at all.<br><br>5) Humm if the bf wants to break off with the gf but could not cos the gf threaten to kill herself, so what should the guy do?<br><br>What should a real good guy do in your context?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>please dont tell me because TS love his gf thats why they holding onto each other, communicating with significant other is always a better choice than ONS with other girls out there and infact, the MAIN problem is still there.<br><br>TS cant go on with this kind of loving her, bedding others. In love, faith and trust should be always there, TS im sorry but stop your current way of hurting her making yourself feel more fulfilling. do you actually know you too are hurting her? much more than what u claim, shes hurting you?<br><br>think about it, loving someone means faithfully, sincerely. if you think bearing with it is too much misery, why not try communicatin with her. give her some security.</div>
