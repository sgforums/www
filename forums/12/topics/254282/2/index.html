I know what u mean , but if u want to be the 'bad guy' .. by all means.  Most of the ppl out there are bad guys , are u going to follow the masses or stick to your true self. The urge for sex is great.. hell its hard for me to resist too.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  BUT.. i think u just want sex simple la. Like YunHair said , maybe u are trying to justify yourself for something u are about to do .<br><br>Oh  , and one more thing ,  i dont think u go EVIL because of ur GF.  Its like saying u become a naughty boy because ur mummy spanked you hard.</div>
