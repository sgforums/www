You expounded on how deeply you love your girlfriend but yet had a short relationship with some other female. You claimed you even broke up with that girl because of your love for your girlfriend - another telling of self-righteousness.<br><br>I wouldn't want to waste too much time elucidating what is love but you shouldn't be loving someone and expecting sex in return. Love doesn't work like that, so jump out of your abusing of love please.<br><br>I implore you to respect the decision of the poor girl who probably give a great deal about you and to fully commit yourself for the relationship to work out otherwise quit wasting the poor girl's precious time and youth. As for the "I know my gf can't live without me" part, no one is indispensable, your absense do not stop the Earth from revolving.<br><br>Detached</div>
