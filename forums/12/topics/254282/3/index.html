Stop lying to yourself and telling yourself you are a gentleman. You want the sex.<br><br>You are acting nice because other people think you are a nice person and so you must act nice in front of them, if not, your image will be shattered.<br><br>You know what? Be true to yourself and quit acting like another person.<br><br>You have lived for nothing for the past 3 years.<br><br>Like I said, be true to yourself. That's all.<br><br>doko</div>

How to surive through the marriage life....<br><br>Justguyz</div></blockquote>miserable you may be, but do put yourself in your girlfriend's shoes nevertheless.<br><br>if you have being with your gf for 3 yrs, than stay on, not may BGR can last so long.<br><br>If your gf don't wanna have sex, than forget about it alright?<br><br>having sex is just a mutual agreement between you and your girlfriend/ a girl whom u met in a pub/disco.<br><br>if it's one-sided sex, than she will not feel happy about it at all, and should you force her to make a decision, she will feel like you're treating her as a sex toy or a prositute after u have and got what you want. (than that's when gals will cry in their shower or hide in their bedroom and cry, thus coverting their love to hate towards guys and covert to les)<br><br>if you really love her, than give her the respect that she deserves!<br><br>from your first reply, i doubt your gf will initiate it since she's conervative which is good. Be happy and stay contented that you can have light petting on her, holding hands waist, hugging her and to carry her.<br><br>but if she one day change, and she's really keen, there will be a critical point whereby she starts it, than when do whatever on you, there will be one moment that your body reacts mentally (gives you the nod to go ahead) and you will carry on.<br><br>it's based on her comfort level when she decides to give you.<br><br>such ladies are really looking for true love, it depends on the chemistry and feeling if it's romantic surroundings + if the topic that both of you and her are chatting on that day have any links with sex or arrousing her physically or not, that gives you higher chances of at least heavy petting.<br><br>learn to treasure your gf, she's really a gem, if you don't want, introduce to the rest of the guys here whom you feel is suits her.<br><br>if you can't imagine staying with her till after marriage, and the idea of having sex only after marriage, I suggest that you as a guy who loved her, recommend a trust-worthy guy who u know to her, and hope the best for them both.<br><br>A responsible and faithful guy should be one that takes care of his gf even after they broke up, but of course, don't expect to hug her after breaking up la, perhaps just maintain as close friends or best friends to share problems and go out with.<br><br>If you really love her, respect her decision. Sex is just a form of communication, there are still many modes of other communications whereby you can try out with her.<br><br>Communication by which means eye-contact, you don't need to talk to her yet able to make her feel happy and blissful with your company beside her.<br><br>That's understanding.<br><br>Love her, don't hurt her.<br>Make her feel happy, and safe in your arms.<br>Have a balance and mixture of verbal, physically (light petting in your case) and emotional communication as well as taking care of her when she's ill.<br><br>Learn from experience and observe and take note what she is sensitive on so as to not touch the topic again in future.<br><br>And listen to her needs.<br>Use our brain and heart to think, don't use our dick when will only make us no different from beast.<br><br>Love is complicated yet simple if you know how to handle it with care and proper communication.<br><br>All the best and good luck!</div>

Its so sad. I think the best moment to make love is the honey moon stage. Now its over. I feel so sad and feelingless. We pet only. I think i will still be petting even after marriage. I love her and will marry her. But seems like the more I wait the more i'm more tired. Now I understand why there is bad guy. I'm used to a 100% good guy that treasure relationship very seriously. But when i have this gf, i've changed over the years. I respect her decision to only sex after marriage. BUt who respected me? I so surpised. I can have ONS with someone I just knew and I cannot even make love to my gf! Life SUCK YA!? [b]In my working place I can get as many gers as i want. I can even choose.</strong> But because of my gf, i resist them. I felt stupid to be nice guy! I have a short relationship with one ger but i broke up beocoz i stil love my gf even though I know I cannot make love to her. I ask her why we cannot make love and argued. She cried and told me to look for other gers! I nearly fatinted. All my loves wasted...I thought making love is a nature thing for couple... U make love to gf beocoz u love her. So she is telling me not to love her? sigh... Currently i'm very close to a pretty ger. How to resist her? I know my gf cannot live without me. But I'm sick of being fatihguy.

            <div class='col-md body'>My question to everyone who reply to this tread is simple.<br><br>1) How many of you out there have a relationship for more than 5 years?<br><br>2) If not do you think any of your relationship will last more than 5 years if marriage is not been held?<br><br>3) BEFORE EACH AND EVERYONE HERE STARTS TRASHING THE TS ASK YOURSELF FIRST, MANY CAN REACH THAT LONG?<br><br>4) The TS is only thinking but he did not do it yet, but there are others who are worst than him, who would have sex with any girl who has a hole, don't you all feel that they are worst then him?<br><br>5) Is not easy for a good guy to have maintain a relationship that is so long, a guy must resist lots of temptations and lots of anger in exchange for a gf who loves him.<br><br>6) Did anyone here ask him how the gf treated him or not?</div>
