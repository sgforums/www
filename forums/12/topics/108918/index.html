She's not giving enough strong signals to determine whether she likes you or not anyway. Besides, those signals may be misleading as well.<br><br>Jia you ba. And don't ask her what she wants for a present. Be a Man and think of what you think she'll like, and just buy it for her.<br><br>Presents are supposed to be mysterious and a surprise.

            <div class='col-md body'>As pointed out, don't act as if you know her very well. In the first place, you don't. Get a grip of reality.<br><br>If you want to get to know her, then do so by talking to her. Don't go sneaky behind her back, ask friends get her number, etc. That tells her you are feeling insecure and most girls are simply not interested in guys like that.<br><br>Just be yourself and ask her whether she wants to meet up. If she is not interested, then just lean back and give her space. Don't try to pursue the matter further or you will come off as another irritating guy.<br><br>If she agrees to meet up, then take the chance to get to know her as a friend. Get to know her personally before getting involved because if u get involved with a hottie with a terrible personality, you are in deep crap. So, it's not worth to rush it. Most importantly, take the time and have fun.</div>

PArticularly Your Charater seems a little like me. The only Important question is have you let the girl know your feelings about her ? Or you can get straight to the point of asking her what she thinks of you..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have you read what we typed out..?<br>Why blur? There's nothing to be blur about.<br>She just wants to be friends, or just treats you as a friend.<br><br>Case closed.<br><br>If you want to develop a more intimate relationship with her, then you have to woo her. There are no signs of her liking you though.</div>
