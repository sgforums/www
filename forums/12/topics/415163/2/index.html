              <p><br> Maybe you should seek help. Have you tried seeking help from
              counsellors or external organisations? Or if that does not work,
              maybe your extended family? like aunts and uncles or grandparents.
              Have you attempted confronting your father? because verbal abuse is
              never justified. You should advise your mother to set some
              boundaries and limitations with your father, there is no reason to
              continue enduring this, her well-being is more important. Sometimes
              parents, especially mothers, hang on to the marriage under the
              impression that it is what's best for the family or the children.
              But this is obviously not the case. Talk to her about it and try to
              convince her that your father is a troubling and obviously negative
              influence on both of you. Advise your mother to divorce him. For
              the sake of both you and your mother. Seriously though, don't deal
              with it alone, seek help.</p>

              <p>i tried seeking help from extended families. like yes, my uncle. there was this time, my mum was pregnant and she was hesitant to tell him. until she told him, he went mad, like real mad cos he did not want the baby at all and forced my mum to get an abortion asap. </p>
              <p>everynight when he reaches home, he will shout at my mum, insisting and persisting on the abortion until my mum almost went mad. when my mum tell him that she wants to keep the baby, he will spill strings of profanities at her. i told my uncle. he said that its none of his business and will not interfere. i was really sad and confronted my dad.</p>
              <p>oh, i tell you. he almost killed me. he was shouting and screaming in the middle of the night and banging at walls and doors and glass tables (which almost broke). he also had our storeroom's door down. </p>
              <p>if i were to confront him again, he will kill me and i bet that. he is very prone to violence also. </p>

              <p>i have problems with my family. my dad abuses my mum. like mental abuse. if you guys dont know, mental abuse is far worser than physical abuse. all these years, my dad has been mentally abusing my mum. and it has been built up in me and i catch myself acting like him sometimes and it eats me up inside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i definitely do not wanna act like him. ill hate myself if i do. i wanna move out just so bcos this matter could stop bcos i dont want it to be in me. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the second reason i wanna move out at a legal age is bcos, my parents do not give me any trust. yes, i admit that i had once did a really silly mistake(long story) and i am really remorseful about it. i regretted what i did. i am sorry about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but they, they have been so protective and i just dont like it at all. whats more, my dad has this mental abuse problem. he also has a serious temper management problem. </p>

              <p><br>Did you asked me anything else that I have forgotten to advise?</p>
              <p>If I remember correctly, you were trying to ask about me and I've already told you what I want to share with you about myself with regards to your question.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But if you're not happy with my answer, then go and pick other answers that will make you happy.</p>
              <p>I'm not here to make you happy or to cheer you up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One more thing you should know, I am not obligated to help you. So don't think you have the right of way to demand anything from me because that's just rude, unreasonable and a very good way to stop anyone from helping you.</p>

              <p><br>You mentioned that you're offended by "your sad broken-family types of dramatic imaginations"?</p>
              <p>Then tell me how do you think I can move out at 14 years old and why do you think I moved out at 14 years old?</p>
              <p>If your reply to my question isn't anything near related to what I have mentioned "your sad broken-family types of dramatic imaginations", then I will tell you why you shouldn't be offended.</p>
              <p>Read my posts properly and they are well paragraphed and should be easy to read and understood.</p>
              <p>IF you decide to cut and paste a sentence out of my posts, then it will be offensive because the meaning are already different.</p>
              <p>And if you think by telling me you're pissed is going to make me feel bad, I can only help you by telling you to go toilet before you pissed over yourself.</p>
