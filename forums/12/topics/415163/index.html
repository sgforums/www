              <p>i have problems with my family. my dad abuses my mum. like mental abuse. if you guys dont know, mental abuse is far worser than physical abuse. all these years, my dad has been mentally abusing my mum. and it has been built up in me and i catch myself acting like him sometimes and it eats me up inside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i definitely do not wanna act like him. ill hate myself if i do. i wanna move out just so bcos this matter could stop bcos i dont want it to be in me. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the second reason i wanna move out at a legal age is bcos, my parents do not give me any trust. yes, i admit that i had once did a really silly mistake(long story) and i am really remorseful about it. i regretted what i did. i am sorry about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but they, they have been so protective and i just dont like it at all. whats more, my dad has this mental abuse problem. he also has a serious temper management problem. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>okay, long story cut short, i just want to know what is the LEGAL age of moving out in singapore. thanks! </p>

              <p>i WILL get a job and would probably rent a place when i am 18 (so that means i have to tolerate another 2 shit years before i can move out). i also plan to have a better education before moving out first. so, i guess that would be okay? and obviously i wont stop my edu at 18. i still plan to further my studies. </p>

              <p>if you are going towards that direction make sure ur disciplined and sensible enough to be able to steel your life properly single-handedly. Finances wise you have to control already, cos you are going to be independent in times to come. No more asking people for money , rmb that</p>

              <p>Parents are the ones who bring us here, by hook or crook, they brought us up, and most of us are more close to mother than our father, cos father use to go out and leave us under the care of mom, no matter what, you cannot repay all their debts. If they are no good, try your best to be good to them, and for yr case, your mother need you the most, you need to help her at this critical stage, not neglect her and go by yourself. It is a time to show your maturity and understanding of life.</p>

              <p>it normal lah, teenagers alway think of going away from family,
              part of growing up, i had run away from my own luxury home many
              times, but after a few years, i am back to my nest, and let me tell
              you, there is where better than home.</p>
              <p>Parents are the ones who bring us here, by hook or crook, they
              brought us up, and most of us are more close to mother than our
              father, cos father use to go out and leave us under the care of
              mom, no matter what, you cannot repay all their debts. If they are
              no good, try your best to be good to them, and for yr case, your
              mother need you the most, you need to help her at this critical
              stage, not neglect her and go by yourself. It is a time to show
              your maturity and understanding of life.</p>

              <p>no one can understand my situation. unless you have been through my situation. you know, all these while, getting influenced by my dad's abusive behavior, i find myself acting more like him and i hate it. i want to get out of it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and its not like i am abandoning my mum? i DO tell her that mental abuse is so much worser than physical abuse and i can truly see the effects on her. but time to time, again and again, she always seem to forgive him for all the things he have done. and i am definitely sick of it. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>like i said, you have not been in my situation, you will not know how i feel. you dont know the feeling of getting mentally abuse. my dad do spill profanities at me and it hurts. hurts like a bitch. and i want to get away from it. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and by getting away from it, i meant, my dad. not my mum. i aint gonna abandon her. shes my mum. she does great things for me and i appreciate a lot. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>okay, so i guess that explains to everyone now. i am NOT abandoning my mum. </p>

              Maybe you should seek help. Have you tried seeking help from counsellors or external organisations? Or if that does not work, maybe your extended family? like aunts and uncles or grandparents. Have you attempted confronting your father? because verbal abuse is never justified. You should advise your mother to set some boundaries and limitations with your father, there is no reason to continue enduring this, her well-being is more important.
              
              Sometimes parents, especially mothers, hang on to the marriage under the impression that it is what's best for the family or the children. But this is obviously not the case. Talk to her about it and try to convince her that your father is a troubling and obviously negative influence on both of you. 
              
              Advise your mother to divorce him. For the sake of both you and your mother. Seriously though, don't deal with it alone, seek help.
