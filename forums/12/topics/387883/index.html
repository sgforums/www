              <p>is it any surprise that there were cracks in his marriage ? why do you think people have affairs in the first place ? .....</p>
              <p>but, regardless of who initiated, who did the chasing, and who made the promises, does it make it any more right for you to appear in the picture ? you'd always be perceived as the "other woman".</p>
              <p>And really, when it comes down to that, I think the interest of the children supersedes everything, after all, they are the only truly innocent party, yours, and their too, you think it matters to the children's interest that there's no "intimacy and communication" between the parents ?</p>
              <p>And back to my first statement, again, to put it bluntly, why does he need to give up his family and marriage and marry you, when he's already getting everything he wants, from you ?</p>
              <p>I'm sure it hurts to think so, but I think you're being used here. So do yourself and your child a favour huh. Really, there are hordes of nice, eligible men out there, if you'd just have the courage to seek again. Why give up the forest for one rotten log ?</p>

              <p>First of all you need to leave the guy you are with.</p>
              <p>Fact : - you love your kid.... and there will be no future if he cannot be his father.</p>
              <p>when your kid grows to age where he understands these things... 12 maybe and that will happen really fast..... there will be problems. Especially when he finds out you are the third party.</p>
              <p>Fact : - It is easier to find a suitable partner when you are younger and your kid is young. When you are younger because you will be more attractive and guys are more forgiving that you made a bad choice.</p>
              <p>Fact :- If your kid old le.... and you find someone you really like..... whether your kid likes his new father is up for debate.</p>
              <p>I can think of more options.... but all of it first step is...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Leave your relationship...</p>
              <p>Start a relationship with someone only if he is single... and don't rush into it just because of your situation.... that is dumb. You'll end up being a foc whore so please don't.</p>
              <p>Also doesn't mean you made a bad choice you should think of yourself any lower. Everyone makes mistakes....I did too i ate too much and I'm a beach whale. </p>

              <p>you move on by first giving him the finger and telling him to get the fark out of your life, forever ..... feel sorry for the other woman and kid, they are the one stuck with an arsehole, not you ..... </p>
              <p>then you delete all the emails, smses, number, etc ...</p>
              <p>next, you spring clean your house, good riddance to bad rubbish and bad vibes .... </p>
              <p>go for a spa if you like ....</p>
              <p>afterwards, go gai gai with your teen, have a good meal, watch a movie, go shopping together or something  .... your kid needs your love too, neh ? ... definitely deserves it more than the farktard you tossed out ...</p>
              <p>then .... you go out and meet people ... join a club, an interest group, call up old friends, sign up for cooking class, karaoke, morning taiji, whatever, go do volunteer work, with the old folks, the disabled, the kids ... you'll find your problems so insignificant compared to their lot in life ... </p>
              <p>wallowing in self pity is a perfectly human and natural form of therapy, just don't over do it, and know when to wake up .... happiness is what you seek, and what you fight for ... it won't drop out of the sky onto your lap. It all boils down to what you do ... you don't want to be still mooching around sighing 10 years down the line, right ? </p>
