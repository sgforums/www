              <p>you move on by first giving him the finger and telling him to
              get the fark out of your life, forever ..... feel sorry for the
              other woman and kid, they are the one stuck with an arsehole, not
              you ..... </p>
              <p>then you delete all the emails, smses, number, etc ...</p>
              <p>next, you spring clean your house, good riddance to bad rubbish
              and bad vibes .... </p>
              <p>go for a spa if you like ....</p>
              <p>afterwards, go gai gai with your teen, have a good meal, watch a
              movie, go shopping together or something  .... your kid needs
              your love too, neh ? ... definitely deserves it more than the
              farktard you tossed out ...</p>
              <p>then .... you go out and meet people ... join a club, an
              interest group, call up old friends, sign up for cooking class,
              karaoke, morning taiji, whatever, go do volunteer work, with the
              old folks, the disabled, the kids ... you'll find your problems so
              insignificant compared to their lot in life ... </p>
              <p>wallowing in self pity is a perfectly human and natural form of
              therapy, just don't over do it, and know when to wake up ....
              happiness is what you seek, and what you fight for ... it won't
              drop out of the sky onto your lap. It all boils down to what you do
              ... you don't want to be still mooching around sighing 10 years
              down the line, right ? </p>

              <p>then replace the "him" part with something else...</p>

              <p>who knows? you might find the company of others more fulfilling
              than a dead-end and pointless misery of that affair.. mostly, it
              gives you something else to do which will take your mind off that

              <p>you will make friends during those activities.. which will widen
              your outlook, widen your social circle, widen your horizons...</p>
              <p>try the CC.. they have such courses.. and they're after work

              <p>you'll even have fun..</p>

              <p>Grace,</p>
              <p>May I know WHY are you a divorcee ???</p>
              <p>Was it your husband who is NO GOOD ?</p>
              <p>Are you in ANOTHER relationship with a NO GOOD MAN <strong>AGAIN</strong> ???</p>
              <p>Why do you keep bringing NO GOOD MEN into your life and your CHILDREN'S LIFE ?</p>
              <p>Your CURRENT lover is a NO GOOD MAN. Are you aware of it ?</p>
              <p>1. He cheated on his wife.</p>
              <p>2. He had an affair with a colleague. Shitting where he eats.</p>
              <p>3. He must be such a LOUSY husband and father .His wife also DON'T CARE FOR HIM. That's why she just couldn't be bothered even after finding out he has an AFFAIR.</p>
              <p>The only reason why his wife is still with him is FOR THE CHILDREN. SO they don't grow up in a broken family.</p>
              <p>If you really want to KIO ( Collect ) this SAI ( Shit).. just wait till his children are old enough.. the wife will eventually throw this piece of shit out of her life. By then you can go collect him.. he will be happy there's someone who wants him.</p>
              <p>Since you like to collect shitty men.. go ahead.. but your children will SUFFER psychologically and affect their marriage in the future.</p>
              <p>What kind of example are you setting for your own children ?</p>
              <p>Have some <strong>SELF-RESPECT</strong>.</p>

              <p>actually, i dont see a problem here. there are all kinds of r/s out in this world. not every r/s is black and white solution.</p>
              <p>since guy dont love his wife and only stay together for sake of his child, there is no reason not to continue to love him. provided that is true and he does not actually have another woman or two on the sidelines and use wife against you and vice versa.</p>
              <p>but there is one thing that has to change. if he say he stay with wife for kid, then he has to spend time with you. a lot more time than currently. and you should be able to sms/call him. etc. and he should automatically do that (call/sms you when apart from you) oso if he say he love you.</p>
              <p>if current situation remain the same, then sorry, no deal. you are not even his mate. you are his FB only. in which case, i hope you are well remunerated for your time.</p>

              <p>Instead of apporting blame on him for all that you feel and are now - why dont you see that you are also equally responsible for these state of affairs today.</p>
              <p>The other thing is this - there was no love and there is no love. People who are loving dont destroy lives and use each other. This is something else all together - ... pretending to be love, masqureading as love. Simply put, you used him for ... and he used for ...</p>
              <p> As to whether it would end or it should end only you know and the only thing that matters is that one assumes responsibility for what one is, whatever the situation.</p>
              <p>If if there is any person losing out here - it is not the woman/man but the children. I say that cos a dysfunctional adult adds to the dysfunction.</p>

              <p>Do you know why your lover BACK PADDLED on his divorce ?</p>
              <p>Because he does not want to become the MOST HATED MAN in everyone's eyes.</p>
              <p>If he leaves his family behind for another woman.</p>
              <p>His children will HATE him, his family will DESPISE him, his own co-workers will OSTRACISE him and very likely LOSES his job. WHAT will he become ?</p>
              <p>For one woman.. his life will be in RUINS.</p>
              <p>Sure.. you want to be that woman in his arms.. but he DOES NOT want to be THAT man.</p>
              <p>There are many things in life worth sacrificing for.. but this is not one of em.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">Ts,</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">How do I let go ………? The very question that you pose speaks volumes of your professed love for him or ... love is allowing, love is acceptance of .. and of course, it <strong>presupposes tht one has it with<span style="text-decoration: underline;">IN</span> oneself</strong>. How to let go when you are taking, attached (attachment is NOT love)? There is no need to let go if one already has it . It is cos you dont have or are lacking within that letting go is such a difficult thing</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">What should I do .............? The only thing that you should understand or acknowledge is this - are u fulfilled within yourself first. Otherwise, this so-called relationship/affair/whatever? may end or not end. But it belies the lack of understanding, the lack of acceptance of Oneself, the lack of love. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">yes u can do this  - leave, change boyfriend or be alone for awhile. However, let me reiterate, that which is lacking within or unreconciled within would surface. many pretend, ignore and later find themselves in the same rut. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">As for 'good'man 'good' woman - my take is this - it is a myth. All of us are fallible and yet in many ways have the capacity within us to transcend the lack of ... and mature. </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS;">Life is not black and white - it is the dividing that causes untold misery and pain. The wise would understand that polarities/dichotomies exist and it is being connected to existence and being cognizant of these that may have one not striving, trying but simply partaking of .. and living.</span></p>
