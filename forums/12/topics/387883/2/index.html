              <p>how are you going to start a new chapter in your life without formally closing another ?</p>
              <p>and your kid is a teen ..... give him or her credit .... they are more understanding about such things than you think .... kid would probably be relived ....</p>
              <p>as to how do you start, why don't you think about it a bit yourself first ? it's basically your life, really ... you have to take the first step to reach out yourself.</p>
              <p>I would tell you to start here but there are more creeps, creepier than the one you left behind, lurking online than you think ... remember, your objective is to make more friends and widen your social circle .... not to look for a rebound ... </p>

              <p>You have so far asked questions on what "<strong>I" </strong>should do, but have you at least talk to your teenage child yet or asked him what he thinks? I have to agree with some that as a divorcee, you should at least understand what will happen to other other family in case he really divorced that family.</p>
              <p>Love is "blind" but at least you have start questioning. Like what some suggested, why would he want a divorce when he had the "best" of both world. Don't just think about yourself, think about others beside you as well. Think about the one that is closest to you now.</p>
