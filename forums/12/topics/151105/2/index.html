I was so blinded by looks that I failed to see the beauty of the heart and dumped her. Right now when I look at my ex-gf, although she is just of average looks but somehow something within me which I cannot explain find her the most beautiful person I've ever known. I dunno if I can ever find someone like her. It's not abt finding someone better again but somethings when lost seldom can be found again.</blockquote>The lesson was indeed expensive. However, if you had become a less shallow person because of it, it was nonetheless a worthy lesson.<br><br>Any fool could be made to see the thorns beneath the rose of a beautiful woman, but it takes a wise man to look past the thorns of a plain woman to appreciate the rose within.</div>

In the end, I was with no one. I know I made a mistake. When i look back now, my ex was the only one I would want to live with forever. She's the kind of girl who will take bus with me(unlike those $$ girls who only take cars). Because of what happened, I lost myself, became depressed, and until now I still have regrets. 2 years of pain and loneliness and god knows how long more before I can love someone again. Now she is attached, happily or not I dunno cos right now I dare not step into her private zone. how I wish i was wiser in the past and never left her. pls dun flame me as I have already realised my mistake. i just hope she knows that if got chance again, i wanna be with her and i will never break her heart again.</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The lesson here is not what you have lost, rather, the significance why you have lost it.<br><br>If you were to reverse time and materialize as a third person, trying your best to talk to your then-mindset as another party, nothing will sink in. Going back time is merely a 'waste of time' because 'the-back-then-you' is bound to lose this girl in exchange for personal growth and cosmic lesson.<br><br>Regardless, it is impossible to turn back time.<br><br>What you are doing now is attempting to look over your shoulder, hoping you can catch a glimpse of her presence behind you. However, it's futile for, she has already moved on so far. In her mind, to return back to where she came from previously makes no sense to her. It makes sense to you because you are regretting... but would it be so for her?<br><br>Considering your behaviour and action, shouldn't she be glad to move on?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>P.S: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Learn to live with your regrets and channel them into force to mould your future, not something to repair your irrevocable past. </strong></span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

What u are looking for is not a perfect love but a slave to you, you expect the girl to stand by you even you go out and play with other girls. In fact I believe 100% that the girl should have left a person like u asap. From the above statement only shows that u care all about yourself but never thought of her feelings at all.<br><br>If the case is different, if she is the one who had flirt around and found another guy and dump u, I believe you will never ever " wait " for her at all.  You are not even worthy of her true love cos all you want is someone to love one if u play around.<br><br>In fact you should ask yourself this question.<br>"DID YOU EVER TRUELY LOVE HER AT ALL!"</div>
