Because of what happened, I lost myself, became depressed, and until now I still have regrets. 2 years of pain and loneliness and god knows how long more before I can love someone again.

I dunno. afterall i once broke her heart and dunno how she will react if i told her this. or maybe just remain as friends? to those who thinking of dumping yr gf for someone better. I hope u think many times unless yr present gf is such a bitch. cos to find someone who loves u for who u r is very rare. treasure what u have or when it is gone, u may not get a second chance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by What if:<br>but she love/loved me. is it possible she really gave up on me? is love that easily forgotten? not possible to be together again?</blockquote>Yes, she loved you once and gave you the chance to love her, but you busted it and she woke up. She has moved on since. So should you -- you could wait or try to win her back, but the chances are pretty slim, particularly when she has someone else now. It is probably better not to delude yourself with false hopes.<br><br>And please don't ask the question, especially to her, if love could be easily forgotten. She'd probably say that you already know the answer -- when you betrayed her love in the first place.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's funny how last time I was always going looks. Because of looks, I was mesmerised beyond logic. I was so blinded by looks that I failed to see the beauty of the heart and dumped her. Right now when I look at my ex-gf, although she is just of average looks but somehow something within me which I cannot explain find her the most beautiful person I've ever known. I dunno if I can ever find someone like her. It's not abt finding someone better again but somethings when lost seldom can be found again.</div>
