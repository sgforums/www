              <p>I don't even know how to start. Basically, I'm suppose to meet her on the 31st of December for the countdown. On that day, it will be the 1st time I'm meeting her after a period of 1 month or so when we had a little misunderstanding. The thing is, my actual plan was to bring to her the flyer to watch the fireworks, but as you guys know, the flyer is closed temporarily and I'm currently out of ideas. That day will be kinda special for me because it will show whether I'm given another chance from her or not.</p>
              <p>I'll summarize a little bit of what happened between us. She is my 1st classmate in Polytechnic and we had grew closer when we joined the same "CCA". From there on, we went out on certain occasions and that was when I developed feelings for her. It had been a total of 8 months and load of things had happened between us. The thing is, my character had actually caused me distance myself from her. During that 8 months, she had also been close to one of my guy friends, and that had really crushed my confidence. Because of this, like I said, I distanced myself (Yes, I know I'm jealous) until things got really bad. There was a point of time where she hated me alot because of my attitude towards her and my friend, I was kinda rude to him. Due to this, we didn't talk to each other for nearly a month or so, until recently where she called me out to clear things out. That was went I knew that I misunderstood the both of them. It appeared that she had feelings for me as well, and the reason why she and my friend got close was because that they were discussing about me, like when I'm going to pop the question to her, but like what i told her, I got jealous about the both of them, and it crushed my confidence. I caused her to wait so long (which she hate) and it ended up in a huge pile of mess.</p>
              <p>So after we cleared the mess, we were back on talking terms, but I admit there is still a certain awkwardness between us. A few weeks back we were sms-ing and we chanced upon a topic about the relationship between us and I asked if she was actually giving me another chance, she replied something like, "What do you think?" So the thing is, I'm not sure whether I really stand another chance, so the 31st of December is to show whether I'm really do stand another chance. Now that the Flyer is shut down, my options are closed as well.. I know that it will not be the same as compared to the past, but I'm willing to try to change things. There is still this "Can't wait to see her, but don't know what to say when I do" feeling.</p>
              <p>I really need some ideas..Any suggestions on what we can or I can do for her on that day? I prefer something which is peaceful, greatful for people who are enjoying their "er ren shi jie".</p>
              <p>I really apologize for the long post..</p>

              <p>pewpew: She has abit of meat, and thats what attractive for me I guess. Skinny girls don't really appeal to me. As for the others, I'm not sure, she does have rather lots of close guy friends and a few chasing after her.</p>
              <p>PeTe_Parker: Yes, I was thinking of that as well. I was actually thinking of the restaurants along One Fullerton.  There are alot of things to consider as well. But taking her out on meals used to be a frequent outing for us in the past.</p>

              you'll probably get nonsensical answers at this hour haha..
              you can just take her to a nice, quiet restaurant away from the crowds.. maybe somewhere you can take a lil stroll after dinner and just chat with her.. good chance to know each other better..

              <p>i think having a diy dinner at the beach is pretty nice.. if a girl expects expensive but thoughtless stuffs all the time then it's time to think twice about her..</p>

              <p><br>yeah true... materialistic gers is big nono...</p>
              <p>but having a diy dinner might be a negative impression of "cheapo" if not done right?</p>
              <p>imagine, by the sea, then u open up ur container, and offer her a piece of chicken chop...</p>
              <p>erm... not so good right.. but if got table chair, some candles, and food on plate.. that is alot more wonderful, but its gonna be troublesome ha...</p>
