              <p>I don't even know how to start. Basically, I'm suppose to meet her on the 31st of December for the countdown. On that day, it will be the 1st time I'm meeting her after a period of 1 month or so when we had a little misunderstanding. The thing is, my actual plan was to bring to her the flyer to watch the fireworks, but as you guys know, the flyer is closed temporarily and I'm currently out of ideas. That day will be kinda special for me because it will show whether I'm given another chance from her or not.</p>
              <p>I'll summarize a little bit of what happened between us. She is my 1st classmate in Polytechnic and we had grew closer when we joined the same "CCA". From there on, we went out on certain occasions and that was when I developed feelings for her. It had been a total of 8 months and load of things had happened between us. The thing is, my character had actually caused me distance myself from her. During that 8 months, she had also been close to one of my guy friends, and that had really crushed my confidence. Because of this, like I said, I distanced myself (Yes, I know I'm jealous) until things got really bad. There was a point of time where she hated me alot because of my attitude towards her and my friend, I was kinda rude to him. Due to this, we didn't talk to each other for nearly a month or so, until recently where she called me out to clear things out. That was went I knew that I misunderstood the both of them. It appeared that she had feelings for me as well, and the reason why she and my friend got close was because that they were discussing about me, like when I'm going to pop the question to her, but like what i told her, I got jealous about the both of them, and it crushed my confidence. I caused her to wait so long (which she hate) and it ended up in a huge pile of mess.</p>
              <p>So after we cleared the mess, we were back on talking terms, but I admit there is still a certain awkwardness between us. A few weeks back we were sms-ing and we chanced upon a topic about the relationship between us and I asked if she was actually giving me another chance, she replied something like, "What do you think?" So the thing is, I'm not sure whether I really stand another chance, so the 31st of December is to show whether I'm really do stand another chance. Now that the Flyer is shut down, my options are closed as well.. I know that it will not be the same as compared to the past, but I'm willing to try to change things. There is still this "Can't wait to see her, but don't know what to say when I do" feeling.</p>
              <p>I really need some ideas..Any suggestions on what we can or I can do for her on that day? I prefer something which is peaceful, greatful for people who are enjoying their "er ren shi jie".</p>
              <p>I really apologize for the long post..</p>

              <p>The thing is, I'm not sure if she still likes me or not after all that I've done to her. That is why I want to salvage whatever is left.</p>
              <p>And you have a point, all these while I had been trying hard to impress her, regardless of whether it involves money or not. It had never come to my mind that what I had been doing isn't actually me, I'm just doing things to impress her, and its not me.</p>
              <p>This is why on the 31st, our usual outing was like in the past. Something simple. We chilled and the Singapore Flyer compound and chatted throughout the night. I don't know if I had gained back her trust, but I know that I've tried.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for those people out there who helped! Thank you all for your suggestions! You guys made me realize one very important point! :D</p>

              <p>Dude,</p>
              <p>In case you forgot. You posted your uncertainty in Aunt
              Agony.</p>
              <p>And pardon me for not knowing the whole scenario.. and guess
              what ? You didn't PROVIDE the full scenario. Am I suppose to read
              your mind with telepathy ?</p>
              <p>Well , if you confessed with a serious tone and she replied with
              a joke. Dude.. sorry to say.. she's not into you.</p>
              <p>So it does not matter if she is hot or cold towards you....
              inviting you on an overseas trip ? Alone or with a group ?</p>
              <p>If alone.. perhaps you do have a fighting chance.. if group
              trip.. sorry dude.. she's just being nice as a FRIEND.</p>

              <p>Apparently, you didn't even read my 1st post or just got confused. FIY, what I've posted was the whole scenario. </p>

              <p>If you read my 1st post, I actually wrote this, "<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">It appeared that she had feelings for me as well".</span></p>
              <p>I posted in uncertainty is not because I'm unsure of my feelings for her, it is the fact that I'm unsure of what to do when we are meeting up.</p>

              <p>Actually.. I did read through your thread.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately... it seems.. you are too focused on the location and dates/time to make it work.</p>
              <p>Working magic on a girl.. is not like baking a cake.. it's not about how much flour you put in and which cooking appliance to use.</p>
              <p>A relationship does not start with a flick of a switch.</p>
              <p>You really need to change your approach. The way you are doing it... I can tell... because you are so focused on issues that are not really important.. you are neglecting those which are important to make a relationship blossom.</p>
              <p>It does not matter where you bring her.. or what special date you choose. If the two of you are made for each other.. the heart beats in sync anytime.. anywhere.. anyway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remember.. if she can have fun and enjoys the date.. you have scored points.</p>
              <p>When you are too self conscious and too worried about the outcome.. you will become very intense and uptight.</p>
              <p>Relax and enjoy the night.That's all to it.</p>

              <p>Yes, this I agree with you. Like what parn and one other guy said, I was too focused on non-related things like where to go and what to do, and I totally overlooked the main objective. That is why our date on the 31st was somehow normal, it was like what we would do in the past. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>About your last question, I've decided on when to do it already. </p>

              <p>Ok, maybe my choice of words was wrong. Its not a special date or anything. It is just something which I'm going to do that might actually catch her at the right mood. She had told me this before, just that I haven't fulfilled it for her.</p>
