The thing about devoloping feelings from zero is possible - however, when you go along the route of your life and when get to know another guy who give you an entire different feeling - chances are, you will succumb.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You have been with him for a year and still no much feelings - seriously speaking, in the first place, why did you agree to be in this relationship?<br><br>Cheers</div>

Common interest is a good foundation for a lasting relationship - but it does not equate to love. As for the making-you-happy part - its a should-have in a relationship - but all these still does not equate to love.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Too good to give a miss? Well, What's use of entering into a relationship with the best guy this world could ever offer when the feelings is not right and probably appreciation is not as deep?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
