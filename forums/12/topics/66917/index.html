            <div class='col-md body'>I happen to like 3 girls at the same time and of course I know there is only 1 girl that I can choose. I am currently studying a local poly and 1 of the girls is from another course and same year as me. The second girl is a junior of mine in the same course as me. The third girl is someone whom I have not met as she is a girl I met online chatting.<br><br>I find the first girl attractive or rather developed a crush on her because she is somewhat very friendly and rather cheerful look. Though she does not look very beauiful nor cute, there is something about her that attracts me that I cannot put it in words.<br>Recently someone told me she has broken off with a bf and egged me on to chase her, but I would not want to do so, especially just after someone has broken up. Sometimes I think, maybe she could be just a nice friend that I would like to have that kind of feeling.<br><br>Anyway for the second girl, when I first saw her, I was deeply attracted to her looks. She has this cute look that is almost making my heart go bonkers when I see her. Another thing is, she has this dress sense that adds up to the attraction or rather infatuation, that I find it hard to describe it here. Anyway whatever she wears I feel she looks good in it. In short, I find her dress sense superb.<br>I then started to find out what class is she in, her name and her school email address. I know this sounds like a voyeur or stalking her but I just want to know more about her.<br>Everytime I see her, I go crazy, more or less and whenever I think of her, I smile so wide my lips are going to snap. The other day, I happened to see her and I was close enough to hear her talk. I only heard her saying a word and oh god! my heartbeat rate skyrocketed. As far as I know, she probably does not know of me, yet, I hope. So far, I have been thinking of ways to getting to know her and discreetly trying to find out whether she has a bf or not. If so, then I would give up.<br><br>Then the girl online. I happen to know her because of some common interests in cars then as we talked, we had near similar interests like korean pop. Though we have never met, I have developed this crush on her suddenly and I have no idea why, since then everytime she comes online we would chat through ICQ for sometime until late. Then once she was abroad for a few days and I missed her a quite abit. Whenever I turn on my ICQ only to find that she is still offline, I get abit disappointed and would go offline if there is no one else online.<br><br>I am abit confused as to which girl should I choose, or something. I am unable to come up with a word to replace choose, I am afraid, because right now I am in a headache. Anyway, neither girls know of my liking,crush, infatuation or whatever you call it. Would you consider it to be a "safe area"?<br><br>Please advise</div>
