Girls with so high feelings for you will rather put aside all agenda, just to be with you.<br><br>Good in some way because she loves you a lot, but she just doesn't have the sort of self-control.

            <div class='col-md body'>Note: this is just my WORTHLESS 2 cents worth!!!!<br><br>hhmm...i feel many of the postings here are correct, but there're a few fundamental underlying truths that can tie most of these observations and advice into a coherent whole...<br><br>1) In terms of many of the usual important attributes: like intelligence, earning power, looks and what not, from wat i gather, the guy is probably obviously superior to the gal.  That in itself explains so many things. Moral of the story: a compatible partnership is the most stable partnership. Both guy and girl are probably acting perfectly rationally under these incompatible r/s, the guy wants something better and feels selfish while the girl wants to hold on and feels insecure.<br><br>2) For a person to mature sufficiently to know oneself well and what one shld look for in a partner, it usually involves some heartache and proabably a few failed r/s.<br><br>To guy: I sincerely hope ur really making an objective assessment of the both of u. Pls check with a few neutral and wiser,older parties to avoid over-estimating urself and discounting her.<br><br>If you do eventually break up with her, pls do not use only superficial symptoms like " too controlling" as the excuse. It is better to say the truth: that due to the underlying incompatibility, you do not love her as much as she deserves.<br><br>Like i said, just my worthless 2 cents...</div>

Have you ever told her about how you are feeling before?  About the space you need from her etc?<br><br>If you have done everything and you are still not happy then the only way to go is to breakup with her.  I know you don't want to hurt her but the longer you put it off, the more you are going to hurt her as you have dragged her deeper into the relationship.  Don't waste her and your time.  (Chinese saying "Chang tung bu lou tuan tung" ). At least she is still young to look for another Mr Right.<br><br>I believe one of the main issues you have is that both of you are in a different stage of the relationship.  Your girlfriend is most likely looking for a long-term relationship and wants to settle down while you still want to look around, to explore and to find your Miss Right.  Girls are usually more mature than boys at the same age until the guys turn 25.<br><br>Good luck and hope everything will work out for you in the end!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

Me, i've only to say she's my longest relationship partly because she's more initiative. I've realised sometimes what one's insecurities can do in a relationship and make both suffer. She's been having a hard time at work, and i had to tell her that yesterday. It's really hard for me too. I just needed to breathe....space to breathe. Mostly when we're together, i feel i cant keep up with her. I cant keep up with her requests and many other things.<br><br>Last night when i was in bed, just felt so hurt. Hurt for her, and also i missed abit of the times we're together cos we've been seeing each other almost every other day for the past 1 year or so. Is it that i really liked her? Then why do i always think i deserve a better and more prettier and demure girl? She's waiting for an answer though she told me she dare not hope. Prayed to God, but i need an answer.</div></blockquote>wanted to reply the very moment i saw this post but was kept busy with projects and stuff...<br><br>dear TS,<br><br>the way that you had described your gf, is so much like me. I mean, i am a guy and it seems like i am the guy version of your gf. initially in my relationship with my gf, i too will hasten her for a solution immediately after whatever disputes we had, and although she does not really "give in" to me, but i am the one doing all the work to try to mend things up.<br><br>however, now i have toned down quite a bit (i dun hasten her anymore, and leave her alone for a while). but why is it that we will behave like that? it is simply because we are trying our best to make the relationship work so as to leave no regrets.<br><br>isn't it better that she will like always try to mediate the situation instead of just running away from the problem everytime it arises? her effort is 100%, and you have to applaud her for that. although i agree that too much of coercing limits one space to "breathe".<br><br>i believe one way of making you and her feel better after a quarrel is you to tell her that you need some time alone, and at the same time you need to give her assurances that everything will be OK after you get to spend some time alone. this will set her mind at ease, and i feel she will gladly leave you alone for a while. unless you really feel to end the relationship with her, then dun give her false hopes.<br><br>do you realise that everytime after a quarrel and if you display something like a "hack care" attitude, it hurts her a lot?<br><br>if you love her, dun hurt her.<br><br>hope you will find your direction soon...</div>
