Prayed to God, but i need an answer.</div></blockquote>You're just trying to be SWEET... Getting BORED? Probably TIRED....<br><br>You're just not being much of YOU anymore....<br><br>Your gf do loves you ALOT now, doesn't she...? Can be one 'crazy' woman...? That's why she can 'tolerate' your nonsense.....?<br><br>SERIOUSLY... I find it sort of HARD and DIFFICULT to be convinced when ya said that you're 'serious' and especially 'commited' to her... So were ya actually thinking when ya said all that....? Or are you simply saying all that based on the time spent so closely with her.....? Making you believe that you're actually that....?<br><br>Don't mind me being a little 'straightforward' here... But just <strong>how</strong> did the both of ya 1st got together....? It seems to me that the reason or way which both of ya got 'binded' together does create some of the (important?) issues as to why you could be finding the road more and more difficult to march on....<br><br>To BEGIN with... I feel that you would NEED to strike off a BALANCE... Between your relationship and your life... Have somehow more control over it, and not let your gf run the show totally... Haven't you realised it yet...? She's like... Becoming more and more unlike your gf... Would be more like your mother if ya ask me...? And you're just like a small boy lost in the playground... So unlike you.....<br><br>You're missing her probably for the reason that is related to how both of ya got together in the 1st place... Your relationship has already shifted its platform.... While she might be getting fairly comfortable with the change (which is probably led by her), you're fast finding yourself on an alien's ground...<br><br>Some relationships are just GOOD the way it was... Think you're probably no where too near the stage to receive and embrace the next step into this relationship yet...? Think about it yourself... Like you've said, you've previously only had short-term relationships.... The 1st true 'commitment' case and you'll have too many questions stirring up your head from time to time...<br><br>By the way, how old are the both of ya?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Insightist:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi guys,<br><br>Just initiated a cool off with my gf. It has already been on my mind for a while already. I plucked up the courage to ask for it yesterday night. Reason being everytime after a quarrel, she would hasten me for a solution, and seeing her so upset and hurt, i usually give in by saying im ok already and make up with her. Yesterday, i just felt too tired. She's my longest gf to date. A looker she is not, average and a rather complicated history behind her. However she wins with her charm and caring personality. Just that i feel her love is sometimes too overwhelming. She will talk about seeing a future together when im going overseas next year for studies. She says she sees that im the one. All these pressure, i just dont know how to handle. I mean im serious and committed with her, but i dont like to make promises in the future when it does not happen.<br><br>We dated very very briefly before getting together. Maybe briefly wouldnt even come close. But we lasted a year plus. Endless quarrels and differences. But that aside, sometimes i just feel whether im limiting myself too much by not socialising. She on the other hand, has dated quite abit, thus she's been in a few long relationships to know what she wants. Me, i've only to say she's my longest relationship partly because she's more initiative. I've realised sometimes what one's insecurities can do in a relationship and make both suffer. She's been having a hard time at work, and i had to tell her that yesterday. It's really hard for me too. I just needed to breathe....space to breathe. Mostly when we're together, i feel i cant keep up with her. I cant keep up with her requests and many other things.<br><br>Last night when i was in bed, just felt so hurt. Hurt for her, and also i missed abit of the times we're together cos we've been seeing each other almost every other day for the past 1 year or so. Is it that i really liked her? Then why do i always think i deserve a better and more prettier and demure girl? She's waiting for an answer though she told me she dare not hope. Prayed to God, but i need an answer.</div></blockquote>Let me tell you something: I think this girl is not good for long-term material if you are planning to get her as a wife. She is not independent and she keeps calling you every now and then. I mean, come on, where is her discipline? Tell her to take it slow. Don't come on to you like a tigress.<br><br>Even though she has dated quite a bit, I don't think she is experienced enough. She couldn't control herself...not classy!<br><br>Can you imagine her calling you every hour especially when you are having a business meeting or doing your studies? Does she need so much love to validate her? Does she try to control you often also in the r/s? She is like the male version of the controller. Can you imagine getting married to her?<br><br>What you can do is tell her to take it slow and easy and let you breathe. If she doesn't, drop her.<br><br>doko</div>

The thought of breaking off has actually crossed my mind 6mths into the relationship. Each time, i told myself she's not yet settled down, maybe i shouldn be so selfish to think of my own feelings, and i should try to make the relationship work. But i feel i cant breathe any longer. At the same time now she's been msging me off and on during this cool off to make small chats.
