              <p>Northland secoundry school located at yishun ave 1 is is not a
                  good school. ever since my uncle's 14 yr old daughter study there, she comes back stressed and depressed. she's not eating well, complaining the other girls tease her n the boys all disturb her .even her
                  so-called friends dont support her. Some also make fun of her race
                  and cluture since she's a native of india who just came here a few
                  months ago she's in sec 1 now and will be in secondary 2 next year. She's a bright girl.  I have
                  heard her crying in the room yesterday. So. i spoke to her she's afraid
                  to tell her teachers and parents but she confides in me her studies.  Her results declined although she passed but she's just not the same.</p>
              <p>i called the
                  office today n the cleark or admin was unresponsive. After putting me on hold for 50 mins, she said that if this is the case i should
                  talk to the teacher. so i asked for the teacher said she is not
                  responsible for the bullying  and the disciplinary master was the one in
                  charge. She said when school re-opens, she can  talk to her.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile this
                  poor girl has to go to school everyday for CCA and she comes back home
                  shacked/tired/exhausted. Not like a holiday at all!  Untill school re-opens ,  bullying and exhasution the could be addressed  this<strong> is
                  northlands education enviroment i was even shocked at the teachers
                  tone so uncaring i dnt want to mention names but when she said it
                  was not her responsibility it was anoying to think she only wad job
                  shes given n have no empthy for a student in her class i thought
                  singapore schools r better but seems i was worng i hope some action
                  will be taken i intent to talk to the principle abt this matter</strong></p>

              <p>You are going around this all wrong !!!<br>Nowaday Singapore kids have grown up with with all races &amp; religion, so it is not that she is an indian issues - it is more then that.<br><br>Yes she maybe foregin, and she does not adapt to the local environment - refuse to or unable to - take may have cause misunderstand, or her actions or words even anger some of her classmate for them to treat her that way. Instead of looking for the real problem - you are just trying to blame it on others, and insist everyone to change to suit her.  </p>
              <p>I think running to see the teacher &amp; principle is not the solution, it just set a very wrong example for your niece - she just learn from you to take the easy way out blame very one and insist everyone do something about it ... but ownself - think of it what example you set for her ? to blame her unpopular in school to everyone, but herself.</p>
              <p>I think it is time to really review with your niece the real reason of her unpopular ? it maybe something she say wrong or some actions. <br><br><br><br><br></p>

              <p>I don't think it's because local indians don't get teased; it's because they are used to it vs. someone who came from india and never experienced it before.</p>
