Thank You.<br></div></blockquote>It seems very unlikely that your case should be Atrial Fibrillation. One thing you should understand is that clinic symptoms can sometimes be rather brief and general things.. That's why you need diagnostic test... What your doctors have recommended are more than enough to cover Atrial Fibrillation alone... IN FACT, they have also taken the EXTRA CARE to rule out some of the OTHER possibly related diseases...<br><br>If you still have much doubt about your condition, what I would personally suggest to you is to stop suspecting yuorself to be a Atrial Fibrillation case. Go to a general doctor and perhaps get you to see specialist from another area rather than thinking that it's chronic.<br><br>In any case, pls feel free to refer to the forum recommended above.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think i have a few symptoms quite like yours..<br><br>The thing is it strikes out of nowhere... esp when i'm relaxed... my heart will start beating fast for no reason.. And sometimes my heart will start to hurt..(i'm sure its not a heartbreak thing)..<br><br>I told the doctor about it but the doctor told me to tell my camp MO when i'm having it..<br><br>Well. That's what you should do. Everytime you feel that you can't go on in BMT anymore... just voice out to your sgt/pc. In fact, raise it out to yr sgt once you know which school and company you'll be going.<br><br>They'll keep a lookout for you.<br><br>You'll be fine.. don't worry so much.</div>

So it's lucky of you to know what you could be having.<br><br>Cramps happen when you're not having enough sodium in your daily dietary intake. And you're stressed over something that has been troubling you. Are you having enough rest? Been sleeping well?<br><br>Rest more and make sure that your head is rested well against your pillow as incorrect head posture during sleeping could deny sufficient oxygen supply to your brain, muscle, internals. You may not feel the difference until you feel that you're waking up feeling more tired than yesterday and you never got rid of the tiredness no matter how long you've slept. Also remember to drink sufficient plain water daily. And walk more daily if you want to feel better.<br><br>Don't worry about the enlistment issue &lt;- Is this troubling you? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
