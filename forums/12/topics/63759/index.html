Its obvious he wanted to show you this stand first (that is he cannot forget his kinda most-loved girl) and when he wants to leave this relationship, he could easily make sure of such excuses to break up the relationship.<br><br>Oh hell yeah, how many similiar cases have I encountered before? *Recalls*<br><br>If you can't forget, you can only be a substitude.

However, I shall say, its natural and all part of the cycle - you tried to move on with your life and found another guy whom you feel comfortable with. Your ex returns and you quickly go back to your security to forgo new possible happiness. Of course your feelings retains. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>***<br><br>Point 1 &amp; 2 are two separate issues. Therefore, whether he has right no right, whose right or not right cannot be determined by adding these two scenario together and poof - the result. Anyway, seriously speaking, does it matters? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You both got patched back one fine day? And I presumed it happened in a breeze? Hate to say this out, but a patch needs to take <strong>farking MUCH MORE </strong>(sorry for the language, but I need to show the emphasis) consideration then the first-chase.<br><br>Issues to think about:<br><br>I) So what's your point of patching? Have you both solve the problems that existed in the past? Please note problems don't disappear from break-patch method. In fact, it<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> accumulates</span>.<br><br>II) So what's his point of patching - If he still loves the other woman? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You both need to talk about the reason why before getting together.

Maybe it's also a time for him to settle down his thoughts and this final decision he has revealed to you?<br><br>Like he had said... At least he had tried? I sense a TENSION point and 'struggle' within himself around the period where he alleged you of having an extra relationship.. I FEEL... The 'angry' was not purely of the things you were doing then but more like because of the 'burden' you're adding to his 'struggle'.... I'm not saying he's right on this part though...? I SENSE... It could have been quite a difficult struggle for him... There is an equal chance that like the others had said, he's just a selfish man... But if his decision was all too soon to be with the other girl, then perhaps his love ain't much too deep for you or he's just a man deprived of feelings...<br><br>Despite how much you would really wants him to be with you... Or maybe even very much the same... He wishes to be with you.... Do you think he would feel any better if he's just thinking about the other girl while he's holding you? Would you feel any better (up to this point) if this scenerio is to be continued...?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"A broken string for kite, distal it shall be...
