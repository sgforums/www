I was really devastated when we broke up.<br><br>she says after we break up, she wants us to remain friends, well it has been almost 2 months since we broke up... she never called, she never mailed, not even a single sms. I called her asking her to reconsider, she was very confused... It hurts me to see her this way, I forced myself to let go... I wrote her an email telling her that I will let go and never turn back anymore. She never replied, just like all the other emails that I sent.<br><br>I have tried, I wanted to move on. I still miss her very much. thinking about all the things we did together... it is really hard for me to forget her... when I go to the movies, and I see some sad moments, I remembered how I would wipe the tears from her eyes, and ended up crying myself thinking that I can't do that anymore.<br><br>I have to try very hard not to call her, and I didn't call for the last 2 weeks, I finally called her just today... she was having dinner with her new guy, she sounded happy, well guess it is going to be like that. I am worried I might give her the feeling I am intruding her life, therefore I just tell her that I will call her next time, and hung up. But I guess I felt better too hearing her voice, and knowing that she is happy, hoping that the other guy out there is treating her better than I did... not that I treated her badly, but I must have done something wrong if she were to leave me...<br><br>I tell myself, I will learn to be better, I will wait for her, just in case she wants to come back... I will always welcome her back into my life. I don't want her to come back to a loser, I want to proof to her that I am worthy of her. If she don't come back, well she has found happiness anyway, so I should be happy too.<br><br>I love her very much... always will... and like Bear, I never blamed her for anything, I tried, but I cant, I can only blame myself, Why there is so much I wanted to tell her now, but I never told her before we broke up.<br><br>but I guess what's happened has happened, maybe she'll come back, maybe she won't. I'll still hope she does, but in the meantime just get on with life, move on... and let the future unravels itself...</div>

Most of the time, when love has little effect on the giver, his words tends to fall under this category. The words, meaning and sentence structure are either:<br><br>(I) meaning from the heart<br>(II) recurring thoughts (whether to implement or not)<br>(III) A point consideration, moments ago/alternative<br><br>Notice that the people with possessiveness, MCP, etc flaws often use angry comments when trying to express their idea. Lower EQ and other factors contribute to that. Deep inside, of course, they love their partner.
