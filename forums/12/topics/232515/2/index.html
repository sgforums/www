(btw, when they ask you to sell the products, they ask you to target your family members and relatives.)<br><br>seriously, ask him to get a stable job. cos even if he sold one freaking mattress, he only get either 6% or 8%. after which, the company "tax" it due to currency exchange bullshit. which comes to about $50 of income to sell a $200-worth mattress at $1500. tell him that. does he want all his earnings to go to his big boss? at least be like me, i worked at a factory during december. And now got enough money for me to enjoy and 'survive' till april while still not working. MLM sucks all your relative's money and yours as well.</div>
