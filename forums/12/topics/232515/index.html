            <div class='col-md body'>Hi people, i'm currently in the university, staying in hostel and is veri troubled by what my brother is doing as a job.<br><br>Last sunday when i was at home, he told me he found a job. I asked him wad it was and he told me it's E*y*uth, Multi Level Marketing. I've been there b4, and i noe it's not a good company to start off with.<br><br>Of coz, i persuaded him not to join, but he gave skeptical remarks like "it's ISO awarded, can earn alot of money" Blah blah blah..<br><br>So he went off with all the talks while i'm at hostel. So yesterday, my mum called me to say that my brother needed 400 as deposit to the company. I was like -_-" that's like a huge % of my dad's pay. I tink my mum rejected him offhand and later he called back the comapny say no need liao. (it's fishy dun u tink so -_-)<br><br>So now, my bro is asking my mum for his NETS so he can get $$ to buy the stupis electro matress at 1.5k Come on, I'm older den him, and i've yet to spent up to a stupid 1k on any single entity. U noe how MLM works, i'm veri afraid that my ill-willed brother will get brain-washed by them.<br><br>My mum is also pleading me to go with him on the talks, to prevent him from signing any stupid agreement or stuffs.<br><br>So wad can i do bout my no-brainer brother? I do not want him to be cheated of my dad's hard earn money, and i certainly cant juggle this shyt, going down to his useless talks, my cca and my uni life.<br><br>SOS pls.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello moto tell your bro about my case in MLM that i almost got cheated...i got a terrible experience 4 years ago...the ppl there talk nicely and sweetly for u and like will help u earn your first buck when u join in thier company. How they help? again ask you to cheat other ppl by psychoing them into joining your team.<br><br>This is what happens between my long lost friends and me. One day he met me up and brought me into one company that he boast about job stability blah blah. End up he show me the modern concepts of network marketing. Got so enticed with the thing pay up $30 upfront for admin cuz i need to go home borrow $500 from dad. later learn the ugly truth from my dad that MLM also known as pyramid selling and tell me not to feed the trolls for they are still cheating the young minds.<br><br>My ah pa somemore said "du lan right? $30 got eaten next time u go open the god damn MLM company on your own if u want revenge -_-". And he reminded me that if ppl find a gold mine they wun go around telling u they found it. Be weary of ppl selling u treasure maps in these case the act done by the MLM agents.<br><br>Any tom dick and harry can work or open up thier MLM company. Most importantly tell him that MLM less lightly guarantee his career path, makes some of money if successful, spend plenty of time sweet talking but lose alot of his circle of friends around him in the end. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
