Besides you had apologise. Please do not grovel and lose your dignity.<br><br>If you had done your apologies sincerely. Once is enough. The ball is in her court.<br><br>But if you ask me, you are over thinking. You should just call her instead of SMS. Ask you directly if she is still angry and did she not accept your apology. If she is still angry after your call and sms and whatever. Is she throwing a tantrum or what? Do you want to be with such a high maintenance person. This is your choice but once you choose this way, we have no other advice but to tell you to put up with all the trash she's gonna heap on you.<br><br>In my opinion, a lot of men go for such kinds of high maintenance girls, spoil them further and then ended up putting up with the bad behaviour.<br><br>I would also add, you might also think I am sprouting rubbish - depending on prespective.</div>

Certainly, you think that what you did might not warrant such a reaction from her..however, normally, the person at fault, will always  think that his/her actions is a norm, and they always wonder why the other party has such a big reaction..<br><br>"its not a big deal what!"<br><br>if she is so piss off, it must be something that you did but yet you think is just a small matter..<br>have a talk with her, and ask her specifically what you think which makes her so angry...come on, even though you had appologise, gals still prefer to be humor....<br>cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
