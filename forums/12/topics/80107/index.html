Like others have correctly pointed out, you need to talk to him, tell him what's bothering you.<br><br>It's only been 6 weeks - call it teething problems, whatever, just give yourself some more time and try and acquaint yourself with Singapore.  It's important to find stuff that interests you here, and perhaps a couple of friends, so that you don't feel so lonely when he's busy at work.</div>
