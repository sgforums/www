              <p>Hey TS, your story quite interesting so I will try to reply to the best of my ability. I think the end result of your situation is very simple, you will leave with your husband, and your child will be raised up together with him. That is the only situation I see that is good and you will be happy with, so don't even think about letting your daughter be brought up by your mum.</p>
              <p>You cannot let your mum keep your granddaughter, because children must live and be brought up by their own parents, unless there is a major difficulty. If you want your child to grow up happy, then you must take her with you to be brought up with your husband.</p>
              <p>But of course, there is the mother issue. The most ideal situation is your mum let your daughter go in peace, correct? So you must try to understand why she wants to keep your daughter. Maybe she thinks that if she keep your daughter, she will also keep you, and she secretly just don't want to lose you? You can try to talk to her to find out the truth, but I assure you she is not trying to be difficult, it's just that she doesn't know how to communicate her feelings, and only can let it out as anger. Meanwhile you and your hubby must put on your best behaviour towards her, so that she cannot fault you. If u keep on treating her nice, how can she complain? Very soon she will also agree to let your daughter leave with you in peace. LIke some others say, you can promise to visit her lah. Absence makes the heart fonder mah, maybe after you leave the relationship will improve also.</p>

              <p>Since you call her your 'princess', that mean she really meant for you. So, why letting her away from you? I strongly advise that keep her right beside you wherever you are.</p>
              <p>i'd been having  a hard time to protect my little prince to stay by my side too. Even untill now, the problems still on going like unstoppable one 'coz my sis-in-law (a spy) is still living with us. My parents-in-law always blame me for keeping my son with me and don't let them take him back to M'sia. Even my husband blame me for not respecting his parent by doing so.</p>
              <p>No matter what, i'm still standing hard on my own position - keep my little prince with me.</p>
              <p>Don't ever leave your own child behind. If you would do so, why do you bring her to this world at the first point?? Now you brought her to this world, that mean you want her. Why you want to leave her with other people?? ----this is what in my mind.</p>
              <p>You don't habe to feel bad for your mom. She has to be understanding in this situation. Ask if she can think about it on your side.</p>

              <p><br>Well..... I certainly see you doing a lot of judging yourself.</p>
              <p>Your daugter should certainly live and grow up with you and your husband. But by completely dismissing your mother, whom you turned to for the past 3 years when you were in need, is not fair either.</p>
              <p>I urge you to be a 'bigger' person and try being a little more understanding. You may feel a lot of anger and hatred for your mom, but until you let go of the past and your hatred, you won't become the 'great' mom that you could be for your daughter.</p>

              <p>jojobeach, u're right.... that's why no matter what i won't give
              up my baby for them. They still keep asking to give birth for
              another one or two, i told them...don't ever think about it. Die
              die i won't bring this 'shxxt' thing for myself anymore. You all
              just treat me as a 'birth machine'.</p>

              <p>Next time your sis in law call your son zai zai again... just say " His name is "David ( your son name) " , please don't confuse him".</p>
              <p>You need to learn how to draw boundaries and enforce it, a lot of time people will want to try to cross it.. just put them in their place whenever they do.</p>

              <p><br>if yr sis in laws is willing to open a bank account with yr son name, put her saving there, then maybe calling Zai zai is ok, even call ah siao also can do, for that matter</p>
