            <div class='col-md body'>agree half half to the statement loh, as ppl haf said, how u define good guys?i tink in many contexts ppl refer good guys as those ppl who r nerdy or guai n so dun reali go after girls. well at times if they dun go aft what they want, then the girls wun knw abt them n may not even take notice of them. it wuld b their fault then.<br><br>i muz admit that there r ppl who r absolutely shy abt it n totally jittery abt talkin to a girl they like. moreover the absolute fear of rejection comes more to them since they r mostly considered 'nerdy' n 'uncool', while most guys whom girls notice first r the 'cool' ppl.<br><br>however, its not all 'good guys' who r like that.<br>1. some girls do notice guys for their talents other than juz being suave or fit. though the numbers r lesser while at a young age.<br><br>2. good guys in other contexts can mean juz being nice n considerate for their mate. those shld b able to get girls as long as they go for it as what most girls want is to feel loved(material comfort n biasness aside).<br><br>3. bad guys dun usually last in a r/s unless the girl doesnt think logically(which i agree that at many times is so, though it doesnt always apply to GIRLS ONLI)<br><br>4. repecting someone doesnt mean u dun go try. u can try to get that girl first, tell her how u feel abt her(dun haf to b too romantic abt this part otherwise the girl might b frightened off). it doesnt mean that u THINK or ASSUME that the girl wun like u therefore u juz give up n say u RESPECT her. thats juz being assumptious.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>A lot of guys mentioned that there are good guys out there and they are often overlooked.</blockquote>Agree. And, I can say there is very severe communication problems between men and women who are introvert. Both groups are very suitable for each other but they will never meet because of their quiet and shy nature.<br><br><blockquote>Though that may be true, I think it's partially because good guys just don't go after things they like/want.</blockquote>Disagree. Most men (good/bad) will always go after what they like/want unless they feel that there is not point going after it anymore. In most cases, there are many obstacles<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">internal factors and external factors) from getting what they want, thus they might give up before they actually try to get it.<br><br><blockquote>They "respect" the person and hope that the person is attracted to them for who they are and then miraculously, something will happen between the two.</blockquote>Whether something will happen or not will depends on each other actions.<br><br><blockquote>I know how it is... I've been there and even now, things are still like that for me. I'm just not someone who aggressively pursues because I want a girl to like me for me.</blockquote>It is just a matter of self-understanding. I always find we that humans are rather silly in some ways. For example, most of us spend many years in school learning this and learning that, but what all of us really should/must learn is the understanding of self, something which is extremely important to each of us, but we always overlook.<br><br>As long as you have doubt about -&gt; whether what you want is really what you wanted, you will never aggressive pursues it.<br>So in my opinion, the best thing to do when in such situation is to gradually increase your knowledge, thus decreasing your doubts.</div>
