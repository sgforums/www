            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that you will attract different girls depending on what type of guy you are.<br>So many posts already on girls being materialistic and not the family type, go for looks and money.<br><br>Well basically I think there are 2 types of girls.<br><br>First type are the open minded modern type. I mean if you sit back and keep quiet and hope and hope that the girl makes the first move. Most probably you are going to end up with this type of girl. So don't complain that the girl only looks for money and is materialistic when you find that things don't work out. But on the other hand, if you are looking for a partner tat is independent and can earn her own keeps, then this type very suitable for you. Just don't expect her to be submissive and give in to you because its equality of the sexes.<br><br>Second type are the quieter type. Not necessarily shy but who still feel that guys should make the first move. Meaning that if you don't make the effort to make the first move you will never get this kind of girl since she also won't say anything even if she loves you to bits. This type of girl probably expects more out of you because "you are the guy". But at the same time she will prob also do more things for you because "she is the girl". Of cos this kind of girls also may not suit everyone because she may not be very independent and will rely on you.<br><br>I don't think nice guys finish last. Maybe they are not always noticed first and are often overlooked. But I do believe that the nice guys (though may wait a bit longer) will end up with a nice partner. Persistance will eventually though the girl's heart. (not stalker kind of persistance.....that kind will win CID heart)<br><br></div>

They "respect" the person and hope that the person is attracted to them for who they are and then miraculously, something will happen between the two.</strong>  I know how it is...

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess sincerity plays the major part here.. you can be a good guy and still chat up girls, make friends, and if it works out, then everything goes from there.. similarly a bad guy can wait wait wait for the dumb girl to suay suay go chat him up too lol.. so of course that blog statement is not very accurate.. note: when i say chat up, there are many forms of chatting up too..from daily chats between male-female friends, to one-off between strangers.. its really quite easy to see the sincerity of a guy, whether he's after your heart or between your legs..</div>
