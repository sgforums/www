Her infection could be cause by 2 possible reasons:<br><br>I) Infection due to hygience. This is not too serious. Probably a little cut somewhere may lead to greater problems due to poor hygience.<br><br>II) Infection due to sexual diseases. This is serious.<br><br>Actually, what you are more concerned over is her bf's insensitive nature. This is serious because her bf is more controlled by what's in between his legs than her physical conditions. There is a need to have a little talk with him. This communication part has to revolve about this issue. Why? Because guys are such that 'UNLESS <strong>YOU SPEAK</strong>, THEY DUNNO.' But I have to say that he is truely over-ruled by his dick. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
