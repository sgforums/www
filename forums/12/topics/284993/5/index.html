Sorry I am still weak  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> Maybe I love her so much, I neglected my own well-being.<br><br></div></blockquote>Never neglect yourself. I had learnt that from my current situation that you will only become a doormat and hate yourself for it.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Not possible. The only time when she 'allows' me to be away from her is work and outing with my friend. If I go by myself, she will say then get married for what, might as well divorce. Even if I somehow manage to go, she will think I go fool around, and then follow me, and then blame me for bringing her along.<br></strong></blockquote>Marriage is not Prison. She cannot even tell the difference. She will live to regret it one day.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>In-laws are compulsory. I only want to go to 1 close family. She say she scared being judged there. That the aunties will gossip about her. I did not force her to visit each and every one of my relatives. I told her this "If anybody say anything bad behind your back, I will break off relationship with them because you are my wife." She say how we would know, and then start to change topic and pick a fight with me again.<br></strong></blockquote>Nothing is compulsory.  She afraid people talk? She not afraid people talk more when she divorce? She not afraid your relatives talk? She very conflicting.<br>If she choose to listen, she should listen to good stuff, not the negative things all relatives say. I have never heard of any relative have anything good to say of other relatives or people. You wife is immature and you didn't help her grow up.  You suffer the consequence.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Not long. I am preparing for endgame. Thanks. </strong></blockquote>[/b][/quote]<br><br>Let me put it across to you. Learn the lesson. If you didn't, you know jolly well it will repeat. I stand my ground and I air my issues.  I will learn more from other people as well especially on how to say NO and get my fair share.  I do not know if I will move out or not but all I know is that I do not care more or less about my r/s and I use it a a training ground to be a better person towards myself and then only then i can be a stronger person for other people be it with my current husband or maybe if things didn't work out for my future.<br><br></div>

Single and happy?</div></blockquote>I am happy as long as I choose to be.<br><br>My husband ask me to stay. I give it another try.<br><br>As for my MIL, she want to act, then i play the same game with her. She think I stupid and a push over.  This time round, I play to win, I no longer play so as to not lose.<br><br>For example:<br><br>I know she is given some money for groceries for our family. Her oldest son does not give her enough to feed the kids he dump on us. My husband sometimes buy groceries for the family and we pay all the bills. But she complains she does not have enough money and demands to collect money from me and demanded a large sum and made it mandatory. She called my mom claiming that I make a lot of money as a office worker with a easy job (she works a taufu seller and only open 5 days a week - works half day anyways and complains tired and always pretend to be sick to gain sympathy points) and I am barren and therefore obligated to pay for her grand kids and her expenses. BUT she comes and tell me another story:  household not enough money the 1st time she demand money from me. This month, she demanded money saying she is paying for my FIL medicines. However, I know my husband and his sister paid for my FIL. So she's lying to me all this time. Then I argue with my husband why should I be made responsible for FIL medical bills when FIL has 3 kids.  So I overturn her demands to pay any household to her. I always feel that if I want to contribute, I will pay for the entertainment we spend together or the holiday we spend together or the petrol bills or any bills I can get my hands on and I let my husband know. I have never like to put money in my MIL hands because I know she's dishonest and scheming.<br><br>She play the game. I play back. She's unhappy and been slamming doors when my husband is not around. But like I say, in front of my husband she acts. When my husband is not around... that's when the action happens. I also do this to show I can play the game and I am warning her.<br>She better not push me too much. To me divorce is not a big deal and I can live better on my own than with her around.  I don't think I cannot survive without my husband, in fact, I am used to renting rooms and staying on my own. My husband never left his family and is never really independent and never tasted freedom.<br><br></div>

Siao.. treat marriage like what..<br><br>It is a small thing to divorce over but small things are like beetles eating away the healthy trunks, killing the tree slowly. There the problem Ts is facing, the pent-up frustration. Try to forgive, let go, cos in life, a lot of sorrows occurs because we refuse to forgive, refused to step out of ourselves and then fall into the "net of anger".. trapped and entangled.. Deal the problem with a cool head and not with an angry state of mind.<br><br>If you really want to save the marriage in the long run. See a marriage counselors to meditate the problems. Cos it seems both of you don't know how to resolve conflicts in the relationship. Don't want to see each other's point. Don't give way to one another. Both have faults..<br><br>Now if quarrel occurs often, what kind of family it will be ? If both of you have kid, i can image how sad your kid will be ........<br></div>
