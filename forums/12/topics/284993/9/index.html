Both of you need to learn to listen before reacting.<br><br>If both of you still want to keep this marriage to go on.  You need to work out some agreements.  For example, agree not to bring up divorce everything there is an argument. Or agree to let the other person talk until he/she is ready to listen.<br><br>I recommend that BOTH of you read through "The Four Seasons of Marriage" by Gary Chapman. I think some of the advice in the book is very helpful.</div>

I do not see the point in being so frustrated anymore. After over 1 year's threats, after making her promise not to do it, it's still the same. So just take it easy, since she manage to put the word divorce in my mind, I just don't see it as a serious thing anymore. Just an alternative. Anyway, thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Building a successful marriage</span><br><br>Success in marriage is based on compatibility rather than just finding the right partner. Both partners must try to be the right person by acting out of mutual respect, love and concern for each other. Love is an inner feeling and af fulfillment arising from the mutual healthy growth with and for the other person. In a successful marriage, a partner must not always try to get things his or her own way. This brings to mind a humorous saying - " Man has his will but woman has her way ". There is only one path to be trodden by both; it may be uneven, bumpy and sometimes difficult, but it is always a "mutual path".<br><br>A happy marriage is not one in which exist with eyes closed. We see faults as well as virtues and we should accept the fact that no one is perfect. A husband and wife must learn to share the happiness and pain in their daily lives. Mutual understanding is the secret formula of a happy marriage. Marriage is a blessing but unfortunately, many people treat it otherwise due to lack of correct communication and understanding.<br><br>Most martial troubles which arise are normally due to an unwillingness of one partner to compromise and be patient with the other. The golden rule to avoid a minor misunderstanding from being blown out of proportion si to be patient, tolerant, and be understanding. Human beings are emotional and get into angry arguments easily. Husbands and wives should do their utmost that both are not angry at the same time. This is the golden rule for a happy marriage life. If not parties are not angry at the same time, problems can be easily resolved by adopting the noble spirit of patience, tolerance and understanding.<br><br>The husband should treat his wife with respect, understanding and consideration and not as a servant nor as a doll in his hands. Although he may be the bread winner of the family, it is also his duty to help his wife with the household work whenever he is free. The wife, on the other hand, should not always nag or grumble at her husband over trival matters. If he really has certain shortcomings, she should try to talk with him and point out his mistakes. A spouse should try to be tolerate and handle problems without bothering the partner, including those related to his or her career.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Being diplomatic</span><br><br>There is a story of a hot tempered woman who would always scold her husband for minor mistakes by saying, " You are a stupid idiot." The husband was very tolerant and kept quiet when he was scolded. However, one day, when the wife shouted " You are a stupid idiot.", the husband said: " i think you are right. If i am not a stupid idiot, do you think i would ever married a woman like you?" From that day onwards she never utter such words.<br><br></div>
