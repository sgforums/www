            <div class='col-md body'>I have followed the posts in this thread. Through reading, I have come to learn more about marriages in real life and how complicated they can be, especially when it comes to human emotions.<br><br>First of all, I'm around TS's age and is single. So I'm in no position to give any advice and what's more, many angles of looking at TS's problem have already been given. It is really up to TS to decide.<br><br>TS, after reading all that in your thread, I really feel the pain and frustration you feel, though I can't say I can understand all exactly.<br><br>My personality is in some ways similar to yours, frustratedguy, in that it would cause me to react in almost the same way as you if I were in your situation. But the main difference is, you are more patient than I am, much more. I really cannot tahan micromanaging, but my mom bo bian, cos who ask her to be my mom. haha.<br><br>I can also empathise your wife in a way for I agree with some posts here suggesting that she may have a low self-esteem and she is quite insecure with people and things around her. Most of all, she is feeling insecure deep inside. But though we never really got to know whether your wife has some past experiences which moulded her into becoming the way she is at the point of ROM and when leading a married life now.<br><br>As a guy, I feel that you are quite the man liao. I simply cannot tahan that long cos I am introverted and dislike being in conflict with loved ones for too long. I also dislike having to explain everything in detail when there are far too many things which I don't even know how to solve myself. I'm already frustrated and yet my wife still wants to ask me to give a solution, only to rebut any solution I can give at that short notice. Even if time is given, with my intellect and limited life experience, I don't see how I can be expected to give satisfactory answers on anything my wife expects me to answer.<br><br>That said, the only practical solution so far, in my opinion, is still to consider seeing a marital counsellor together.  An objective and neutral third party, a professional in your area of concern, would help to air out and possibly resolve deep-seated misunderstandings due to a wide range of interlinked causes.<br><br>Take care, frustratedguy.<br><br>P.S: Reading posts from TS and those commented from a position of a married person, it makes me think more deeply about marriage. Perhaps marriage is really not for a weak guy like me.<br></div>

But I don't think women need to appear weak or worse, pretend to be weak in front of certain groups of people and flip back to being strong in front of other groups.<br><br>If you are submissive, you are. If you are vulnerable, you are. If you have either one or a combination of many others, still it doesn't really say that you are weak for that matter or weak throughout your entire life.<br><br>The example traits of weak listed by shrodingerscat can indeed be considered 'weak' if they are taken to the extremes in real life, in interacting with others especially.<br><br>What some consider to be an heartfelt expression of love and concern can be considered submissive or vulnerable by others, even if it's the same sex looking at one another from afar or near.<br><br>That's to say, it merely goes down to personal expectations, beliefs and values.  Nothing good or bad about that, really.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My apologies for the 'disapperance.' It's hard to input anything at home when wife, within seconds of hearing me type, will come and check on me. We are in the same room.<br><br>I try to answer everyone if I can. Some of you are right. No point complaining when all I do is whine. I will probably source out any lawyer's office I can when I am free and wife is not with me.<br><br>On a lighter note, everything seems to be fine when she is mentally sane and not throwing her temper around. Mum did not mention about moving in(maybe 'cause she just casually mention?), and wife took a pretty long time to calm down her emotions. I had to bear with her for a week!<br><br>For those who think I can talk to mum alone without wife knowing, it's impossible. After everytime I talked to my folks, my wife will ask me in detail. Interrogation style. Last week, she did it to me, and how can I possibly remember everything I chit-chatted with my parents? I blew up my top and asked her, "Next time I talk to them, do you want me to bring a voice-recorder along?" Then she realised I'm going to lose it, and stop.<br><br>Both my wife and I are bad-tempered. Good thing about her is she doesn't bear grudges, but unfortunately, I do. I can't tell the difference sometimes when she threaten divorce is, am I bearing grudges or am I being driven to a corner?<br><br>Like some of you mention, she also said I will regret when I divorce because it will be painful and there will be a mental scar. But what scar will I have if I regain back my life to a time of peace and freedom?<br><br>Our house is in renovation works. I believe it's something good to look forward to. If things go things go the way they should, it would be good. But if she blew her top and mention divorce, it should be over. I reckon it should be next year when I succumb to her threat. Hey, I'm not rushing it. Gotta give it the best before I end it all, right?<br><br>P.S. Just for the record, she threaten again last Saturday, 13/10/2007. Cheers!</div>
