I will like to bring you to a mother perspective, since young, your mother had loved you dearly, bring you up, gaive you education, provided all the needs and cares for you as far as they could afford. No mother in this world would like to see her son leaving her, she will alway cherish and wish her son to be happily married, be a man of honor, be a man who can guides his own family toward prosperity, healthy and peace.<br><br>Next, as young, we must learn to understand the old pple mindset, money, lavish eating or good living is not the most important criteria in being filial piety, the togetherness, the love sharing, the bonding is the ultimate needs of old pple, we shall all be old one days, we shall have childrens of our own, the day will come when he decided to leave you, what then do you think?, you have to let him go, because you love him, but deep inside the old poor soul, the cry of unheard sound alway wanted her son and daughter in law to be with her, be together, be happy so as to enjoy her twilight years to what she dream of when she borne you.<br><br>In our Asiatic value or oriental concept of family, most of the chinese embraced confucianism, an idealogy that once a person is upright, he then can take care of his parents, and with his parents blessing, he gets married and built a perfect family, serve the state and in turn the country. If all these is met, the society shall prosperous in peace and harmony. Anything along the way that cut off this system shall result in saddness and hurt thus affecting anything down the system. We must uphold our family Unity, it is our values that the west have found it hard to follow and are trying to learn from it. Respect of yr elder and ancestor is a respect of yourself, your own culture, your own upbringing and your discipline in life.<br><br>Mom had brought you into this world, please take care of her. Nagging and pestering as she can be, her heart is as pure as the blue sky in loving you and your wife. SHe who love her son so much, that she is willing to let him go and cry by herself in the lonely dark corner of a empty house.</div>

Unhappy, is a natural thing but your wife is taking it too far. Which couple don't quarrel and who is happy to quarrel. Did she really want to marry you in the first place? She want divorce. Then give it to her. I reminded my husband that I had agreed to his demand for divorce once. asked to move out 2 times. All of that he subsequently ask me to re-consider. However the day I move out. I never intend to move back. It will also be followed by a divorce request.<br><br>Easy solution to your issues:<br>You want to go overseas during CYN. She wanna stay. Then you go overseas. and she stay. Solved. She cannot care for your request, why should you care for hers?<br><br>She want to visit many family and entertain them. You visit the one you should visit. Problem solved.  She want to catch up with her relatives, she can go anytime or call them any day. The one relative you should visit is your in-laws. The rest is just good will.  Your relatives are also important to you but you never force her to visit everyone of them did you? Then during wedding, all the ang paos/gold she took from your relatives, she better cough them out.<br><br>As i said before in your previous airing of the same issue:  how long are you going to give in to her tantrums, pamper her too much before you totally give up and become bitter. How long more do you want to give way to her wishes? You think this is building a r/s? Why can't she give way some times?<br><br>Learn from my lesson. I gave way too much! Everyday I think of moving out, divorce, unhappy, suffer hypertension, and all sorts. Everyday I live in regret.<br><br>I understand your wish not to stay with your mom. Seriously, its better for you guys and its not a sign that you do not love your mom. You do what you need to keep your r/s.  2 women under one roof with conflicting characters is going to make you crazy. My MIL is aggressive, nosy, careless, shallow, brainless and bossy lao ah lian. She will take every opportunity to bully me and she always want to win at all cost. I am introverted and quite and usually try to have peace by giving way. I end up unhappy all the time. Its really extreme if you see the situation i ended up. I have no say about my house, I cannot place my  2 pots of plants anywhere, I cannot use the washing machine on any days I want, I cannot try any feng shui thing I want. Anything, eveything, in my house, even my money, I have no say and my MIL demand to make decision how to even spend my money for me or she will make a big hu-ha.  My husband believe in telling everything to my MIL thinking she is fair and a goddess or goodness in his eyes (this is the real mommy boy) and she takes it out on me later when everyone's not around. She's a real great actress - when my husband is around -wah she is like a saint, when my husband is out her words are sharper than swords and her acts are all out to hurt. My MIL even calls up my Mom and complain all sorts of lies about me till my mom was very upset. I cannot forgive her for the kind of things she's done causing hurt to my mom, for driving my r/s to the rocks and still claiming she's not trying to do anything. Seriously, if you ask me my one wish is that my MIL never existed at all. That will be peace for me, my husband and my FIL.<br><br></div>

I probably just write "Because she wants it so badly."<br><br>Yeah, I also like humour. But I find it difficult to share with my wife. Sometimes, she would scold me "Can't you take anything seriously?" I told her not to look at things so hard. Don't think so much.<br><br>We can only control 10% of things around us, 90% of things happened cannot be controlled. Learn to let go and be happy. Like now, I 10% keep quiet. She is my 90%, want divorce, want divorce. I increase to 11%, say yes. Then game over liao loh.</div>
