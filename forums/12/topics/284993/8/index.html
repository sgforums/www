I reassure her countless times, but it does not seem to work. Only when we get into big fights, then will she calm down. I hate to always argue then can make her listen. My wife and mum are both scared of me losing temper too. I'm just like those silent dog, I guess. Quiet quiet but have the worst bite. So wife now beginning to know when I'm going to lose it. I notice a change in her when I argue with her. Sometimes, she will keep quiet a bit one.<br><br>She always tot gals will lose their marriage when guys go fooling around. I told her to wake up loh.

Through reading, I have come to learn more about marriages in real life and how complicated they can be, especially when it comes to human emotions.<br><br>First of all, I'm around TS's age and is single. So I'm in no position to give any advice and what's more, many angles of looking at TS's problem have already been given. It is really up to TS to decide.<br><br>TS, after reading all that in your thread, I really feel the pain and frustration you feel, though I can't say I can understand all exactly.<br><br>My personality is in some ways similar to yours, frustratedguy, in that it would cause me to react in almost the same way as you if I were in your situation. But the main difference is, you are more patient than I am, much more. I really cannot tahan micromanaging, but my mom bo bian, cos who ask her to be my mom. haha.<br><br>I can also empathise your wife in a way for I agree with some posts here suggesting that she may have a low self-esteem and she is quite insecure with people and things around her. Most of all, she is feeling insecure deep inside. But though we never really got to know whether your wife has some past experiences which moulded her into becoming the way she is at the point of ROM and when leading a married life now.<br><br>As a guy, I feel that you are quite the man liao. I simply cannot tahan that long cos I am introverted and dislike being in conflict with loved ones for too long. I also dislike having to explain everything in detail when there are far too many things which I don't even know how to solve myself. I'm already frustrated and yet my wife still wants to ask me to give a solution, only to rebut any solution I can give at that short notice. Even if time is given, with my intellect and limited life experience, I don't see how I can be expected to give satisfactory answers on anything my wife expects me to answer.<br><br>That said, the only practical solution so far, in my opinion, is still to consider seeing a marital counsellor together.  An objective and neutral third party, a professional in your area of concern, would help to air out and possibly resolve deep-seated misunderstandings due to a wide range of interlinked causes.<br><br>Take care, frustratedguy.<br><br>P.S: Reading posts from TS and those commented from a position of a married person, it makes me think more deeply about marriage. Perhaps marriage is really not for a weak guy like me.<br></div></blockquote>Erm, thanks? I do have much more patience than other people, I guess.<br><br>Yeah, conflicts and confrontations are really unnecessary. Live free like a bird. Why go and control everything so tightly? 90% of the problems we can't control and eventually, everything will work out fine.<br><br>No need to see counsellor lah. She has made it so that if our marriage were to end, it would just end loh. She won't agree to counselling one. Pre-marital counselling's advice she can turn a deaf ear, what chance do I have of a post-marital counselling? HAHA!</div>

Its distressing for him. Actually he was the one who made the choice to live together. I told him its not good. He insisted and I give way because I know it means much to him to stay with his parents and near his siblings and his nieces and nephews.

I reassure her countless times, but it does not seem to work. Only when we get into big fights, then will she calm down. I hate to always argue then can make her listen. My wife and mum are both scared of me losing temper too. I'm just like those silent dog, I guess. Quiet quiet but have the worst bite. So wife now beginning to know when I'm going to lose it. I notice a change in her when I argue with her. Sometimes, she will keep quiet a bit one.<br><br>She always tot gals will lose their marriage when guys go fooling around. I told her to wake up loh.

I think staying together will not help. Maybe for a while when cards are laid, threats are made and each party promises to be OK. Then soon, the whole cycle repeats itself.<br><br>DIL and MIL lifestyles are never in sync one. Maybe got, but very rare. They only have 1 thing in common, the son. Which means, both will be fighting for him for a long time. And since, son and mother have been living in that flat for so long, DIL will have to bear with it when she moves in. If son refuses to move out, I cannot see how this can resolve the delicate rift that exists between DIL and MIL. Good luck to your HB. He want to live like that, he have to bear the stress.</div>
