            <div class='col-md body'>to turn a deaf ear to your wife is not a good idea as she would only get louder and louder until she gets your undivided attention by then you are already in a fighting mode.Maybe its already too late to try this but if you are not happy with her actions or things that she says you need to deal with it there and then.Do not try to ignore and think that your ears are not listening....or yes they do listen to every single word,this is to prevent you from holding up and exploding like a Volcano later.I dont know if I mentioned this before but here is one good way of voicing your grievances with her....get her to write down all the things that she is not happy about you and you do the same.Later just go through them together one at a time in a mature civil manner,the things you both agree just tick them and the things you dont you discuss.Sometimes we learn more by finding out the things we dont want to know. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi TS,<br><br>I didnÂ’t read every post here, only read ur starting post. Have u found any solution yet? If not then here is my bit of advises.<br><br>In the first place I want to talk about your relationship. U are letting the 2 woman become your boss controlling u. Just imagine yourself serving under 2 diff boss that donÂ’t agree on each other. One said this and the other said that, donÂ’t u think is chaos? U will go crazy one day.<br><br>How about this? Turn the relationship over where u become their boss and let the 2 woman be your worker that work under u. DonÂ’t u think is more easy to manage? U want 2 worker or 2 boss u decide yourself. Well, how to make them listen to u willingly is an art. If u donÂ’t have the wisdom to do it then it will be real bad. Go and figure out a way. Maybe u can try the carrot and stick method?<br><br>The other one that I wanna chat about is your situation now. U got a new flat right? u can move into it with ur new wife first. Tell your mom to give u some time to settle down a bit. After that ask her not to sell her flat but come over to stay over the weekend and see how well it goes.<br><br>Good luck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi TS,<br><br>I have been following your threads, but have said nothing so far because others have pretty much covered everything that needs to be said.<br><br>But here, I would like to suggest a more creative approach of solving your problems.<br><br>I don't think the issue is fundamentally about your mom moving in, or others.<br><br>Fundamentally, I think it is your wife that is suffering from low self-esteem, and hence she needs to micro-manage you. That results in you suffering in bad relationships with say, your parents, and in turn, you feel resentful about it. Your wife feels that she needs to "own" more of you than anyone else, including your parents, friends.. etc.<br><br>Divorce is a quick but painful way to end the marriage.<br><br>An alternative might be to examine why your wife feels so insecure in life in the first place. Although that wouldn't solve your immediate problems, it might very well treat the root of the problem, instead of the symptoms.<br><br>Hope that helps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mistyblue:</div><div class="quote_body">You still weak. didn't learn lesson the last time. Please stand up for yourself. Unhappy, is a natural thing but your wife is taking it too far. Which couple don't quarrel and who is happy to quarrel. Did she really want to marry you in the first place? She want divorce. Then give it to her. I reminded my husband that I had agreed to his demand for divorce once. asked to move out 2 times. All of that he subsequently ask me to re-consider. However the day I move out. I never intend to move back. It will also be followed by a divorce request.<br><br>Easy solution to your issues:<br>You want to go overseas during CYN. She wanna stay. Then you go overseas. and she stay. Solved. She cannot care for your request, why should you care for hers?<br><br>She want to visit many family and entertain them. You visit the one you should visit. Problem solved.  She want to catch up with her relatives, she can go anytime or call them any day. The one relative you should visit is your in-laws. The rest is just good will.  Your relatives are also important to you but you never force her to visit everyone of them did you? Then during wedding, all the ang paos/gold she took from your relatives, she better cough them out.<br><br>As i said before in your previous airing of the same issue:  how long are you going to give in to her tantrums, pamper her too much before you totally give up and become bitter. How long more do you want to give way to her wishes? You think this is building a r/s? Why can't she give way some times?<br><br>Learn from my lesson. I gave way too much! Everyday I think of moving out, divorce, unhappy, suffer hypertension, and all sorts. Everyday I live in regret.<br><br>I understand your wish not to stay with your mom. Seriously, its better for you guys and its not a sign that you do not love your mom. You do what you need to keep your r/s.  2 women under one roof with conflicting characters is going to make you crazy. My MIL is aggressive, nosy, careless, shallow, brainless and bossy lao ah lian. She will take every opportunity to bully me and she always want to win at all cost. I am introverted and quite and usually try to have peace by giving way. I end up unhappy all the time. Its really extreme if you see the situation i ended up. I have no say about my house, I cannot place my  2 pots of plants anywhere, I cannot use the washing machine on any days I want, I cannot try any feng shui thing I want. Anything, eveything, in my house, even my money, I have no say and my MIL demand to make decision how to even spend my money for me or she will make a big hu-ha.  My husband believe in telling everything to my MIL thinking she is fair and a goddess or goodness in his eyes (this is the real mommy boy) and she takes it out on me later when everyone's not around. She's a real great actress - when my husband is around -wah she is like a saint, when my husband is out her words are sharper than swords and her acts are all out to hurt. My MIL even calls up my Mom and complain all sorts of lies about me till my mom was very upset. I cannot forgive her for the kind of things she's done causing hurt to my mom, for driving my r/s to the rocks and still claiming she's not trying to do anything. Seriously, if you ask me my one wish is that my MIL never existed at all. That will be peace for me, my husband and my FIL.<br><br></div></blockquote>mistyblue,<br><br>I'm glad you are standing up for yourself, and yes, it's high time indeed.<br><br>Your MIL is little different from my own MIL, who resorted to dirty tricks to wringing money from all of her children except the darling youngest.<br><br>I hope you prevail in the end.<br><br>Good luck!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Frustrated_guy:</div><div class="quote_body">I tot I do not have to post here again, but just let me whine a bit. Since Monday, my wife has threatened divorce once and presented the idea of divorce twice liao.<br><br>Here's the story. We are getting our own house. Woohoo! Then my Mum came into the picture. Boo! Initially, she had agreed to let both of us stay apart from them. But as the date draws near for us to move into our new house, Mum started nagging to sell her house and stay with us.<br><br>My stand is this from day 1; I do not want to stay with my folks. I have told my Mum in the face that I want to live separately from them. Not that unfilial or something, I love my parents, but I have personal reasons. My wife knows I'm with her, but she's overcomed by stress and fear that my mum may actually gets what she wants. I reassured her MANY MANY times that I won't let it happen. But don't know what she thinking, she began to pick a fight with me, accusing me of being Mummy's boy and say my mum betrayed her trust...bla bla bla(the rest is noise).<br><br>I HATE to be caught in the middle and it actually happens now. I love my wife, but perhaps not enough patience to counsel her. Hey, only God has infinite patience, I am only human. So the thing is this, over the years until now, she has successfully sold the idea of divorce into me. I do not want to fight it anymore. I already said yes once, but somehow we manage to make up. I even dreamt that I said yes in a dream and we spilt.<br><br>So now, it's only a matter of time. I am gonna say yes and make it real in one of our future quarrels. I can put up with her micro-managing my life and other stuff, but I do not like threats. I know in some way, I may have asked for it and partly my fault too. My mind is struggling to make sense of it all and salvage the whole thing, but I feel hopeless. Also, the temptation of absolute freedom is irresistible. In the end, I would probably grant her wish, and have the whole house to myself. No, I won't invite my folks to live with me. Feels like a cool thing afterall hoh?<br><br>Thank you for listening. </div></blockquote>I've posted a reply or two in your first virgin post concerning your forever 'threatening with divorce wife'. And...I like to say it again. When another party in a marriage kept using that taboo word to emotionally manipulate, blackmail the other party into giving ways and into submission is almost a 100% a case goner. I did say that for how long will you be able to tolerate that kind of mental abuse. No matter how much one love the other, there is always a limit to things in life. I don't want to say 'See, I told you so. He has finally reach his limit.' But well, in the end I have to say it because my theory was proven right. YOU CERTAINLY HAS FINALLY REACH YOUR LIMIT of tolerance level.<br><br>Moreover both of you are in your 30s. It's too immature and irresponsible for her to keep using that taboo word on you to make you succumb to her. Vile, totally vile and wicked.<br><br>Frankly, I don't think your mum's demand of wanting to stay with you both is really the issue here. That is just a speck of nuisance adding on to your real major problem here.<br><br>Aye, a separation is good and do it! Show your wife you no longer would let her keep using that taboo word to get her ways with you. You have to do it once just to let the message get across to her that you have reach your tolerance level. Let her panic and sweat about it. She will then realize the threat doesn't work anymore. She will have to mend her ways if she wants to get back with you. Oh, I'm pretty sure she loves you too but using threat to control another person into submission is not right.<br><br>Other forumners may not agree with my supporting you to separate but to me it is the best for both of you. DO IT!</div>

This misalignment and her attitude to take full control of the house and the people's lives living in it is where the most conflict is arising from. This is where my resentment arise as well because I had bend over backwards to give way in terms of the house, grandchildren, the Parent and Sibling in-laws, and even given up my rights to the whole house except my room.

That is where I draw the line but anyways I feel everytime I give her money, I am giving her a slap on her face for the lies she made up. She had brought up her kids with no mental knowledge of financial planning nor savings. Hence her oldest son is always running out of money but having lots of branded goods. They also sell branded goods and make a tidy sum which instead gets invested in their personal entertainment as the cost of feeding their kids are conveniently made my MIL problem where she knows she will never get a cent off her oldest son and wife, hence she knows the path of least resistance is me since my husband always supports her and do not offer any protection from her demands.<br>Anything I can give in.

If I ever ever decide to have kids, at least I know financial planning will be the one thing I will teach and I will not be shameless as my Brother-in-law as to make use of other people to keep my children fed.<br><br>Under such situation, I think I should be allowed to get really angry and demand better treatment.

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, i will leave the relationship when my other half tried to threaten me by emotion blackmailing. My heart is tender so don't keep me arrested. If my heart can't bear with the separation, i will give max 5 chances and there will be about it. A line to be drawn. Marriage isn't a prison to begin with. What is the direction of your love and marriage? It should be the same.<br><br>I feel that your wife is immature and has low self-esteem. Therefore, u have to be patient and be understanding with her, for the simple reason cos you love her. Love and forgiveness is powerful enough to heal almost all the broken pieces in a relationship. It depends on whether do both parties want to. Think back all the good times that both of you have, there put a smile on your face and wish her be happy.<br><br>Give yourself some space to breathe from all this little bugs. Be good to yourself. I feel you are probably emotionally tired and probably so is ur wife, there why she probably threaten to divorce. Don't Fu yan your wife by those OMMM or ORRR, quite disrespectful even to an outsider, not to Mention what your wife, a closed one will feel. She probably feel you should be there for her to listen to. The problems with men is that they don't listen well.<br><br><strong>Since you have tried marriage counseling. Try it again. </strong><br><br>Try inject the love back to the marriage, pamper or "hong" her and avoid arguing with one another for the time being.<br><br>I could say always try your best to save a marriage before the last attempt, divorcing. At least you will not regret walking away.<br><br></div>

Take out time and discuss with her calmly, and explain to her that you don't like those threats, and make her promise to you personally that she will not do so again. If she doesn't, ask her why does she make those threats to you? Listen to her reasons carefully and decide if she is over-demanding, explain to her why it is not possible, and suggest alternatives.
