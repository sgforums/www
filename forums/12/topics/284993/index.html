            <div class='col-md body'>I tot I do not have to post here again, but just let me whine a bit. Since Monday, my wife has threatened divorce once and presented the idea of divorce twice liao.<br><br>Here's the story. We are getting our own house. Woohoo! Then my Mum came into the picture. Boo! Initially, she had agreed to let both of us stay apart from them. But as the date draws near for us to move into our new house, Mum started nagging to sell her house and stay with us.<br><br>My stand is this from day 1; I do not want to stay with my folks. I have told my Mum in the face that I want to live separately from them. Not that unfilial or something, I love my parents, but I have personal reasons. My wife knows I'm with her, but she's overcomed by stress and fear that my mum may actually gets what she wants. I reassured her MANY MANY times that I won't let it happen. But don't know what she thinking, she began to pick a fight with me, accusing me of being Mummy's boy and say my mum betrayed her trust...bla bla bla(the rest is noise).<br><br>I HATE to be caught in the middle and it actually happens now. I love my wife, but perhaps not enough patience to counsel her. Hey, only God has infinite patience, I am only human. So the thing is this, over the years until now, she has successfully sold the idea of divorce into me. I do not want to fight it anymore. I already said yes once, but somehow we manage to make up. I even dreamt that I said yes in a dream and we spilt.<br><br>So now, it's only a matter of time. I am gonna say yes and make it real in one of our future quarrels. I can put up with her micro-managing my life and other stuff, but I do not like threats. I know in some way, I may have asked for it and partly my fault too. My mind is struggling to make sense of it all and salvage the whole thing, but I feel hopeless. Also, the temptation of absolute freedom is irresistible. In the end, I would probably grant her wish, and have the whole house to myself. No, I won't invite my folks to live with me. Feels like a cool thing afterall hoh?<br><br>Thank you for listening.</div>

No lah, I won't want to kill her that kind. I can't even bear to be violent to her. Dating stage, she did not threaten. But just before ROM, it started. Until now.<br><br>No kids lah. She always say the reason why we have no kids is because we are not meant to be together, so maybe should split.<br><br>I give up arguing liao. Yeah, maybe she right. Still got time lah. Wait till she threatens a few more times loh.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm with TS, whether it is empty threats or threats shows the girl has no consideration for you. She think its fun, she get a kick out of it when she see you giving in to her threats. The threats will never end. She thinks she is superior than you while telling you she is feeling very stress about your mom coming.<br><br>As much as you do not like/want your mother to come in, she is forcing you(although you're willing) to chase your mother away. Now the topic is your mother, and you happen to agree with her, next time when she want something, and you don't agree how? And what if by then, you both have kids, it will be more complicated by then. She is someone who can share your happiness, and leave you in the lurch when things turn for the worse. You will continue to be her slave if you continue not to do anything.<br><br>Tell her what you feel and solve the problems together, also talk about the underlying problems such as her attitude, or just divorce when she mentions it again.<br><br>Anyhow trigger happy say divorce shows she has no respect/commitment to you and the relationship. It also shows she will never sacrifice herself for you although you as a man should not let her be, but somethings it's beyond your control.</div>
