Nothing more, otherwise your fishes will suffer.<br><br>2) Filter too weak/small to hold Bio cycle of your tank.<br>You'll need a bigger filter area for your tank.<br>No matter what, you'll still have to change your tank water all the time because the tank is small. (point 1)<br>Aquarium shops have huge filter areas. You see tubs and tubs of water and huge filter sponge hidden underneath the shelf or elsewhere in the shop.<br><br>Solution.<br>Remove your tiny fishes or Change to a 3-4ft tank.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>cfm , goldfish r extremely greedy and hungry fish. i tink for 2 ft tank, u can only keep 4 fishes at most.<br><br>it is more difficult to assess them but other fish, feed only when u cannot see their stomach. for large ones, once a week may b enuff.<br><br>the fish food u give also matters. some of the kios/ goldfish food contain a high level of coloring agent. they can cloud ur water quickly.<br><br>i wun say change ur filter. too high filtration will also make fish stressful. they hv to b sized properly. getting rid of the unwanted fish is a easier choice, esp for those who r noob to fish rearing.<br><br></div>

So as to removed out all the fishes acidic fluid(fish bowel which they call it). it make the water acidic and fish will have git at the grill or white spot.<br>3. brought a small bottle of"super clear" soln from the fish shop and top out 1/2 cap of it to the tank. it will clear up the milky water after 1/2 hrs.(advice do not use it regularly,due to gold fish may not take in too much).</div>

It's best to keep goldfish together with goldfish and nothing else..if you can, separate the 2 types of fishes...<br><br>six, if you want to rear tiny fishes, i suggest you get some plants to go with them minus the goldfish....if not your tank will appear too empty<br><br>lastly, i hope you have a wonderful time rearing those fishes to a healthy growth provided you do some homework and asking around for help on maintaining your fish tank, if your lazy, then just hire some experts to help you do the job, they do offer such services. you can call them if you want. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
