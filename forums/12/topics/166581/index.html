I admit in the course of building my career I got disheartened and even jumped ship for "greener pastures."<br><br>Problem is, my "dreams" are now blurred. I no longer want to be the MSCE I wanted so much in the past. It's as though my fight is over... I still play my football on sundays, I still go to gigs, I still like my life.. but come to career its just a big question mark...<br><br>These few weeks my performance in work had dipped alot..

            <div class='col-md body'>I had the same problem as you do... I seem to be mess up in my life... When other people are earning money or studying. I am in a drift... I had met some frens in working part time. There is even 1 uncle who is about 40+ still dun even got a perm job.<br>Dreams and jobs are different... When it come to work, it will not be as good as it seems. Some people dun really noe wat to work but when get into a job can stay for few yrs. It will depends. Some people are clear of wat they wan and work towards it. Even if it fail at least they tried. You will have to see whether you want just a job with high pay ? or something you like to do? Try to find out ur character and area of interest. See if possible to work from there. I am still finding my way out. So can't really help you.</div>

Jack Welch the former boss of General Electric was so successful so rich but look into his private life and its a huge mess. So is he a perfect problem handler? He has big problems.<br><br>I dunno what your problem but you shouldn't allow it to influence your life, your life is more than just having a good career or doing the right thing, but there is no right or wrong, you have to either choose to continue to follow the crowd in the big rat race and maybe become somebody, or you can choose to tell yourself "No rat race" and become a nobody, but either way living on this planet you will still have problems.<br><br>you can choose to go and study, there is no right or wrong move since you are still very young, but you study and work later you will still have life preassures and problems or you don't study and do what you like  and you will also still have problems.  You can sit still and yet have problems, just don't allow problems to get to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
