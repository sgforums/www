            <div class='col-md body'>from a girl's point of view, i think she has already considered letting u go.<br><br>starting as friends again is juz an excuse not to put it across to harshly.<br><br>or maybe, she juz wants to have that feeling of you chasing after her again.<br><br>sometimes when a couple has been together for quite awhile, its no longer love. more like a habit of being together. u feel that way?<br><br>a quarrel or misunderstanding would be the last thing u would wan to happen at this point of time. coz that will be the bullet to end it off. the reason for her to leave u. it could juz be a simple misunderstanding which both of u can resolve, but probably too tired or lazy to resolve it. then thats the end of the story already.<br><br>i may be wrong about it, coz i dun quite know both of u. thats juz based on my own experience. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>do try to find out wat she actually wans. is she happy during the relationship with u? u might feel that u have put in alot of effort, but it might not be wat she actually wants.<br><br>best wishes.</div>

No law, no justice, no accountability. Fairness is moot because how much one gives or takes in a relationship is often questionable and seldom quantifiable.<br><br>Rational thought is not a pre-requisite for relationships. You don't need to be of rational thought to fall in love (though it is believed, on the contrary, that you have to abandon a bit of reason to accept something as irrational as love).<br><br>A long-term relationship is definitely bound to have highs and lows, but when a party calls a time-out on love and puts friendship on the table instead, the relationship is -- more often that not -- as good as dead.<br><br>My 2 cents 2...</div>
