              <p>Hi forumers! I'm a new user but I've been browsing these forums for at least a year, and I felt that with such a great Singapore presence, my issue is best addressed here.</p>
              <p>Anyway, here is what I'm facing right now.<br>I have this friend, a girl, who I've been friends with for 4 years now.<br>I admit that at some point, I have had strong feelings for her, but I'm pretty sure we're just friends now, good friends actually. And I like it this way.<br>The thing is, in the past 2 years I've known her, she's been getting a lot more attention in school than previously.<br>She became more girl-ly I guess, and also, sad to say, quite different.<br>Like, she has her skirt pretty short in school, I mean there are shorter and it's pretty common, so actually it's almost a norm. But occasionally, she wears coloured-bras to school, which attracts a lot of my classmates' attentions. I mean, I'm friends with her longer than I've been with the guys, so I don't actually partake in their conversations of like how hot they think she is. I naturally try to divert the conversation away from such topics relating to her. I mean, I feel quite offended as some of them call her a slut and all, but I don't feel that way. I personally just think perhaps she ran out of white bras to wear that day.<br>Just from a good guy friend's point of view, how do you all think I can help her get out of this habit of attracting 'the wrong attention'. It's been going on for about 2 years now, and I just really want to help her because I really don't want her to end up in a mess, with a boyfriend that doesn't treat her for who she really is.<br>Thank you!</p>

              <p>So take this chance to compliment or criticise and accept her explanations to attain a quasi fashion advisor status.  So brush up your own fashion sense instead of complaining about unwanted attention when what she wants (non admittedly) is that attention.</p>

It might not surprise me if you actually have developed feelings for her. I know you say that you are comfortable being her close friend, but I see a different picture here. Anyway, that's a different story altogether. If you want her to not be so conspicuous,you just need to talk to her. It think it will be awkward for you. She might start to have the impression that you actually fancy her. Perhaps your friend is just starting to realise people are noticing her and doesn't mind feeding off the compliments from others. I have a feeling you just might be slightly jealous of others trying to take notice of her. You might be a good bf to her you know because of your protective nature.</p></div>

              <p>Feelings towards her aside..</p>
              <p>Your friend may be going through some changes/stress back home.</p>
              <p>Perhaps her parents are going through some marital/financial problems, hence are neglecting her back home.</p>
              <p>Typically, parents will be very watchful of their teenagers especially during their rebellious years.</p>
              <p>Inappropriate dressing is a sign that her parents are neglecting her and she is free to do as she will ...</p>
              <p>Right now, she is desiring of attention, if she is unable to get positive attention by being the good girl, she will generate/accept negative attention being a bad girl.</p>
              <p>As a friend, you can help with positive influence. Instead of reprimanding her (which will  make her feel all the more unwanted and uncared for).</p>
              <p>I think it's ok to let her know that some people are labeling her a slut, and see how she react to this kind of negative reputation.</p>
