Andrew Loyd webber immediately flew down to India to do a project wif him after hearing his music. if u look aound sgforums, there are many topic on this musician before.As Andew Loyd said. he is a genious. I am Andrew Loyd webber fan myself, but even he could not have done this quality of music.<br><br>Perferct for this forum</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>here i am pasting an article  by Andrew<br>Lloyd Webber .<br><br>its quite interesting<br><br>I have been fascinated by what Westerners call, to<br>most Indian film-makers' indignation, Bollywood, for<br>several years. It all began thus. About a decade ago<br>on Saturday mornings, Channel 4 showed a selection of<br>popular Hindi movies in a series which was called<br>Movie Mahal. On one such Saturday one of these films<br>was playing on my kitchen TV. I was cooking lunch when<br>a song lured me away from the stoves.<br><br>Three lines of gorgeous girls were dancing for a few<br>seated blokes with turbans whilst one girl moved<br>demurely and sang in an abnormally high chest voice.<br>Very good this song was too. Unfortunately I forgot to<br>write down the name of the movie. To this day I<br>haven't traced it. Increasingly I became interested in<br>contemporary popular Indian music and the direction it<br>was taking. Talvin Singh, in particular, struck me as<br>introducing complex rhythms to a Western audience in a<br>way that was accessible and totally couched in the<br>sounds of today.<br><br>A couple of years later I was introduced at lunch to<br>the film director Shekhar Kapur Shekhar is best known<br>for his Indian movie Bandit Queen and the drama<br>Elizabeth starring Cate Blanchett as Good Queen Bess<br>I. Partly out of small talk, partly out of genuine<br>curiosity I asked him about Bollywood. He told me that<br>dozens of movie musicals were made in India in any one<br>year.<br><br>I was fascinated. How could I not be when he told me<br>that on any one night in Britain more Asians will see<br>a musical on the screen than will a London audience<br>see one on the stage. So I mentioned the unknown song.<br>Shekhar volunteered to find it. He sent me a couple of<br>videos that he compiled of dozens of Bollywood's<br>greatest hits. I took the videos on holiday and<br>chucked them on in the background whilst the kids were<br>playing in the garden.<br><br>I never found that song but I discovered something<br>else. One in every five songs evinced a melody of pure<br>gorgeousness or a rhythm so complex or a level of<br>musical invention on a single "drone" note that had me<br>realise that I could be listening to something that I<br>had always hoped would happen, the revitalisation of<br>popular melody from somewhere far removed from Western<br>Europe and America<br><br>Twenty years ago I predicted that this would come<br>about through the inevitable collapse of the Soviet<br>Union. I argued that the land that had produced<br>Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Prokofiev, Shostakovich et<br>al would produce modern versions of these great<br>melodists again the moment the tin lid was removed<br>from their society. I argued that once young people<br>from Eastern Europe could freely produce their own<br>music the West would get the musical shot in the arm<br>that it so badly needed as its pop atrophied in a lard<br>of "grooves", high tech production and manufactured<br>boy and girl bands. I was wrong. What emerged as a<br>consequence of the Soviet Union's collapse succeeded<br>in lowering the tone of the Eurovision Song Contents<br>still further.<br><br>After a couple of days, the music of one in every five<br>Bollywood songs was hitting not just me buy anyone who<br>heard the stuff. There had to be a common denominator.<br>This was their composer, A R Rahman. One look on the<br>net revealed that he was a phenomenon in Asia, where<br>he's known as the Asian Mozart. Rahman was born in<br>1966. His father was Hindi and a musician. Rahman<br>himself converted to Islam as a result of a family<br>tragedy. That is when he took his name. His scores<br>have been composed for some of India's most successful<br>films including Dil Se and Lagaan, which was nominated<br>for Best Foreign Film in the 2002 Oscars. With album<br>sales of over 100 million, his albums have sold more<br>than Britney Spears and Madonna combined. Soon my<br>house was full of them. His awards in his homeland<br>would cause the strongest mantelpiece to groan.<br><br>I called Shekhar Kapur and asked if he could arrange<br>that I meet him. Thus I found myself in Bombay and<br>mobbed in the midst of a vast press conference<br>organised by Shekhar to proclaim my interest in<br>Rahman's music. When I asked him if he would consider<br>writing a stage musical, he was intrigued, if more<br>than a little bemused. Once he had said yes he came to<br>London. The second day that he was in town I walked<br>with him the hundred yards from my office near the Ivy<br>to the Palace Theatre. I swear he signed ten<br>autographs en route. By the time we left the theatre<br>the busdh telegraph had seemingly caused most of the<br>Asian head waiters of Soho to be awaiting him outside<br>the stage door.<br><br>That was two years ago. Since then it has become my<br>obsession to bring this melodic genius to the West End<br>musical stage. I am proud to be introducing a composer<br>to the West End who has this quote on his web site "If<br>a music artiste wants to blossom into a fully-fledged<br>person, it's not enough if he only knows classical<br>music or if he's well versed only in ragas and<br>techniques. He should be interested in life and<br>philosophy. In his personal life there should be, at<br>least in some corner of his heart, a tinge of<br>lingering sorrow".<br><br>Andrew Lloyd Webber</div>
