            <div class='col-md body'>hey man... just to inform you some stuff about girls...<br><br>we don't go for emotionally weak guys... you see, most of us have this mindset that girls are always the ones leaning on guys, but because Singaporean girls are getting stronger emotionally nowadays, (and those strong ones are those who attract guys), then it is harder to keep up with guys who are more able to withstand obstacles.<br><br>It is definitely true that confidence is beauty... (or handsomeness in this case)<br><br>So what if your gf really was the worst kind of girl that dumps you after lying and cheating on you? You are not alone. And that kind of person does not deserve to have someone like you pinning after her. She is not worth it. And you know something... You can only truly hate someone if you still love them. Because they still mean something to you. You must learn that she does not have to stay on your mind all the time, because only when you are free of her that you can find other girls and move on. Right now you still think of how you have been betrayed by her and you are looking for comfort and reassurance...<br><br>It's not hard to listen to a guy with a broken heart and feel very comfortable. I have encountered a lot of people in chatrooms who sms or call me and we talk through the night. Most of them are lonely and/or have some problems in their lives. That's why chatlines are so popular. I believe that one day you will find a girl who gives you comfort when you are with her, yet not only that, she brings you joy instead of pain. Because when you love someone, she will not want you to suffer.<br><br>I am also like you. I always hope that any small thing I do can go a long way in 'saving the world'. I still believe I can. But i'm sure you know that if you want to live long enough to continue spreading peace and joy to the world, you have to be street smart. Not everything is as simple on the surface. But I also know that if you are already swaying towards going for the Thai lady, you would forever ask yourself 'what if'. I would advise that you do what your heart (after thinking it through) tells you, but remember along the way that you do not give away your money or put your life on the line.<br><br>Jia you ba! *piang i talk so long...*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For some reasons, this topic attracted my attention and i would like to share with you a similar experience that a friend of mine had.<br><br>Same reason as you, that he fell for a prostitude which resemble his ex. Almost everyday he went to look for her. Eventually, they became very close and the lucky thing is that the thai prostitude can actually communicate in mandrin.<br><br>This continues for quite awhile, he did confessed to the prostitude but she doesnt accept him. Till one day, he went to look for her and realised shes gone. He was devasted and heartbroken that she left without bidding goodbye.<br><br>Reality strucks him only after he found out he contracted AIDS from that prostitude and he suicided.<br><br>My point is that, think twice before you actually put in feelings for her. Because of her background, there are alot of obstacles the both of you have to face together if you both started. And even if you dont mind, you got to know if shes willing or not . All the best and good luck.</div>
