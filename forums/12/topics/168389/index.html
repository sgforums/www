            <div class='col-md body'>Killer,<br><br>Now you got me emotionally involved as well. IÂ’m not questioning how strong you feel for this girl. You realized there is risk involved in pursuing this relationship but have you really assessed how HIGH is the risk?<br><br>ListenÂ…IÂ’m a lousy story teller but you need to listen to this story.<br><br>At least, take it as I'm telling you to make myself feel better. Read it and please relate it to your case.<br><br>X broke up with his girlfriend 3 years ago. They almost got married. But a week before the ROM, this girl chickened out on him and ran away with another guy. This girl hurt him so bad that he vows never to be serious about women again. He started to frequent the houses in GL whenever he needed companionship.<br><br>He told his friends, Â“At least the girls there are more honest than a lot of girls out there. They just want your money but they are honest about it. You pay and get something in returnÂ…fair deal.Â”<br><br>Then he met a Thai girl in one of the houses. This working girl (WG) frenched him the way a working gal usually will not. So he got confused againÂ…Â”If IÂ’m just a customer to her, why would she kiss me like that.Â” He was curious, he went to the WGÂ’s house a few more times, they talked, they transacted. WG told him her story.<br><br>WGÂ’s father is a massive gambler. Right now, WG is trying to pay off the debts. WG told him her dream to go back to school again, how she always dreams of having a happy family of her own. WG showed him her family photo and said that she donÂ’t hate her father for what he has done. WG also said that she is returning to Thailand very soon. Her fatherÂ’s debts are almost fully cleared.<br><br>X started to spend a lot of time with the girl. Before he knew, he was in love again. He bought a necklace for her on her last nite. WG told him that he shouldnÂ’t spend that kind of money on her. But WG admitted that she has strong feelings as well.<br><br>X asked her what she wants as a parting gift. WG told him that all she wantsÂ…is a photo to remember him by.<br><br>At that moment of time, X melted. He decided to take the risk. He told his friends, Â“I will never find someone like her againÂ…if all of you are true friends, donÂ’t stop me from getting happiness.Â” His friends gave him their blessings and WG made plans to go to Thailand together. They intended to get married there and settle down.<br><br>1 year later, X came back to Singapore.<br><br>He was in a sorry state.<br><br>A big hole in his pocket.<br><br>Emotionally wrecked.<br><br>He simply told his friends, Â“I nearly got myself killed.Â”<br><br>I later found out that WG already has a husband in Thailand and the girl is following what the husband suggested to lure X into Thailand so that they work on their plan. I didnÂ’t ask X for the details. IÂ’m too ashamed to ask because I failed him as a friend, I should have done more to help him.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Killer, </strong><br>You see why IÂ’m telling you not to listen to what she says at face value? They are programmed to say the things you want to hear. ItÂ’s almost mechanical because they do it everyday to any men.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>A smart man learns from other peopleÂ’s experience and avoids making the same mistake.<br><br>A smart man takes calculated risks in life. But when the stakes are too high and the odds are against him. He bails himself out of the situation before he gets too emotionally involved.<br><br>BE THE SMART MAN, KILLER.</strong></span><br><br>There is an important reason why people called it a commercial sex industry.<br><br>Turn back before it is too late.<br><br>Think about it.</span><br></div>
