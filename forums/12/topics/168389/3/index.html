I am keen to know what really happen? So far, I haf not been cheated of any money as u can see, she (Thai Lady) is different from others. She did tell me that she is not after my money. There are no relationship between me and her. We are just good friends now.<br><br>I have just realise why I can't get out of this problem becos I do not haf confidence in myself. My ex-gf destroyed my  self-esteem entirely. I am left to "die" when she just ditch me at my lowest pt of my life. Somehow, I haf to admit the Thai Gal happens to make me forget my ex-gf for a moment. She gave me back a bit of self-confidence. But then, its just short term solution. Is your situation similar as mine?<br><br>I thank everyone here for your comments. As u can seem FBI is also in confusion. I am like him now still deciding on Road 1 or Road 2.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow.. Such good replies and advices from curiousOrange, The Emperor, FBI, Yunhaier and all the others..<br><br>I don't know why but although I am like not related to any part of this topic I would just like to say a BIG thank you to all u guys for spending time and thought to help out this poor soul. May you all have happy days ahead! =)<br><br>Personally, I would say give it some time. Seems like no one has talked about the time factor here. As in since how long have you been "in love" with this Thai lady? And how much time gap was there since you broke up with ur ex and started to like this lady?<br><br>I have never been to a pro before and probably nvr will, but thats my personal choice. So please pardon me if I asked something really dumb in this next question.<br><br>I don't understand why you MUST pay her to visit only. Can't both of you just meet up out somewhere when she is not working? Can't be they work 24 hrs rite? If she rejects that it MIGHT be possible that she wants the money and hence doesn't want to meet you outside..<br><br>Just my thoughts..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ern.. It is quite confusing. But it is better that you don fall in love with deeper n deeper. Many things you need to consider 4 the furture.. how old are she, is she married or attached, she gt HIV, will she have to go back to thaliand one dae, k your parent accept her n blah blah so on and so fore.. If you got confidence to answer these question, i will wish you all e best. If nt, wish you k think clearly ba. Or maybe she is replacement or maybe a crush?</div>

Why don't you put the money to good use? Spare a thought about other peoples feelings before you satisfy your own needs. How would the allowance giver feel if he found out about it?<br><br>Sorry i sound like a nag and feelingless towards your confusion but i think you should be more mature and rational in your thoughts.</div>

I am keen to know what really happen? So far, I haf not been cheated of any money as u can see, she (Thai Lady) is different from others. She did tell me that she is not after my money.
