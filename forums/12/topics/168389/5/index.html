Love in your heart has been taken away when you broke up with your ex leaving behind an empty space desperately to be fill up by love again and when someone who possess these certain elements which you had once loved before in your ex comes along, you just feel like loving once again.

I mean you don't mind her 'servicing' other people until she finish her contract? What contract is this? If she breaks the contract, she breaks the law? No? If you really like her you would do all you can to stop her from doing what she's doing. Similarly, if the feeling is mutual she would do the same.<br><br>But whatever it is be very careful.
