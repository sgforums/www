They think differently from you and don't know you well. what makes you think they will understand you? I am sure you know a lot of parents don't understand their children at all so you are not alone. and big deal with this dont understand thing. the most important is that you understand yourself and you don't owe them any explanation.<br><br>secondly, i wonder who is the master, you or your dog? if your dog hates you and you get so upset, then I think your dog should be your master right? Look, if you think you are the master, show to the dog that it better not give you any nonsense or else its the street for it. done.<br><br>Thirdly, now if you die, you die for no purpose at all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nelstaer dear,<br><br>i seriously hope you are not kidding here...<br><br>A forum is for people to voice their opinions, so watever sarcasm you've seen, let's put it aside. People have their rights to say watever they like.<br><br>But if you are genuinely here to seek guidance, then I shall share some advices with you...<br><br>Some forumners are right. Since you still have time to turn to this forum, then you are really not ready to die. I think you are still very young to have such thoughts. Have you ever really thought of a way to die? Have you thought of the consequences if you are paralysed due to a suicide attempt failure? That would have hurt yourself and your loved ones. To really DIE, you need tons of courage and I can tell you, it is not easy.<br><br>1) Jumping off a building - Yes, you will surely die. Call it a bimbo thinking. But can you imagine the disgusted remains of yours after the deep impact on your brains? All the intestines flowing on the ground? No, it's out! Too ugly.<br><br>2) Popping on pills - The most common drug used for suicidal cases is Panadol. I tell you, 20 - 40 pills of Panadols won't kill you, instantly. You will only end up having suction in the hospital and worrying about the after effects which will kill you. The effect of Panadol will only take effect after 24 to 48 hours. Slowly, the paracetamol will affect your liver function. The amount of paracetamol allowed in a human body is 20-30mg. Any more than 50mg could be deadly. 20 pills of panadols is equivalent to 230mg of paracetamol. Imagine the amount? If it is severe, your eye balls, skin and urine will turn yellowish due to the mis-function of your liver systems. Once that happen, you will suffer from liver failure. And gradually, you will suffer hell before you can really die.<br>Some may say, take more than 41 pills of panadols lor. True, but then, do you think you will have the strength and ability to do so at that time? You will already start to feel weak at that time and you will start to vomit out some of the panadols.<br><br>3) Cutting your wrist - Can you really bear to do it? It's god damn painful.<br><br>I could only think of these methods at the moment. But anyway, cherish your life. If your parents couldn't understand you, turn to your friends. Find out where does the problems lies before you make any decision. There is a thread on counselling numbers to call too. Please check it out.<br><br>As for your dog, if you cannot stand the 'hatred' your dog has for you, then, give him to your friends or SPCA.<br><br>All the above are juz my 2 cents of opinions.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Look straight, think positively.<br><br></div>
