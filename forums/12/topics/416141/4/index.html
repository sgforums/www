              <p><br>Ohh... pushing out foreigners forcefully will bring problems and bad karma?</p>
              <p>So are you the Foreign Minister now or are you trying to act noble now? What has that got to do with you?</p>
              <p>I didn't know you come here to be the good guy, and if you want me to be the bad guy, then I will show you what's a bad guy lor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore Government encourage overseas students to INVEST their education in Singapore Universities, and Singapore Universities should welcome foreign students to get their education in Singapore, so treating them better than the locals is not considered unfair IF you can understand that these foreigners aren't as familiar with Singapore as compared to the locals failures like yourself who only know how to study but failed to understand anything beyond your books.</p>
              <p>Local student like yourself who have parents in Singapore, siblings in Singapore, cousins and relatives in Singapore, are just utterly lame and shameful if you are complaining and comparing with foreigners who didn't have that kind of support in Singapore. IF you're lucky, local student like yourself would be fucking foreign students while receiving an education in Singapore with all the support from your families. DO YOU SEE HOW SHAMEFUL YOU ARE? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>If you're complaining about your NSF liabilities and the need to go to NS, you should have migrated out of Singapore to China then come back to Singapore as a foreign student. There's always a way to get around your teeny whiny complaints but you must ask yourself this, "DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO ACHIEVE THAT AND GET AROUND YOUR LAME COMPLAINTS?"</p>
              <p>Yes, you write your complaints based on facts, but only your self-centered facts which is just wide open for me to shoot you down into pieces of junks and trashs. I don't think trash like yourself deserves to pursue any further studies in Singapore Universities because there's really nothing useful that you can contribute to our society anyway with all your self-centered facts + complaints, it's just going to increase the unhappiness of everyone in the workforce and at your workplace. WHY DON'T YOU SAVE UP AND STUDY OVERSEAS AND TRY LIVING YOUR LIFE AS A FOREIGN STUDENT FOR ONCE? I hope you will grow up and change to become a better person once you have achieved that and graduate successfully as a full-time foreign student from overseas universities.</p>
              <p>I cannot help you any further if you tell me you are not satisfied and your cousins, friends and so-called locals are also not satisfied. I WILL ONLY ASK YOU ALL TO GO AND MASTURBATE UNTIL YOU ALL ARE SATISFIED!</p>
              <p>And I have no idea why they told you their dissatisfaction and I believed it's definitely not because you're the smartest among them and also not because you're their indian chief or tribal leader. MAYBE THEY NEED YOU TO MASTURBATE THEM TO RELIEVE THEM UNTIL THEY ARE ALL SATISFIED? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>And if like what you said, there are so many dissatisfied Singaporean guys like yourself out there, it's certainly no wonder that the divorce rates are all time high and Singaporeans girls are marrying late.</p>
              <p>As a Singaporean girl, it is always wise to marry the right guy or else you will end up with a lifetime of babysitting your teeny whiny Singaporean guy......ahem....childish and immature and insensible Singaporean guy who needs you to masturbate for him whenever he is not happy or when he doesn't understand about the Government policies.</p>
              <p>LAME LAME AND VERY LAME. AND I DON'T THINK YOU NEED FURTHER HELP FROM US HERE SINCE YOU ALREADY THINK YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACT HIGH AND MIGHTY.</p>
              <p>I WOULD'VE BAN PEOPLE LIKE YOU, BUT YOU'RE LUCKY THAT SHINY RED BUTTON ISN'T WITH ME. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
