              <p>True guys the foreigners are getting a bit out of hand but, the Government's really 100% responsible for it.

              <p>Why can't we bring all the hate together and overthrow our shameless PAPies?</p>

              <p><br>You should be smart enough not to force yourself to work under FT superiors if you really detest that thought.</p>
              <p>But if you tell me that you have no choice and you really need to force yourself to work under FT superiors which you have detested so much, then I will tell you that it is YOU who convinced yourself that you are UTTERLY CHEAP and you would CHEAPEN yourself to willingly sell your pride and sacrificed your happiness at work for the sake of money...a mere few thousands to be exact.</p>

              <p>IF YES, THEN YOU TRULY DESERVES TO BE HUMILIATED BY THE FTs AT WORK FOR THE REST OF YOUR WORKING LIFE AND YOU SHOULD GO HOME AND SUCK THUMB AND STOP WHINNING ABOUT IT.</p>
              <p>I will empathised with you if you were forced by Men In Black to work under FTs, but if you willingly cheapen your worth for the sake of a mere few thousands dollars, then it is a fair trade and deal which you have agreed to willingly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think again who will be the superiors of your FT superiors, Singaporean right? IF all your superiors up till the top of the management are all FTs, then you must be working for a whore house where employees need to fuck and suck their ways to be promoted in the company and I would suggest you to get yourself out of that company of international whores before you become one of them.</p>

              <p>I don't wanna reply you directly littlemissbonker, I can tell you the fact that in University foreigners get treated better ......on poly it's on equal, scholarship and paying same fee... but deep down it's unfair because their bond &gt; our NSF liabilities, In Uni there were complains about foreigners get scholarships and free lodging, it's there at Temasek Review if you guys ever interested to look at it.</p>
              <p>First of all you are female, think about it if you ever will want to marry a Singaporean guy he also have to sacrifice, your son will also have to if you stayed. And if all of you want to marry the Ang Mohs then too bad for Singaporean guys, again :P</p>
              <p>Yes I KP the government. But don't I write my sentences based on fact? Maybe I haven't proved myself in Uni, but I have proven myself in one way or another.</p>
              <p>Having 3 year of your life and opportunity cost sacrificed, I am interested to see a show of hand how many are unsatisfied with this kind of unfair treatment only to our local guys. My cousins, my friends......I can tell you they are all unsatisfied, they told me. You can even hear by looking at the replies.</p>
              <p>And parn ... must be really lucky to find a company that hire 100% Singaporean. Yet problems arises too if you push foreigners out forcefully ... by ill treating another human using underhand means you will bring bad karma upon yourself too, you know? If you are trying to kick the foreigner's ass by being mean and torture them, doesn't it make you one of those bad guys too?</p>
              <p>Lastly to say I'm fine and I don't read all your insults littlemissbonker, I have a year of experience in F&amp;B and I am not one to succumb to cheap insults easily, you are against what I said.....different opinions and views, but not against me =)</p>

              <p>I don't wanna reply you directly littlemissbonker, I can tell you the fact that in University foreigners get treated better ......on poly it's on equal, scholarship and paying same fee... but deep down it's unfair because their bond &gt; our NSF liabilities, In Uni there were complains about foreigners get scholarships and free lodging, it's there at Temasek Review if you guys ever interested to look at it.</p>
              <p>First of all you are female, think about it if you ever will want to marry a Singaporean guy he also have to sacrifice, your son will also have to if you stayed. And if all of you want to marry the Ang Mohs then too bad for Singaporean guys, again :P</p>
              <p>Yes I KP the government. But don't I write my sentences based on fact? Maybe I haven't proved myself in Uni, but I have proven myself in one way or another.</p>
              <p>Having 3 year of your life and opportunity cost sacrificed, I am interested to see a show of hand how many are unsatisfied with this kind of unfair treatment only to our local guys. My cousins, my friends......I can tell you they are all unsatisfied, they told me. You can even hear by looking at the replies.</p>
              <p>And parn ... must be really lucky to find a company that hire 100% Singaporean. Yet problems arises too if you push foreigners out forcefully ... by ill treating another human using underhand means you will bring bad karma upon yourself too, you know? If you are trying to kick the foreigner's ass by being mean and torture them, doesn't it make you one of those bad guys too?</p>
              <p>Lastly to say I'm fine and I don't read all your insults littlemissbonker, I have a year of experience in F&amp;B and I am not one to succumb to cheap insults easily, you are against what I said.....different opinions and views, but not against me =)</p>

              <p><br>True, I'm not against you. All I want to do is to remind you that you can play a bigger and better part in your life.</p>
              <p>And yeah, my posts and tone sound harsh but I won't apologise for that, becoz sometimes I feel that people need a wake up call.</p>
              <p>The govt in Sg may not be perfect and may even make major screw ups at times. But when you really compare it with other countries, you'll see that we're mostly provided for; with ample opportunities to better our lives.</p>
              <p>All in all, nothing can be gained from whining alone. If you really want to lead a better life you'll have to fight for it.</p>
              <p>I'll end it here.</p>
