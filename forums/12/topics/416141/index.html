              <p>My NS is scheduled in 4th May but after I got this enlistment letter and send my resume to apply for a job, 0 reply at all.</p>
              <p>I got my Diploma in Engineering School and I have a Merit .........but nobody ever want to hire me except normal part-time jobs which students/undereducated people do.</p>
              <p><br>As a result I have to do shitty jobs out there paying at $5-7 per hour where everyone is asking "Why can't you look for better jobs? This job not good enough for you la". Well who should I ask? My mom for giving birth to me here? My dad? The government? Nah... all they do is just forward their Act no. xxx to xxx, law here, law there...... they win because they made all law they wanted but we can't.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have to waith 7-8 months for all this shit to end and then for another shit to start (The NS)</p>
              <p><br>Even then the government is still docking my pay here and there... CPF last time I checked last week with the pay range I earned the company aren't complied to pay my CPF so what the hell now I have to pay all my CPF alone with my pity savings and the company still dared to lied to me that they will pay my CPF. The worst thing is that the PAP lied and the company can avoid paying CPF at all if the worker is among the lower salary range.</p>
              <p>When I go shopping ... all I see was NTUC there, again government making money off me and opening new outlets everywhere.</p>
              <p>When I take MRT or Buses, again paying government. $3++ everyday.</p>
              <p>Whatever I buy, pay 7% GST.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All my classmates from China most of them have already found job, some were delayed getting work permit but all of them don't have to do NS at all, they all laughed at me but not because I made a dumb decision but because my country made a horrible decision which I am forced to disobey.</p>
              <p>I wrote to the CDAC, I have 2 jobs and I wanted not to donate the $1 because I already donated a lot into CPF ... again they send me letters with act no. and again law related. Very troublesome have to go and take opt-out form from them.</p>
              <p>Last night I happened to saw CDAC near my home (Saw the George Yeo nameplate outside this centre) so decided to go in to take an opt-out form they told me very rudely they don't have such thing ... then again telling about law, they were very elite and uncaring and talked in a very mean and unpolite tone but I thanked them anyway because I am different and I am better from them. I can even tell you that George Yeo isn't any better than them because he looked unhappy and moody during our election campaign.... yes I've seen his elite and uncaring face. =)</p>
              <p>Well so they asked me to go down to Tanjong Katong if I wanted to get the form, I don't know what shit will happen next if I go down, but I decided not to for now ...everything here is at the convenience of the Government, in the name of our Nation but in reaity theres little for our Nation and nothing for the people.</p>
              <p>When you go out to shop ... people can use pressure tactics in getting you to sign for packages, you can complain or sue them, but when one's Government's doing such things upon you and making it a law in absolutely everything they are forcing upon you ......What can "You" do?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the end the pay I received was horrible after all the docking from Government and transport, living expenses ... that's what I came to realize my difference. If I weren't denied basic job opportunities I could have been earning $1.6-$2k per month or continued my studies. Here I am earning about $900 or even lesser a month working 40 hour/week (before deducting CPF) and I really feel the "heart wrenching pain" as a low-income worker because transportation cost and living expenses are very costy. Certainly my classmates whom are earning $1.6-$2k per month (Which I should with my qualification) will feel lesser pain when taking transport or paying their living expenses, they might even have lots to save up, but that kind of life is totally unheard of ...at least to me, I have to suffer another 3 years straight from the PAP rule just like that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They claimed CPF is to help us.....CDAC is to help us Chinese and tell me whom are these "Chinese" people they are referring to? What can people do when their money is all trapped in CPF? The government doesn't care obviously so people borrowed money from banks and loansharks. Now with the CPF life things only got more horrible for our generation.</p>
              <p>Basically every 5 hour work 1 do, 1 hour is for the government which I hate and basically I am just paying and paying for them because almost everywhere I go they are there (MRT/BUS/NTUC/CDAC/etc......). The worst thing is that other countries gave free healthcare and benefits from paying tax but theres none in reality going for us.</p>
              <p>Sure it's easy to argue that "you can use your CPF to buy HDB" , but then ask yourself who builds them and who is pricing your HDB so high?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is only a truth about the PAP's policy ... they created a really well planned and profitable business in the name of government's services intending to profit only themselves but lied and told us that we benefit a lot from it for as long as people stay in the country. They added on to our burden furthur by making a scheme like CPF ... to me this is far worse than a ponzi scheme because there is only ONE winner. The PAPs are going on to reach their final goal ... to get as much people in as possible so that they can be the richest Government in the world with all our people's hardearned money and asset. (They even do offshare banking and allow money laundering so you can see really what kind of people they are)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am so depressed I don't want to live anymore ... Please ISA come catch me and shoot me la, make me dissapear. Charge me for being a rebel. Before I become insane and kill all of you government dogs.</p>
              <p>What more can I expect from my own life if I can't even make my own decisions but forced to do so many things which I hated.</p>

              <p>Put yourself in the employer's shoes and think why they should employ you for 6 months.</p>
              <p>Secondly, engineering diploma pays an average of $1600-$1800. Now you earn $900. It's just a difference of $700 per month over 6 months. If you can't get over this, then how when you earn NSF pay of $400-$900 a month for 2 years?</p>
              <p>Just enjoy your holidays while you can. After all, retirement age will be raised to 82 when you retire. There are many more years to earn the $$ back.</p>

              <p>Life is never fair. In NS, you will come across things that are more unfair than what you're facing now, like why that cock eyed mate of yours is going to sniper instructor course at SIF, and you have been posted to armour.</p>

              <p>Like that also complain.</p>
              <p>When is life fair for you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Other countries give free healthcare? Take Germany for example, the world 4th largest economy. VAT (same as our GST) is 19%. Tax rate is higher. But you are required to have bought insurance for healthcare; healthcare isn't free.</p>
              <p>Germany's education is free though, but you still have to pay miscellanous fees, which amounts to more than in Sg. Their uni fees is definitely cheaper though, but then, they are now starting to charge for it.</p>
              <p>Of course, there also many more reasons why Germany is better than Singapore, e.g. their Deutsche Bahn system, etc.</p>
              <p>If one wants to compare, there are never ending comparisons.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are not well travelled, read up, and complaining merely for the sake of venting your frustrations. Then again, it's understandable. It's human nature to want more. Like why is the lady in front of you getting 1 extra fish ball, or why the person who bought the lottery ticket in front of your strike the first price and not you, etc.</p>
              <p>Life is just fairer to some, and less fair to others. Comparisons will only shorten your life, and make you unhappy like you are now.</p>

              <p>Life isn't as bad as you thought if you tell yourself not to be discouraged by the losers and society failures in here.</p>
              <p>In what ways do you think your life isn't good enough for you?</p>
              <p>You should start by telling us how life should have treated you instead, that would be a good way to start living your dreams.</p>
              <p>But if you tell us you expect people in the working world to treat you like the CEO of CEOs, Manager of Managers, Supervisor of Supervisors, Section Leader of Section Leaders, then you might realised that you are asking too much of yourself in your current situation.</p>
              <p>There are many other people out there who are worse off than you and they have more existing struggles and burdens than you. Should these people go and kill themselves?</p>
              <p>Change jobs if you felt that you have been shortchanged by your employers, but make sure you are at least capable enough to handle and perform your job scope well first before you admit that you were shortchanged at your workplace.</p>
              <p>If you are capable at your workplace and you felt terrible because of the behaviour of your co-workers, I will tell you "NOT TO GIVE UP EASILY" and hope that you will inherit this spirit and instill it in your blood and bone.</p>
              <p>The people who can be successful and win the world aren't people who are particularly talented or capable or educated with merits like yourself. They are simply people who NEVER GIVE UP on whatever job or tasks they were assigned to do.</p>
              <p>These people are truly the ones who will succeed in their lives and in every things that they do at their workplace and their personal relationships.</p>
              <p>Your life will become normal like everyone else around you if you chose to give up on yourself. But life changes unknowingly and mysteriously when you finally made up your mind NEVER TO GIVE UP EASILY on yourself and whatever you do in your lives.</p>
              <p>Make the difference in your lives, and you will see the differences with your lives.</p>

              <p>What's so unfair?</p>
              <p>Your china classmates are either very rich or they slogged their guts out over their studies to get a place here.</p>
              <p>U rich ma? Got all distinctions ma? Dun have den shut up la.</p>
              <p>Your china classmates have to pay the full course fees for poly while you only need to pay the subsidized version. Fair ma?</p>
              <p>Life is unfair what, not everybody has got bloody rich parents. Since you dun have den work hard to become rich yourself la. Your bloody attitude is never gonna get you there.</p>
              <p>Think out of the box la, why is it that some poor kid can make millions as an adult but you still cannot? The difference is in the attitude.</p>
              <p>And hor, when I was fresh out of secondary sch, I managed to get a job paying 8-10 bucks per hour. So I dunno wth you're complaining about. If I can get one with just an O level cert, then why can't you? BTW, I didn't get it becoz of recommendations or whatever. I got it becoz the employers were impressed with my attitude.</p>
              <p>So dun compare and complain. Look at yourself. If your attitude sucks and only have so-so qualifications, then why would people want to hire you? What makes you think you deserve a bigger pay-check?</p>
