              <p>1) Most of your foreign classmates are one or two years older than you. Most have to waste one year of their time to come to Singapore. Don't believe, go check around all the secondary schools and JCs. If they are the same age as you in your study course, that means they are really geniuses to have skipped that one year.</p>
              <p>2) I have applied and gotten a HDB from BTO, 5-rm at $325k. Expensive, but compared to foreign colleagues who are getting married, they have to buy a resale with high COV... betw $400k to $500k or more. How?</p>

              <p>First of all you are female, think about it if you ever will want to marry a Singaporean guy he also have to sacrifice, your son will also have to if you stayed. And if all of you want to marry the Ang Mohs then too bad for Singaporean guys, again :P</p>
              <p>Yes I KP the government. But don't I write my sentences based on fact? Maybe I haven't proved myself in Uni, but I have proven myself in one way or another.</p>
              <p>Having 3 year of your life and opportunity cost sacrificed, I am interested to see a show of hand how many are unsatisfied with this kind of unfair treatment only to our local guys. My cousins, my friends......I can tell you they are all unsatisfied, they told me. You can even hear by looking at the replies.</p>
              <p>And parn ... must be really lucky to find a company that hire 100% Singaporean. Yet problems arises too if you push foreigners out forcefully ... by ill treating another human using underhand means you will bring bad karma upon yourself too, you know? If you are trying to kick the foreigner's ass by being mean and torture them, doesn't it make you one of those bad guys too?</p>
              <p>Lastly to say I'm fine and I don't read all your insults littlemissbonker, I have a year of experience in F&amp;B and I am not one to succumb to cheap insults easily, you are against what I said.....different opinions and views, but not against me =)</p>

              <p>Singapore Government encourage overseas students to INVEST their education in Singapore Universities, and Singapore Universities should welcome foreign students to get their education in Singapore, so treating them better than the locals is not considered unfair IF you can understand that these foreigners aren't as familiar with Singapore as compared to the locals failures like yourself who only know how to study but failed to understand anything beyond your books.</p>
              <p>Local student like yourself who have parents in Singapore, siblings in Singapore, cousins and relatives in Singapore, are just utterly lame and shameful if you are complaining and comparing with foreigners who didn't have that kind of support in Singapore. IF you're lucky, local student like yourself would be fucking foreign students while receiving an education in Singapore with all the support from your families. DO YOU SEE HOW SHAMEFUL YOU ARE? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>If you're complaining about your NSF liabilities and the need to go to NS, you should have migrated out of Singapore to China then come back to Singapore as a foreign student. There's always a way to get around your teeny whiny complaints but you must ask yourself this, "DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO ACHIEVE THAT AND GET AROUND YOUR LAME COMPLAINTS?"</p>
              <p>Yes, you write your complaints based on facts, but only your self-centered facts which is just wide open for me to shoot you down into pieces of junks and trashs. I don't think trash like yourself deserves to pursue any further studies in Singapore Universities because there's really nothing useful that you can contribute to our society anyway with all your self-centered facts + complaints, it's just going to increase the unhappiness of everyone in the workforce and at your workplace. WHY DON'T YOU SAVE UP AND STUDY OVERSEAS AND TRY LIVING YOUR LIFE AS A FOREIGN STUDENT FOR ONCE? I hope you will grow up and change to become a better person once you have achieved that and graduate successfully as a full-time foreign student from overseas universities.</p>
              <p>I cannot help you any further if you tell me you are not satisfied and your cousins, friends and so-called locals are also not satisfied. I WILL ONLY ASK YOU ALL TO GO AND MASTURBATE UNTIL YOU ALL ARE SATISFIED!</p>
              <p>And I have no idea why they told you their dissatisfaction and I believed it's definitely not because you're the smartest among them and also not because you're their indian chief or tribal leader. MAYBE THEY NEED YOU TO MASTURBATE THEM TO RELIEVE THEM UNTIL THEY ARE ALL SATISFIED? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>And if like what you said, there are so many dissatisfied Singaporean guys like yourself out there, it's certainly no wonder that the divorce rates are all time high and Singaporeans girls are marrying late.</p>
              <p>As a Singaporean girl, it is always wise to marry the right guy or else you will end up with a lifetime of babysitting your teeny whiny Singaporean guy......ahem....childish and immature and insensible Singaporean guy who needs you to masturbate for him whenever he is not happy or when he doesn't understand about the Government policies.</p>
              <p>LAME LAME AND VERY LAME. AND I DON'T THINK YOU NEED FURTHER HELP FROM US HERE SINCE YOU ALREADY THINK YOU HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACT HIGH AND MIGHTY.</p>
              <p>I WOULD'VE BAN PEOPLE LIKE YOU, BUT YOU'RE LUCKY THAT SHINY RED BUTTON ISN'T WITH ME. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Don't understand what you meant by this time I'm a bit too carried away when you only can follow my post since October 2010. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually, nobody pointed a gun at your head and forced you to accept the education system in Singapore. You can be a rebel and stop your education but you didn't. You don't remember that YOU DID HAVE A CHOICE, but YOU FAILED TO MAKE YOUR OWN CHOICE.</p>
              <p>Why bother to whine about it after you have accepted the choice to receive an education in Singapore? Would you have complained if you were one of the top elite students in Singapore? I think not, you would probably come up here and tell people to fuck off from your elite uncaring face right? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>People like yourself should thank your lucky stars and GOD that you were born in Singapore and despite your inability to do well in your education, the Singapore education system are still able to provide plenty of leeways and alternate routes for you to be sufficiently educated to stand up on your own in your society. DO YOU THINK YOU AND YOUR KIND WOULD BE GIVEN A SECOND OR THIRD CHANCE TO CONTINUE YOUR EDUCATION IF YOU WERE BORN IN POORER COUNTRIES?</p>
              <p>Don't pick on everything around you and don't pick on people who are doing better than you. Don't pick on GOD and don't pick on your parents and loved ones.</p>
              <p>Achieve that and let go, and I can guarantee you that you will be able to move on alot quicker than you can ever imagined in the past.</p>
              <p>Life should be happy for everyone and YOU SHOULD BE HAPPIER WITH YOUR LIVES.</p>
              <p>The fact that you know a few things in your lives doesn't necessary means you have the POWER to change them. The truth is these informations were meant to warn and help you to avoid getting implicated into the same situations and scenarios as them.</p>
              <p>The laws does not forgive and neither does the laws forget. But you can use all your might and power to avoid getting yourself involved on the wrong side of the laws. And IT IS STILL YOUR CHOICE TO MAKE.</p>
              <p>IF YOU REALLY GIVE A DAMN LIKE HOW YOU HAVE EXPRESSED IN THIS TOPIC, THEN PLEASE HELP TO WARN YOUR LOVED ONES AND IMPORTANT ONES TO KEEP THEM OUT OF TROUBLE OR KEEP THEM ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE LAWS, SO THAT THEY CAN ALSO LIVED A HAPPY LIFE!</p>

              <p><br>So you're a fine example of a useless Singaporean with an escapist attitude or are you simply just a society failure who need to depend on his parents in order to feel successful about having an escapist attitude?</p>

              <p>Don't worry about Miss P, Miss P always talk about cock and
              vagina and then peeing on top of other people, I just don't
              understand her.</p>
              <p>Anyway I agree with you, I hate to work in Sg, the PAP govt
              always support the employers make life for workers stressful and
              high performance- all must work "better, cheaper and faster". Lucky
              for me, my parents have enough savings, so instead of going through
              the Sg education system, they sent me to Australia to pursue my
              college and university studies.</p>
              <p>I also got sick of living in overpriced HBD flat hearing
              neighbour footstep everyday. Instead now I settle in Msia, able to
              own a double storey house with 20
              feet of side garden and drive a car without any
              limitations.</p>

              <p><br> Sorry hor, in uni already</p>
              <p>Unlike the losers here, I dun blame everything on the govt.</p>
              <p>Yeah, the govt plays a significant part in people's lives.
              But ultimately the biggest part will be played by you and you
              alone. If your attitude sucks, then no matter how much aid you're
              given, you'll still be living out your life like a parasite.</p>
              <p>Look at USA and some other western countries, the people get so
              much govt aid, they practically just roll around and sleep all day.
              Look at their unemployment rates. These people are practically paid
              for being unemployed. Then look at the mountains of debt they've
              incurred.</p>
              <p>Before you compare, use your brains.</p>
              <p>Ultimately you're the one who's gonna live a shitty life. If I
              were you, I'll be scrambling to pull up my socks now. By the way,
              if your intention is to KB the govt, then please post in Whiner's
              corner in future so that people don't waste valuable time reading
              trash.</p>
              <p>Don't like what I said? Too bad</p>

              <p>Ah, ok, maybe that's why our country is in such a mess, no one is interested in politics, the running of the country has been surrendered by citizens into the hands of PAPist which ruled Sinkapore even more ruthlessly. We have to take interest and also participate in the running of a country also. You, alone, can acheive quite a lot but together with other people, we can acheive much more, come, come join the Whinning Corner, maybe you will start to like us. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>Do come over and you will see that the problems in the West has progressed much further and also mirrored what is happening in Sinkapore also. Come, come, don't be shy. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
