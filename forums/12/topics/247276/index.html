            <div class='col-md body'>Apologies for the late reply.<br><br>The reason for the late reply is not because I'm trying to avoid anything. It's genuinely because I don't have the habit of posting over the weekends.. Perhaps except Sunday nights?<br><br>And I admit that I've been quite inactive in AA lately. It's mainly because of political reasons. My intention as a moderator in AA was never to use my position to take advantage of anyone.<br><br>Regarding Bee_gal's incident, I'll stand firm by what I've said previously. It wasn't like what the others have accused of me. Perhaps Bee_gal herself would come back one day to clear everything if she still regards me as a friend. Perhaps she won't. Doesn't really matter now I guess?<br><br>Quinsy. Yes, we went for the movie. I seriously had the impression that she was leading me on. From my further conversations with her after (sorry, I didn't learn about all these threads until lately), I guess I could be wrong. She said she wasn't trying to encourage and lead me on. To that, I <strong>owe her an apology</strong>. I'm truly sorry if I've misinterpreted you. I guess you were too quiet and casual about it so I didn't really know. I'm sorry. When I 1st asked her out, it was purely casual. No intention.<br><br>I agree with MOST here that I'm not a 'good' guy nor a 'saint' to start with. I also agree with the 'warnings' given with regards to me. Makes me think perhaps I really shouldn't be allowed to meet up with anyone online at all? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> I've not and never for ONCE claimed that I'm a SAINT.. In fact, I dread it if anyone is to define me as so. I'm just doing a part which if humans have handled a better job themselves.. I would not have even need to exist today.<br><br>I would also urge Jason to find AA a replacement for moderator soon. And should he find appropriate replacement for AA, I would like to free myself from that position and duty.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think I must have been nutz... As in the same case as to jump to Bee_gal's defence when I was actually the accused... I'm repeating my same mistake here again...<br><br>I've been reluctant to state whatever actually for 2 main reasons..<br><br>1. I know a girl's reputation is especially important to her. Especially for someone like Quinsy. Age 19. And according to her, she really mind how people would judge and look at her. I can understand that.. I truly have no intention to trash your reputation or whatsoever... Even when mine's down the drain... Like I've said, such things often don't really bother me... But what started as a joke for you to just 'humiliate' me is not so 'funny' anymore if you strike out for it to be a police case... I'm not stopping you nor intimidating you if you feel 'justified' that such a call is most adequate from your point of view. I just ask you to touch your heart and recalled of what happened..<br><br>Below would be my account of what happened between me and Quinsy in the cinema. Yes, I gave her the treat. I told her it's because she's a student, that's why I treated her.<br><br>We had a drink which we shared. I suggested using 2 straws. She suggested to use 1 straw to share. I insisted on 2.<br><br>In the movie, I was holding the popcorn. She was to my left. She had her arms rested on the chair initially as according to her. And yes, I believe her attire is as what she had described more or less. After a while of taking popcorns from me (she took it herself using her own hands, I did not feed her), she actually pulled my arms closed to her bre*st. I did not retaliate. But I did moved my arm away from her because I had to take popcorn for myself. The process repeated itself for a while. Sometimes she would pull my arm close to her to feed on the popcorn, sometimes I just moved my hand to her.<br><br>After the movie we talked and I sent her to the toilet. She took a long time to come out but I waited anyway. After which she left for home.<br><br>Some time after, I realised that what we did back in the cinema could have been quite inappropriate and so I smsed her telling her something like "I'm sorry for being naughty in the cinema just now." or something like that? Then we continued to exchanged smses for a while.<br><br>Some time after, a question which kept popping my mind continued to disturb me. There was another(?) forumite who PMed me about her problem (sorry I can't disclose the nick) which involves a sex buddy. She and Quinsy were PMing me about the same time which was really in the middle of the night. So I thought they might actually be the same person, hence I smsed Quinsy the question of "Do you have a sex buddy?" out of the blues...<br><br>That's basically my part of the account. I only discovered about her thread on me and VK's thread(s) in AA at a much later stage.<br><br>I do not insist that forumites believe in the above I've stated, but I think it's only fair that I give my part of the account having heard so much from the involved and 'uninvolved' people.<br><br>I only true regrets now is the disappointment I've given to my gf and the dirty politics in Sgforums.<br><br>2. 2nd reason why I've been reluctant to speak up is because I know my words would be twisted around somehow... Just look around the threads and it won't be difficult to understand what I'm trying to say. Nonetheless, I've decided that it's only fair to everybody to state my account. For those who is still interested to twist my words around and put words into my mouth (claiming that I've said things which I've actually not said), I shall try to ignore for now.<br></div>
