The poor fellow will have liquidlity problems, not enough cash for daily activities, by then will the fellow even make it alive and kicking (touchwood)  for the returns as well as the money invested i doubt so.<br><br>i thought you said confirm win short term one.<br><br>anyway  thanks for sharing with me so much, i really learnt and understand the path better which i am about to take on soon.</div>
