If it's right, she will not hold back unless she just divorced or broke up etc. She's hot and cold towards u, it's really obvious - she's not sure. Why not sure? because the feeling is not strong enough. U look like u r getting very desperate over the situation and are trying many ways to get closer to her. This is suicidal.<br><br>Take a step back. (yeh u said it) don't call her at all. Make friends with other gals and "report" back to her a mth later on how well ur doing. If she cannot be bothered or does not call u, then forget abt her.<br><br>Remember, when we apply for jobs and we know we got the self worth , it's our call, not the employer's. Same, if u know u got the worth, then YOU choose, not the girl.

Your advice i will heed, its always the clearest picture from outsider's view. What you said were all right, i'm sad to do it but i'll try my very best.

But i never really go try(cause i know its impossible) until recently(2-3months) we somehow got closer and i dont want to miss the opportunity, taking steps by steps, trying to prevent any wrong moves. Has been very cautious. She's just has this very attractive personality that make me so happy everytime i get in contact with her. So its not really 6years and notthing happened, or should i say, 6 years but only 2-3months back that i got close to her, for the past 5 years 9months, we just catch up sometimes. I only got my feel when we got close  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
