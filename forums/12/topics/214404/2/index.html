If you just want to be friends then all of a sudden you want to change to a r/s direction, it is not going to be easy for the girl. If you just want to be friends with her so that you can be steady with her, you are making one huge round just to close the deal. Why don't you make your intentions clear from the start? Not asking you to say "You love her" so fast but just ask her out first on a date.  Women want a real man, period. That's all.</div>

You may think that your woman is capricious, but she might have pick up those little subconscious messages from your dealings with her, which may cause her to behave in that shifty manner. She is hesitating because something is missing. Something about you...which causes her uncertainty.<br><br>If she is uncertain, you must present a constant message about your intent (law of consistency), and not returning one step back on your chase, with every step forward just because your fear reminded you of your need to be caution. You put two uncertain people together, whatever budding love might die of 'natural death'.<br><br>I reckon you are afraid to break your one chance and shatter that fantasy of six years forever, like facing rejection face on and not being able to take it.<br><br>P.S: Sometimes, we just have to accept some risk in our chase. Perhaps it could be the time where we abandon the facade of a friendship and gradually reveal our interest in somebody. There is a difference between dating with an interest and dating hiding behind the facade of a friendship. The former presents a possibility, while the latter waits for a possibility. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

You may think that your woman is capricious, but she might have pick up those little subconscious messages from your dealings with her, which may cause her to behave in that shifty manner. She is hesitating because something is missing. Something about you...which causes her uncertainty.<br><br>If she is uncertain, you must present a constant message about your intent (law of consistency), and not returning one step back on your chase, with every step forward just because your fear reminded you of your need to be caution. You put two uncertain people together, whatever budding love might die of 'natural death'.<br><br>I reckon you are afraid to break your one chance and shatter that fantasy of six years forever, like facing rejection face on and not being able to take it.<br><br>P.S: Sometimes, we just have to accept some risk in our chase. Perhaps it could be the time where we abandon the facade of a friendship and gradually reveal our interest in somebody. There is a difference between dating with an interest and dating hiding behind the facade of a friendship. The former presents a possibility, while the latter waits for a possibility. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div></blockquote>You understand my whole situation, i thank you so much.<br><br>cheers</div>
