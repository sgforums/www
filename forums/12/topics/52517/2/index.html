            <div class='col-md body'>i have encountered a very similar case....i mean i have a female colleague and she was admired by a male colleague abt 10 yrs older.<br><br>but the problem is that she dont like him....actually it is only recently that i told her abt what i observed...but since she feels awkward and wishes to avoid him....i felt that prob i can help a little...<br><br>they went on solo dates quite a few times and in fact i thought both of them are really on good terms...but these days perhaps he is busy so 'not much drama' ...<br><br>but seriously if u like him...go and talk to him....make him feel that his efforts are not wasted at all...if it is a golden opportunity...dont let it pass by.</div>

You can also go for short-term relationship if you don't mind, and both parties are agreeable to it.... But you must be able to take it more light heartedly as you've just been through a storm and is still on a mode of slow recovery?</div>
