            <div class='col-md body'>I think he's keeping his distance after your rebuff; he thinks you are not interested in him and is respecting your decision. Perhaps you can try to get your relationship back to the previous comfortable level so that he can probably regain his confidence and try asking you out for a date again.<br><br>How to do that I think you can try a more "stealthy" approach by being more friendly towards him, grab chance to talk and chat with him alone on personal issues/topics/life in general. Once the communication gets going, the mood between you and him gets more relaxed and tension from the first rebuff gets less. Then he may feel more confident about asking you out a 2nd time. At least let him know that you're not rebuffing and keeping away from him and you're open to approach.<br><br>However, if you're gutsy or confident enough, you as a girl can also ask him out on some pretext of discussing official business/work-related stuff, or simply ask him out outright. I don't think he'll look at you in any negative light and may even be delighted.</div>

Many a times, its not what we actually felt - rather, its the constant thinking that made us feel subconsciously we may have a small crush on that person.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <span class="large">THIS IS NOT LOVE NOR TRUE CHEMISTRY.</span><br><br>The avoidance is probably because of your confusion and inability to handle or conclude things in your mind. Together with the 'time pressure' you are having from his deadline (end of the month), all these factors adds up together and create a little burden in your emotions and mind.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Advice?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Don't assume; take steps understand and realise what is all this about. To simplest way is to supply hope - you can remain passive and let him chase you, but you must feed him with hope; his own source of motivation. Probably he has felt that you has no interest in him, therefore, he could have given up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Comment how nice this shirt is, smile, etc, so as to tell him (indirectly) that you ain't avoiding him because you ain't interested in him. Agree for a lunch together (or even initiate one for a start to get him his motivation coming) and be yourself. With the little time you have, it should be sufficient to keep his confidence coming. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Even if he has to leave the company - you have already lay the spell in him by then. Meanwhile, communicate and see how comfortable you are with him. Compatability of all kind (character-wise) very important - in simple words: TAKE your OWN time to know him. From there, you will know whether you have fallen for him and if he is suitable for you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

When you fall in love, it doesn't mean that he has to know every single thing about you to fall in love - he does because his emotions just flow unconsciously.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> When he is working with you - there are qualities in you that attracts him.

No matter if you both know each other well, the point is... Are you interested in him too? If your interest is there, no harm staying in contact with him so that both of you can get to know each other better..? No obligation or anything... Just knowing someone a bit better and stepping into a different part of life... Provided that you're psychologically perpared? Afterall, you must understand that this ain't a perfect world?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
