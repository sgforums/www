This is beyond what students can handle. Its a very severe case of jealousness. If your friend is afraid to do so, at least tell her parents and her parents can decide.<br><br>Personal "vengeance" or confrontation is ill-adviced. Who knows what that "stalker" might do next. For the safety and well being of your friend, I advice reporting it to the school. The school will handle. The police is the last resort.</div>

This use to be in my class, B is very quiet and from wat I seen she like very quiet and alone. She rarely mingled with our classmates. B also like to cry alot, whenever she though that the class mates are "bullying" her.  That does not happen! We are not secondary school kids anymore and we dun do that childish shit. Anyway B quit school.<br><br>My friend A, also from the same class go steady with this guy A. This guy A proposed to her first. When the stalker B get to hear that, she start to send angry SMS to my A friend. After that stalker, despite her innocent look, get her friends to wait for her where they beat her up unless she left the guy! Right now this stalker somehow get a girl (classmate) from my class (also very innocent looking) to spy for B. The stalker B will then email us "boasting" of her accomplishments and she also get to know every single little details of my friend A, including where she works, wat time she leave for home and even secretly followed her when my friend go to a birthday party!<br><br>However the guy A have some problems and soon breakup with my friend A. This does not stop the stalker B from harassing her. This mad gal B now and everytime send email to my friend, asking her to quit sch so the guy will not see her anymore and thus make no chance for em to patch up (cos they all same class).<br><br>The stalker B even get to hack my friend's email account, deleted all her emails. She also (incredibly) stole my friend's HP, then use it to call the guy tell him that my friend sucks and does not deserve to be with him, the stalker Balso take my friend's hp number and pass it to some other guy, telling him that my friend is horny, then the go send her dirty sms, but the guy A not only does not like her, but also hated B as well. Even so, the stalker continue to boast to my friend A in her email that she "drink coffee and watch movies" with guy A together! Haha...every now and then B continue to send harassing emails to my friend, she is now very depressed....wat should I do?</div></blockquote>Threats of physical assaults and stealing of her HP. Can she make complaint to the school authority?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>seriously, i think the girl B is so jealous over girl A that she becomes hysterical. i think you better inform the girl B parents if possible before any real trouble gets in. girl B then should be advised to go for counselling.</div>
