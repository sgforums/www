            <div class='col-md body'>The sad thing is that I find a lot of Malays to be really insular and unwilling to mix with the other races. They'll come up with things like 'Uggh... they eat pork leh... how can you mix around with them?'<br><br>Heck, a lot of the 'Mats' I know of regard me as a so-called 'traitor' to the Malay community just because I seem to get along with my Chinese friends well. Back in JC my Malay friends once scolded me for hanging around with my classmates (who were all Chinese). They'll ask me, 'Why are you hanging out with the Chinese? Why aren't you hanging out with us? We are your own kind!'<br><br>At which I'd retort to them: 'I go for lectures with them. I do my tutorials with them. I take tests with them. I study with them, and I slack with them. They ARE my own kind! Why aren't YOU hanging out with your own kind?!?!?!'<br><br>I'm glad to say that shut them up for a while.<br><br>Back to the topic... to faizal82, there's nothing wrong with you in wanting to go after a girl who's of a different race than you are. After all, we all have four limbs, two eyes, one nose and one mouth. That makes us all equal. What you're doing is wrong only if you listen to and believe in the intolerant bigots who think that their race is the greatest.<br><br>Relationships aren't easy, and it'll be harder still with a relationship that crosses boundaries of race and religion. But as I said, if the two of you are meant to be together, then love finds its way.<br><br>And if you do want to know, I'm mixed Indian and Malay. That ought to tell you something.</div>

When I said 'low grades', I was referring to literally poor academic performance (you know, poor grades in school), and not in the metaphorical sense of the word.<br><br>But I guess I also made the mistake of lumping it all together with what I said about crass behaviour.
