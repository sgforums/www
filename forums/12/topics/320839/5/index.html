              <p>I married him for 8 yrs. We had 2 beautiful kids. To everyone, I
              was the lucky girl to marry a handsome,charming hubby whose
              family is quite well to do. then the 2 children. A girl followed by
              a boy are making a lot of people envy. People like my neighbours
              are wondering.. a plain jane like me is so fortunate. life is good
              for me.</p>
              <p>No one knew we had an open relationship. He is indeed very
              charming as a friend , a boyfriend, a lover but not a hubby.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He loves to fling. Right from the start till now... it had been
              10 long years. I thought I could just close one eye to it. I
              conhabit with him, got pregnant then a shot gun marriage at early
              20s . Now I am coming to 30. I changed, he did not , he is still
              the same old guy whom I knew 10 yrs ago.  His list of flings
              became longer, cos new flings are always added to the list and the
              old list remained.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am surprised. Some flings are indeed challenging, some girls
              wanted to let me know that they are around, some girls just
              want to have the flings even accomodate to his needs and wants. He
              did not pay for them or pay for their living like some guys did.
              But the flings just love him. He got the charm to have the free
              fXXk.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am confused and tired. He wanted the family and also his
              flirting ways. I scared of the diseases that he may brought back to
              the family. He loves the excitement of meeting new girls. This
              is something I cant do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I love him till this moment but I dunno what I shld do.</p>
              <p>I am terrified of these girls. I am also scared of getting hurt
              somemore, 10 yrs is enough. I dun want to wait for him at home
              while he go out and fXXk those girls. This type of pain is really
              getting unbearable. I know some may tell me in this reality
              world which guy dun fling. Maybe there is really a minority of guys
              who are really faithful when they are in the relationship. I dun
              want to be a bitchy wife who fight with other woman over my hubby.
              If it belongs to u, it will be yours.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really dunno how to hold on to this relationship, he said he
              doesnt know how to love and what is love. So what am I doing in
              this relationship for the past 10 yrs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He say he was trapped to the marriage because of the baby.</p>
              <p>I wanted to return his freedom back to him, shld I ?</p>
              <p>There is a saying if you love somebody, you shld let him be
              happy.</p>
              <p>So if I returned his freedom to him, he will be happy  i
              suppose.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am a loser rite?</p>

              <p>which is a wife candidate that every guy dreams of and for that you should be proud of yourself for making it this far in a marriage despite a unfiathful husband..</p>
              <p>if you can't stand him..just file for divorce since u have the every right for him to do so..</p>
              <p>make sure u prepare ur kids for the divorce and have them grow up in a happy family at least with ur relatives and family members..</p>
              <p>i'm sure that your parents will support u if u tell them the truth..</p>
              <p>there's a saying "a leopard will never change it's spots''</p>
              <p>so if u are sick of his life..file for divorce..else it will be mentally stress for u to keep up the healthy image of a good family shouldering the bunden by yourself and keeping it away from your kids..</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>I think you are power to have endured 10 years of this. No woman will tolerate their guy cheating on them, much less for such a long time.</p>
              <p>I'm sorry to say that your guy may not change in the immediate future. It is very difficult for guys to change after a marriage, and even if he does, it takes some time for it to happen. But 10 years and still the same?</p>
              <p>Is your HB the type that can separate love and sex?</p>
              <p>Does he yearn for more sex, while his heart is still with the family?</p>
              <p>Does he advocate divorce often?</p>
              <p>Is the constant yearning for flings a mental sickness?</p>
              <p>Either way, if 1 party refuses counselling, it makes things worse because the other party is in the illusion of everything being fine.</p>
              <p>As for the freedom part, he has shown that he abuses his freedom, so what is he complaining about? Freedom and trust needs to be earned and built, but I tin your HB has managed to successfully destroy it completely.</p>
              <p>For the sake of your children, I hope you put up with it 1st and distract yourself with happier things. When the kids are old enough and independent, it is still not to late to call it quits.</p>

              <p>Hi delores,</p>
              <p>I'm extremely sorry to hear about your situation... there are already some very good advice, amid the usual initial naive, past-looking and blaming ones, already dished out by some people in this forum.</p>
              <p>Yunhaier brought up a good point about looking within yourself to see what you really need most. All major religions help us to do that. I think a good long term solution for you is to continually strive to search for good meaning in life and to seek inner peace and happiness, independent of the current predicament (Hey, even high-power executives need to do that).</p>
              <p>Now for your current situation:</p>
              <p>To sum up your husband: He lacks any sort of family responsibility, including that of a father, and barring a miracle, he isn't probably going to change, until he no longer has the option to, by the time which you probably won't care about it anyway.</p>
              <p>Someone previously mentioned counselling.. well, that is one potential solution, but he must play his part. If he doesn't see it as a problem "if it aint broke, don't fix it", then counselling is going to be useless.</p>
              <p>The majority of his self-worth may come from conquering all sorts of women (Edison Chen style), it may even be a sex addiction, and if he has no other source of intrinsic self-worth, it's impossible to try to change him.</p>
              <p>Not all male homo sapiens are like this, fortunately.</p>
              <p>I beg to differ on the stand from some of the well-meaning forumers here on staying in the marriage for the sake of the children.</p>
              <p>In my humble opinion, children benefit most from having happy and loving parents. They model after their parents in many ways. If their parent is negative, their outlook in life would be negative. Having said that, given the option of</p>
              <p>1) irresponsible father and perpetually sad mother</p>
              <p>2a) happy mother (assuming you get custody of the children)</p>
              <p>2b) happy mother and responsible step-father</p>
              <p>I think that while it may not seem obvious, 2 would be a better longterm solution. Who's proud of a philandering father anyway? Worse still, your children may think it's acceptable behaviour from a man to do that ("My dad sleeps around and my mum tolerates it, so that's okay")</p>
              <p>Of course, there's always the financial aspect of providing for the children, and you might feel you're taking away a materially comfortable life from them (holidays and all that), but if you believe in yourself, you can conquer all obstacles ahead of you.</p>
              <p>When the children grow up, they may either be grateful to you for being so sacrificial, or resent you for not having the courage of changing their lives when you can. It's a tough call..</p>
              <p>Divorce is seen by some as the end result, that is a failure to a marriage, but it is also seen by others as the first step to success in life and possible re-marriages. Everyone deserves a shot at happiness. Some need 1 shot, others need 2 or more.</p>
              <p>May you have the strength to do what you feel you need to do.</p>
              <p>Just one mention about those other women: What can you expect to come out of their mouths, while they know they are being condemned as "the other party"? They pretend not to care, because it is easier to be aloof than to be sensitive to judgement , and the easiest way to be aloof is to be fierce.</p>
              <p>Last of all, you sound like a good woman, and good potential wife material to many guys out there. It's just unfortunate that you are in a situation that can be described as "a stalk of flower stuck in a pile of cow dung"</p>
              <p>Take care!</p>

              <p>speaking from a christian context, you certainly are validated for divorce on grounds of infidelity.</p>
              <p>if your husband will not change his ways or see his irresponsible way of living life, divorce him, for the sake of your child.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>my cell group had a single mum, brought in by my friend, now they are happily married and having their 2nd child. he loves the first kid as his own, and the kid, when she first came in, was so lost, so scared, so lonely, now become so joyful and growing up into a fine child.</p>

              <p>I married him for 8 yrs. We had 2 beautiful kids. To everyone, I
              was the lucky girl to marry a handsome,charming hubby whose
              family is quite well to do. then the 2 children. A girl followed by
              a boy are making a lot of people envy. People like my neighbours
              are wondering.. a plain jane like me is so fortunate. life is good
              for me.</p>
              <p>No one knew we had an open relationship. He is indeed very
              charming as a friend , a boyfriend, a lover but not a hubby.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He loves to fling. Right from the start till now... it had been
              10 long years. I thought I could just close one eye to it. I
              conhabit with him, got pregnant then a shot gun marriage at early
              20s . Now I am coming to 30. I changed, he did not , he is still
              the same old guy whom I knew 10 yrs ago.  His list of flings
              became longer, cos new flings are always added to the list and the
              old list remained.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am surprised. Some flings are indeed challenging, some girls
              wanted to let me know that they are around, some girls just
              want to have the flings even accomodate to his needs and wants. He
              did not pay for them or pay for their living like some guys did.
              But the flings just love him. He got the charm to have the free
              fXXk.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am confused and tired. He wanted the family and also his
              flirting ways. I scared of the diseases that he may brought back to
              the family. He loves the excitement of meeting new girls. This
              is something I cant do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I love him till this moment but I dunno what I shld do.</p>
              <p>I am terrified of these girls. I am also scared of getting hurt
              somemore, 10 yrs is enough. I dun want to wait for him at home
              while he go out and fXXk those girls. This type of pain is really
              getting unbearable. I know some may tell me in this reality
              world which guy dun fling. Maybe there is really a minority of guys
              who are really faithful when they are in the relationship. I dun
              want to be a bitchy wife who fight with other woman over my hubby.
              If it belongs to u, it will be yours.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really dunno how to hold on to this relationship, he said he
              doesnt know how to love and what is love. So what am I doing in
              this relationship for the past 10 yrs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He say he was trapped to the marriage because of the baby.</p>
              <p>I wanted to return his freedom back to him, shld I ?</p>
              <p>There is a saying if you love somebody, you shld let him be
              happy.</p>
              <p>So if I returned his freedom to him, he will be happy  i
              suppose.</p>

              <p>Really not a gd husband. HE SAID HE WAS TRAPPED IN THE MARRIAGE BECAUSE OF THE BABY!!!!!</p>
              <p>What a jerk. Does he treat the baby like his child? The child was born from the love of u two. Does he regconise that? He should say he's trapped in the marriage.</p>
              <p>I find no point sticking to this kinda husband. What if someday he goes overboard, list gets longer and longer that he don't even know if u're Lucy,Mary or Jane (lolx old names).<br>Maybe like what some of us suggested, suck a portion of his money away to cope with the life after ur divorce. Seriously, he isn't giving his attention to the family... he's not only a husband but a father too. What will your children think about him if they someday, see him on the streets with another woman?</p>
              <p>We can't control womans to stay away from the person we love but we have a choice to stay with him anot. If he's rather be with someone else rather than u, rather than loving the children, accompany him, teach him things and give his fatherly love... then I think. It's time to let go.</p>
              <p>Maybe can give him a last warning or sth... tell him what's wrong with him, tell him he is wrong to have flings when he's already married, tell him it's not acceptable to say he's trapped in the marriage because of the baby. What kinda reason is tt?...</p>

              <p>IT's because the moment they made up their mind to be a Mother, they understands  the reason for self-sacrifice for the sake of their children and accept the life-time responsiblity of serving their children.</p>

So, she don't actually love him for him but his money and looks. But now after ten years and it starts to eats into her and she is getting tired, cry foul and want out. Why? Because she is getting older no more the young xiao mei mei. Her outlook has change. She decided love is just as important and want it now and since she has cream enough from the hubby and certainly going to cream some more waiting for a big settlement from the divorce procedure. If she get out of this marriage she might still likely to land herself again in a marriage of love now since she is still consider young. Twenty-eight nia. Otherwise she will spend the rest of her life rich but no love.</p>

              and since she has cream enough from the hubby and certainly
              going to cream some more waiting for a big settlement from the

              <p>First of all, I appauld your decision and courage to keep your child when you weren't married yet. However, I believe that you'd hoped the marriage will change him into a better man. Sad to say, it seldom worked this way. Suggesting an open relationship would have already told you that he wasn't prepared for the responsibility as a husband, let alone that of a parent.</p>
              <p>Look inside yourself, and you'll know why you're hesitating to leave him.</p>
              <p>Is it that you still love him?</p>
              <p>Is it the fear of losing the materialistic comfort you're enjoying?</p>
              <p>Is it the fear of finiancial difficulties and insecurity of raising the children on your own?</p>
              <p>Simply, if you do not love him anymore, it's time to leave him before its too late. Nearing 30 myself, I do understand the problems and uncertainty that the future holds.</p>
              <p>If you feel that the relationship can change for the better, do something about it! Try to communicate with him more, but do not suggest immediatedly that the current relationship needs to change. This often adds pressure and stress unnecessarily. Instead, go out with your friends, dress well, put on makeup, go on a healthy diet and appear attractive to him will make him proud. It is important to rekindle the fire that once brought you two together. Doing so will also increases your self-esteem and makes you a better person. Make an effort to go on romantic dates and social activities with him, but do not be desperate! Like most girls, guys do not like a desperate woman as well. Gradually, he'll find you more attractive and his attitude towards you will change. That is when you can really talk to him about the relationship and his commitment to his family.</p>
