            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I married him for 8 yrs. We had 2 beautiful kids. To everyone, I was the lucky girl to marry a handsome,charming hubby whose family is quite well to do. then the 2 children. A girl followed by a boy are making a lot of people envy. People like my neighbours are wondering.. a plain jane like me is so fortunate. life is good for me.</p>
              <p>No one knew we had an open relationship. He is indeed very charming as a friend , a boyfriend, a lover but not a hubby.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He loves to fling. Right from the start till now... it had been 10 long years. I thought I could just close one eye to it. I conhabit with him, got pregnant then a shot gun marriage at early 20s . Now I am coming to 30. I changed, he did not , he is still the same old guy whom I knew 10 yrs ago.  His list of flings became longer, cos new flings are always added to the list and the old list remained.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am surprised. Some flings are indeed challenging, some girls wanted to let me know that they are around, some girls just want to have the flings even accomodate to his needs and wants. He did not pay for them or pay for their living like some guys did. But the flings just love him. He got the charm to have the free fXXk.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am confused and tired. He wanted the family and also his flirting ways. I scared of the diseases that he may brought back to the family. He loves the excitement of meeting new girls. This is something I cant do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I love him till this moment but I dunno what I shld do.</p>
              <p>I am terrified of these girls. I am also scared of getting hurt somemore, 10 yrs is enough. I dun want to wait for him at home while he go out and fXXk those girls. This type of pain is really getting unbearable. I know some may tell me in this reality world which guy dun fling. Maybe there is really a minority of guys who are really faithful when they are in the relationship. I dun want to be a bitchy wife who fight with other woman over my hubby. If it belongs to u, it will be yours.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really dunno how to hold on to this relationship, he said he doesnt know how to love and what is love. So what am I doing in this relationship for the past 10 yrs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He say he was trapped to the marriage because of the baby.</p>
              <p>I wanted to return his freedom back to him, shld I ?</p>
              <p>There is a saying if you love somebody, you shld let him be happy.</p>
              <p>So if I returned his freedom to him, he will be happy  i suppose.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am a loser rite?</p>

              <p>3. When the girls call, be very nice to them.. let them know you are his wife, and you are aware of what they are doing, best yet.. address them by their name. Let them know you are very thankful of them for providing the service to your hubby.</p>

                  flirting ways. I scared of the diseases that he may brought back to
                  the family. He loves the excitement of meeting new girls. This
                  is something I cant do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I love him till this moment but I dunno what I shld do.</p>
              <p>I am terrified of these girls. I am also scared of getting hurt
                  somemore, 10 yrs is enough. I dun want to wait for him at home
                  while he go out and fXXk those girls. This type of pain is really
                  getting unbearable. I know some may tell me in this reality
                  world which guy dun fling. Maybe there is really a minority of guys
                  who are really faithful when they are in the relationship. I dun
                  want to be a bitchy wife who fight with other woman over my hubby.
                  If it belongs to u, it will be yours.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really dunno how to hold on to this relationship, he said he
                  doesnt know how to love and what is love. So what am I doing in
                  this relationship for the past 10 yrs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He say he was trapped to the marriage because of the baby.</p>
              <p>I wanted to return his freedom back to him, shld I ?</p>
              <p>There is a saying if you love somebody, you shld let him be
                  happy.</p>
              <p>So if I returned his freedom to him, he will be happy  i
                  suppose.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Really depends on what you want out of marriage. What kind of woman you are or want to be. Got to ask yourself that question.</p>
              <p>If you're the type who can overlook his whoring ways and say what the hell, they're fucking him but I'm the one he married, then stay on.</p>
              <p>If you know very well that you cannot give him the thrill of casual intimacy. What he throws around, you don't need. What you want, he cannot give, then walk away.</p>
              <p>Relationships and marriage don't have to be difficult and tumultuous in order to work.</p>

              <p>I married him for 8 yrs. We had 2 beautiful kids. To everyone, I
                          was the lucky girl to marry a handsome,charming hubby whose
                          family is quite well to do. then the 2 children. A girl followed by
                          a boy are making a lot of people envy. People like my neighbours
                          are wondering.. a plain jane like me is so fortunate. life is good
                          for me.</p>
              <p>No one knew we had an open relationship. He is indeed very
                          charming as a friend , a boyfriend, a lover but not a hubby.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He loves to fling. Right from the start till now... it had been
                          10 long years. I thought I could just close one eye to it. I
                          conhabit with him, got pregnant then a shot gun marriage at early
                          20s . Now I am coming to 30. I changed, he did not , he is still
                          the same old guy whom I knew 10 yrs ago.  His list of flings
                          became longer, cos new flings are always added to the list and the
                          old list remained.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am surprised. Some flings are indeed challenging, some girls
                          wanted to let me know that they are around, some girls just
                          want to have the flings even accomodate to his needs and wants. He
                          did not pay for them or pay for their living like some guys did.
                          But the flings just love him. He got the charm to have the free
                          fXXk.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am confused and tired. He wanted the family and also his
                          flirting ways. I scared of the diseases that he may brought back to
                          the family. He loves the excitement of meeting new girls. This
                          is something I cant do.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I am terrified of these girls. I am also scared of getting hurt

              <p><strong>You have an issue of low self esteem which unfortunately stinks to the high heavens.</strong> First of all , you shouldn't let everyone let you think you are the lucky woman. HE IS THE LUCKY BOY who has a woman who tolerated all his sh*t. You let him have his way and now he is playing a guilt trip on you.</p>
              <p>Woman, put your foot down. No one is a plain jane unless they think they are and worse of all it shows. Keep telling yourself that you are beautiful and he is the loser who choses to endanger his family.</p>
              <p>Now you need friends to help out with your confidence . If it is about your physical appearance -<strong> fix it to FEEL BETTER ABOUT YOURSELF </strong>( REMEMBER DO IT ONLY FOR YOURSELF , NOT the loser)  but don't go to the extent of a plastic surgeon. Second of all, learn to be assertive yet non offensive. Diplomacy goes a long way with that guy and he is probably one who will make you go on a guilt trip.</p>
              <p>Third, if he chooses to have his flings and you are planning to leave him/stay with him, put your foot down and lay out the rules with him. These are the rules that I suggest:</p>
              <p><strong>No sex for him if he wants to continue screwing other women because he doesn't want the mother of his children infected with something. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>No kissing/sharing food/sharing drinks with  his children. Epstein barr viruses (glandular fever), influenza, viral gastro , common colds certain forms of meningitis and cold sores  (herpes simplex) spread this way.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Take a STD test every 3 months AND show you the results. </strong></p>
              <p>If he chooses not to obey these rules, he can go screw himself because he is putting others at risk just for the sake of his own fun. <strong>If he truly loves his family, he will do anything to protect them. If not , you have to consider other options.</strong></p>
              <p>If he starts crapping about you trapping him into marriage to get you to overturn those rules, this will be your response : <strong>if not for the children , I would have walked away from you now. I am doing this for my children now , not you. If there is any consolation about you being trapped, I am the one who is worse off than you are by sacrificing ALL my needs to ensure that OUR children are safe and healthy.</strong></p>
              <p>Remember that it takes two hands to clap and one hand to slap. He made a decision to marry you. He could have asked you to consider an abortion or walked away from it all. He chose to go ahead. Both of you had sex , unless you have cut a hole in the condom or something, he cannot say that you TRAPPED him.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>To thehappybunny, caleb_chiang</p>
              <p>this is a method, but in this relationship.... my heart havent died yet. no heart to break up the family ... i dun suffer.... my kids do. one day maybe when my heart is dead , this is one of the options.  I really dun hope that to come</p>
              <p>I came from a divorce family, I hated it when the teacher in class asked me...every yr when they ask personal details at the beginning of each yr. Then it become a topic .u need to explain every yr</p>
              <p> "" why huh... the birth cert mother name and now ur mother column got different. ""</p>
              <p>or why guardian not mother....</p>
              <p>It is always the fault of the adults and the kids suffered.  In a divorce, both parties think that they are miserable so the best way is to divorce return each other's freedom and then be happy.</p>
              <p>It's a nitemare for the children, it not their fault why they had to suffered. ....</p>
              <p>Single parents</p>
              <p>new mummy or daddy</p>
              <p>new siblings</p>
              <p>new stares and why is my family like that.</p>
              <p>Our love for our own children is different ... like our fingers ... it not the same height</p>
              <p>some may tell me each of ur own natural kid got a even fair share of ur love.  how u know.. did u ever ask the kid?</p>
              <p>how much love can you give to a child borne by another woman or man  which u need to treat as ur own and  u got your own too.</p>
              <p>u cane them, people say u cruel step parents</p>
              <p>u dun cane them. people say u pamper and dun teach them ... because let them be useless and rotten.</p>
              <p>It is really unfair to my kids. say that i think too much .........</p>
              <p>I dun want them to go through what I have been through.</p>

              <p>He thinks flings are okie.</p>
              <p>as long as he dun bring them home and of cos no offsprings from them and every nite he come home to sleep.</p>
              <p>He thinks it is norm.</p>
              <p>There is a question column from a chinese paper... the woman ask a question why a divorcee can become a marriage counsellor .</p>
              <p>she brought her hubby for counselling ... end up divorcing faster because.. the hubby and the marriage counsellor got involved with each other. </p>

              <p>1 . divorce ... then move out find a place.</p>
              <p><em>Why bother moving out ? You'd be on your own anyway.. and you cannot leverage on his family to help you with the kids. One less sets of hands for some freedom you already have... not a very calculated move.<br></em></p>
              <p><em>Stay together and just treat him like a room mate lor.</em></p>
              <p>2. <em>What for divorce ? Just go enjoy your life lah. Make yourself look good, sign up a spa membership, get some cosmetic surgery,  go travelling and not have to worry about work.</em></p>
              <p><em>Pick up more certification... enrich your life.</em></p>
              <p>3.and wait idiotly for his  c**k to soften down and

                  it is time for ur revenge then ?</p>
              <p><em>Horrr horrr horrr.... this is really wicked ..hehehehhe... every woman's ultimate revenge !!!! I'm surprised you didn't club him into a coma while he's sleeping. You are really too kind .</em></p>
              <p>Anyway.. what ever the dad did... try not to influence the children too much, as it will affect their emotional well being.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Children are very sensitive beings.. they become anti-social when their little minds are bogged down with their parent's marital problem.</p>
              <p>So let them have a carefree childhood. In time , they will understand. You've been through it yourself.. so you know what it's like.</p>
