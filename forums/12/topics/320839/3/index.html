              <p>TS. since he is that way, you can do the same thing.</p>
              <p>He says that he doesnt know love. Have flings and see if he's mad, angry etc.</p>
              <p>If he's not, then do whatever you want.</p>
              <p>My 2nd suggestion is that you can leave him, take the children with you. He claimed that he doenst know what is love, definitely the judge wont give the children to a man who cant love. Get my point?</p>
              <p>No money? Get a lum sum from him. Since you'll get full custody, he'll pay you a huge amount of money. No worries. No point of stressing yourself for such a person.</p>

              <p>The women are desperate to steal your man, that is why they hurl abuses at you. You should pity them, because they cannot find other betta men.</p>
              <p>You say you have 2 kids. Ask yourself why your hubby didn't just stop at one ?</p>
              <p>Because he knows you are a good mother and you are a good wife.</p>

              <p>Dear Delores,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You must be strong, dun let we sg gal down, if you think you are on the right as mother and wife status, you should not let other scold you and destroy your family. No doubt, those women are to be blame, but the biggest person responsible is still you damn husband, if he dun flirt, no women will come to him. And if you cannot control you husband, you are skilful enough. Be it a young mistake or whatever, you choose your man, you trusted him, you believe you can be with him forever till old age and death, but it seem that all is shattered now. There is nobody actually to blame other than marrying the wrong guy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand, if you are daring enough, at 28, you still consider young mature and good looking, go flirt with men you like, and see the response from you husband. As the saying goes, you cannot beat him, join him lor, go flirt and enjoy life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If still cannot do it or get over it, i can call my 666 gangs down and give him a big bash up and make sure he come crawling and kneel in front of you to seek forgiveness.</p>

              <p>Hi Delores,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not sure about all the 'pride of these and that'...there are times when pride cannot be put on the table for consideration.Why? Cos pride in this case is a zero sum game.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For your case, there are 2 categories of pride: pride as an individual woman and pride as a mother. If you fight for your individual pride, you lose others. In your case, you will lose your family if you walk out to try to regain your pride. your children/parents/in-laws will question why dun you stay with them. I'm not sure if they will understand now, tomorrow, in the future.</p>
              <p>Most young people will opt for this cause they have nothing to lose; and able to start all over again. But can you really start all over again with your kids around?</p>
              <p>If you take the 'mother's pride' route, you will keep the family intact. Your pride as a mother who sacrifices will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">increase</span>. Your children will be grateful, your parents and in-laws will be grateful, and if your husband is still around when your kids are all grown up, he will also be grateful!</p>
              <p>Think about it. We are not about upmanship here. We are about welfare of yourself, your family and children.</p>
              <p>Whatever your decision, you won't be the first to experience. Neither will you be the last. But there is one decision that you will gain more. Can you see it?</p>
              <p>As for seeing another guy. If you are doing it for revenge, than I must say you are childish. But if you are doing it cos you need it metally, biologically and physically, then that's another story.</p>
              <p>I think your past decisions were influenced by your parents. Think how your action today will affect your children next time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, we are all hiding behind our nick and we are not accountable for our words. You need to find real support from your familiy and friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck : )</p>

              <p><strong>If you take the 'mother's pride' route, you will keep the family intact. Your pride as a mother who sacrifices will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">increase</span>. Your children will be grateful, your parents and in-laws will be grateful</strong>, and if your husband is still around when your kids are all grown up, he will also be grateful!</p>
              <p>Think about it. We are not about upmanship here. We are about welfare of yourself, your family and children.</p>
              <p>Whatever your decision, you won't be the first to experience. Neither will you be the last. But there is one decision that you will gain more. Can you see it?</p>
              <p>As for seeing another guy. If you are doing it for revenge, than I must say you are childish. But if you are doing it cos you need it metally, biologically and physically, then that's another story.</p>
              <p>I think your past decisions were influenced by your parents. Think how your action today will affect your children next time.</p>
              <p>Lastly, we are all hiding behind our nick and we are not accountable for our words. You need to find real support from your familiy and friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck :</p>

              <p>you're tooo faithful, too kind. Tolerating makes things worse. Try to communicate with him, and does his parents know about all these? I know its hard to let him go because it's a fact that you love him more than he loves you.</p>
              <p>But if you were to divorce you husband, make sure you are able to provide the kids all they need. I can tell you that the kids will be broken of course 'cause i'm one kid who grew up in a broken family since i was 4.</p>
              <p>I'm sure your kids will understand one day and support you when they are mature enough to know more about their father's misdeed. I support my mom for what she did<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> and i really hate my dad till now. It's better to let your kids know that they have a faithful and good mom rather than a flirtatious dad.</p>

              <p>Why do you even let them hurl abuse at you? Why does your husband even allow his flings to hurl abuse at you? That is one red flag for you , honey.</p>
              <p>My grandfather had 2 wives ( in those old days) . The eldest wife was allowed to hurl abuse at the second because she is the principal wife. If you want to allow your husband his freaking harem, start acting like a principal wife. You are married to the man , not them . They are the ones at fault, not you. Why are you allowing yourself to cop abuse from those <em>type</em> of women?</p>

              <p>Dear Delores,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You must be strong, dun let we sg gal down, if you think you are
              on the right as mother and wife status, you should not let other
              scold you and destroy your family. No doubt, those women are to be
              blame, but the biggest person responsible is still you damn
              husband, if he dun flirt, no women will come to him. And if you
              cannot control you husband, you are skilful enough. Be it a young
              mistake or whatever, you choose your man, you trusted him, you
              believe you can be with him forever till old age and death, but it
              seem that all is shattered now. There is nobody actually to blame
              other than marrying the wrong guy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand, if you are daring enough, at 28, you still
              consider young mature and good looking, go flirt with men you
              like, and see the response from you husband. As the saying goes,
              you cannot beat him, join him lor, go flirt and enjoy life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If still cannot do it or get over it, i can call my 666 gangs
              down and give him a big bash up and make sure he come crawling and
              kneel in front of you to seek forgiveness.</p>

              <p>Hi Delores,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it is half truth when you think you must have done something right to keep him for 10 years, therefore it makes sense to continue doing it. You have been doing the same thing for 10 years, you yield the same results.</p>
              <p>As for why he has open relationships and blabs to you about it, I can think of only one reason, there is no love in the marriage. Tough nut to swallow but it happens to be the truth. So what options are you considering now? There are no options. Options means choices but what choice have you got? Leave him? For what? The man is already gone. You are the one beating yourself with a stick here.</p>
              <p>If you cannot stand up for yourself, no one else is going to respect you for who you are. Certainly not him.</p>
              <p>And I'll always wonder why couples insist on keeping a marriage for the sake of the kids. It is far more traumatising for them to grow up under the care of very unhappy parents who live unfulfilling lives.</p>

              <p>this three mths... I used up the amount of tears I used in 10yrs.</p>
              <p>I am 28 tis yr. I did think through why I married him in the first place. I conhabit with him for 2-3 yrs before I get married to him</p>
              <p>I am married for 8yrs. So actually I got 3 yrs to think and commit to this marriage. but at that time , what I only want is a family , a family and a baby that I called my own. I dun think this is materialistic. I agreed, His family is wealthy and I threw away the self- respect of a woman to gain these. but dun the adults taught us to fight for what we want..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At 17 , I met a guy who is handsome, charming, doesnt have any tendency of being violent , have a job , family well to do .</p>
              <p>He doesnt treat you badly and he gives in to you .pamper you.</p>
              <p>Since at that time, I thought that girls eventually get married, this man appeared. will I find a guy who I had to suffered with him over the next meal-</p>
              <p>è´«è´±å¤«å¦»ç™¾äº‹å“€</p>
              <p>or a guy who at least can provide me with a comfortable life whom I do not need to worry about the next meal.</p>
              <p>I dun buy Lv , or other branded stuff. I dun buy diamonds or a lot of money stashed under my pillows.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You see... I thought when guys mature, they will change. I am waiting but he did not.</p>

              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi Delores,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it is half truth when you think you must have done something
              right to keep him for 10 years, therefore it makes sense to
              continue doing it. You have been doing the same thing for 10 years,
              you yield the same results.</p>
              <p>As for why he has open relationships and blabs to you about it,
              I can think of only one reason, there is no love in the marriage.
              Tough nut to swallow but it happens to be the truth. So what
              options are you considering now? There are no options. Options
              means choices but what choice have you got? Leave him? For what?
              The man is already gone. You are the one beating yourself with a
              stick here.</p>
              <p>If you cannot stand up for yourself, no one else is going to
              respect you for who you are. Certainly not him.</p>
              <p>And I'll always wonder why couples insist on keeping a marriage
              for the sake of the kids. It is far more traumatising for them to
              grow up under the care of very unhappy parents who live
              unfulfilling lives.</p>

              <p>2nd that.  I was told this when I ran into troubles:</p>
              <p>Sometimes we must make that daring step forward, for ourselves (regardless of the people around us) instead of continue on with what we do not want/unhappy about. So just to know that there are better things out there, perhaps there is some initial struggle and issue, but its always better to live for oneself.</p>
              <p>Let me put it this way, looking at you Delores. I know you live in your own closed up world for a long time. It take courage to step out. It takes courage to recognise you are more than just a mom and someone's wife. It takes courage to recognize that you are a worthy person and your children are taking all that in as example. Do not ever give up living for yourself even for your children because they have to live on their own.</p>

              <p>Just to share this story with you, it actually happened to my cousin's classmate cum best friend and she is waiting for divorce.  She is in her early 30s with 2 sons living with his-in-law. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't really know how long she had been married, but should be quite young when she got marrried.  I happened to check into a local hotel with my family 3 weeks ago while she was on duty and she contacted my anuty whom she regarded as half mum.  She related that during the last 4 years, her hubby has been away in China busy on business trip and work only sending $$ back as allowance for his parents and living with his girl friend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You see, she discovered he had an affair and then subsequently, even seeing that woman around and her hubby even made it open about that relationship.  Worse, his parents who are staying with her are aware of his son's affair but only revealed later and told her they are treating her like a step daughter.  This happened when she confronted his parents because she found them behaving extremely nice to her of late out of the blue...only to discover the disheartening news.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now already 4 years, she had given up hope and even found herself a boyfriend who knows her condition and pain she had gone through and even advised and encourages her, her course of action and she is now waiting for divorce letter to be signed.  Problem is, her hubby is still in China, just that both party has agreed to signing the paper...</p>

              <p>And I think TS refuse to ask for divorce is simply afraid of losing her waterface. She is afraid society will gossips. Worse, enemies of the old will laugh behind her back for her failed marriage.</p>
