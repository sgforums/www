              <p>Hmmm ... I wanted to ask , if you have a gf and you have a very close neighbour . And when your neighbour saw you and your gf at your house downstairs and your neighbour didn't say hi to your gf . Is it consider rude ?</p>
              <p>Because there's this friend of mine , she has a bf . She told me that her bf has a very close neighbour. And she dislike his neighbour because his neighbour is rude. It is also a form of basic courtsey to greet someone when you saw right ? And when she questioned her bf why her neighbour is so unfriendly that whenever she saw her she didn't greet her. And her bf told her , maybe she forget ? As in , she is not close to you and why she needs to greet you ? After i heard this , i told her basically its all crap. She felt that her bf is just like his neighbour's dog. Not once but alot of times when his neighbour asked help from him , he is damn willing to help.Like asking him to fix laptop , and when my friend and his bf going out , she(the neighbour) called asking him to buy dinner for her. And when she(the neighbour) is changing new cardboard she is scared, she(the neighbour) asked my friend's  bf to accompany her. And helping her soooooo many times , when my friend's bf invited her to go to his birthday , she didn't even turned up. Crap isn't it ? </p>
              <p> And he told his gf , he and his neighbour is under one roof , if he don't help her who will? And she repiled , so you like to help people without getting anything in return uh?</p>
              <p>So ya , wanted to know how you all feel about this. </p>
