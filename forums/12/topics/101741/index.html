            <div class='col-md body'>Learn to accept reality and survive it. What you experience is quite common in many companies. So, moving on may not solve your problem. Having said this, however, does not mean that you should not move on. There are more friendly companies out there, but it may be a long search. Can you afford the search? This depends on your financial needs as well as your patience and job interest.<br><br>For a lot of people, they just accept life as it is. For some, they job hop each time they reach a point where they cannot take it anymore. I have a number of friends who change job every so often. But most important of all, learn to relax even when everything is falling apart. At the worst, you get sacked or the company folds up.</div>
