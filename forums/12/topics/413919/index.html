              Just a few months ago, I somehow met this girl during a cca.she look kinda of sweet and have the girl-next-door look.We did not talk much but still we knew each other as someone that we met during cca.
              
              It was a trial event so I did not take part of the event seriously.At that time, my mind was occupy with another girl, so I did not really care much about her. To be serious, I even forget her name. 
              
              After the event, we met a few time in campus but we only say something like hi or hello that all.After seeing her for a few time, I sort of regret not getting her contact or something. I even felt stupid for forgetting  her name.
              
              During the holidays, I  had fear that she may forgotten me and had thought hard how to find her. As the new semester start, I wanted to meet her again but still helpless about it. What should I do about it......?
