Deep inside me, I still miss her and all, and am willing to change just so that I can be with her.<br><br>Recently, just on Wednesday, I went to Suntec to shop for X'mas gifts for my friends, and as I was returning, passed by this shop at CityLink selling notebooks etc. Went in, and after spending 1/2 hr in the shop, chose to buy my ex a diary/planner for 2006 as an X'mas gift. Went home hopping that she would accept it, wrapped it all up nicely and all.<br><br>Passed it to my friend to ask her to help me pass to my ex. Later in the day, my friend smsed me, saying that my ex have accepted it and have got me sumthing as well. I was obviously delighted, not because I'm a step closer to reconcilation or anything.But at least this shows that we can still be friends.<br><br>So today, I arranged to meet with my friend at Novena Square's Spinelli. My friend came and handed me the gift,I opened the wrapping and my mind went blank.She had taken two pieces of wood from her school's workshop and sandwiched the diary/planner I gave her and re-wrapped the whole thing with another wrapping paper and asked my friend to passed it to me.<br><br>My heart was totally torned up. How is it that someone, whom you know for 6yrs and whom you have been in a relationship with for 2.5yrs do this to you?Someone please help me...I just feel like crying, but i can't bring myself to. I'm really really torned up.</div></blockquote>I got a few things which I feel I should point out.<br><br>1) Do you know that by returning the gift to you is already a very kind act?<br>I have seen people gifts smash into pieces in front of them and the gal scolded the guy in front of crowd. Trust me man you have not seen the worst thing a gal can do.<br><br>She at least try to wrap it up nicely for you and return it back. Others just hack care and throw it away on the spot.<br><br>2) Grow up lar this is your first gf only ma. Like that cannot stand liao. Have seen people who put in far more effort , time and love then you and still kena rejected too..<br><br>3) We live in a real world where money is important. If your gf is that pure and strong willed person she will never look down on you. But sadly it seems like she cannot take the temptation which is not wrong, I mean who can? Who will not want to be living comfortably enjoy life. If you are her, I am very sure you will chose the same path.<br><br>4) I am a bit puzzle after so many posting you have not even mention why you had broken up? You have only say how bad she become but it seems like is a one sided story. What lead to the break up? Are you sure she is the only one at fault.<br><br>5) Stop saying her friends is using you to buy things at staff price. They have never force you and you are a willing party. Why complain and blame others only when your relationship is over ?<br><br>Stop living in a fantasy world where people who are kind and sweet will not change. Thats life and it makes each person unqiue. She have already chosen the path to leave you and you cannot do anything about it.<br><br>The ball is in your court now. You can complain on and on or grow up and be more mature.<br><br>my suggestion on how to tackle your problem.<br><br>a) First thank her for returning your gift and say that it was kind of her to return it so nicely.<br><br>b) Pass the massge to her through your friend that you understand her intentions for the break up and is willing to accept it gracefully.<br><br>c) next thank her for the good times you and her had but is time for you to let go.<br><br>d) Next go out with friends and enjoy life. You are born alone why should you be tie down by a gal who does not love you at all? Instead go out to the real world and experience life.<br><br>Take care and have fun.</div>

If your gf is that pure and strong willed person she will never look down on you. But sadly it seems like she cannot take the temptation which is not wrong, I mean who can? Who will not want to be living comfortably enjoy life. If you are her, I am very sure you will chose the same path.<br><br>4) I am a bit puzzle after so many posting you have not even mention why you had broken up? You have only say how bad she become but it seems like is a one sided story. What lead to the break up? Are you sure she is the only one at fault.<br><br>5) Stop saying her friends is using you to buy things at staff price. They have never force you and you are a willing party. Why complain and blame others only when your relationship is over ?<br><br>Stop living in a fantasy world where people who are kind and sweet will not change. Thats life and it makes each person unqiue. She have already chosen the path to leave you and you cannot do anything about it.<br><br>The ball is in your court now. You can complain on and on or grow up and be more mature.<br><br>my suggestion on how to tackle your problem.<br><br>a) First thank her for returning your gift and say that it was kind of her to return it so nicely.<br><br>b) Pass the massge to her through your friend that you understand her intentions for the break up and is willing to accept it gracefully.<br><br>c) next thank her for the good times you and her had but is time for you to let go.<br><br>d) Next go out with friends and enjoy life. You are born alone why should you be tie down by a gal who does not love you at all? Instead go out to the real world and experience life.<br><br>Take care and have fun.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No doubt it takes two hands to clap, but the only thing which I felt I've wronged is that I neglected her when I work. She complains about it, but no reasoning works, imagine this, she likes those ex. stuff, I work so as to give her the material means.She complains that we are unlike other young couples, can go out on weekends as I'm working.So I took off, 2 weekends, and she told me that her parents don't allow her to go out on weekends, how siah? On top of that, at the age of 18, she has a curfew of 1800hrs, how is it possible to go out on weekdays even when I want to when we end class at like 1600hrs in the afternoon?<br><br>She once told me that she admires guys who work, but earn little, yet can give their girlfriends the world, how is that possible? I mean, she wants material stuff, but don't want me to earn alot. Don't make sense doesn't it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha honestly as a girl I am just as puzzled as you are how come some of my gender expects the guy to be there for her 24/7. Yet in other cases it's the girl who is at the beck and call and control of the guy, who goes around being the social butterfly. Sad to say, some of us are just like that. When we realise the influence of material things, things change. I agree with points 2 and 3 posted by drx.<br><br>You know what's the problem with all these relationships nowadays? We keep looking for love, and long-lasting love, that we have in our minds a type of lifestyle that marriage provides. Financial stability, a car to drive around and romance to keep the girl happy. But at this age guys are not financially stable enough to provide all these, yet the girl expects it. That is when all the conflicts and complaints about not spending enough time with each other comes about. If you are really busy, your partner should be reasonable enough to understand. So I believe that to meet up to te expectations of a 'girl like that', you have to wait until you settle your own life first. Stand on your own two feet strongly first man! But it is totally alright to vent. A guy who I was very close with nearly got ran over by a car cuz he was skating recklessly on the road after I told him I wasn't mature enough to handle a relationship. I felt so bad, but no matter how bad I felt, I still gave him the cold shoulder becuz I didn't wanna hurt him even more by leading him on. And he has since forgotten about everything and we are still close friends. (Don't worry I know he has gotten over it cuz i recognise the signs.)<br><br>So give yourself a new beginning. I believe you are stronger than that, and the fact that you came here to seek solace shows that you wish to get out of this misery right. The hardest but most effective thing to do is let go. Gambate!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bro,<br><br>Forget about her. Girls are like that one. When they want to break up with you especially when they got another person with her or they really tired with you, that is what they will do.<br><br>To them, break means break and they really dont want to have anything else involving with you, not even taking your gift. Actually she is quite steady, I've seen some break already still accepting their ex gift and even asking for something else. That will give their ex a false hope that he still have the chance with her.<br><br>So to conclude, move on with your life and find a better girl than her. Cheers..</div>
