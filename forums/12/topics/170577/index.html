Went home hopping that she would accept it, wrapped it all up nicely and all.<br><br>Passed it to my friend to ask her to help me pass to my ex.

My friend came and handed me the gift,I opened the wrapping and my mind went blank.She had taken two pieces of wood from her school's workshop and sandwiched the diary/planner I gave her and re-wrapped the whole thing with another wrapping paper and asked my friend to passed it to me.<br><br>My heart was totally torned up.
