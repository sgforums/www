            <div class='col-md body'>I think I'm a big failure when it comes to human relationships. Even after my 4 year education in secondary school, I've managed to make only 2 really very good friends. But even, during the holidays, I find it hard to pass the time becoz there's no one to spend it with, and even if I do go out, it would be alone most of the time. 1 of these 2 friends is grounded while the other doesn't seem to want to spend time with me anymore. I do have other friends, but they don't seem to be around all the time. I think I'm a real lonely person, and right now I'm feeling all sad and pathetic. It has something to do with my character or something: I'm not too open about my feelings etc, too sensitive etc. So at the end of the day, I find myself alone. Hoping to find myself a new life when I get into JC. Any comments or advice? Otherwise, thanks for listening. =)</div>

This will still improve your relationship with your friends at least. No matter what, it's better than keeping to yourself and being lonely.<br><br>I was like you and possibly still like you; I was reluctant to go out because I've low self-esteem and not much confidence in myself and I get totally freaked out in front of the opposite sex. But as you go out more, I got better and I'm not so averse to going out anymore. Although I'm still not so comfortable in large group and prefer to talk with 1 or 2 close friends but that's an improvement after all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi there honggggg, long time no hear from u..<br><br>Hmm.. I understand what you are going through. having no friends to go out means being bored in ur case I suppose.. But ever tried going something else on ur own?? maybe just do things that u wanted to do all this while, but never had the chance becoz of ur studies and other commitments. Well, u said that u r the reserved type.. so does it mean that things like decorating a photo album or, piecing a puzzle amuse you?? These are things that will take time and effort. and will make u proud of wat u haf done. For instance, decorating a photo album for ur frens, stating how the friendship with this fren or that. I mean even if it's just some small neo prints they are worth the effort, becoz most importantly, they are the ones whom u consider as good pals before. Moreover, u can also do some social work to help past time if u need.<br><br>And one more thing.. I dun think u are anti social. and u dun haf a low self esteem. U think u r antisocial becoz u dun have much friends. But hey no manz.. that's not wat u call antisocial. U have posted things here on this forum. U have helped pple here on this forum. that does not make u one. it's just becoz like wat [SSF]Legion said. u just can't get along with all the pple ard u only. That wun make u antisocial. U select ur frens carefully, u consider the character of ur frens. that's being good. that means u think before u move.. that's the correct way in life rather than just accepting all the pple ard u and learn the wrong things.<br><br>And u dun haf a low self-esteem too. I'm sure of that.. it's just that u r bored at the moment and u get hindered by it, or maybe there are some other things that u r troubled with that makes u feel this way. If I were to put u together wif ur the two good friends I think u will be all well alive.. well... it's just who u r wif and where u r. For instance, if u studies are not that good, and I were to put u in a top school. U will feel terrible too. but is that u? no manz. U have ur sthenghs to be proud of. this is u. something no other pple can take over, or resemble u. Maybe just that u have not discovered. and if u have found out wat they are and use more of it, u will have more self-confidence. that's how u build ur self esteem.. relax u are a fine young girl.. u are not inferior from any one of us overall. We are all the same. just that we are better in a different way...<br>Smilez...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

Nothing is wrong with shy and antisocial, it's juz that u r not used to  it, mayb when u come out to work, you will think and behave differently.  Trust me, one will not be shy forever.  Of course u must make an effort yourself to go out more with others and if u really need a friend to chat to, ICQ me or email me, but pls identify yourself or else I won't authorize u loh<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"...I think we're all lonely. I think that's the human condition. I think we all feel loneliness, but I'm not afraid of it and I'm not afraid of being alone. I see the suffering of feeling lonely. I have felt loneliness; I've felt lonely with people and without them. But I've only grown from it, learned from it. The negative impact has disappeared for me in the face of all the positive things I've learned. I find that when you get upset by loneliness or you feel like crying or you get that painful feeling, it isn't a bad thing. I just look at it as feelings." Amy Ray</div>

Well, the initial step will always be hard. but as time takes it's place friends fill you life and heart with fun and memories. Especially now that u r still young, it's good for u to know more pple. after that u have a wider selection of pple to choose from. Even then wif more frenz, u will get more help, and u will have another kind of life. which will satisfy another kind of ur emotional needs.<br><br>sometimes u just have to make the extra effort to make pple to feel closer to u. It's like giving and taking, u give a little bit more info about urself, pple will also do the same. If u really leave things as it is, it's hard to be sure that someone will understand you, hence it will be harder for u to find a close friend. think u know wat I mean...<br><br>And finally, we are all friends here. we will share ur happiness... divide your sorrowz... comfort u...

Once again, thanks.</div></blockquote>hey, which JC u going to? mebbe we going same jc, den we could be frenz....<br><br>newae, i think thou' pple ard us all seem to have very close frenz whom they can share everything with, but sometimes, one does need private moments with oneself.......notice alot of the people who posted in this topic said they are lonely, so am i, but i think u can really find something to occupy/take away the loneliness. frenz can't really fill in the emptiness all the time.........<br>alot has to do with urself, and how u actually try to find things to occupy urself lo.........<br><br>anywayz, to tell the truth, 4 yrs in sec sch, i too have yet to find a real true fren......amongst those whom i'm always seen ard with, i can only say they are like mere acquaintances who just happened to cross my path. sad to say lo, but i dun have any real close frenz.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>honggggg &amp; djmemo:<br>Glad to see a tinge of positive attitude from the two of you. Well, expand ur social life that's wat u need... u may find it hard maybe a good fren among 10 u make, or among 20 or even 30. But this good fren will be true fren. If u dun mixed wif the 30 pple how are u going to find the good fren?? U dun strike lottery everyday... anyway nothing wrong wif having more frens, even they may not be that close, but somehow someday, they may need ur help and u will need theirs. Life is strange esp how it entangles our life.<br><br>honggggg &amp; t|red:<br>Bet you will make some good friends in JC. Well, it's another new start so make good of it.
