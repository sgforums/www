              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I am now doing my fianl year project for my honors and the dead due is just left with 1 month. I am really panic because it is a design project and i have not got the prototype out for testing. I am always anxious everyday and had problem sleeping at night. I keep looking for manufacturer to help me do one of the part an then they could only make it after 2 weeks and i am afraid that i do not have the time to finish then. And the prof can see my helpless and 'useless' in solving problem. He had in the first place help mi foresee that i do not have time for the proj and so i have to work hard. and now he had seen that i do not manage my time well. wat can i do to calm myself down?</p>

              <p>1. Acknowledge that you do not have any more time to waste worrying.<br>2. Come up with a detailed plan, breaking down into steps within the tight timeframe.<br>3. Accomplish the various steps, sticking to the plan strictly.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Alternately</span>:<br>1. Consult your prof on possible remedies (whether can extend dateline; convert it into research report instead etc).<br>2. Go ahead with the part manufacturing.

              <p>Don't stress... What I always tell others... Stress, yes, but no matter how stress, you still have to do your work... No matter how stress you are, the work is still there. If you give up today due to 'stress', you will be even more stressed the next day.</p>
              <p>Remember, work will only pile up if you postpone it. The best thing to do is to have tried your best. You don't want to look back one day and say it is because you did not try your best and that's why you didn't complete.</p>
              <p>Have faith in yourself. If they can only do it in 2 weeks, so be it. Meanwhile, finish up on your thesis and technical paper.</p>
              <p>P.S. My fabricated device is estimated to be out on around 31st March +-. And the last day for hardcopy submission of thesis is 4th Apr... So what do you think? I still have to test the device characteristics.</p>

              i am a uni student before so I know how those lecturers mindset.
              
              1) do you best stop thinking you will fail.
              
              2) Start writing your final report, even if you fail to complete in time, explain clearly why you could not do it in time. A clear and truthfull report will help you get better marks.
              
              3) The maufacturer can only finish in 2 weeks time, then do not waste time crying over it. Let them do their job.
              Trust others and trust yourself. Improve on your other parts and get them ready for the final installation. 
              
              4) Do not panic. Remember. just do your best.

              <p>Ok, i tell u my experience. I was doing a design, simulation project on antenna. first part is computer stuff. second is to make out the prototype and test its characteristics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>stuck at simulation. told professor my problem but he also dunno how. just ask me to ask people and do this do that.</p>
              <p>i ask him i can pass or not, then he say hard to past with 2 weeks left.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the end, my report all just simulation results. Got a B-.</p>
