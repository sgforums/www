D will haf a bad childhood and she is aready 6 yrs old. She noes who her mum is. And she can see things. SHe may grow up to be a totally diff person if tt really happens as in A marries G.<br><br>I support A's decision too. G is not as good as mentioned. If he is, why cant he accept D? A's mom is also abit overboard though she wants the best for her daughter. Being a mother, i am not sure uf she feels the same way as A. Will she haf given up A is a similar situation occur to her? I feel she shouldnt tell her to accept G.<br><br>A did the right decision!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
