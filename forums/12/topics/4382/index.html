            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree wif wat devil1976 is saying.. coz watever happens u have some proof of who is doing it to u and can be reported to the police let's say if it's some life arson..  but then again of coz this sort of self-owning thingy wun happen in real life...<br><br>I can only say if u love this girl, I believe u wun mind subjecting to the watever he has in mind.. but usually in S'pore, pple seldom dare to things becoz of the law and police that's behind it. he do one thing, u jst report, if he ever so foolishly ever gonna hurt u physically he jolly know that he's gonna well up in jail, becoz he's likely the prime suspect amongst all other pple. Of coz there must still be evidence and witnesses lahz..<br><br>How ever if he's ever say he will jump or die to ur gf becoz of her.. I can olny say let him be.. he's just trying to get attention that's all.. he's not gonna do it.. This is not Hong Kong or Taiwan, where pple will jump off a building or train becoz of love... I dun hear pple die becoz Zoe or Fann or Celest got a bf or hubby... Singaporeans are too kiasee to do such things as long as u dun bother they will quiet down...<br><br>Right now since nothing has been done, or maybe u left some details of wat's gonna happen so there's nothing much that we can do.. so the above is wat I think might be helpful and boost ur confidence in ur r/s wif ur gf.. and ne be intimidated by her ex...<br><br>But one more thing that I want to remind u.. u mentioned that u just broke off wif ur ex and now u are wif another girl, I not poking my nose into ur business, but just wanna ask if u really like this girl or is it just a replacement?? Maybe u dun wanna announce it here, but I do haope that u will considerit very carefully becoz this is a r/s and it involves 2 pple.. it will be unfair to her and deny her of the possible opportunities...<br><br>Do update us on the latest happenings...

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, i thought everything has already ended since january....really shocked to see this thread which is started in May.<br><br>ehh...this is posted at one of the thread in chit chat long ago. u guys can choose not to believe mi.<br><br>"To VnVin,<br>I had already told u many times that our breakup has got nothing to do with anybody. Since u came in and posted, i think i will say it one last time, maybe written words are easier for u to understand.<br><br>From late 1999 onwards, i had already slowly stop loving u. I'm sure u also know that by that time, we had already reduced greatly the number of times we met.In year 2000, the situation got even worse, we always quarrel every time we meet. At that time, I had attempted to break off with u a few times but u always threaten to commit suicide, that is why we had remained so long. (pls note that at that time, i have not met anyone from this forum.)I often called up Janice and told her that i'm very miserable cos i don't love u anymore but i can't break up with u. All these while, i had been waiting for a chance to leave u, but i'm just afriad that u will go n kill urself.<br><br>I only met the forumites in june 2000. I have told a few person in this forum about my misery and at that time, i don't even know oldman well and had never talk to him before. Do you know that i'm really so happy on that day of our breakup? I felt so relief that everthing is finally over. I can finally overcome all your threats and i had also realised one thing.<br>IF U REALLY WANT TO DIE, U WON'T KEEP TELLING ME. U HAD THREATEN TO KILL URSELF SO MANY TIMES, IF U REALLY HAD THE INTENTION, U R ALREADY DEAD. U JUST WANT TO USE IT AS A THREAT TO KEEP ME BY UR SIDE. PLS NOTE: I advice u that if u have a gf in future, this kind of method can only be used once or twice. Even stupid gers like me can see through ur trick.<br><br>OLDMAN, I LOVE U!!!~~~~~~"<br><br></div>
