Beauty, and sexiness, is in the eye of the beholder.<br><br>Telling someone that a "dao" girl is sexy is like saying that an apple tastes better than an orange. People may agree or disagree with you, depending on their taste buds. Naturally, the presumably unattainable is more desirable, and that factor itself contributes to how you feel about the girl.<br><br>If you think that your girlfriend is not sexy enough for you, you can always communicate your preferences to her in a nice way. But you are certainly not asking her to be "dao" to you, right? Well, you can ask her to dress more sexily, if that's what you want.<br><br>For me, a "dao" girl is more of a put-off, although there are exceptions. I am definitely more attracted to girls with warming smiles and friendly dispositions.</div>
