              <p>A lot depends on which field you work in and what degree you are planning to take.</p>
              <p>Following these 2 factors, you will also have to consider where the degree is from, and whether you are going to get a just-pass degree after a few years or a Honors degree.</p>

              <p>Generally a degree will be better la!</p>
              <p>Becoz...if you only have a dip...your salary can only be raised until so much....whereas with a degree you can get a higher salary in shorter time</p>
              <p>But if you time it's too hard work...then you probably have to settle for less lor....</p>

              <p><br>aiya honestly I feel that in life for the avg joe.... its how well u save and invest ...the difference btwn part time degree and diploma whilst helpful is not rly important and earth shattering.</p>

              <p>degree. no offence but a diploma is as good as bang sai jua these days. We used to have 3 polys giving about 20,000 grads per year. Now we have got Republic Poly, so that adds the number to about 26-27,000 a year. With hundreds of thousands of grads flooding the market in the next ten years, i think the diploma will become just about everyone's PSLE cert.</p>
              <p>get a degree, it guarantees you nothing but at least it's still relevant. And since it's a part time cert and not at the original country itself, your choices are pretty much limited to only the private sector.</p>

              <p>think its a very common question alot of people are fret about,
              that is to work with a dip cert or to work + taking part-time
              degree?which is better, worst or tough?when comparing to 10years
              down the road..which has more prospect?should i just work with what
              i have or take up a part-time degree while working?it seems pretty
              stress on hearing it..but i do not know what is the best for
              me..</p>

              <p>go for Professional Graduate Diplomas instead..specialised certificates..like CFA, CPA etc..</p>
              <p>which takes only a few months..but the price cost the same if not slightly expensive than a diploma combined..but this saves lots of time, and with time, you can earn back and make much more money..in the process..</p>
