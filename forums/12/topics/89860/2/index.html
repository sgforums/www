If Mars is afflicted, there could be violence, lust or intensity in relationship.<br><br>Aries - The God of War - usually needs to keep his/her temper under check. If Mars is weak and strong placing of Venus &amp; peaceful planets, there might resentment within the soul more than direct explosion of temper.<br><br>Both Aries needs to learn the gift of endurance and staying power.

But then, alot of things are subjective.. different people hold different presepectives even if they fall under the same zodiac.
