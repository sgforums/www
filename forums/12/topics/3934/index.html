I never know to luv someone can be so painful and weary...sigh...<br>The problem is that she already have a boyriend. But from what i knows, her bf does not treat her well, yet she still loves her bf a lot. I know she only want to treats me as a close friend and nothing more bcoz she have rejected me before. I know i dun stand a chance against her bf who is much better looking than me.<br><br>But the problem is that i cannot denied my love for her. I truly luv her. Whenever i go out with her, i feel so happy. Juz to see her smile, to see her laugh. I dun know if she ever realised that. Everytime i see them together, its hurt me a lot. But from the bottom of my heart, I truly wish her happiness...<br><br>In the middle of the night<br>i could not sleep.<br>Being troubled by matters<br>of true love that i seek.<br>Everytime i close my eyes,<br>forget her as i cry.<br>However hard i try,<br>I juz couldn't erase her<br>from my weary mind...<br><br>*A toast to all those broken hearted souls out there*<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mr cloud,<br><br>Its never wrong to love any1..... i mean love is a very funny thing, u can still love some1 though she may have hurt u very much, or just like the ger love her bf even if he treats her badly ........<br><br>Think at current, think its best if u could just be her close friend, maybe 1 day she will 'wake up' n realise whos really good to her. Like many other cicumstances, not much u can do, but then u r consider much luckier than others, at least she still treat u as a close friend.<br><br>I know the feeling is hard to bear, but at least u will be one of those who knows whats on her mind. If she's yrs.....eventually she will be yrs..... here, wishing u all the best.<br><br>Regards</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>* posted this msg in another thread<br><br>Some people think that it's holding on that makes one strong. Sometimes it's letting go makes u strong. This is what i call unrequited love &amp; is the equivalent to<br>banging your head against a wall that isn't there.<br><br>Whatever treasure &amp; wealth u accumulate, they will disperse one day. Whatever high status we struggle for, it will be lost one day. Whoever we love,they will leave us one day.<br><br>Think back. There was a time in your life when you didn't love this person. In fact, there was a time in your life when u didn't even know this person. And u were just fine without them! Loving someone is a learned reaction, through times u have spent together, special moments, etc. Just as you "learned" to love this person, you can learn to unlove them.<br><br>The true fact of the matter is...time does heal. And why does time heal? Because over time u naturally stop thinking of them. This may be due to the fact that u won't be in physical contact with them anymore, u may meet someone new and your thoughts turn to that new person; whatever the case, this is a true statement. so, why not speed things up? believe me, thinking of them, wishing for them, &amp; pining away for them, will not bring them back. And speaking from experience, all it will get u is a new set of wrinkles! And, if they should come crawling back in the days ahead, with their pathetic tail between their legs...u will be in a much better frame of mind to deal with them a second time around if you have put them out of your thoughts.<br><br>Men like to get &amp; forget.<br>Women like to give &amp; forgive.<br><br></div>
