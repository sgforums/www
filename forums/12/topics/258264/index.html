            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Espada:</div><div class="quote_body">well,i found myself falling in love with this girl who is from the same school and cca as me,but younger than me by 1 year...after getting to know her,i noticed that i can't stop thinking of her and would always want to chat with her when she is on msn.<br><br>i know this is just a crush and happens alot during teenage years...but this is my first time feeling like this,and i dun think the girl is interested in me and sees me as a friend,is there anyway to get rid of this feeling inside me...and to see her as just a friend without feeling shy??....i believe alot of ppl has gone through this,so pls help me,thanks..</div></blockquote>There is a number of route you can choose.<br><br>Your situation, is very normal... There are alot of people that it the same as you...  Maybe, the person sit beside, infront or diagonally is the same as you. A crush on someone. Crush, also means infatuation... It's good that you can differ between crash and love...<br><br>But still, having a crush on someone sure makes your heart itchy right? And that feeling sux right?<br><br>So find a cure for it, a route for it...<br><br>There is a number of things you may do... Forget her, ask her to be your valentine. etc...<br><br>Itchy... Isn't it irritating? the cure for it? Ask her her whether she like you or not... The only problem with this is your braveness... Think, alot of people have already ask... Why not you?<br><br>About forgetting her, i am sure this is also one of good path right? But the problem is, are you sure you can forget her?<br>There are some people who can't forget for a fews years even though it's just a crush...<br>So this route depend on how deep is your infatuation on her... If possible, i hope you will take this path...<br><br>Or, you can just simply do the same thing as you are now... Doing nothing... Then you will let the itchyness make you suffer... And it a long term effect if you don't know when to let her go...<br><br>Still... You will know which route to take better then us... Yup...<br><br>Just keep in mind about one thing,<br><br><span style="color: red;">Don't regret whatever path you take.</span><br><br>^^<br>Stay happy always  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
