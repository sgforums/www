There are alot of people that it the same as you...  Maybe, the person sit beside, infront or diagonally is the same as you. A crush on someone. Crush, also means infatuation... It's good that you can differ between crash and love...<br><br>But still, having a crush on someone sure makes your heart itchy right? And that feeling sux right?<br><br>So find a cure for it, a route for it...<br><br>There is a number of things you may do... Forget her, ask her to be your valentine. etc...<br><br>Itchy... Isn't it irritating? the cure for it? Ask her her whether she like you or not... The only problem with this is your braveness... Think, alot of people have already ask... Why not you?<br><br>About forgetting her, i am sure this is also one of good path right? But the problem is, are you sure you can forget her?<br>There are some people who can't forget for a fews years even though it's just a crush...<br>So this route depend on how deep is your infatuation on her... If possible, i hope you will take this path...<br><br>Or, you can just simply do the same thing as you are now... Doing nothing... Then you will let the itchyness make you suffer... And it a long term effect if you don't know when to let her go...<br><br>Still... You will know which route to take better then us... Yup...<br><br>Just keep in mind about one thing,<br><br><span style="color: red;">Don't regret whatever path you take.</span><br><br>^^<br>Stay happy always  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>well,i dun think i should actually confess,cos its obvious that she thinks of me as just a friend,so if i confess it will only make me more embarassed...so the path im taking is just to try and forget her,can only hope the feeling goes away...</div>

This is the path that requires you to endure...<br><br>Endure is the key to success for this path.<br><br>But one thing to remind you, Some people take alot of years just to forget.<br>Normally, half a year or more will do...<br>But still, 7 or 8 year may come...<br><br>But if you really have a deep crush on her, after you and her seldom meet, you will forget this itchness liao... like when you change school, CCA or class...<br><br>Still the same old sentence,<br>Don't regret whatever path you take.</div>
