              <p>IMO, it is really sad, if you have parents breathing down your neck, pushing you to get married. Marriage is for two person ultimately, not four.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you marry someone from other countries, who knows, they may just be interested in your money, or maybe, at the opportunity of moving to another country for a better life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In truth, even though marriages between two nationalities or races are pretty common now, I still feel that relationships with the same nationalities or race will last longer, due to the fact that he/she has a higher chance of understanding your culture/behaviour/habits.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And also, arranged marriage have a higher chance of failing I believe. What TS should do, is to say no to his parents (in a polite way of course). Afterall, he is the one who will be staying in the same room with her and sleeping on the same bed with her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Above is just my point of view. No discrimination against people from other countries or other races.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheers :)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>aiyo, Ah Boy.... you are still young and sad to said you are abit childish. Dont marry that girl if you have intention to divorce later. Dont be so silly to sponsor her to study.... by than she is the one who want to divorce you. Oversea bride for them is ok. They are prepared to get marry to someone they dont even know. As for you, you have to give your parents some impressin that you are grown up and mature enough. By doing so, engage with further study or tell them your plan for future career path and so on... give them the impression that you have intention to build up your career. DONT GET MARRY IF YOU ARE NOT READY. is a KAMA.... knowing is a wrong thing to do and yet proceed with it..Be firm with your decision. I think you must be the only son/child and always depend on them, they treat you like a small kid and afraid that you choose the wrong girl or worried that cant get one. Do sometime in weekend, make yourself busy with acticity and they realise their boy grown up ...</div>

              <p>Do not attempt what you are contemplating. It will destroy her life, for if she ever get divorced and return home, her family will reject her and her neighbours will despise her as a failure, when it is not her fault.</p>
              <p>If you are truly noble, you can always take ]responsibility] for a child and pay for his'her education thru the normal channels, just like many other noble and charitable Singaporeans I know that had done so.</p>
              <p>As for your r/s with your parents, you must realize that you are already 21 years old and capable of making your own decisions. But perhaps you had not shown them that you might be that capable, thus their resolve to take matters into their hands, not because they are authoritative, but only because they love you and want the best for you.</p>
              <p>This will be an issue you have to resolve with them, by allying their concerns, whatever they are. Many here do not have the full picture and would be difficult to share experiences.</p>
              <p>If the issue is only because you prefer singlehood, then it is a choice you choose in life, and I sincerly hope you will not have any regrets later. We are only young once, and before you know it, we will be staring at the sunset on our walking sticks, watching kids play merrily along the beach, wondering what have we done or did not do in our lifetime.</p>

              <p>At 10.17 am, the TS started started a thread cursing Mediacorp
              to hell for rescheduling his favourite Shaolin show... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Slightly over two hours later at 12.39 pm, he comes in here
              complaining that his parents are forcing him to get a mail-order
              bride.....</p>
              <p>Heck, even after starting this topic, the TS still went back to
              that forehead-slapping 'curse Mediacorp to hell' thread.....
              there's one post by him in there timestamped 12.51 pm.</p>
              <p>Looks like a fish, smells like a fish. I'm more willing to
              believe that he's some 15 year old kid on school holidays with
              nothing better to do. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>now, my parents has been pressuring me to get foreign bride
              (vietnam) as i don't have gf (now i'm 25).<br> <br> i think they're going to vietnam next year or so to look for
              foreign wife for me.<br> <br> now, this is just crazy, considering that i'm a male and we're
              living in 21st century.....and i'll try my best to prevent all
              these crap from happening.<br> <br> i mean, love is love and how can it be bought with money?<br> i have never ever accepted the barbaric idea of the concept of
              "mail-order brides". it's not just insulting to the girl, it's
              demeaning to me as well.<br> <br> and if i can't stop this, my plan B is as follows:<br> <br> 1) go with parents to Vietnam and pick a young girl (17 - 19 yrs
              old)</p>
              <p>2) vietnam girl stays with me but i don't touch her or have sex
              with her....i'll treat her like neutral friend, send her to study
              courses upgrade herself etc.  this is a way to make-up for her
              wasting of 2 - 3 yrs with me.</p>
              <p>The purpose of picking a young girl is so that when i divorce
              her, she will only be around 22 yrs old, and still very young
              enough to find another guy more suitable for her<br> <br> 3) after 3 years, i'll divorce her and ask her to find another
              guy<br> <br> 4) i'll be free again<br> <br> 5) if parents want me to marry again, i'll repeat from step
              1).<br> <br> 6) if need to pay alimony fees to vietnam wife after divorce, i'm
              willing.<br> at least parents will see their mistake.<br> <br> the idea of marrying a girl i've no feelings for is atrocious, and
              i don't believe the BS of "feelings can be nurtured".<br> <br> pls advise your comments here and if there are flaws with this
              plan, pls let me know so that i can rectify.</p>
