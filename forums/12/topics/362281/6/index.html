              <p>backpackers always fall into 4 groups:</p>
              <p>i) those who have earned a lot in their younger days and after retire, they tour the world</p>
              <p>ii) those young hippies (usually asian-americans and ang-mohs) in their early 20s - 30s who earn 6-digit salaries and they can spend 6 years backpacking the world without needing to work</p>
              <p>iii) those born with silver-spoon who use parents money to backpack (also known as good-for-nothings)</p>
              <p>iv) those who have no money but still borrow from parents / friends to backpack</p>
              <p>anyway, i personally don't like how backpackers slung those 50-kiloton, 4-metre by 4 metre gigantic bags on their backs.....it's crazy.</p>

              <p>backpackers always fall into 4 groups:</p>
              <p>i) those who have earned a lot in their younger days and after
              retire, they tour the world</p>
              <p>ii) those young hippies (usually asian-americans and ang-mohs)
              in their early 20s - 30s who earn 6-digit salaries and they can
              spend 6 years backpacking the world without needing to work</p>
              <p>iii) those born with silver-spoon who use parents money to
              backpack (also known as good-for-nothings)</p>
              <p>iv) those who have no money but still borrow from parents /
              friends to backpack</p>
              <p>anyway, i personally don't like how backpackers slung those
              50-kiloton, 4-metre by 4 metre gigantic bags on their
              backs.....it's crazy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and Terminator.....you've truly convinced me that you're worse
              than me, and that you're indeed a 15-year old kid.</p>
