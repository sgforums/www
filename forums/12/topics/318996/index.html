              <p>So as stated in topic title. <br><br>I don't feel contended with these qualities, a lot people tell me that it's already fortunate. Sometimes, I feel exclusive, sometimes, I feel out of place. Sometimes, I feel like a loser. I don't know.  </p>
              <p>According to people, (and after some introspection)<br><br>I have high IQ. To the extent where I can don't study much and achieve not bad results. I'm taking Alevels, but never really studied in my life before. <br><br>Highly philosophical and deep. I think too much, sometimes. I always define this define that and I'm always thinking about sometime. <br><br>I'm the type that will go online to read on random articles (wiki and some others) about history, science and stuff like that. I read these for pure pleasure and knowledge<br><br>I have almost near photographic memory. (though not exactly very evidently). <br><br>I listen to classical music. I read up a lot on music history and periods and I learn music theory. plays advanced repertoire on the piano and I don't listen to pop or "normal" music. I play 4 hours of piano/day, and will still do okay in school work eventually and have a decent social life.<br><br>I'm considered fit. Last year my 2.4km run was almost 9 flat. <br><br>Not exactly part of me, but I was born in a relatively rich family. Landed house, got car to drive me whereever I want to go. I only spend like 10% of my pocket money as I have nothing much to buy.</p>
              <p>I know many are going to ask why is this even in aunt agony. But the fact is <br><br>I don't seem to be happy at all. I use to believe money can't buy important stuff and the world's most important things can't be bought with money. And so I set out to gather all the stuff that is more than superficial. Knowledge, skills. I've been trying my best to accquire them, I am an anti-materialististic person. But right now I'm at a lost, these skills, these abilities, do not exactly make me happy.<br><br>I don't really have a good love life. Don't get interested in girls easily. But yet sometimes, I feel lonely.<br><br>Am I the classic spoilt uncontended brat?<br></p>

              <p>Feel empty hor..</p>
              <p>having everything is like having nothing. All that money to get more money and then ?</p>
              <p>I think u thirst for a purpose. Go and do things u never done before. On top of doing what u do now , u can do more. Attend events , charities like some say , associations and then socialise u meet more people. Maybe from there u can meet other like minded people.</p>
              <p>Elevate your social status and circle as u go. You wont be so empty. U gotta have purpose and a plan. Maybe u still young and dunno do what, go where , with who.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">All those qualities you have actually wont make u happy, in fact I think they are not a blessing. U are rich u don’t have to work for a living, u have good memory u don’t have to study hard to pass your exams. This will not only make u lazy, they will also make your life boring.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>

Be it their friends, their parent. How many of them actually want to make themselves happy? I guess not many. Being happy is like doing a quest, u need to put in efforts to seek.</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Only yourself is responsible for your own happiness, nobody else is. So, make yourself happy now. U can sing yourself a song, tell yourself that u are handsome Listen to beautiful music like Mozart’s - Symphony No. 40 or Mozart’s - nachtmusik </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>

Bring yourself to a posh restaurant and enjoy the wine and dine. Go buy yourself a gift, or bring yourself to a place with nice serenity to look at the beautiful sunset</span></p>

              <p>when i read your description of yourself, it was also like reading about myself, take away the piano part and increase the 2.4 timing to 10+min. i suppose you are in j2? i'm in j1. you look for happiness in your skills, which i understand. it can be very rewarding to just go on wiki or any other website to read about stuff and gain more knowledge. the piano is also a good way (i quit piano last year, it just didn't interest me enough).</p>
              <p>however, all these can only bring you to a certain level of happiness. it is not through these skills where i get my happiness, it is from my friends and other activities. you have not mentioned friends, maybe you have overlooked them? i was also a facilitator for a life science workshop for sec 3 students for 2 days. it ended yesterday, and it was very rewarding for me, being able to guide them and such.</p>
              <p>perhaps you have been looking in the wrong areas for your happiness. you mentioned that you play the piano for 4h a day. not to put it down, but it is a very long time to spend alone. perhaps staying around in sch more, hanging around with people might bring more joy?</p>
              <p>i think i can understand your character, i used to want to go all out to gain knowledge and skills, but obviously, it wasn't giving me contentment. look in other areas</p>

              <p><br>Hi TS,</p>
              <p>Personally, I am very similar to you when it comes to acquiring of knowledge though I am very much older than you I guess. That is why I can understand what you are going through right now as I had been through the same path too.</p>
              <p>Like what Yunhaier has mentioned, you might be spiritually void right now. I am not sure if you are a Buddhist but you can try reading some postings in ~Buddhism: Wisdom Bliss ~ forum in sgforums. There are alot of meaningful postings about the emptiness you are going through. I personally is not a Buddhist, yet, but like to read the postings in this forum. It gives great peace to one's mind.</p>
              <p>I am also not sure if you are a Chinese, as watching educational TV shows by äºŽä¸¹&lt;&lt;åº„å­�&gt;&gt;å¿ƒå¾— that is currently showing in U channel might help. You can also watch it on <a href="http://www.tudou.com">www.tudou.com</a>. The full list of the educational program can be found at this web page <a href="http://lishouli.blog.hexun.com/7901086_d.html">http://lishouli.blog.hexun.com/7901086_d.html</a>. You just need to cut and paste the title of each series at tudou.com and search for the show. The program talks about ZhuangZi's philosophy of life which contains wisdom from Buddhism and Taoism. It has helped me alot and I do hope it can help you too.</p>
              <p>Hope you can find your true meaning of life soon! :) Cheer up!</p>

              <p>You are lucky that at a young age that you realize that money canot buy you the most important things in life. It sounds that you already have a passion. That is you like to read about stuffs. Why don't you buy books on the topic which interest you like history or anything or read religious stuffs just for the sake of seeking knowledge.</p>
              <p>If you want the most important things in life I suggest you go for a spiritual quest. Only God can truly makes us happy literally. We can only have outworldy peace from God. Peace that is so overwhelming that it gives you joy. Peace that would make anyone feel richer than Mr. Gates LOL. I had been given such peace but unfortunately lost it due to my attachment to a particular sin. I hope you may find the peace that God promised to anyone who follows Him. And you could experience spiritual 'gifts' as well. You would be surprised on what you thought imposssible. The world is larger than you think.</p>
