              You are a loser.
              
              I can imagine you to be one with no life, no friends and no love. You take pride in PHILOSOPHY, SCIENCE, CLASSICAL music, running fast... all these "brainy" and "classy" stuff which makes you feel superior.
              
              pls wake up, yr *elitist* mindset will never help you escape from loneliness.

              <p>Then you need to go arranged Match-Making, marry a girl that your parents fancy and you will find that your life does get more meaningful than it is right now when your kids are born.</p>
              <p>Or...you could try to build your own business, towards the goal of accumulating more wealth than your parents and everyone else around you. The person with the most cash flow wins the world.</p>
              <p>Or...you should get yourself a religion and devote your time to care, encourage, love your fellow members of faith.

              <p>So as stated in topic title.<br><br>I don't feel contended with these qualities, a lot people tell me that it's already fortunate. Sometimes, I feel exclusive, sometimes, I feel out of place. Sometimes, I feel like a loser. I don't know.  </p>
              <p>According to people, (and after some introspection)<br><br>I have high IQ. To the extent where I can don't study much and achieve not bad results. I'm taking Alevels, but never really studied in my life before.<br><br>Highly philosophical and deep. I think too much, sometimes. I always define this define that and I'm always thinking about sometime.<br><br>I'm the type that will go online to read on random articles (wiki and some others) about history, science and stuff like that. I read these for pure pleasure and knowledge<br><br>I have almost near photographic memory. (though not exactly very evidently).<br><br>I listen to classical music. I read up a lot on music history and periods and I learn music theory. plays advanced repertoire on the piano and I don't listen to pop or "normal" music. I play 4 hours of piano/day, and will still do okay in school work eventually and have a decent social life.<br><br>I'm considered fit. Last year my 2.4km run was almost 9 flat.<br><br>Not exactly part of me, but I was born in a relatively rich family. Landed house, got car to drive me whereever I want to go. I only spend like 10% of my pocket money as I have nothing much to buy.</p>
              <p>I know many are going to ask why is this even in aunt agony. But the fact is<br><br>I don't seem to be happy at all. I use to believe money can't buy important stuff and the world's most important things can't be bought with money. And so I set out to gather all the stuff that is more than superficial. Knowledge, skills. I've been trying my best to accquire them, I am an anti-materialististic person. But right now I'm at a lost, these skills, these abilities, do not exactly make me happy.<br><br>I don't really have a good love life. Don't get interested in girls easily. But yet sometimes, I feel lonely.<br><br>Am I the classic spoilt uncontended brat?</p>
