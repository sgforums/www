            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Wolfwoof,<br><br>This is 1 of the most selfish posts I've ever seen.  You didn't care whether feelings would be hurt, the aim of owning her being your only goal, making you oblivious of everything else.  You didn't think properly of the consequences, &amp; now, when the going gets tough, you wanna desert her?  After what she's given up to be with you?<br><br>Your self-centredness ASTOUNDS me.  You reap what you sow, &amp; you should've been prepared for this before you selfishly butted into a relationship that has lasted 4 years.  May this be a deterrent to those who're thinking of stealing someone away from a relationship.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Wolfwoof^^:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi..i manage to cut into their 4yrs rs.

            <div class='col-md body'>I can't believe this!!!<br><br>It does not even sound like love to me. You saw her 4 yr relationship as a challenge and now that you have Â“triumphedÂ” you have SUDDENLY found yourself Â“Im beginning to drift away from this rs but i still luv herÂ”<br><br>This is CRAP!!! If you LOVE her enough to fight for her in the first place. This should be chicken feet to you! What did you expect? Her friends and family to think Â“oh my daughter/good friend has given up her 4 yrs relationship for this guyÂ… YAY!!!Â”???<br><br>Before you Â“cut inÂ” have you ever given a thought on how this can affect her? Her family? Her bf?<br><br>IÂ’m not dead against ppl pursuing the gal/guy they like even if the other party is attached, but if you intend to do that, you have a certain obligation to be certain of your own feelings and not Â“succeed to cut inÂ” and Â“Im beginning to drift away from this rs but i still luv herÂ”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, the fact that u cut into their 4 yrs relationship is horrible, u broke up a couple just like that @_@ however , this proves that they still do not understand each other well enough and maybe dont love each other deep enough, u made the girl love u and to the extend of breaking up with her bf to be with u, i must say u are something, it is natural that her ex bf dont wanna let go, but since u are with her now , and u love her as much as she loves u , Dont let go , go for it .. but if u are just playing with her feelings, i suggest u better reflect on yourself what damage have u done to everyone. Keep on trying if u really love her  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
