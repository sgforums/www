Yes, they boosted ur ego and u enjoyed the feeling and thrill of gaining their attention... and felt very attractive.<br><br>Other than dat wat do u gain from them? Love?? Sex??? I don't think tat's wat u r looking for in life...<br><br>And i m not here to condemn u for watever u have done or undergone.<br>To mw, u are juz like a missing kid looking for it's nanny goat. U have no aim, goal or direction in life.<br><br>Get a grip on urself..<br><br>Since u mentioned tat u love ur present gf and u even have the intention to marry her, then y do u want to give up? Cuz she's too easy to get?? Cuz she's not the type who can provide u wif the excitement u want?<br><br>Both of u muz have gone thru some hurdles to be together now. And seeing the plight she's in, u should have be her pillar of strength instead of escaping from it!! now<br><br>She is brave enuff to get herself out from her 4yrs r/s to be wif u and now she has to face the pressure from her family's and frenz, including her ex. If she dun luv u, i dun think she will want tosuffer all these torments from them for this r/s.<br><br>Other forumites say tat u r selfish.. naturally, standing only in ur own shoes, u cannot really accept wat they had commented on ur doings. But everytime should a disagreement arises, there must be something wrong somewhere. It's juz tat u have yet to come to an agreeing point.<br><br>U should and better stand in ur gf position and try to visualize how and wat she is facing now and brave thru all these wif her, give her the moral, physical, mental support tat u can, at least if u love her enuff. Dun think for urself only , or plan for a back route. If u are mature enuff, u have to think for ur future.<br><br>Most importantly, i think u r the type of person who cannot love a person for a long period of time. It's mayb because u haven't meet a gf tat treats u very well and tat's y u nv learn a lesson out of it. If u ever ditch a good gf for another gal, and the gf is not as gd as the one before,then u will regret and u will definitely grow..from experience.<br><br>If u really love someone, u should hold her hands tightly and nv let her battle troubles alone...How cud u bear to see ur loved ones suffering?? and yet u chose to run away from it? Do u think by getting urself out of this r/s she will be better?? Then by tat time, u r really a Scary monster!!<br><br>Now if ur gf ever finds out ur intention of leaving her, how wud she feel?? Huh?? I wonder did the wolf devour ur conscience!!<br><br>Everyone makes mistakes. It is only the matter of whether did u learn something out rfom ur mistakes and not let history repeat itself.</div>
