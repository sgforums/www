            <div class='col-md body'>Looking back, the past 7 years of my life have been so unbelievable that it would put any soap opera to shame.  The last 4 years of this longdrawn episode has just come to an end.  After allowing myself 2 days of anguish, here I am, sitting back and surveying the mess of my life and what lays ahead without the slightest hint of trepidation.<br><br>I thought nothing could surprise me after all the drama, the colourful characters and the impossible situations I've handled through these turbulent years, and so the unexpected silent calm in my mind now comes as a surprise.  Perhaps this is akin to a calm after a storm, so although this new state of clarity was something I least expected to find at the end of this 4-year ordeal, I am very pleased with the result.<br><br>It was as if someone had "uncooked" all the garbled information in my brain.

It's interesting how easily I succumbed to the lull of this so-called "normal" life and how I struggled to maintain it even at the cost of my own beliefs. The irony in compromising my own ideals and desires for the sake of moulding myself into someone else's perception of a "woman behind the man" does not escape me, for I have always prided myself in being at the forefront of any relationship, taking on the role of the aggressor rather than that of the passive gentle female.  In fact a part of me is quite disgusted that this dream was not ended by my own hand, but by "his".. I would've still been lost in the mist for goodness knows how much longer if he had not decided to end the relationship.<br><br>Perhaps I was tired. Overwhelmed, even.  Weary of fighting endless battles alone, tired of being strong and invincible when I feel vulnerable and wounded inside.  This relationship was simply my excuse to run away from my future.. my way of hanging up the towel and letting someone else be the driving force of ambition.  Everytime I think of my mother, I punish myself mentally.  She is a unicorn with a behemoth's spirit, a maker of miracles with a mindblowing track record.  And I?  How could I ever hope reach that calibre when all I've done so far is to wait for life to throw something in my path that would force me forward?<br><br>I admit I have been fearful of taking the reins.  So many unanswered questions loom over me like an ominous grey blanket of clouds that threaten to drown the buried answers below before I can even find them, but now I allow myself a drizzle.. Where would I go? What would I do?  How would I generate enough income to get something going?  The initial questions hit me like gigantic hailstones.  But I must weather them, for after all this time, all these experiences, I have come one full circle and right back to where I started.. right back to the problem I have been avoiding all along ... indecisiveness on what I want to do with my life.<br><br>The newfound clarity beckons, but I am fearful.  But I must go forth.. for time is no longer by my side.  Indecisiveness will only prolong my pain.  I face this old crossroad, this unwanted familiar friend, and now I know which unmarked path I must take.. it is the one I have been avoiding all along.<br><br>But what about you, ladies &amp; gents?  How do you handle these huge questions in life, all these huge expectations?  Just.. do now, think later?  How do you overcome your own fear of failure?

Then I pamper myself with the things I do for myself and the gifts I am given as rewards for helping others.<br><br>If you really love, you really need to undertsand, yourself, the other person and the whole situation.</div>

Sometimes we all try to conform to the ways of how things are supposedly normal. You have to know the true core of your own principles and belief and that as one of the driving forces in life. Your mother , you can learn a lot of things from there. As u are her offspring , you too can have that same desire and ambition to strive for the better. We all fear failure. But we will experience failure not once but many more in our life time.. Its through the failures and struggles that u know how to beat it and come out the victor through these and it will make u a better person. Stronger, tougher , wiser , more sensitive to things around you and able to handle situations with a sound mind.<br><br>Some have that empty hole. There is no wrong in craving for love. Perhaps you can inject those into the love for work and to strive for better. We all crave for love. Hobbies , or hanging out with your good friends can cure and fill that hole for sometime. And let things take its turn n perhaps you will find love again soon.</div>

Just 2 Thursdays ago, I was still planning on marrying a manic depressive chauvanist who didn't love me for chrissakes.. the same man who, much to my great fortune, decided to burst my big bubble that fateful Thursday night and call the whole thing off.  *smacks forehead* What was I thinking.<br><br>I never regretted anything before I met "him".  I took shelter in his notion of a woman, allowed him to change me into this giggling, babbling heap to match his himbo style, convince me that my sexual history made me an immoral, sordid person, that I was unworthy of a "normal" life.. and that only served to make me long to please him so that he might allow me to carry on "our"  "normal" life together.  We even had a wedding scheduled for the year end before things came to an end.  GAWD I was seriously deluded ! *cringe*.<br><br>Moving on....... now that we're no longer together, the fear and regret have dissipated like MrMuscle on mold.. but there's still alot of uncertainty.  It's like I'm standing without help for the 1st time in a long time, and my legs are abit wobbly.  My mom has been a rock for me, she never imposed her ideals on me but I just can't help but look up to her.   Not be like her, just be as magnificent as her.<br><br>I'm quite determined to put this all behind me.  Blew a few k in the past week on shopping "therapy" (I'm usually a big stinge), successfully diverted the pain from the heart to the pocket. *winces*  Bought a pair of rollerblades last Sunday and headed for the ECP right away, determined to pick up something new.  Laughed at myself for stumbling about like a drunk tarantula.. laugh.. I hadn't even done that in a long time, well not geniune laughter anyway.  I updated my friendster profile and suddenly I'm getting messages and calls from all directions.. I'm glad .  I'm going clubbing later with an old galpal who's having marital problems.. am in need of some "girl talk".<br><br>And yes, I will make sure I do not go back into self-destructive cycles.. no more nonsensical roleplaying-relationships.  Hope I'll recover in a few mths time with the help of close ones.<br><br>Thanks for your input, I'm encouraged.  Uncertain, but encouraged.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by spinsugar:</div><div class="quote_body">Looking back, the past 7 years of my life have been so unbelievable that it would put any soap opera to shame.  The last 4 years of this longdrawn episode has just come to an end.  After allowing myself 2 days of anguish, here I am, sitting back and surveying the mess of my life and what lays ahead without the slightest hint of trepidation.<br><br>I thought nothing could surprise me after all the drama, the colourful characters and the impossible situations I've handled through these turbulent years, and so the unexpected silent calm in my mind now comes as a surprise.  Perhaps this is akin to a calm after a storm, so although this new state of clarity was something I least expected to find at the end of this 4-year ordeal, I am very pleased with the result.<br><br>It was as if someone had "uncooked" all the garbled information in my brain.  With this newfound clarity, I am beginning to understand what has transpired over the years.. this latest "relationship" suddenly looks so clear.<br><br>As an old "buddy" put it, I must have been desperate for some semblance of normality in my 24 years of life when everything up till this point was anything but. It's interesting how easily I succumbed to the lull of this so-called "normal" life and how I struggled to maintain it even at the cost of my own beliefs. The irony in compromising my own ideals and desires for the sake of moulding myself into someone else's perception of a "woman behind the man" does not escape me, for I have always prided myself in being at the forefront of any relationship, taking on the role of the aggressor rather than that of the passive gentle female.  In fact a part of me is quite disgusted that this dream was not ended by my own hand, but by "his".. I would've still been lost in the mist for goodness knows how much longer if he had not decided to end the relationship.<br><br>Perhaps I was tired. Overwhelmed, even.  Weary of fighting endless battles alone, tired of being strong and invincible when I feel vulnerable and wounded inside.  This relationship was simply my excuse to run away from my future.. my way of hanging up the towel and letting someone else be the driving force of ambition.  Everytime I think of my mother, I punish myself mentally.  She is a unicorn with a behemoth's spirit, a maker of miracles with a mindblowing track record.  And I?  How could I ever hope reach that calibre when all I've done so far is to wait for life to throw something in my path that would force me forward?<br><br>I admit I have been fearful of taking the reins.  So many unanswered questions loom over me like an ominous grey blanket of clouds that threaten to drown the buried answers below before I can even find them, but now I allow myself a drizzle.. Where would I go? What would I do?  How would I generate enough income to get something going?  The initial questions hit me like gigantic hailstones.  But I must weather them, for after all this time, all these experiences, I have come one full circle and right back to where I started.. right back to the problem I have been avoiding all along ... indecisiveness on what I want to do with my life.<br><br>The newfound clarity beckons, but I am fearful.  But I must go forth.. for time is no longer by my side.  Indecisiveness will only prolong my pain.  I face this old crossroad, this unwanted familiar friend, and now I know which unmarked path I must take.. it is the one I have been avoiding all along.<br><br>But what about you, ladies &amp; gents?  How do you handle these huge questions in life, all these huge expectations?  Just.. do now, think later?  How do you overcome your own fear of failure?  And lastly... how do you handle that empty hole inside you, the one that craves for love?  </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If you shield the canyon from the winds, you will not see the beauty of their carving.<br><br>You are probably enervated and overwhelmed by infallible expectations generated in your mind. Higher desire begets greater disappointment - you can't really change that, but more importantly, a greater sinister lurks maliciously deeper; your fear of failure made you afraid of making decisions and that limits your growth.<br><br>Let me illustrate an analogy: In finance, all the low risk, capital-guaranteed investments generally have low returns. Although you still get back your money and a little gain, it's still possible to make a loss from such financial instruments because the meagre returns cannot cover the admin/sales/hidden charges derived from the investment. And inflation worsens it. Therefore making 'safe' decision may be always be the 'best' decision.<br><br>Learn to take calculated risk and even if you fall, don't be afraid of learning how to recover yourself. We learn walk by falling, therefore we learn succeed by failing. Like your siggy: <span style="font-style: italic;">Are you the men who want crops without plowing up the ground... want rain without thunder and lightning... want the ocean without the roar of its many waters</span>?"<br><br>The natural craving for love is biologically, emotionally and spiritually induced. No man is an island. Love defines meaning in our otherwise insipid life and it's only human to desire companionship.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Last night's Zouk escapade with "SP" ended with an anticlimax.  Was spared from sweating it out in the Q lines thanks to the help of another old galpal "Su", whom I never expected to see, but I instantly regretted it once I ducked past security.. followed her to the VIP area but it was just as bad.. it was so packed that I couldn't stay at one spot for 5 minutes without getting rudely shoved about or stared hard down the chest.  Swooned not because of the hot hunks but because it was so stuffy, pissed not from the drinks but with the crowd.  Don't even wanna start on the groping.  "SP" managed to get us some space and drinks by chatting up a weird hiphop dude at Phuture, but by then I was too put off to have fun.  Plus, I didn't feel confident enough to dance and it showed.  Finally decided to bail out to avoid raining on the parade and for some fresh air.  I thought to myself, this is what hell must be like.   Or Singapore, 10 years from now.<br><br>No more mambo night for me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>"SP" was a real sport, she knew my situation so no worries with her.  -sigh- and the dancing... *makes mental note to pick up dance classes*<br><br>That aside... my unexpected encounter with "Su" did get me thinking.. I lost contact with her, as with many other friends, over the years.. I think she was tired of saving me all the time from the crutches of the mega-multiplying evil wolves whenever we went clubbing.  I guess soulwinner's right.  I appear tough but I'm in constant need of rescue.  Like those female "heroes" on the old Saturday morning cartoons that I used to loathe.. hmm.. yet another irony.<br><br>But I don't want to be a damsel in distress!  I suspect that's what's keeping me from keeping long term friendships alive.. my damsel in distress thing, and the way I operate.  As soon as I've met "someone", I stop going out with friends almost immediately.  I slow down, I settle down, I become..... boring.  I am not the sort to forget friends or make use of them, but somehow I inevitably feel I give people that impression because of my inconsistent way of keeping in touch, and my chameleon abilities.  For example, I think "Su" got miffed when "SP" and I disappeared into the crowd last night.. she hasn't replied my SMS.  I have a hunch she thought I just said 'hi' to jump the Q, then bailed on her.  *rubs chin* I'll have to work on that too I guess.  Human relations.<br><br>edit : great.. "Su" returned my msg, we're catching up this weekend.  Wow.. what a rush!  Time to repair bridges..</div>
