I will do some self-evaluation before embarking on my next course of action.<br><br>Karma is a very subjective thing. Instead of getting worried about negative karma being built in this lifetime, many people including myself<br>would prefer thinking of it as amortizing the positive karma from the past lifetime. Besides, there's a flipside to every failed relationship.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Scion79:</div><div class="quote_body">I am impressed. Sincere thanks for your meticulous and surprisingly immaculate analysis. It has certainly enabled a new dimension towards my<br>perception in life. You pointed out that I have many dimensions of vulnerability as a whole pertaining to relationships and emotions. That is such an<br>accurate mirror of my inner-most feelings.<br><br>Prior to my acquaintance to S, my preceding relationships and flings could not engage me beyond my esteem, cognitive emotions and aesthetic desire, which belongs to the 2nd quantum defined in Marslow's hierarchy of needs. To put it in layman terms, I have not explored my humane self fully by reaching the top consortium of self-actualization and ultimately, self-transcendence. Through S's tender sincerity, I began to learn how to love and to sacrifice unconditionally. (Which is such a shame given that my 1st relationship started when I was 13 and all those 10 years before I met S, I have not been able to bask in the full potential of unblemished and pure love).<br><br>You surprise me with your accurate inference  of "You have unseen blemishes clogged deep right in your soul since the day S promulgate breaking up." In many situations in life, you can forgive but it is somehow difficult to forget. Different individuals have diverse takes towards dealing with life's hard knocks. This is best described by the Elephant metaphor involving 7 blind men, which is so highly advocated by Alan Greenspan before his tenure at the world bank was up. Since that fateful breakup, the bruise in my ego has egged me on full acceleration to improve myself and achieve as much as I can. On hindsight, I can say that without this setback, I would probably have remained languid and unambitious, especially so when I could easily take my family wealth for granted. However like what you prophesied, the hate of having my feeling of love in its purest form disappointed remains embedded deep. Now can you share some views how I should let go of this hatred and start to accept love without prejudice? I trust your insight would be beneficial from the sincere and profound reply<br>you have posted thus far.<br><br>Seperate issue, you mentioned that a player by rationale should have no qualms taking a relationship easy without finding hard to let go right ? With the risk of sounding absurd, I am actually a soft hearted person. My current situation would have easily been resolved by terminating B and cutting off all contacts if I<br>was callous enough. Do you understand why I find it hard to bring up the seperation issue to B now?<br><br>Anyway I really appreciate your advise, it is wise and unpretentious. Out of curiosity, what is your profession? You seem to have a very analytical mind<br>and surpassing articulation skills. It was indeed my pleasure to correspond with you. Have a lovely day ahead.<br><br>Cheers</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> How can you accept love without prejudice?<br><br>You just have to return back to the self when 'S' manifested it out from your life when you were in aussie.<br><br>You have been there before - you know the road to unlock that route; just that you have chose not to. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Seriously, it depends on whether you prefer to pursue a relationship driven out of love or fear.<br><br>Fear is a huge black word that covers all aspects of negativity that you employed to protect yourself and your ego.

            <div class='col-md body'>Scion, oh dear Scion.. Â…. YouÂ’re Machiavellian ainÂ’t you? From my analytical prognosis, you r not, I REPEAT NOT seeking any advice on your R/S at all!!! YouÂ’re confidant, and extremely succinct on how best to tread the path moving forward, re: S &amp; B.<br><br>From your lengthy elaboration placing special emphasis in painstakingly describing the prowess of B and how well your present status matches up or perhaps suppress S, isnÂ’t it obvious that everything only serves to levitate and heighten your own self worth and apparent status?  What youÂ’re probably trying to do (be it intentional or unknowingly) is to pen out your Â“self alleged accomplishmentsÂ” into the forum and take a back seat, Â“enjoyingÂ” the responses (be it judgmental, condemnatory, encouraging or praise worthy) which only serves to rub and augment yr already HUGE male ego. Juz imagine that, from a jilted, unaccomplished GFN a few years ago, you have morphed into a distinguished professional with a penchant of twirling accomplished females around your little finger and whose forte is anything from hedge funds to entertainment!!! Wow, impressive isnÂ’t it!!<br><br>Nevertheless, kudos must be given for your remarkable applications of quotes from the financial guru and theories from the Russian academic. Well let me guess your statusÂ… A hotshot novelist / journalist? An accomplished corporate warrior? Or perhaps even a distinguished academic yourself??? Â….Nah!! Your profile betrays a Â“man on the streetÂ” that has recently climbed out of mere meritocracyÂ…. And I bet you are gloating over that Â“self perceived great triumphÂ” and grinning teeth to teeth right now as we are speaking!!! Well.. you are probably armed with a recently attained Masters or Doctorate degree too from the free flowing inputs of theoretical expressionsÂ….it really screams Â“I am fresh out of school Â”  Your Â“worksÂ” are genuinely significant and flows like sparkling water from the ice alpines, yet it lacks the profound subtlety and modesty to conceal an overbearing effort in reiterating your apparent success in life and conquers over women.<br><br>Do B a big favor would youÂ… Drop her like a smoldering piece of charcoal right now!!! (I believe thatÂ’s already in the cards before and without this entire forum thingy in the 1st place!!!) And I presume given your psychological mastery, it has already been done with tact and discreet. Its time for you to BMW with your newfound confidence, knowledge, status, pursuits blah, blah, blahÂ…..<br><br>S would always remain unblemished in your eyes, though she and you would never be together ever again. She was the one that truly touched your heart, yet she was also the one that awaken the dormant narcissism in you. Your dreadful alter-ego is unveiling itself to her bit by bit, yet her deliverance would come in the form that you yourself would NEVER be interested to recommence this past relationship and rekindle a lost love..<br><br>Pain is but a transient phase. Your once foolhardiness has taken a great toll in your self perception and confidence. Yet, you have reshaped your destiny and mapped a shimmering road for yourself. Touch your heartÂ… Have you lost confidence in love??? I seriously doubt soÂ….. hold back your horses, youÂ’re not as bad as what you try to portray yourself to be and I sincerely believe the next serious Â“AlphabetÂ” would be a blessed soul Â– that would only happen after you have achieved sufficiently to slow down your pace and smell the roses around!!!<br><br>Just as a parting short, lets discuss KarmaÂ….<br><br>**Quote**<br><br>Â“Karma is a very subjective thing. Instead of getting worried about negative karma being built in this lifetime, many people including myself<br>would prefer thinking of it as amortizing the positive karma from the past lifetime.Â”<br><br>**Unquote**<br><br>That is absolutely true!!! I have been a cursed narcissist bitch all my life with the solace that I have suffered as poor lass spanning my entire past lifeÂ…  Perhaps we are people of the same kind, we feel alive when we are recognized for our superiority!!! Our blood burn in our veins and we can hardly wait!!!!!!!!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Been a while since I've read such a long and detailed post. Kind of refreshing.<br><br>------<br><br>The old saying goes, "Once bitten, twice shy". It sounded to me you fit the bill perfectly.<br><br>To let yourself love without restrictions and then betrayed, the incident have no doubt left scars in you. Your self-protecting mechanism, a direct result of the break up and the bruise in your ego, suppressed your ability to love.<br><br>The many flings you had were merely your subconscious reaction to the first breakup- your belief that the breakup is due to the fact that you're inferior to her in terms of studies and career success.<br><br>B is merely another victim of that self-protecting mechanism. You already know what you should do. You seemed to have made up your mind. Execute it.<br><br>You are only delaying the inevitable- the relationship between you and B were built on superficial reasons and fuelled by your own ego and pride. That is, in your case, definitely the wrong ingredients for a relationsip.<br><br>Yet the self-protecting mechanism can only protect yourself from consequent harms, but not the initial. You have not gotten over S after all- you've adopted a form of escapism from her, weaving for yourself a tale of "nonchalant outlook towards life".<br><br>In the end, it is only your subconscious trying to convincing you that she's the past.<br><br>In fact, she has never left your life- you still live under the shadow of her actions.<br><br>Forget about B- she deserves someone who can love her fully.<br><br>And forget about S- break out of that self-protecting mechanism. Love is one of the most primitive feelings built into humans, and it is powerful. Learn to love yourself. Life is too short for you to be nonchalant about it. Only when you start cherishing yourself (and your ability to love), can you truly break out of that shadow.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Good luck- Life is too short to be not taken seriously.</span></strong></div>
