              <p>that explains it. his family is rich, so he does not need to worry about money and future, as his family can provide for him even if he does not work.</p>
              <p>as a friend, you can advise him, but I doubt if he will listen to you. if you keep advising him, he will find you a bore and a nag and may soon dissociate with you. if his parents do not worry, so why you worry.</p>

              <p>Since this topic is about rich and poor kids, here's an excerpt:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Brain function was measured by means of an electroencephalograph (EEG) -
               basically, a cap fitted with electrodes to measure electrical activity 
              in the brain - like that used to assess epilepsy, sleep disorders and 
              brain tumors.</p>
              <p>"Kids from lower socioeconomic levels show brain 
              physiology patterns similar to someone who actually had damage in the 
              frontal lobe as an adult," said Robert Knight, director of the institute
               and a UC Berkeley professor of psychology. "We found that kids are more
               likely to have a low response if they have low socioeconomic status, 
              though not everyone who is poor has low frontal lobe response.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"This is a wake-up call," Knight said. "It's not just that these kids 
              are poor and more likely to have health problems, but they might 
              actually not be getting full brain development from the stressful and 
              relatively impoverished environment associated with low socioeconomic 
              status: fewer books, less reading, fewer games, fewer visits to 
              museums."</p>

              <p>Give him time to learn from his own choice of path. He'll wake up one day on his own when his life is no longer comfy and smooth... There are times when well meaning words alone are useless. Real-life experiences will touch him more in his case, since he'll probably think you're jealous of his life now.</p>
