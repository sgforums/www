              <p>One more thing... He's very possesive, any time of the day he would call me for no apparent reason...And when he sees a guy talk to me, he would be very aggressive in the way he talks to that guy... WTH????</p>
              <p>He's also studying but not working,,, So when we go out, i want to eat in a more expensive restaurant(can afford), he would drag me to the nearest coffee shop to eat... I dont mind paying for his meal...He could treat me for the movie or something... Everything he wants to pay...</p>

              <p>If something's not right somewhere, he's probably not the one. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Jokes aside, I'm rather shocked you still managed to think that 'everything was fine' after he confronted you. What even more flabbergasting is that you could still question if it's really your fault.</p>
              <p>A love relationship is fundamentally a recipocal emotional relationship between partners, who besides lovers are also best friends. The couple should learn and grow together; spurring each other on when the going gets tough. Also, it's a lot of acceptance - you know your relationship is doomed to fail when he can't even accept your lifestyle and you, his dress code! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>Do you want to date a guy who: (1) doesn't respect and accept you as his equal (2) put you down all the time (3) is jealous and possessive - <em>Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"> </em>(4) doesn't share the same vision and dream as you - <em>how can two walk together unless they agree.</em></p>
              <p>If your answer to the above question is an unwavering yes, then by all means go ahead.</p>

              <p><a href="http://armedforces.sgforums.com/users/238803">White_SoulReaper</a>, you should know that all the suggestions given about how you should deal with your relationship, these are just the opinions of each individual.. Please don't break up with with him after being "psycho-ed" by what we say here in this thread.. This decision should be made based on what you yourself think, you know..</p>
              <p>It all depends on how much you treasure this relationship with him, how far are you willing to go to tolerate till he comes to his senses.. He is definitely in the wrong, he needs to know that it IS a fact that he's in the wrong.. <strong>How he comes to his senses, I can't tell you how. Maybe the others can help suggest?</strong></p>
              <p>If you can't tolerate anymore, then you can consider breaking up with him in search of a better relationship..</p>
              <p>It's all up to you.. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/unused/sorry.png" alt="sorry.png"></p>

              <p><em>The thing is my BF thinks that i am not committed to the r/s because I dont spend enough time with him... I go out with him on most sundays.( sometimes go out with friends)... For the rest of the week I am busy with either school or work....</em></p>
              <p><em>One more thing... <span style="color: #ff0000;">He's very possesive</span>, any time of the day he would call me for no apparent reason...And when he sees a guy talk to me, he would be very aggressive in the way he talks to that guy... WTH????</em></p>
              <p><em>He's also studying but not working,,, So when we go out, i want to eat in a more expensive restaurant(can afford), he would drag me to the nearest coffee shop to eat... I dont mind paying for his meal...He could treat me for the movie or something... <span style="color: #ff0000;">Everything he wants to pay</span>...</em></p>
              <p><em>Is sg that hot ? <span style="color: #ff0000;">Every where he goes, he wears T-shirt, shorts and sandals... Nothing else... Even when meeting my parents...</span></em></p>
              <p><em>I am  a person with big dreams... And when i share my thoughts on how to persue these dreams, <span style="color: #ff0000;">he ALWAYS puts me down!!!</span></em></p>
              <p><em>We have been dating for 2 years BTW... Last night, he called and said that our r/s has strained... I thought everything was fine... <span style="color: #ff0000;">And he blamed everything on me...</span> He said that I should focus more on him...</em></p>
              <p><em>How? What should I do? Is it really my fault that he feels that way?"</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What is the matter with you?</p>
              <p>You want him to be your husband?</p>
              <p>You want him to be the father of your children?</p>
              <p>Yes, its your fault he feels that way.</p>
              <p>Because he is not compatible with you,</p>
              <p>you are too good for him. That's why he is not happy.</p>
              <p>He will destroy you, bring you down, and he will still not be happy.</p>
              <p>Do you want the unhappy life many uncles and aunties go through just for marriage sake?</p>

              <p>Erm. Why is TS supposed to SMS him? Did her boyfriend requested her to do so and she broke her promise? You actually sound like her boyfriend or something.</p>
              <p>But I would agree with you that the situation might have been better if TS could spend 5-10 mins each day with her boyfriend, or even a "Good Morning" and "Good Night" message would be good enough. TS, have you tried this yet?</p>

              <p>Indeed, communication is a crucial factor in a healthy relationship. So did you tell your girlfriend that you would actually like her to send you a little message each day?</p>
              <p>I think it's just that TS don't realize the great difference it can make if she sends a simple message to her boyfriend. But if the guy thinks it's something so important, instead of ranting it off, why not just let her know about it?</p>
              <p>Possessive behaviour may not be caused by a weak relationship alone, but also one's low self-esteem and lack of trust in the other party. But since neither of us know how's TS' boyfriend like, we can't really assume whether the fault lies in TS or him.</p>
              <p>And isn't one outing per week already good enough? Typically, an outing takes up half a day. To a final-year poly student who is also working part-time, I think that's quite a lot of time actually.</p>
              <p>Regarding the money and the ego issue, man, if that Parn ever comes in and reads the posts here, she'll flame you and her boyfriend to no end. Scary yea, but no joke about this.</p>
              <p>Anyway, to TS, if you don't mind going one step further for your guy, you can try to be considerate to him and organize outings that are wallet-friendly since he doesn't have a source of income yet other than just pocket money. It can be as simple as window shopping, or maybe a picnic at East Coast. You can still have your movie outings occasionally and even offer to pay for your own ticket, but when it comes to having meals, please go for somewhere affordable and allow him to foot the bill. If there's only one thing a guy can pay for for a girl he loves, it will not be her diamonds, her clothes, or her handbags, but her meals.</p>
