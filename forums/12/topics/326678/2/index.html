              <p><br>question yourself first....you say his possesive.</p>
              <p>do you have a flirtious nature?</p>
              <p>you say he call you everyday..isnt that good -_-. You mean, you want a boyfriend who contacts u only once a week/month and u know no shit about what his doing?</p>
              <p>he wants to pay, he wants to look like a man. Perharps you should sit down and talk to him about it, like, telling him its okay that sometimes u pay.</p>
              <p>his angry when u talk to other guys, how did u talk to the other guys? do you look like u were flirting? you should be glad his angry, instead of ignoring or even talking to other girls.</p>
              <p>he wears t shirt sandals shorts...did u talk to him about it? if even You, his girlfriend does not tell him about this, who is going to?</p>
              <p>If u're going to be his wife, you ought to point to him his mistakes and everything...he trusts u the most, and u should trust him the most too.</p>
              <p>about him pulling u down, maybe its his fault. He hasnt been in the NS yet, many guys are immature before NS.</p>
              <p>He blamed everything on you, i agree that is his fault. When theres a blame, the cause of it is never one, it is two or more.</p>
              <p> Think about it, what his friends may say about him? <br>" Eh, you gf no sms u one arh? why only go out once a week? you never see her other days? "<br>" why everytime she pay one, you love her money is it ?"<br>think...think...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Question oneself and take sometime to think before tackling a problem like this.</p>

              <p>When I say telling her about it, I don't mean sending her short messages and expecting her to reciprocate and do the same, but <strong>telling her in words</strong> that you would appreciate if she could spend a few minutes sending a text message to you each day.</p>
              <p>Or, you can try sending messages that elicit a response from her, like "How are you feeling today?" and stuff like that. If she doesn't even send a reply to such messages over a few days, you and her seriously need to take some time out and meet at somewhere quiet for a good talk about your relationship, and find out whether there's anything wrong. She may be unhappy with something you did or misunderstood you in some way; vice versa. The key is communication.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> In a relationship, derived from struggle between masculine and feminine roles, self-centrism on positioning often contributed to the root of BGR dissatisfaction because either side will formulate a structure of what they deemed as an appropriate patterns, personalities or behaviours required from their Significant Other (SO), while demanding the manifestation of this ideal. Almost like a mannequin, with no life force - one must understand that every human being is unique, hence it's difficult to fashion their style and personality into a structured model.</p>
              <p>Of course there are ways to do it, but that's another topic for another day.</p>
              <p>This give rise to incompatibility, which are often unrevealed until the birth of the relationship and later. Most people coped with such indifferences with various degrees of adjustments and compromising, but there are bound to be cases where major discord will materialize through the latent dysfunctional effect of incompatibility. Many times, it crippled the relationship until gradual death occurs or it simply grants instant annihilation.</p>
              <p>Your man presents a classic male chauvinist in Love - the insecure male constantly exerting implicit pressure on their other half, through the eyes of his distorted perception and fear of competition from the other more seemingly 'competent' males. The actual concept of competency doesn't matter in this case, in fact everyone will appear to him as a potential contender. A male chauvinist often finds it a burden to change their attitude because he rationalize his personality as 'fixidity' and often claimed that his possessiveness and jealousy are 'natural behaviour' of being boyfriend. Thus he is unmotivated to change himself (being causal in his dressing, unromantic, or whatever) and choose to mask his insecurity by coercing his partner to demote her beliefs to his values.</p>
              <p>Finger pointing and believing that his woman is the cause of the strain in the relationship.</p>
              <p>Big dreams? Ah, hack it - your place lies in the kitchen and tending the kids. Forget about having a social life too. If you don't obey, you are the strain of the relationship.</p>
              <p>In this contemporary era, the evolution of Love also changes as society transformed itself. The patriarchal perceptive, roles and function of what a relationship ought to be is waning and there is a greater calling for mutual respect and consideration in what's better for the relationship as a whole and not some specific parts.    </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>First Law of Love states: it is we who chose our partners, not the other way round.</strong></span> You make the decision to be with him two years ago and now you are lamenting about this drastic incompatibility you are finding yourself at odd with - wouldn't it question the identity of the relationship and the reason that give birth to it's existence?</p>
              <p>A male chauvinist is almost an affliction for life - they usually don't differ very much away from the formation of this personality because of cultural, social and reiterated self rationalizing - a faculty of the distorted mind and not from the pristine quality of the heart.</p>
              <p>Understanding this, you probably need a session - not to trash - but to decide how you want your relationship to move on from here. By dragging a relationship to continue in the original fashion probably only suggest delaying the inevitable. If there is something in the relationship worth fighting for and still relevant enough to remain, then some kind of agreement needs to be cast in stone and be adhered. <br>It would be wise to communicate first, before you decide upon departure.</p>
              <p>For everyone is entitled a chance to understand the alternate perspective of the relationship from their other half before any ultimatum is slammed upon them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>Care to share with us the reasons/expectations why you accepted him as your bf in the first place?</p>
              <p><br>If like what you have mentioned that he has always been and behaving like this, do you think you have changed and moved out of this relationship unconsciously?</p>
              <p>And yes, putting you down without any alternative suggestions is demeaning and it shows that he is not being supportive of you. A relationship requires both parties to be supportive of each other's strength and complement each other's weakness.</p>
              <p>You should have a talk with him when he's in a good mood, especially after spending some time with him or after a meal.</p>
              <p>Honesty is very important to a relationship and no matter how far or busy takes both of you away from the relationship. Honesty when together actually strengthens the trust in the relationship over time.</p>
              <p>Let him know what you feel and discuss one topic at a time, it's useless to dump the whole lot on him as he may be confused and paint a different picture in his mind. Then that would resolve nothing.</p>
              <p>If and IF all else fail, as in he is really stubborn and MCP....then be gentle on him and his ego/pride, and give in to him for a few days until you noticed a slight change in his attitude towards you, then try to place the blame of some topics on your weakness. If he loves you, he will be really tempted to "help" you and you will be able to get him to have a real discussion for those topics.</p>
              <p>If after placing all those blame on your weakness and he still doesn't feel tempted to "help" you. The answer would be obvious to both of you and you will be able to leave this relationship because of your self-inflicted "weaknesses". Either way, you have nothing to lose and it would be a good way to test his love for you and if you still exists at a place in his heart.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> In a relationship, derived from struggle between masculine and feminine roles, self-centrism on positioning often contributed to the root of BGR dissatisfaction because either side will formulate a structure of what they deemed as an appropriate patterns, personalities or behaviours required from their Significant Other (SO), while demanding the manifestation of this ideal. Almost like a mannequin, with no life force - one must understand that every human being is unique, hence it's difficult to fashion their style and personality into a structured model.</p>
              <p>Of course there are ways to do it, but that's another topic for another day.</p>
              <p>This give rise to incompatibility, which are often unrevealed until the birth of the relationship and later. Most people coped with such indifferences with various degrees of adjustments and compromising, but there are bound to be cases where major discord will materialize through the latent dysfunctional effect of incompatibility. Many times, it crippled the relationship until gradual death occurs or it simply grants instant annihilation.</p>
              <p>Your man presents a classic male chauvinist in Love - the insecure male constantly exerting implicit pressure on their other half, through the eyes of his distorted perception and fear of competition from the other more seemingly 'competent' males. The actual concept of competency doesn't matter in this case, in fact everyone will appear to him as a potential contender. A male chauvinist often finds it a burden to change their attitude because he rationalize his personality as 'fixidity' and often claimed that his possessiveness and jealousy are 'natural behaviour' of being boyfriend. Thus he is unmotivated to change himself (being causal in his dressing, unromantic, or whatever) and choose to mask his insecurity by coercing his partner to demote her beliefs to his values.</p>
              <p>Finger pointing and believing that his woman is the cause of the strain in the relationship.</p>
              <p>Big dreams? Ah, hack it - your place lies in the kitchen and tending the kids. Forget about having a social life too. If you don't obey, you are the strain of the relationship.</p>
              <p>In this contemporary era, the evolution of Love also changes as society transformed itself. The patriarchal perceptive, roles and function of what a relationship ought to be is waning and there is a greater calling for mutual respect and consideration in what's better for the relationship as a whole and not some specific parts.    </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>First Law of Love states: it is we who chose our partners, not the other way round.</strong></span> You make the decision to be with him two years ago and now you are lamenting about this drastic incompatibility you are finding yourself at odd with - wouldn't it question the identity of the relationship and the reason that give birth to it's existence?</p>
              <p>A male chauvinist is almost an affliction for life - they usually don't differ very much away from the formation of this personality because of cultural, social and reiterated self rationalizing - a faculty of the distorted mind and not from the pristine quality of the heart.</p>
              <p>Understanding this, you probably need a session - not to trash - but to decide how you want your relationship to move on from here. By dragging a relationship to continue in the original fashion probably only suggest delaying the inevitable. If there is something in the relationship worth fighting for and still relevant enough to remain, then some kind of agreement needs to be cast in stone and be adhered.<br>It would be wise to communicate first, before you decide upon departure.</p>
              <p>For everyone is entitled a chance to understand the alternate perspective of the relationship from their other half before any ultimatum is slammed upon them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>I'm doing it already. Sending her short SMS each morning and
              night. Maybe to it, it's just another bored routine junk SMSes that
              she receive everyday.</p>

              <p>That's considerate, yet it became predictable and boring after a while.</p>
              <p>SMS should be sent out not out of obligation, but because you really have something to say and that something has better be more meaningful than "good night" or "I love you". Those phrases are meaningful but say them too much and they will become a bore to the girl.</p>
