              <p><br>Agreed. Agreed. Agreed.</p>
              <p>Dressing up is one issue but leaving a good impression with your parents at the least is very important. If he can't even do that, he will not achieve anything in this image conscious world.</p>
              <p>Dumping him is giving him time to grow up, he is filled with insecurities and possesiveness, possesiveness being a chaine effect from insecurities, and that is rooted from his conscious image of him himself.</p>
              <p>Good call. As for paying for meals, personally I am not against the idea, but I only agree from time to time(after paying for a few dresses and shoes and feeling broke). Thus far, I've never eaten hawker fare with my current GF because she deserves well. Only time I've eaten it with her was with my grandmum, which I appreciate her effort to come down and dine with us.</p>

              I guess the boyfriend also has his reasons for behaving how he behaves? Many people here commented on his 'ego', but then again maybe he's seriously just scared to lose her? Plus he's a guy ... and you know how guys are ;)
              
              But seriously, TS, if he's dragging you down I think you should talk to him about it. And if he doesn't understand or doesn't make an effort to change/keep you, then what can you do about it? Maybe he just doesn't understand how you feel/ doesn't truly recognize that he's stiffling your dreams.
              
              But then again, he seems pretty insecure.

              <p>The thing is my BF thinks that i am not committed to the r/s
              because I dont spend enough time with him... I go out with
              him on most sundays.( sometimes go out with friends)...
              For the rest of the week I am busy with either school or
              work....</p>
              <p>One more thing... He's very <strong>possesive</strong>, any time of the day he
              would call me for no apparent reason...And <strong>when he sees a guy
              talk to me, he would be very aggressive in the way he talks to that
              guy... WTH????</strong></p>
              <p>He's also studying but not working,,, So when we go out, i want
              to eat in a more expensive restaurant(can afford), he would drag me
              to the nearest coffee shop to eat... I dont mind paying for his
              meal...He could treat me for the movie or something... Everything
              he wants to pay...</p>
              <p>Is sg that hot ?<strong> Every where he goes, he wears T-shirt, shorts
              and sandals...</strong> Nothing else... <strong>Even when meeting my parents...</strong></p>
              <p>I am  a person with big dreams... And <strong>when i share my
              thoughts on how to persue these dreams, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">he ALWAYS puts me
              down</span>!!!</strong></p>
              <p>We have been dating for 2 years BTW... Last night, he called and
              said that our r/s has strained... I thought everything was fine...
              And he blamed everything on me... He said that I should focus more
              on him...</p>
              <p>How? What should I do? Is it really my fault that he feels that
              way?</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> In a relationship, derived from struggle
              between masculine and feminine roles, self-centrism on positioning
              often contributed to the root of BGR dissatisfaction because either
              side will formulate a structure of what they deemed as an
              appropriate patterns, personalities or behaviours required from
              their Significant Other (SO), while demanding the manifestation of
              this ideal. Almost like a mannequin, with no life force - one must
              understand that every human being is unique, hence it's difficult
              to fashion their style and personality into a structured model.</p>
              <p>Of course there are ways to do it, but that's another topic for
              another day.</p>
              <p>This give rise to <strong>incompatibility</strong>, which are often unrevealed
              until the birth of the relationship and later. Most people coped
              with such indifferences with various degrees of adjustments and
              compromising, but there are bound to be cases where major discord
              will materialize through the latent dysfunctional effect of
              incompatibility. Many times, it crippled the relationship until
              gradual death occurs or it simply grants instant annihilation.</p>
              <p>Your man presents a classic male chauvinist in Love - the
              insecure male constantly exerting implicit pressure on their other
              half, through the eyes of his distorted perception and fear of
              competition from the other more seemingly 'competent' males. The
              actual concept of competency doesn't matter in this case, in fact
              everyone will appear to him as a potential contender. A male
              chauvinist often finds it a burden to change their attitude because
              he rationalize his personality as 'fixidity' and often claimed that
              his possessiveness and jealousy are 'natural behaviour' of being
              boyfriend. Thus he is unmotivated to change himself (being causal
              in his dressing, unromantic, or whatever) and choose to mask his
              insecurity by coercing his partner to demote her beliefs to his
              values.</p>
              <p>Finger pointing and believing that his woman is the cause of the
              strain in the relationship.</p>
              <p>Big dreams? Ah, hack it - your place lies in the kitchen and
              tending the kids. Forget about having a social life too. If you
              don't obey, you are the strain of the relationship.</p>
              <p>In this contemporary era, the evolution of Love also changes as
              society transformed itself. The patriarchal perceptive, roles and
              function of what a relationship ought to be is waning and there is
              a greater calling for mutual respect and consideration in what's
              better for the relationship as a whole and not some specific parts.
                 </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>First Law of
              Love states: <span style="color: #ff0000;">it is we who chose our partners, not the other way
              round.</span></strong></span> You make the decision to be with him two
              years ago and now you are lamenting about this drastic
              incompatibility you are finding yourself at odd with - wouldn't it
              question the identity of the relationship and the reason that give
              birth to it's existence?</p>
              <p>A male chauvinist is almost an affliction for life - they
              usually don't differ very much away from the formation of this
              personality because of cultural, social and reiterated self
              rationalizing - a faculty of the distorted mind and not from the
              pristine quality of the heart.</p>
              <p>Understanding this, you probably need a session - not to trash -
              but to decide how you want your relationship to move on from here.
              By dragging a relationship to continue in the original fashion
              probably only suggest delaying the inevitable. If there is
              something in the relationship worth fighting for and still relevant
              enough to remain, then some kind of agreement needs to be cast in
              stone and be adhered.<br> It would be wise to communicate first, before you decide upon
              departure.</p>
              <p>For everyone is entitled a chance to understand the alternate
              perspective of the relationship from their other half before any
              ultimatum is slammed upon them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>Love doesn't mean getting stuck in a relationship. Sometimes, one may love someone, but you realize that the person is not suitable for you.</p>
              <p>I have experience of being stuck in a relationship myself. I had tried to broach the subject of a breakup, but was quickly hushed up by him. In the end, after several years of relationship together, we still had to part whereas the incompatibility issue was actually present early in the relationship.</p>
