              <p>- I am assuming you must be a very young male with no idea how relationships work.</p>
              <p>If he loves his family but only wanted physical gratification, he can always go get it from his WIFE.</p>
              <p>The see dun touch is another self serving justification men tell themselves to avoid the feeling of guilt. In reality, looking  at or admiring other women when the wife is right next to him is just as insulting and hurtful to her.</p>
              <p>If you think women are just a bunch of meatbags with a vagina, you are so dead wrong. Women also need "physical gratification" , if she is not getting it from her husband, are you implicating it's ok for her to fulfill her physical needs from another man ? If that is so, may I know what is the purpose of "marriage" if each gender are to go sleep around with anyone for their unfulfilled "physical gratification" ?</p>
              <p>So for TS's case.. her husband is not having intimacy with her.. can she go and get her "physcial gratification" from  a sex service provider ? Or are you implying only men are "allowed" to seek physical gratification elsewhere but not the women ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While men likes to justify away his guilt and hide betrayals... believing.. in " what she doesn't know ain't gonna hurt her".... hence all the lies and denials.... Women are more logical and straight to the point.. most of us who doesn't want to hurt our love ones... SIMPLY do not commit the act of betrayal nor try to seek out one.</p>
              <p>Whatever lame excuses you come up with to justify men cheating.. are unfortunately.. unacceptable.</p>

              <p>Men really need to stop blaming women for their own shortcomings. Perhaps when this day of reckoning comes, only will men evolve into a better being.</p>
              <p>Of course men respond to physical stimuli, so do women. So I really do not know where you are going with using this as an "excuse". Wrong is wrong, no amount of "excuses" will justify a wrong behavior.</p>
              <p>Truth is... women tend to respect their husbands more than, husbands respect their women.</p>
              <p>Apparently this unbalance in mutual respect has a lot to do with the male ego.</p>
              <p>For most men are fearful with plenty of insecurities within. And through immoral ways  men deal with their insecurities, cheating, lying and what not, .. jeopardise their relationship with love ones, yet seeking forgiveness after tearing them apart. The paradox.</p>
              <p>Perhaps men will only behave, if they forever live in guilt, instead of simply enjoying the marital bliss they've worked so hard for.</p>
              <p> So there you go, if men wants women to think of them as more than some talking horn dog with no brains... all men really need to do.. is not act , think and talk like one. It's just that simple, really.</p>

              <p>Hire a PI first, and gather the evidence you need. Even if you're not gonna get a divorce. You need to be able to get the custody of the child should you divorce one day. The child would most prolly be neglected if you leave him with the husband, judging from his night life. </p>
              <p>Maybe the two of you need some time apart? Go back to your å¨˜å®¶ with your child. Make him realize that he needs you. Stop doing his laundry, stop cooking for him etc.. But note that this method MIGHT fail. He could eventually bring women back to your own house... </p>
              <p>Well, I know the emotional hurt that you are feeling.  The feeling of the love of your life touching another woman. Makes me sick. What's worse for me was, the 3 of us were friends... </p>
              <p>Just stay positive okay? :) I'm trying to move on too... </p>

              Ts,
              Muse over this,
               
              Two loving persons, may be married or not be married but there is a very slight possibility of using another to ''prop'' oneself or using extraneous agents (add in what comes to mind) to sustain it.
              On the other hand, two unloving persons use the word ''love'' and exploit each other, extract from each other what they can to fulfil themselves. Compromising is the game!
              This is not sustainable and along the way, it is a drudgery and all efforts and stances are unconsciously calculated n contrived to keep the marriage in order. 
              He is going to be what he is, rite or wrong; the choice at the end of the day is what u choose to be and also to know what of u is being revealed. His perceived ''wrongs'', by u and from u reveals u more than it does about him.

              <p>If he has nothing to hide, he won't need to.</p>
              <p>To feel guilty about invading his privacy? You must be kidding right? Does he work for the government with sensitive data on his phone that is highly classified? if not, I'd probably slap his face silly for acting so sneaky. </p>
              <p>There should be no secrets between husband and wife. Did he keep his undies on when he got you pregnant? privacy my kar cheng lah !</p>

              <p>Men really need to stop blaming women for their own
                  shortcomings. </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">More woman blame men for their real and perceived shortcomings</span></p>
              <p>Truth is... women tend to respect their husbands more than,
                  husbands respect their women.Apparently this unbalance in mutual respect has a lot to do with
                  the male ego.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Don't say a woman do it only to please a man. She needs a man around and hence is willing to do all the ego boosting.</span></p>
              <p>For most men are fearful with plenty of insecurities within. And
                  through immoral ways  men deal with their insecurities,
                  cheating, lying and what not, .. jeopardise their relationship with
                  love ones, yet seeking forgiveness after tearing them apart. The
                  paradox.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">For every man cheating there is 2 woman cheating. Don't come with statistics crap, men don't cheat with men. If few woman cheat with more men then they are slutsrus.</span></p>
              <p>Perhaps men will only behave, if they forever live in guilt,
                  instead of simply enjoying the marital bliss they've worked so hard
                  for.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">Marital bliss, tell it to the henpecker who takes out her PMS and what her friends said,why he is not romantic, or why he don't treat her like he used to after a days hard work, again and again to annoy and demoralize a poor soul</span></p>
              <p> So there you go, if men wants women to think of them as
                  more than some talking horn dog with no brains... all men really
                  need to do.. is not act , think and talk like one. It's just that
                  simple, really.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">So the woman can use 'I told you so" when it didn't go well and 'If you had listened to me, it would have been better' when it went well.</span></p>
