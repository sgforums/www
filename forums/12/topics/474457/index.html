              hi daylight,
              
              sorry to hear yr predicament.
              as an outsider, i shouldn't assume anything, i m trying to answer your questions based on my own opinion. some guys stray, some not. 
              unfortunately yours stray. but that doesn't mean he doesn't love u. he doesn't want sex could be he was too tired when he reached home.
              
              it will be better to talk to him, moreover, it is extremely dangerous to have multiple sex partners, more so with social sex workers, who are expose to unprotected sex.
              you should try to ask him to stop or seek a certified counsellor.
              
              if u still do not know how to approach him abt this, talk to your closest relative/friend to seek help.
              
              hope your issues could be resolved.

              One cannot change another with words and it never happens. One changes one's own behaviour and therein lies the resolution to the .... Stating preferences (one's own) is wiser as opposed to making another wrong.
              What he was and is now, is not circumstantial, rather the person he is, is manifesting itself. Circumstances do not create a person, it reveals and the sooner one gets used to it and acknowledges that, the better it is for one.
              As for love, is it really love or something esle pretending (masquerading) as love? Many confuse needs/expectations as love. All these matters and to feign ignorance is unconsciously sowing seeds of discord/disharmony for oneself and another or ..... The latter cannot be sustained for much too long. It is an accident waiting to happen!

              <p>Your husband will continue the betrayal as long as he thinks he is getting away with it. And yes, many men lies to get out of trouble. Thanks to you.. He obviously thinks his lies are working.</p>
              <p>A man is never sorry for what he did, he is only sorry because he got caught.</p>
              <p>The next time his phone ring and he is not picking it up. YOU go ahead and pick it up.</p>
              <p>The other woman may not be aware that she is dealing with a cheater, she may not even know he's already a married man and a father.</p>
              <p>So do yourself and that ignorant woman a favor. Let her know you are his wife, and if she persist, let her know she can have that piece of garbage you no longer wants.</p>
              <p>Let your husband know you are well aware of what he is doing, there is no need to stand on ceremony here. What are you afraid of , hurting his feelings ? Don't worry, he's a big boy.. he can handle it.</p>
              <p>He needs to know he can't have his cake and eat it too.</p>

              <li>If he changes ....because you and I both know that at the end of the day if he doesn't your life is ruined.<br></li>

              <p>Custody is awarded based on the best interest of the child, not how much money the parent earn.</p>
              <p>If the father had not been much involved with the care taking of the child, he really shouldn't be given sole custody of the young child.</p>
              <p>Obviously, TS's husband is more interested in servicing his own dick.. than be a good husband and a good father.  So, why would you want her husband to have custody ?</p>

              <p>All too often, a man will justify his action by drawing a line and convince himself that as long as that line is not crossed,  his action is not considered a betrayal or damaging.</p>
              <p>Example. Look but don't touch. </p>
              <p>Your husband probably thinks that as long as he is not caught with his pants down he's not betraying you.</p>
              <p>You need to be the person to draw the line, and tell him emotional betrayal is just as disrespectful and hurtful and you will not tolerate that kind of betrayal either.</p>
              <p>The most painful part of a betrayal is not about him putting his dick in another woman's vagina. It's really the DECEIT that cut the deepest. </p>

Being self-honest and acknowleding this lacunae in oneself may stand one in good stead to come to terms with one's cirumstances.. Otherwise, it is being incarcerated in one's predicament and suffering immensely cos extraneous agents (whatever comes to mind) may not elicit fulfilment.
