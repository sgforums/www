The society is very realistic, people judge U based on PAPER<br>QUALIFICATIONS. I am NOT QUALIFY to associate with all these HIGH CALIBRE citizens -- I am not trying to be sarcastic but facts speak louder than words.<br><br>2. There will always be a THIN LINE drawn between the 2 sides..........<br><br>3. I feel that the higher a person's qualification is, the more he/she lacks of Human warmness or "Ren Qing Wei"..............so pathetic. Do U agree?<br><br>I will never consider to participate in any of the co-host events in future. I will only join those by SDS. I still feel proud to be here.<br>Well, I myself also want to end the association fast (I feel no future) as I merely testing her out by asking her a simple question but ............... A simple question tells it all.<br><br>I have seen the ugly picture of human kinds...pathetic.<br>Any sad stories from SDU/SDS to share?</div>
