Said everyone who heard her tale just told her ... leave him. Said that I neglected her, did not appreciate her, didnt truly care for her needs, didnt share her interest, and was cruel, callous and nasty. Called and accussed her of all sorts of things and names during arguments.<br><br>Thinking back, I just feel so stupid. Always felt smug with myself for having such a beautiful girl in my life. And when she's gone, just a huge chunk of my life is gone. All the things she said was true. Every single word. ....<br><br>I just couldnt believe it at first.

She wants her own life and her own path.<br><br>We agreed to a 'cooloff period' but I think its just plain hopeless. Anytime we talk something more serious, beyond what 'friends' talk, she just balks and back off. She's just dead on the inside.<br><br>I'm just lost.
