I played a big part of it, being her support and giving her advice.<br><br>I guess I've begun to pay less attention to her as she grew older. Maybe it was just the familiarity, but partially also because I felt she no longer needed constant attention / guidance.<br><br>Somewhere a long the way, we started quarreling a lot, and everytime it happened, each of us withdrew a bit of ourselves from the relationship. Eventually, she just snapped.<br><br>At first I wanted her back, and wanted to make up. But now, Im not so sure. I am willing to change, and win her back, but for tat to happen, i guess she still has to have a little hope left. But i think even tat is gone now.<br><br>I guess all i want now is to know not feel so much pain anymore.</div>

I really appreciate it.<br><br>I guess there's always fear of the unknown. Even when making the decision to move on, there's this fear of never able to find someone just as special. Tat's why i guess there's still apart of me that hope things will get better, as at least, i know what im dealing with now.<br><br>Frankly, looking back, I dont think I made all the mistakes. Both of us have our share of pet peeves. I was just able to put up with her eccentricities better than her. In the end, she just didnt hv the tolerance and patience anymore.<br><br>You are right that I should reflect on the happy moments.

Well, now that it's gone, the way forward is not to dwell too long on the unhappiness but to just let it go. Time heals all wounds. I've been thru this and gone on to live an even better life. You can too. You just have to get your new life going. Once you are busy living your new life, you'll have no time to feel hurt and sorry and all the pain of the failed relationship will simply evaporate without a trace........  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div></blockquote>I see. I'll just have to keep myself busy until then. Forgetting something is never easy, especially if your whole life previously revolved around it.</div>

I've been talking to a lot of ppl, and they are all seem to agree on a few key things - that I should learn from this, I should move on, and focus on myself and make myself happy.<br><br>It makes a huge difference to know that even though u r suffering, there are still ppl that are concerned abt u. Like u guys ... It makes things more bearable too, that hearing there are ppl who hv gone through the same situation and still survived.</div>

Happy, sad, extreme grief, regret. I was feeling so clingy, that any scrap of attention she gave me I was so grateful and happy about it.<br><br>She said she just wants to be friends. So we talked about normal stuff and all. Yet when I tried to talk more serious things, she just either clams up or ...<br><br>She said she's just beyond all feelings of frustration and grief. Said everyone who heard her tale just told her ... leave him. Said that I neglected her, did not appreciate her, didnt truly care for her needs, didnt share her interest, and was cruel, callous and nasty. Called and accussed her of all sorts of things and names during arguments.<br><br>Thinking back, I just feel so stupid. Always felt smug with myself for having such a beautiful girl in my life. And when she's gone, just a huge chunk of my life is gone. All the things she said was true. Every single word. ....<br><br>I just couldnt believe it at first. Begged her to stay on - she said I could do watever i wanted, but she wanted no part of me anymore. No more pain, grief for her. She wants her own life and her own path.<br><br>We agreed to a 'cooloff period' but I think its just plain hopeless. Anytime we talk something more serious, beyond what 'friends' talk, she just balks and back off. She's just dead on the inside.<br><br>I'm just lost. There's so much more to tell, but I just cant think coherently. I've tried begging, pleading, cajouling ... nothing works. So much so I've begun to fear the pain that all this activities cause, when she just brushes it off.<br><br>She said there's no hope anymore. After talking for hours with her, I begun to see that.<br><br>Just lost and confused. Raw pain. Grief. Regret.

Just glad to hear from all of u.<br><br>But it wont be easy to do such a drastic change. I can only keep myself occupied to i wont be so down in the dumps all the time.</div>
