            <div class='col-md body'>You say, you would like to study more and get a better job with better pay.<br>May I suggest none of these and focus on financial education. Alot people leave school with high education and soon found themself working so hard everyday for money. Slave of money. When you get a higher pay job, what goes up? Your expenses and taxes as well as liabilities. So will all these liabilities goes away after your working days are over? NO. you still need to work for money and pay them. When you retire, how many days forward can the money you save during your working days last you? 10 years, 20 years....many people outlived their savings and what will happen? They are old and then they force themselves to go out and work for money again and start sitting in coffeeshop blaming the garmen this and that. School never teach you about money. They teach you how to work for money and not let money work for you. Focus on building passive income that will put money into your pocket every month for the rest of your life without you even working at all. That is call financial freedom.<br><br>What happens to a person who got good grades in school then find himself a high pay job?<br><br>When he gets a high pay job, what the 90% of them will do? Buy a nice house, get a nice car and higher taxes. Before they realise, they are deeply in debt and needs to cling onto job security for the rest of their lives in order to pay for his house, cars, taxes, high expenses. what will happen if he is fired? He is dead I tell you he will work so hard to please his boss in order not to get fired. NOW HE IS TRAPPED INTO WORKING FOR MONEY FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. Most of these kind of people will look good on the outside driving BMW, mercedes but if you look at their financial statement, he is 3 months away from bankruptcy. What if he got no paycheck for 3 months??? Where will his nice house and car goes? To the bank and auction off but he will still own the bank money after the bank auction off his items. He is broke..FLAT BROKE cuz all these are bought with with his money and installments are paid with his own money. And where all these money came from??? His hard work waking up everyday early in the morning going to work.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by LowfaT_yoghurt:<br><strong>Hello everyone!<br><br>I'm new here and have some problems.<br>I am 22 this year, with only ' N ' Level certificate ( All grade 4 ).<br>I have 3 years of experience in admin and customer service.<br>I have 1 year plus of experience in sales line.<br>I don't like to work in sales line.<br>To be clearer, I don't like to service people.<br>Even as a customer service officer.<br><br>My problem now is I will like to study so that I can get a better job with better pay.<br>[b]But what should I study? </strong><br>Some of my friends suggest I take private 'O' level while others suggest I take MDIS diploma.<br><br>Another problem is I don't have $ to study.My parents don't have $ to spouse me.<br>I am considering working part time waitress an hour $6 while studying self study private "O'<br>If work part time, I believe I will earn about $600 per month only.<br>What do you think of this?

It is a "do well in exam or die" situation. Ever watch the movie " catch me if u can"?  It was based on true story. Frank was 17 and he studied 2 weeks for his doctor or lawyer exam and he passed ( I forgot which).<br><br>I know having good education isn't going to make me rich or a better person but it is a good start. I am also thinkin to be a violin teacher. I stopped at grade 3. Must have a skill for living too, I think.<br><br>Anyway, take care, guys!
