            <div class='col-md body'>yo man. wat u can try is 6 months with u and 6months she can go back to visit her parents but u only visit her parents when u can get off lor. if i am not wrong alot of companys give their workers certain number of leaves. so u use that leave at the end of the yr or during their festive season.( japanese) isnt that wonderful? if a gal wants to quit her job and live with u that shows alot. that shows that she loves u alot. anyway she might also find a job here. right? if that is the case both of u can be together. if u dont feel like marrying so early live together for a start to see how. at least if anyting goes wrong u will not end up with a law suit. i know its hard to love someone fully when ur heart has been destroyed b4. but if u dont love u will never know.  as for the gap. it isnt that big of a deal. u can take some japanese lesson. culture can be picked up easily. like for example. when eating japanese like to slurp loudly if u dont it means the food isnt good and thats is a disrespect to the one cooking. and also tea serving (that 1 i dunno) but if i am not wrong japanese ladies are to serve the guys and guest wine or sake only. unless u r with ur guy friends only la. etc etc . other than that their culture and ours isnt much a diff. they r human so r we. i dont think its just u who is thinking of all this problems. i believe ur gf is also doing the same. that is also maybe why she wants to come over and be with u to know more of u and ur culture.  anyway give it a hard though its silly to give up a relationship becos its long distance. i have seen many do that ending up regretting it.<br>so good luck man <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Commitment is a BIG thing. Glad you've noticed that. Both of you are probably travelling at a different speed on a relationship... Possibly a different direction too?<br><br>Personal advices I'll give to you?<br><br>1. Slow her down a little if you're not ready for the many things. Of course, my guess would be that this might cause quite some drastic changes to the current situation? Then again... Things might not promise to be so bright even if it's travelling the original way it's supposed to be?<br><br>2. Stop or end this relationship. Or at least pull a brake to it. All things are going too fast for you. You might be giving her the 'wrong idea'. (if you have any idea of what's going on for yourself?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) All things in the end might just end up quite badly...

In your situations, it's very difficult to see much future in your relationship because the odds are terribly overwhelming. You can only know if this relationship if for you ONLY after you have lived together for a period of time. Love is great, feeling is strong - but we must not let that influence and blind us to our risky future. You have to anticipate problems way before it arrivals and hits you in the face because <strong>your relationship is so fragile</strong> - you need to shield them from the hostile wind and build up a steady foundation before you expose them to 'experience'.<br><br>You can attempt this relationship and your objective of this move  has to be: Minimize possible risk. Culture difference can be respected and learned, but as for language, it's truely a feat on the strength of your relationship. There are some 5 pointers that you have to have before you can consider this relationship:<br><br>I) I hope financially, you are independent and no problem with that because if that wasn't the case, I advise you to drop this relationship. Too much problems thrown in a relationship can instantly kill it before you can find ways to salvage. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) Mentally and emotionally you have to be <strong>10 times more </strong>understanding and stronger. Temper has to be curb. Empathy place with intiative and decision making. Your mind and heart must be prepared and trained to see that this relationship WILL NOT be a smooth going one (like all true love). Rewards in this relationship can only be felt <strong>AFTER</strong> you spend mutual effort in maintaining and upkeeping this relationship.<br><br>III) You have little choice; to understand culture, you have to begin by studying their language. You can go to my ex-school (<a href="http://www.ikoma.com.sg" rel="nofollow">www.ikoma.com.sg</a>) Lack of communication or mis-communication are the top killers in relationship. See, when you wrote an email to her saying that this relationship may be a little difficult and everything, she became defensive and blasted back at you. THIS IS MIS-COMMUNICATION. Imagine if you were to have real life issues with her but you can't find a common ground to talk things out... this could mean certain death. You may want to say something, but she interpret them differently or vica vista.<br><br>IV) An immediate jump to marriage is a no-no. I suggest if a title is critical, <strong>get engaged instead</strong>. In this way she could stay over for 3 - 6 months to get use to the life in here WITHOUT people talking. If you are taking foreign language class in say, Ikoma - there are many Japanese people there. At least when you can taking the class and she waiting for you to finish, she will get to know people of her own country - this minimize home sickness and establish networking.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>V) There is no room for 'what-if' <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WHEN YOU HAVE DECIDE TO PURSUE this relationship</strong></span> after considering Phrase I and II - be positive and ALWAYS employ the 'right' way to handle your own relationship. Drop previous bad habit (e.g. Break-patch, cold war, violence if applicable, etc). Both of you must share this common vision in your relationship before you can move to greater heights. <strong>Constantly encourage one another </strong>or even do little things to make the day happier.<br><br>Personal:<span style="font-style: italic;"> If I had my chance of that LDR... the yunhaier today would be so much different</span>.......<br><br>Cheers</div>

You can't just splash cold water on her and expect her to wake up? You can easily imagine the circumstance from there....<br><br>Try to slow her down in a more mild and gentle form... Note what Yun has mentioned about 'communication'. And probably my guess would be...? Cultural difference is coming in a bit now... Her cultural background... Her actions... Somehow I sense that the Japanese romantic dramas are drilling a bit too deep into some of their heads...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Nonetheless...?<br><br>Note this,<br><br>When you slow her down, hold on to her... Make sure that she don't fall on her own... She's doing alot for you... The worst of her fears would be you giving up on her... Like you've told us, tell her and let her understand you're not letting her go.... Give her a hand.... Let her know you'll be there for her....<br><br>APPRECIATES what she's doing for you... With appreciations would come alot of encouragement... It'll MOTIVATE her to move on and also at the same time not to have the wrong thoughts (remember the 'fear' I've mentioned earlier)....<br><br>Yes. Like what Yun have mentioned, it's not gonna be an easy task. But since you've made up your mind and choice?<br><br>Give it your BEST SHOT? And it'll help alot by doing it the right way for a start?<br><br>I wish you luck...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Devil and YuHaiEr have said alot. In every relationship, give in more but expect less.<br>What i suggest is to tell her about some of your plans for you and her in the future.<br>But you must do what you say, don't give empty promises. Give her a little surprise by communicating abit in japanese during your conversation with her.<br>Communication, trust and commitment is really important in LDR.<br>Give in, don't worry about the results. Call her often, show that you care for her and won't neglect her.<br>I have a failed LDR, you can read up my post and see what i had done wrong.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think there are 2 types of people in a relationship.<br><br>The hopeless romantic who opens their heart out to the one they love, do special things, give warm cuddles and "l love you" sms and phones every day, every hour and minute.

Holding hands is fine but thats as far as it goes.... it was quite funny when i was last in japan.

Because love is a world of your own - being expressive only exist in your world. Allow me to encourage you to be loving despite all these no-no thingy?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all.<br><br>I was reading this thread and Aargon's situation really reflects mine!<br><br>Well my situation: I went to Switzerland on student exchange, and I was thinking of just enjoying myself there, to get away from the stresses of studying in Singapore, and also have the opportunity to travel around Europe. I had never expected that I would find myself a girlfriend there!<br><br>I met a PRC chinese girl at one of my friend's birthday parties, and of course nothing much happened, but several weeks later I later met her on the street, and she recognised me. We exchanged numbers, and then we just started chatting, and I invited her to dinners which I was organising, with other international students of course.<br><br>With group travelling and the get togethers with other friends, I learnt more about her, and started to treat her like a good friend. At that time, I was not romantically inclined towards her.<br><br>We continued like this for about a month, and then just 1 week before I was to come back to Singapore, she sent me an sms to say she liked me very much. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> I was quite taken aback, as I never thought that someone would like me, and I never had the thought of getting a gf there, but I replied her sms and asked if she wants to be my gf. She said yes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Well with that, the last week we tried to spend some time together, even though I had also other farewell parties to go to. I grew to like her more during that one week, when we really had time together alone. Before I left Switzerland, I told her that if she were to find someone else, or if I were to to find someone else that we liked, then we would tell each other, and she agreed. That was the last time I saw her since, and we had been together for less than a week! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I initially thought that it would be difficult to maintain a LDR, and I wasn't very hopeful that it would continue. But somehow or other, we managed to call each other every day, we could chat for hours on end sometimes, and if we did not call, then we would send SMS. This has been going on for nearly 3 months now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>From the advice from everyone in this thread, i can really sense the need for communication, because it was only after we seperated that we were able to tell each other some of our inner most problems and secrets. I dont know if I could have said the things that I said to her face to face, but sometimes I really want to see her reaction, which I cannot, unfortunately.<br><br>It is fortunate that both of us can speak Chinese, her English is improving, so we dont have the language barrier that Aargon is facing. But I do have another problem.<br><br>She likes to use her father to compare with me. I think she loves her father very much, she says that her relationship with her father is like a close friend. Sometimes I get the feeling that she likes her father more than she likes me. I dont know why I feel like this.<br><br>And another problem - she is afraid that her father would object to our relationship, and she cannot clearly explain why to me why this is so, she says her father will be "disappointed" if he knew - which gives me the feeling that she is holding back something. Her father does not know that her daughter has a bf, but her mother does. Which is sort of strange to me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>I told her it doesn't matter to me too much, anyway i assured her that I just wanted to enjoy being in a relationship. But something tells me whether I should be getting more answers from her, or should I not? Why do I feel that her father can be a potential hinderance to our relationship? That is my first question.<br><br>The thing is that both of us are students, and with limited financial resources, this means I can only visit her in December this year. She cannot visit Singapore without her father not knowing - she needs a visa and a security deposit. I intend to fly to Switzerland this year end. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>But in any case, we havent talked about the future much. All I know is that she will go back to China after her studies, while for me, predictably, I will stay in SG to work. Is it true that for a relationship between two different nationalities, one party must "sacrifice", in the sense that if they do commit to one another (in marriage perhaps), that one party must "uproot" and move to another country? That is my second question. This question is rather far-fetched for now, I do realise, but I just want to know if this is really the case for couples with different nationalities.<br><br>Would really appreciate it if there is anyone out there who can give some advice! Thanks!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
