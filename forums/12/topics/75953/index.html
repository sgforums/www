            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I would like to hear from anyone who has been in, or currently are in, a long distance relationship.  I was wondering if you could comment on how difficult has it been and what you do to keep the relationship going?<br><br>I am in a long distance relationship with a japanese girl and want to know what I need to do to make it work.<br><br>What worries me about our relationship is not just the distance, but also the cultural differences we have. I cant speak any japanese and our relationship is based only on her ability to speak english (which is only at basic level).<br><br>I know that communication is the most important thing in a relationship and it worries me that this thing we have going isnt going to make it.<br><br>Anyones thoughts and opinions welcomed.<br></div>

I'm just scared we havent been through enough to even consider her coming here to live.<br><br>She has asked me what I planned to get married. I said not for another 2 years and she said the same for her too. BUT, by quitting her job and coming here that's practically married already... and plus I know that she will miss japan because she was actually home sick when she visited me here....<br><br></div></blockquote>oh... 5 weeks ah.. well thats kind of little, perhaps she feels its little too, and thats why shes coming over to spend more time with u?<br>shes so sweet... perhaps when she came over, u can spend more time with her... but as wat u said she will miss japan, so mayb u shd do something in return for her? like mayb 6 months in singapore, 6 months in japan? of course travelling expenses will be high though...<br><br>if there is some1 doing such a sweet things to me.. i will appreciate her and cherish her very greatly.. nvr let her go...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>5 weeks can actually produce deep love for each other. thats girl's deep feelings. we are sensitive creatures and guys should know about this<br><br>and staying together doesn't means your married okay...<br>my bf and i staying together for 3 years plus and we doesn't consider us as married couples.<br><br>don't like that la.. you know you love her too right?<br>why not starting out early rather than thinking unduly and come out with nothing?</div>
