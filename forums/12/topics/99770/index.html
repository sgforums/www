I'm so confused now that i can't think clearly anymore. I dunno if what i'm doing is right or wrong. I dunno if what i'm doing now is for myself or my family.<br><br>Everyday I gonna put up a strong front and face the challenges ahead and this is draining me dry. I'm mentally drained and emotional exhausted. I so sick and tired of it.<br><br>Is Life really so difficult? Or is it just me?</div></blockquote>Life can be really difficult at times... But it'll probably take YOURSELF to make it TWICE AS DIFFICULT....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

In fact I would think that 'telling you not to think too much' is quite an appropriate and GOOD advice for you... One thing about 'advices' is that sometimes they're NOT like pills and medications... After you've heard or taken them then you'll just feel SO MUCH BETTER... Sad to tell you but NOPE... Alot of times they just don't work that way...<br><br>What's the point of people telling you not to think too much and you still do it? What's the point of people asking you to change and yet you still don't...?<br><br>Of course practising better mental controls and not to think too much would take some time... But give yourself some room to BREATHE... GO OUT... ENJOY LIFE... Meet people and MEET MORE PEOPLE!!! Though some of them MIGHT SUCKS... Though some of them might even OFFEND you.. But that's just the way LIFE IS... Just like yourself offending others... Sometimes you just can't help much of it...?<br><br>BEING HAPPY is not about just putting up a HAPPY FACE... It's about WHAT YOU WANT and what you think YOU DESERVES... And if you think you deserves it, the WORK for it....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
