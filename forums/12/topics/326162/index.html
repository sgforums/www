              no harm trying out first. go out on dates like a friend and see what happens. who ever said a fairytale cant happen to you?
              
              human beings are contridicting creatures. when the right one doesnt appear, we wonder why he doesnt. or when someone before us isnt really what u want we complain. when he finally does, we think its too good to be true.

              <p>lol i agree with iwishiwilliwould....no matter what ppl will always think the opposite as a human reaction kinda thing...to guard urself from any harm that might come by...as much as it is safe to think so, it is oso impt that u dun put too much thought into it, or else u might b thinking too much in everything n ruin a potentially good ending for urself...</p>
              <p>oso as the rest haf said bah, juz b frens first then see how loh, sometimes our emotions cloud our judgement oso de...observe how he behaves in front of others, like when ur not arnd, n mayb get that info from others...then u can see what kinda person he is, whether he is truly what u think of him...if that cant ease ur worries, then the best thing is still to think less...afterall, even if u keep pondering over it, ntg is goin to come of it rite?juz makes urself more stressed=p</p>

              <p>?i was juz asking la not saying that ur one =x...n doesnt mean that if u can, u shld...there is so much more to what u shld do than what u can do...i can choose to play doesnt mean i haf to...there r consequences to everything u do, n its what kind of person u wan to become that decides what u shld or will do...a talent can b used in more ways than one, n i feel that its always better to use it in a way that no one gets hurt...</p>
              <p>n yes as forumers, if we make irresponsible comments that cause ppl to seperate, we wuld b at fault, yet at the same time, if we were to keep quiet at something we could haf helped, we wuld b guilty of not helping a person as well...i believe that we shldnt tell her what she has to do, but suggestions on what other choices n the pros n cons of each choice can still b given, as it wuld still b her decision on whether she shld take up the suggestion or leave it behind as juz a plain comment...</p>
              <p>hmm...i believe that everyone's destiny crosses many others in their whole lives, in a way or another u will affect others thru ur comments, ur actions, ur words...the fact that ur living, will interfere into another's destiny alrdy...i believe in helping if possible...but of course, we haf to b confident of what we r sayin as well as not to mislead others...any mistakes, said out can still b discussed...if juz kept to ourselves, we will onli think in our own way...</p>
              <p>dun wry i dun think its negative either, being direct is good n i like talkin to ppl who r more direct as its easier to talk things out that way...</p>
