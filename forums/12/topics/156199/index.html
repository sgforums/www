            <div class='col-md body'>Nothing u change will cause her to start loving you again. If there is something u muz change for her sake and not yours, then it will not last.

Wat u can do is tt u can chit chat abt current affairs, BGR wif ppl who r more senior. Btw, r u working or still schooling?

And during this time she attended her cousin's wedding and she just realised she dun picture marrying me.<br><br>She also told me she don't have feelings for me and it's a gradual process. the more she see of me the more she feel that i'm not the one that she will marry. and the more she see the more she feel that way.<br><br>I've told her i will try to make changes for her. the issue is that she feels i'm not mature enough in my ways and thinking.<br><br>she also said that at this point in time she dun love me.<br><br>she said she cant stop me from trying to revive our relationship. but she told me that i cant force her to love me . if i try and the outcome is the same then i just have to accept it.<br><br>previously in the past she've given me hints already but i failed to act upon it.<br>and what she wants is very simple. Someone who is mature in his ways and thinking and who can lead her and her family in the right way ( apparently my misbehaviours are too glaring )"<br><br>Hi gustowind i think your problem is not unsolveable<br><br>i will show u a few tips that  u can use...<br><br>1) Her mum is sick and you were not are when she needs you the most and she feels that u have forsake her..is normal ..she suffer from a lack of security. Girls need someone by their side no matter how big or how small the problem is. Have you ever wonder how it is like to see a love one so sick and u cannot do anything about it. It can really hurts alot..<br><br>2) And during this time she attended her cousin's wedding and she saw how happy the couples together walking hand in hand and she realies where the hell is my love one ? why she is he not beside me at all. Her thoughts will run wild and  her small lttile heart also feel the pain.. She long for someone to be beside her to hugz her and hold her hand and say I will be there for you..<br>Sadly her heart pain grows bigger and bigger ...till she ask herself why should I have a bf who does not care a single bit about me at all..<br><br>3) her feelings are still there if you look carefully, never trust fully what a girl says..  if she really do not love you anymore she will not tell u so nicely and give u so much time and chance to patch back.<br><br>Actually I want u to ask yourself are you willing to change ? If not let her go..<br>no point forcing yourself again and again... to suit her needs.. Seeing her mum like that had made her grow up alot.. she really needs someone there to take care her more than ever before... Ask yourself can u seriously change ?<br>that means no more fooling around and start to think of earning an income to provide for the one you love..<br><br>I really hope that u can think over this very properly...If you chose to accept her that will mean you have to take good care of her family... you may had to work longer hours to provide for her but if you truely love her this will not be a problem. If not I really hope that you let her go nicely, she really needs someone who can protect her and to support her family... I went thru what she had been through so I know her feelings well...<br><br>Take your time to think carefully the path you chose as it will effect your life and hers.. Is not a game anymore is real life now..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>gustowind<br>You have a choice to pursue or let go<br><br>My opinion from what she tells you (filtered through you) is that she has her mind pretty made up and cannot be swayed.<br><br>I think you should give her up because she isn't fond of you anymore.  Your chances of success seem low.<br><br>Also your previous questions about maturity and "how to be more mature" is almost impossible to answer.  You'll have to give examples of what you did that is immature, before anyone can comment on it.<br></div>
