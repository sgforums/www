            <div class='col-md body'>Welcome to the painful world of exercising, or rather trying to keep fit.<br><br>From your other thread, I shall assume that you are female although I may be wrong.<br><br>Seems like you have a problem with general fitness.<br><br>If you feel breathless now, it is perhaps because you are being too ambitious in your training.<br><br>Take it one step at a time. Start slow, start small.<br><br>First, try taking it slowly by slow jogging, as in really really slow and small steps, for 15 mins. Do it 3 times a week on alternating days. Do not be too ambitious and go threadmill immediately. Even then, try doing a low speed at first. The most important principle is to start slow then progress when you feel that you can handle it better (eg after 2 weeks and you find your current regime gives you no kick). Do not straight away go for high speed running on the threadmill for an hour unless you are ready for a marathon.<br><br>From what I infer, you are trying to lose weight so why not just do slow jogging at first for 15 mins straight, rest for half hr, then do another set of 15 mins. When you are comfortable, start increasing in small increments of 3~5 mins. Then keep progressing until you are able to slow jog for 30 mins straight. Do not bother running or jogging fast as those merely help you build muscles and make you heavier instead of lighter (muscle weigh more than fat for the same volume).<br><br>I am no fitness expert but this was the regime I put myself through when I had to past my NAPFA this year (I am male btw). If I believe I managed to shave 2 mins off my 2.4 and go from 0 to 7 pull-ups in 5 mths (not superb progress I guess but enough for me) using this regime, I believe it should help you lose weight and increase your general level of fitness.<br><br>Good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Because it is easy, you will not lose interest and stop.<br><br>As you walk, you will find yourself walking longer and faster, gradually.<br>To be cool about walking, go walk by the seaside, or round the neighourhood or to buy something.<br><br>I walk, moderate speed,,  5 - 6 km/hr ,almost every weekday morning when it is cool for an hour.  Weekends , I sleep in.<br>When I am too lazy to go out, I turn on the tv and walk as I watch my favourite programme.<br><br>I have written three chapters in my blog about walking: "Walking and our Fats", "Power Walking" and "Shape Walking".  Walking and eating low carb, low fat, high fibre and high protein helped me lose 14 kg to my current weight of  49 to 50kg.  Not only that, I am healthy as proven by health examinations and blood tests.<br><br>My lunch today is 10 sticks of satay and 3/4 of a cucumber with some sauce. chinese tea and my exercise today (it is school holiday, so I can't go out as much as I want), 1 hour infront of Chanel News Asia.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>p/s: you may want to check with a doctor about your health.<br><br></div>
