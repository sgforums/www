              <p>My advice to you is tell your wife to give birth at her country. Ask your mum in law to look after her . Alternative is to a rent a room in JB or Batam. But you must get a friend to accompany her when you are away.</p>
              <p>2nd choice is to build a tent in Changi beach or East coast . Do it after night fall  and cleared in the morning. Shower will be in public toilet.</p>
              <p> If your wife is going to give birth at KK tell them owed first and then pay by installment. They cannot turn away you .</p>
              <p>Try building your savings ..if cannot then you have to follow her to her country and build your future there.</p>

              Trangloh listen here. Why should you apply for student pass for your step daughter when she already has a long term visit pass? No need for that student pass....just register her for the kindergarten.

              Yes, correct. If your spouse is not a Singaporean or a PR, HDB will reject your application for the one room one hall rented flat. Even if you see your MP in your constituency is not going to help you. 
                  
              Best solution now, you can go to JB and rent a single terrace house with 3 bedrooms for RM300 to RM500 a month, excluding the water and electricity bills...don't worry its cheap. 
                  
              Since your wife and step daughter have long term visit pass, you and your family can live in JB, no problem. Don't worry about JB immigration have to stamp your wife and step daughter passport each time upon entry and exit. You, your wife and step daughter can apply for the macs system whereby you do not have to go through the normal JB immigration counter for social visit pass stamp or exit stamp. With macs system, you just need to have the passports scanned at self-entry/exit machine in JB. To apply for macs system, it will cost you Rm30 for a year validity. 
                  
              In Singapore, you, your wife and step daughter can apply for the passports to be scanned and finger print instead of going to the immigration counter for passport check during entry to Singapore or exit from Singapore to JB. I think when you apply for that you need to pay $30 for each passport and the validity of using that immigration clearance will concide with your wife and step daughter LTVP expiry date. You can apply for that immigration clearance system at the departure hall at Woodlands Checkpoint, no need to go to ICA HQ at Lavender Road. 
                  
              When you stay in JB with your family, at least you can still go to work in Singapore and return to JB after your work in Singapore. At least you have a good shelter for your family and good proper home again. If you managed to do all this, I assure you, your life will be back like normal again and it will even gives you a better life that you had while living in Singapore. 
                  
              I think is best your wife give birth in her own country if you can't afford it and if can afford it better still because with that child your wife will be able to be a PR and later SC in the future. You can do all the abovementioned after she has given birth. 
                  
              Hope this information helps you. Good luck to you and your family.
