              <p>Realised a month ago, my quite close classmate cutting his forearm, not wrist. He looked very normal, we used to be close as we often run 2.4km together until both of us slim down alot. </p>
              <p>During the recent 2-month holiday he came back with piercing on his ear, trendy glasses etc. From quiet nerd to gangster, O_o</p>
              <p>One day, I came up to class early after recess and found him sitting behind the wall taking the pen-knife cut his hand, alot of blood. I ask him to stop and he was like "Just leave me alone for awhile...." He stop for a week after that, and continued soon later. He just did it today and there is about 80 cuts in total! The counsellor is helping him and even assisted his best-friend to take care of him.</p>
              <p>I tried to stop him and ask him why he did it but he keep saying it's 'shiok' and has a nice feeling, I never got the answer as to why he did it but I remember him briefly saying that his family is always not at home last year but he immediately changed the topic when I tried to question further.</p>
              <p>Can anyone help me how to stop him when I see him cutting next time? It's his own hand but being his classmate, I think I should show concern, or should I?</p>
              <p>Please advice.</p>

              <p>fyi, when you see lots of blood flowing, your friend might go into a Hemorrhagic shock..</p>
              <p>the 1st thing you should do is to find a clean cloth or t-shirt &amp; apply pressure to stop the bleeding..</p>
              <p>and also please call 995 for an ambulance..</p>

              <p>Just continue to update your counsellor and ask for advice from him.....</p>
              <p>It's not clear from your description.....is he enjoying the adrenaline or is he having family problems at home.....(because you say he pierce his ears so maybe this is just a similar thing)</p>
              <p>Anyway I have a suggestion that maybe is suitable to you and is more subtle.....</p>
              <p>Just try to cheer him up and make him less obsessed about cutting himself......you can do this by talking to him more, joking with him, bring him to do some sports like running or cycling, or going to arcade and play games.......and maybe also ask several other friends (a group) to go together...</p>
              <p>Maybe this way his emotions wont be depressed and frustrated anymore.</p>

              <p>@Veggie Bao Okay, maybe next PE lesson I will jio him run with me 2.4km, or maybe walk up to him and chat with him. I think it is more of problems ba, I see him crying when he make the first cut.</p>
