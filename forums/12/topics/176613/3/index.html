            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that when I was your age, where reason has no bearing on emotional decisions, I will definitely try to "win" her back if I were in your shoes. However, from the viewpoint of an outsider, I honestly feel that she likes the other guy, or she is weary of your relationship, which is based on almost nothing. I think the best thing you can do, if you intend to do anything at all, would be to talk to her. Be direct and avoid beating around the bush. Don't drag.</div>

She's still reserved her rights to go out with her friends, and her friends doesn't necessary has to be girls only or people who doesn't makes you jealous. Yes, there are always guys out there waiting and waiting for the both of you to break up or wait for her to dump you. But no matter how long they are willing to wait, they're still stucked in the 'nth' runner-up position while you're 1st position. There isn't any need to be jealous or possessive really, she will leave you if she's really bent on dumping you for someone better. And when she really does that, you'll have to blame yourself for it and no one else. Respect her as a friend (That's why it's called GirlFriend, luckily there's still a Friend word in 50% of it.) and love her as a girl. Try putting yourself in her position for once and perhaps you'll understand a bit of her behaviour.<br><br>Remember...<br>GirlFriend should means someone who's better or at least equivalent of your best friend. So you should trust her as you would trust your best friend on the friendship (The attachments of the hearts never dies), respect her as you would of your best friend (They are still in control of their own life and they don't need to please you every single time you're together), love her as a girl (You can shower your one-sided love on her anytime without breaking the law). Love is reciprocal and she'll respond back to your love cos girls will know if they're being loved or not. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck, and do change your mindset and behaviour towards her before she's forced to dump you. And do not feel bad if she doesn't respond well enough for your expectations, and don't bother to try forcing her to give you a reason for it. Girls are beyond reasoning cos they're emotional creatures, something rational creatures like Guys couldn't comprehend in eternity. Just do your part and love her, she'll follow-up in her own pace. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My advice to you is to keep your mind open.  The result of the chat may go in favour to you or may not.  If you have a high expectation from the chat, you may disappointed greatly.  Be cool about it and chat like a regular friend and try to find out more about her feeling towards you.  Respect her with the decision she made.
