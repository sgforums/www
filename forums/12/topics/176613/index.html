From her actions i can say that her feelings for u are fading fast.<br><br>U made a few mistakes. U shdnt have asked her why she is not responsive. That sounds like begging her to respond to u. U are making her dislike u more. And u shdnt tell her ur problems. She's not ur mother. She's ur gf. If u want someone to share ur problems go talk to ur male friends or ur mother.<br><br>Once a woman's feelings for u are like that as u have mentioned, i believe it's almost game over.</div>
