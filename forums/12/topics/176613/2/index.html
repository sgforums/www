Besides talking to her will not help improve things. If u dun believe me u can try. Why? As usual it seems like u are trying to seek her attention. All she cares are abt are her feelings only. I mean, once it's game over, time to smile and take ur leave.</div>

Talking to her might be quite an okay thing to do afterall?<br><br>By the way.. Think both of you have a very weak foundation for the relationship... And perhaps she was holding too much emotional baggage when she started off with you... Not to mention that there is a high chance your relationship started off highly based on infatuation and idolisation, without giving much further push to its build up...</div>

But have you seriously thought of her feelings?<br><br>You want her back because you are scare to lose not her but to "lose"<br>All your life you are winning again and again and she is a trophy to you.<br>You feel proud that despite AA have ask you to give up on her and you are able to get her. Nice hor the feeling? But sadly she is not a trophy but a person. She got feelings. She used to admire you in the past and thought you are a good bf and give you a chance but sadly you did not treasure it.<br><br>Nvm lar seems everyone here has already try to help you but you seems bend on thinking that you have the right and have the chance then go ahead lor.<br><br>Your gf has eyes, soon any tricks you pull before will not work and she will go.<br>Not going to encourage you but i feel that the your gf is better off not knowing you at all.</div>
