            <div class='col-md body'>if she's attracted to u , she is. No need to go on diet de =) Spoil ur body only. Everyone got this mentality that if we get more handsome/pretty , the opposite will fall in love with us , but that's not e truth. Think this way , if she likes u cause u are handsome or slim , there might be more ppl out there who are more slim and fit and handsome. She will change target then . No offence to u , but i tink that's e most honest opinion i can give here. Afterall , its the chemistry that counts. There are more "Trees" around !

Yes i do believe my way of diet is unhealthy but i only have a aim .... dat is to slim down as much as possible in the shortest period of time and i do believe i reduce to say ard 75 in less than 2 weeks ~</div>
