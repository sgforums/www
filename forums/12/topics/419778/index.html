              kind of lost now... I need some advice / wisdom / guidance for my future
              study...I’m 18+ years old currently I just completed a 2 years NITEC courses
              (info-communication technology) and got a GPA of 2.9(I know the marks is not
              enough to get into poly as NITEC to POLY require at least &lt;3.5 GPA. but i
              still try apply for poly (no harm in trying).  </span></p>

              have interest in culinary and IT. so I stated my choice for ITE.. 1st
              and 2nd as culinary courses, 3rd as info-communication tech (which I had
              interest in and so i got in the 3rd choice.. sigh)... anyway i was from
              normal tech..(Some may think why I didn't study hard and get into normal acad?)
              The fact is i did, and got a chance to normal acad but I rejected it due to I’m
              weak in chinese compo..(Made the biggest mistake) I hope it not too late to
              start planning my study now..</span></p>

              NITEC student is compulsory to take related courses in higher NITEC courses /
              polytechnic. But I had lost my interest and passion on IT staff. i know i can
              go higher NITEC for sure but i had lost interest on IT and it another 2 years
              courses..I need to serve NS for 2years too..so if i really take higher NITEC. By
              the time I completed poly I will be 25 years old.. </span></p>

              <p>i would discourage you from taking o lvl as private candidate.</p>
              <p>it requires intensive preparation, and you would need a good tutor to guide you through your subjects.</p>
              <p>and since your from normal tech, and had not touch on O lvl stuff for 2 years, most likely you will need 2 years to start from scratch again. this 2 years would be better spent if you decided to move on straight to shatec or poly, wherever your interest lies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>option 3 also not bad, just anyhow hamtam, and try see whether can get into poly. you have limited time left before you are called up for NS, and you would want to secure a course for NS deferment asap.</p>
              <p>the 2 years of NS would make you stupid, forgetting everything you have learnt. so its better to upgrade yourself as much as possible before NS.</p>
              <p>and don't forget that you have a sell-by date. don't spend too much of your time to pursue full time studies. it would be harder and harder to promote yourself to potential employers as you grow older.</p>
              <p>imagine, being a "fresh poly grad" at 25, or if your good, "fresh degree holder" at 29, how are you going to compete with 20 yrs old fresh degree holders?</p>
              <p>also, another option is to try to pursue part-time studies during NS.</p>

              <p>it's ok....never too late to try. Have met many people like that. Got a friend who grad from NUS at 28 because he studied from ITE to Poly to NUS. Working in the US now. Another one dropped out of poly, served NS, resumed his poly, went to NUS and is doing fine now.</p>
              <p>Then another one dropped out of poly, served NS, resumed poly and became a SAF pilot trainee at 27. His peers are 19.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>deathmaster : i must agree what you had said ... since i was from normal tech and haven't been touching any O lvl stuff.. 100% having difficulty taking O lvl and need quiet amount of money to study private O.. as my friend's friend is taking private O and he failed 2 time... total he invested more then 10k just for a private O lvl.. <br><br>since the situation is like that.. i guess i might take higher nitec , complete NS then go poly.. as i left 1 time deferment  for NS, so if i take higher nitec.. i must go NS then continue my study in poly ..so by the time i go poly i'm 23 yrs old ... and just like what you said it would be harder to find a job as we getting old... but what that the only way to continue my study..  and i don't think is a good idea to pursue a part time studies during NS if NS duty is on weekday, how should i attend class on this 2 day of weekend? and self-study on weekday which i on duty ..  <br><br>anyway thanks for helping me to think far and i appreciated it alot.. haha =D<br><br>Rock^Star : haha.. i hope it never too late to try it .. and i hope i not the only one is 23 yr old in poly =( i scare i cant get along with them as most of them is 17 / 18++  ... <br><br>anyway thanks alot =) </p></div>
