Very ineffective.<br><br>When you do nice things , you want her to know it is you.<br>You hope she will appreciate what you have done for her.<br><br>Being secretive admirer is NOT romantic . IT IS SPOOKY.<br><br>I get this kind of stuff before, anonymous flowers, gifts, notes.<br>YES it was nice at first.. little surprises.<br>After a while, I get frustrated with the guessing game.<br>I start to get suspicious with every guy in the office.<br>COULD HE BE THE ONE ? IS THIS A PRANK ?<br>Then I get angry.<br>I feel that if this guy is such a wuss , don't even dare let me know who the hell he is.<br>He is not worth my attention, because he is a coward.<br><br>So, Fatone, don't become a victim of your own doings.<br><br>In the search to find the girl , you will be rejected several times.<br><br>Imagine you are a $3000 vacuum cleaner sales guy.<br>You go door to door, knocking on the doors of your potential buyer.<br>Out of 10 doors, you get rejected 9 times.. until you found the one buyer who so happen to have the need, and money to buy your product.<br>Along the way, you will meet competitors who may or may not have more superior product than you.<br>It is up to you, to sell the product and win over the buyer.<br><br>Let her know you are the nice guy.<br>Send her a message " I hope you've been enjoying the morning coffee break as much as I do.

It is like a typical soap opera with you being the supporting actor; always supporting, never the lead.<br><br>You do have initiatives in demonstrating your affection, but I don't understand why is there a need to saunter such huge circles, just to avoid being 'seen'. You don't even have that mote of courage to work/improve your friendship with her beyond just plain causal, preferring to assimilate yourself in the dark, catching glimpse of her from afar and praying for miracles to manifest towards your advantage?<br><br>You think with the powers of prayers your competitor will just vanished into thin air and never to be seen again? In that case, all corporations in the world will be incredibly pious.<br><br>They are close to each other for a reason.<br><br>But what are you to her?<br><br>What have you done?<br><br>Because in my humble opinion, you did almost next to nothing.<br><br>Talk. Have you talk to her? Hold proper conversation? You know, those that makes her feel so comfortable with, added with tint of humour?<br><br>Has that happened?<br><br>Or you are wishing that it will happen?<br><br>A good conversation owns all of your collective gestures you attempted surreptitiously to evince your affection. You spend all your time worrying about your competitor and that you didn't even bother trying to a work out a viable strategy to market your own presence. It is like you counting your neighbour's wealth, wasting all the time in the world and realized that eventually, the money still doesn't belong to you.<br><br>And to add onto the flabbergasted list - you stalked her (Personally, I have my top three disgusted list of aberrant behaviour resulted from catalysis of love: (i) Threaten with harm, (ii) stalker, (iii) emotional blackmail).<br><br>Harsh reality?<br><br>I say it's time to wake up from your illusion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>In reality you are only in love with love. All those overwhelming feelings in which you have lionized its impact is nothing but some dramatic self perception of fantasy, in which you have shaped the plots into some sort of pseudo-reality pretty much surreal by nature. Your heart probably felt so much feelings being invested, yet it amounts to nothing - of course. How can you even have any result, in which nothing concrete has been done, to justify a positive conclusion?<br><br>It's like staring into darkness, thinking that you are looking at the mirror. Then its ghastly silence reflects none of your desire. But when you close your eyes and shape a thought in your mind eye, the image you see is basically self conjured - it's not even a reflection you originally wished to see yourself in, unlike looking directly into a mirror.<br><br>Why stare into darkness when all you need is to look at the mirror?<br><br>Why live in delusion when all you need is to find your way into reality?<br><br>If you can't even be a good friend to the woman you love - don't even dream about having her as your girlfriend. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are behaving like what all cowarice did... in fact, its more to stalking.. doing things behind her wont help u la, bro,, instead think of something to talk bout with her.. and the coffee or anything..<br><br>I just dun understand.. just hang out with her one day or sms or call her.. why are you being a wussy...<br><br>You know what? Before you wan to tell her that you like her.. you already defeated la.. Why ? Bcuz you're a WUSSY.. so low is the self-esteem, so low the motivation and so low your courage...<br><br>If your in the battle of a war.. you are already dead..<br><br>Let me teach you something, little bro,,<br><br>What is life to you? Life is actually a battle and there is no way to get out of it.. The only way is to get out is DEATH<br><br>So, the only way is that to WIN or LOSE... depends on you man... but to all great man, Their only aim is to win this battle....<br><br>What is success to you? Success is not bout chasing your dream,, Its about understanding and pursueing your very own path... This also means success is a CHANGE and courage to take the RISK OF FAILURE.<br><br>IF you still dont understand, Try this.. Google: David DeAngelo and i suggest you to buy a book titled "Thick Face, Black Heart"<br><br>I remind you again, little bro,<br><br>With your kind of attitude and thinking, you are already DEFEATED even before the war begins.. YOu dont even have the chance to begin the journey to the war but already defeated in your very own camp, even before you walk to the war path.. even before you can have your very 1st kill of your enemy.. You are already DEFEATED..<br><br>Gain some strength and the courage to fight.. Be fearless. Dont expect the outcome of a war bcuz whatever the outcome will be, will be..YOu just do what you have to do, fearless and courage to accept failures and that what makes u a MAN<br><br>Loser <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's always nice to surprise a girl with a gift here and then. And do those little things that you did. Bound to touch the girl's heart in a way or two. But you've got some competition there. Time for you to gather your courage to drop heavier hints that it is you who has been doing those little things. Which guy likes to have someone else take their credit? Like what others have said, your insecurity and low self esteem is your major hurdle. But certainly the girl wouldn't like it at all if she finds you've been stalking her.<br><br>As the saying goes, 'no guts no glory' or 'weak heart never wins fair maiden's hand' and blah blah blah <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ... whatever it is, strike while the iron is hot.
