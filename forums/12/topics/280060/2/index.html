At least you won't keep guessing how they are progressing and stuff.<br><br>And talk to her more lah. Find out more about her.

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think a girl being attached is a reason good enough to not chase her. Nothing venture nothing gain, plus if you are successful in your venture, remember she has to make the choice of you over her previous boyfriend - it is not your fault. Moreover, her previous boyfriend had a more advantageous position in preserving their relationship, so there should not be any guilt trip or ethical dilemma.<br><br>Chase her openly. If her boyfriend gets angry and defensive over it, just tell him to f-off because the girl is not his property regardless of the relationship. Only the girl gets to choose whether to allow you to continue courting her.</div>
