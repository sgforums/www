You guys(including me) lack confidence. We thought that its the little things that count, and that she may hopefully be touched by our sincerity, but all the while not daring 2 confess our feelings. The thing is that guy has more of a chance to win her than u, because they 2 are quite often together, and that he is probably more able 2 convey his feelings for her than u.<br><br>Try asking her out to catch a movie after work? Best if only 2 of u alone, so that u can build up ur confidence by talking to her, and knowing her more.</div>
