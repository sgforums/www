            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by OutOfIdeasHusband:</div><div class="quote_body"> Once, there is this guy A (33) , and this gal B (29). Gal B is a very sporty type, enjoy outdoor, the sun. Guy A is an indoor type, likes to stay at home and relax.<br>Guy is first bf for Gal.  Gal is 2nd for Guy.<br><br>They are together for 2 years, before getting ROM. Before the ROM, the gal kick up a fuss and pick problems with the guy. All in the hope that the guy will find the gal irritating, and call off the ROM. After the ROM, the gal became havoc and stay out with frens, wanted to have fun. The guy kept quiet and the gal told the guy she regretted doing the ROM. The guy wore the wedding ring, the gal didn't. She still introduce the guy as "boyfriend". A month or so later, the guy stopped wearing the ring.<br><br>Some months later, they became ok, and they got a HDB. The guy took care of the reno, while the gal worked till late at night. They moved in together. After 1 year, the guy requested to have a traditional wedding dinner. The gal, fearing the same thing happen during ROM, would not like to have it. She needed more time for convincing herself. So, they had a quarrel over it. The guy relented and did not push further.<br><br>3 years have gone. Guy called the gal "Wife". Gal called guy "Hubby". In the 3 years, they went travel yearly, had fun doing stuffs together. Both had change for each other, guy became more outdoor, and gal loves to be with the guy. During this time, there are no big arguments or quarrels.<br><br>Gal went searching for wedding venues, and showed to the Guy. The guy wasof cos, very happy. They went and decided on the venue, and got the wedding package. They had a great day with the photoshoot. Inivitations were printed as well.<br><br>2 months before wedding. Gal went for a night outing with frens, and the Guy called her a few times to return as it is late (11pm ~ 3am). The gal became angry. They quarrel. The gal wanted to call off the wedding dinner. The guy knew she is purposely doing the same thing so as to call off the dinner. Guy asked her. She said she is still not committed. She is not sure He is the one. She feels something missing, as if waiting for another guy to appear.<br><br>Now, both guy and gal is feeling miserable. Gal wanted to have sometime alone to think about what she really wants. Guy is waiting. There are options :<br><br>a) Wait for Gal to be ready for traditional wedding dinner, could be 1 year, 2 year, never?<br><br>b) Forget about the wedding dinner. (Guy want dinner, think parents (both) also)<br><br>c) Go for counselling (Guy suggest)<br><br>d) Divorce for Gal freedom. She can goes to search for her perfect husband.<br><br>What do you think?</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Emotionally, the woman is not ready for marriage, albeit her mind is probably hinting to her that she isn't young anymore and should be thinking of settling down. That is probably the reason why she accepted his ROM/HDB proposal, only to be defeated by her own introspection later on, fueled by individualism and wilfulness.<br><br>One major concern to her subconsciously is that probably because she only has one boyfriend in her life, there isn't any comparison nor choices. The only man she could claim as boyfriend monopolised and provided the framework and cosmic lesson she ought to grasp in BGR aspect. Her stark confusion is because ONCE the wedding dinner is hosted (announcement to friends, family and relatives), she would inevitably have that notion that there are more responsibilities, yet not necessary more happiness.<br><br>She probably feared to gamble her marriage on the ONLY known 'product' she has knowledge of.<br><br>I realized that every time when she hangs out with her friends, something drastic would happen. It is quite possible that the man could pick up important clue as to understand why is she so evasive towards marriage from them. Perhaps they are partial influence, or perhaps she might have told them something that the man is unconscious about (e.g. that she could be holding onto a certain past and has yet to initiate movement in her life, someone else initiate a chase, etc).<br><br>Too much individualism in a person makes him/her less domestic. When people are too used in enjoying freedom, sometimes, they are reluctant to give up this lifestyle in exchange for a marriage.<br><br>The man will likely to wait because he is unlikely to give her up and replay the dating scene (partially due to age and the desire for stability). I guess the ball lies with the woman. I believe that she still desire to be courted by someone else, given the choice, before she could make a decision. And a last thing she would ever want to face is to meet another person significant to her AFTER she has decided to commit.<br><br>She has fleeting emotions and not very decisive in judgment. I suggest a third party sort of mediation and counselling. Go for marriage preparation course or something and make decision AFTER that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Now, the Guy's in such deep shit as he cannot split wif her without obtaining a divorce which will involve some legal fees...... HDB flat will cost even more money for him when they divorce.<br><br>Best thing for the guy to do now is get away from her as fast as he can. If it means a divorce, den just grit his teeth and go through wif it. If have to pay alimony, just pay lor.<br><br>HDB flat can be sold back to HDB upon proof of divorce (decree absolute). Will probably be sold at a loss.<br><br>Guy will lose lots of money but he'll at leasre regain his own self esteem and dignity. Never mind the monetary loss. Take it as payment of school fees.

Yun encounter such gals before?<br><br>Guy has handwritten a letter.<br>--------<br>Dear Gal,<br>Its been a long time since I wrote to you.  It had been a difficult time for you and me.  I miss your smile, laughter around the house.  I always look forward to seeing you, holding your hand, hugging you at the end of everyday.<br><br>Guy is not a romantic guy.  We both know.  I appreciate that you took time and effort in getting the lazy me out in the sun.  I enjoyed every outing we had at ECP, UBin, even the short squash session.  I understand that you make an effort to stay home and watched TV with me.<br><br>Through the years, we changed unknowingly.  Life seems boring.  Spark seems to disappear.  We have taken each other for granted.  We failed to create the special moment, just for the other.  I am obsessed with the computer game.  You are unhappy, but yet you let me play.  I want to say, "I'm sorry".<br><br>I know you are still angry about the incident last week.  I did not meant to sound angry.  Maybe I have expressed my concern in a wrong way.<br><br>When some things happen in a relationship, its not just 1 person's problem.  Both did something wrong.  You are not selfish.  On the contrary, you gave me love, freedom, and your trust in me.  I am always wondering, would my love be able to exceed what you have given me, if love can be measured.<br><br>I do not know how this current problem will end.  We have gone through many ups and downs.  I just want you to know, you have change my life, and I am happy that it is you.  No regrets.<br><br>From the time we started out, I have loved you ... till now.<br><br>------------------<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ROM. Legally Married.  No need Wedding Dinner as its just custom.<br><br>Gal Working, no children. No need give Maintenance.  By the way, we dont call it alimony in Singapore.<br><br>Both in a HDB flat. Possibly with a grant issue with HDB, but judging that they are together in that flat nearing 5 years, they should be able to sell the flat soon.<br><br>The guy sounds real nice, but then.....it may be that the story was only told from one side and we do not have a clear picture of whats really going on.<br><br>Looks like divorce is in the cards.  No chance of annulment of marriage since it already pass 3 years since the ROM.<br><br>Try for a separation first. Physically detach the female from the household.  Once the female has a taste of being single and cheated by the loads of men on the outside, then she will regret losing her husband and most likely would want to come back.<br><br>IF she found her True Love and dont want to come back.

            <div class='col-md body'>I am going to be crude and direct in this.<br><br>I think the Guy is not in control of the situation, ie not having Gal attracted to him and Gal being obedient all the time. Their relationship is too one-sided. The Guy has always been giving in to the Gal, giving her presents, giving her a shelter, a "daddy" sort of care.<br><br>"<strong>Guy might tried too hard in pleasing Gal."</strong> - BINGO!<br><br><strong>"Gal does want to have more "flings" before she settle." </strong>- Trust your gut feelings. Gal has been dating other guys, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;"><strong>perhaps even slept with them</strong>.</span> </span><br><br>"Gal said maybe with the investment (time and money and effort), Guy should put on another gal and may able to appreciate him better." - Guy should do what Gal tells him to. Gal was being kind when she said that. She has REJECTED Guy.<br><br><strong>"A girl with very high feelings of attraction for a guy will not want to date any other guy, period."</strong> -  Pure Gold! Very true!<br><br><strong>"Guy is hoping thru the counselling, Gal will know what she really want. be it separate, or whatever."</strong> Counselling is a left-brain logical process which sounds right to guys but to girls, its totally a waste of time. You cannot tell a girl to be attracted to you when she is not. You can list down all the things you have done for her, all the sacrifices you had made and its still useless. Once she lost the attraction, thats it.<br><br><strong>Here is what Guy should do:</strong><br><br>- Continue to go for this Fri counselling. Pay attention to her body language at the counselling. If she appears uneasy, always figgiting and not paying attention. Thats it. Make it the last counselling Guy has with her.<br><br>- Dump all of your computer games. Completing a game in record time will not give you a girl!<br><br>- Go to gym, wear trendy clothes, go out with friends more. Be different. be fashionable. Be an attractor of girls.<br><br>- Continue to have sex with her. Guy should go all out to learn all the different sex techniques and practice with her while she is still available for practice (aka before divorce). This has 2 benefits. First, if guy can give her incredible pleasure, there may be chance that she will be attracted to Guy again. Second, it will attract the other future girls that Guy will sleep with.<br><br>I rather be single than be a slave who is always giving and not receiving. Period.<br></div>
