Gal B is a very sporty type, enjoy outdoor, the sun. Guy A is an indoor type, likes to stay at home and relax.<br>Guy is first bf for Gal.  Gal is 2nd for Guy.<br><br>They are together for 2 years, before getting ROM. Before the ROM, the gal kick up a fuss and pick problems with the guy. All in the hope that the guy will find the gal irritating, and call off the ROM. After the ROM, the gal became havoc and stay out with frens, wanted to have fun. The guy kept quiet and the gal told the guy she regretted doing the ROM. The guy wore the wedding ring, the gal didn't. She still introduce the guy as "boyfriend". A month or so later, the guy stopped wearing the ring.<br><br>Some months later, they became ok, and they got a HDB. The guy took care of the reno, while the gal worked till late at night. They moved in together. After 1 year, the guy requested to have a traditional wedding dinner. The gal, fearing the same thing happen during ROM, would not like to have it. She needed more time for convincing herself. So, they had a quarrel over it. The guy relented and did not push further.<br><br>3 years have gone. Guy called the gal "Wife". Gal called guy "Hubby". In the 3 years, they went travel yearly, had fun doing stuffs together. Both had change for each other, guy became more outdoor, and gal loves to be with the guy. During this time, there are no big arguments or quarrels.<br><br>Gal went searching for wedding venues, and showed to the Guy. The guy wasof cos, very happy. They went and decided on the venue, and got the wedding package. They had a great day with the photoshoot. Inivitations were printed as well.<br><br>2 months before wedding. Gal went for a night outing with frens, and the Guy called her a few times to return as it is late (11pm ~ 3am). The gal became angry. They quarrel. The gal wanted to call off the wedding dinner. The guy knew she is purposely doing the same thing so as to call off the dinner. Guy asked her. She said she is still not committed. She is not sure He is the one. She feels something missing, as if waiting for another guy to appear.<br><br>Now, both guy and gal is feeling miserable. Gal wanted to have sometime alone to think about what she really wants. Guy is waiting. There are options :<br><br>a) Wait for Gal to be ready for traditional wedding dinner, could be 1 year, 2 year, never?<br><br>b) Forget about the wedding dinner. (Guy want dinner, think parents (both) also)<br><br>c) Go for counselling (Guy suggest)<br><br>d) Divorce for Gal freedom. She can goes to search for her perfect husband.<br><br>What do you think?</div></blockquote>Question for Guy : Did you ever have a heart to heart talk with the Gal on the above points that you highlighted?<br><br>That should be the first step. you guys are married and should try to communicate to solve problems together and come to an understanding...<br></div>

Because the truth is sometimes not nice to hear.<br><br>It's not about drawing a conclusion la. It's about being objective and we have to face the facts and not try to avoid it. It might be painful but it makes us stronger.<br><br>Most of the time, the woman's feelings towards the guy have been neglected and they <strong>WILL NOT</strong> tell you they have no feelings nor will it be printed on their foreheads. Most people dread to think about it. They can think of thousands of reasons but still refuse to include that the girl has low feelings. Why? Because the male ego is too strong. Simple as that.<br><br>Women do not even know it themselves. I have been saying many times the woman's feelings towards the guy is the most important and usually the guy doesn't know it themselves, whether it has been dropping.<br><br>Im not suggesting it to be a scenario. It is a very real possibility. Romantic feelings do fade. It must be considered. It forms the basis for every r/s.<br><br>Now, Im not accusing or condemning the girl. In fact it is not the girl's fault.  It's very natural that feelings can fade. It is in the female's nature. How can she stop herself from losing feelings? It's not within her control. Love is not logical, at least to them.<br><br>It can be due to many reasons and I feel that the threadstarter did not tell us enough information. It can be he neglected her or did not date her or he was too clingy or he tried to control her or she might not have loved him before the ROM or other undisclosed reasons.<br><br>I did not conclude that ''her heart is not with him'' but I said consider this as a top possibility. Why do I come to this line of thinking? Im analysing everything based on facts. She said "she is not sure if He is the one" if you remember. She also asked him to ''find another girl'' if you also remember. Why would some one you assume ''loved'' you say this? Shouldnt that hit something in your gut feeling? Any guy can sense something is wrong when his lady said something like this. He will just feel something is not quite right.<br><br>In fact there are quite a few forumers who agree to this line of thinking. eg. Marcuz1977<br><br>Again, threadstarter: I do not want to accuse your lady and I am not trying to instill negative feelings to you. You just have to be objective and not let your own feelings dictate your judgement. Like what Marcuz1977 said, observe your Gal during the counselling. But during the counselling process, she will not tell you "I have lost feelings for you". But what she says is some way or another signalling that her feelings for you might had fade. Eg. Things like what you did or didn't do. Only you yourself can feel what is actually happening.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think i'm just like your wife. So i pulled the plug 5 months into the relationship and dropped the guy.<br><br>2 main reasons<br><br>1) Love - I felt that i don't love him. I even question myself did i ever love him before. There is something really seriously wrong when your boyfriend tell you I love you and you cannot reply him or say the same things back to him because you are unsure if you love him. This carried on for 3 months and i cannot take it longer. So i pulled the plug.<br><br>I dun wan to use him and find another guy, and dropped him like dirt when I find someone new. It's unfair to him cause he is a very nice guy and loves me a lot. I don't want to make use of him and feel guilty. I'm already feeling very guilty and couldn't be happy when i was with him. So no point carrying on a relationship, where i torture myself and in turn torture him. In the end, nobody is happy and people around us are miserable too. He refused to let go in the beginning but due to my insistance, he have to let go.<br><br>2) Compatibility - I feel that we are not suitable. ANd he is not the kind of guy for me</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by dokono:<br><strong><br><br>I understand your concern that it might be negative and what I said is not nice. Because the truth is sometimes not nice to hear.<br><br>It's not about drawing a conclusion la. It's about being objective and we have to face the facts and not try to avoid it. It might be painful but it makes us stronger.<br><br>Most of the time, the woman's feelings towards the guy have been neglected and they [b]WILL NOT</strong> tell you they have no feelings nor will it be printed on their foreheads. Most people dread to think about it. They can think of thousands of reasons but still refuse to include that the girl has low feelings. Why? Because the male ego is too strong. Simple as that.<br><br>Women do not even know it themselves. I have been saying many times the woman's feelings towards the guy is the most important and usually the guy doesn't know it themselves, whether it has been dropping.<br><br>Im not suggesting it to be a scenario. It is a very real possibility. Romantic feelings do fade. It must be considered. It forms the basis for every r/s.<br><br>Now, Im not accusing or condemning the girl. In fact it is not the girl's fault.  It's very natural that feelings can fade. It is in the female's nature. How can she stop herself from losing feelings? It's not within her control. Love is not logical, at least to them.<br><br>It can be due to many reasons and I feel that the threadstarter did not tell us enough information. It can be he neglected her or did not date her or he was too clingy or he tried to control her or she might not have loved him before the ROM or other undisclosed reasons.<br><br>I did not conclude that ''her heart is not with him'' but I said consider this as a top possibility. Why do I come to this line of thinking? Im analysing everything based on facts. She said "she is not sure if He is the one" if you remember. She also asked him to ''find another girl'' if you also remember. Why would some one you assume ''loved'' you say this? Shouldnt that hit something in your gut feeling? Any guy can sense something is wrong when his lady said something like this. He will just feel something is not quite right.<br><br>In fact there are quite a few forumers who agree to this line of thinking. eg. Marcuz1977<br><br>Again, threadstarter: I do not want to accuse your lady and I am not trying to instill negative feelings to you. You just have to be objective and not let your own feelings dictate your judgement. Like what Marcuz1977 said, observe your Gal during the counselling. But during the counselling process, she will not tell you "I have lost feelings for you". But what she says is some way or another signalling that her feelings for you might had fade. Eg. Things like what you did or didn't do. Only you yourself can feel what is actually happening.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">[/b]</blockquote>What you've mentioned MIGHT be suggestive of the truth, but need not necessarily be anywhere near to reflective of the truth...<br><br>Pardon if I seems to be snapping at you, as I often is reluctant to comment on others' comment. My point is so that TS would not take it in a negative manner which might really complicate things if happens.<br><br>Since you've already put up your stand to the TS, I have nothing to add.<br><br>Have a nice day.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
