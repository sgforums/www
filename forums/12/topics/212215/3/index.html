Thats the general feeling I have also.<br><br>Come on lah... which parents dont worry?  A wedding dinner will stop them worrying?  They most likely will sigh more and shake their head and try to hide their faces from their relatives to have their children 'show off they are married and then be seen that the couple are doing so badly.'<br><br>So whats next? have babies to show the relatives that the family can reproduce?</div>

She needed more time for convincing herself. So, they had a quarrel over it. The guy relented and did not push further.<br><br>3 years have gone. Guy called the gal "Wife". Gal called guy "Hubby". In the 3 years, they went travel yearly, had fun doing stuffs together. Both had change for each other, guy became more outdoor, and gal loves to be with the guy. During this time, there are no big arguments or quarrels.<br><br>Gal went searching for wedding venues, and showed to the Guy. The guy wasof cos, very happy.

Obsessive in playing computer game, leading to neglect in wife at home at night.<br><br>Ok, Gal is patient with Guy, but guess there is a limit to everything.</div></blockquote>Hi there.<br><br>Perhaps the best is for the Guy and Gal to be totally honest (be it painful) to each other during the day of counsel. That, will help a lot and might even bring your relationship to a deeper level.  I have a recommendation for an excellent marriage counselor, if you wish to have more choices. My wife and i did our pre-marriage prep with this person. Let me know if interested and i can PM you his contact.<br><br>i am in favour of the opinion that there is still a choice. A choice to forgive and to love (both ways and not one way). The rest of the other choices are really secondary. Perhaps i, being someone who had walked the painful path of divorce, tend to caution anyone against walking that path.<br><br>Finally, in a marriage, trust must first be given before it can be earned and not the other way round.<br><br>All the best !   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMO,<br><br>In a relationship, no problems will arise becoz of only One party's factor contribution. It's More<br>or Less factors only. You won't realise ... that indirectly, each of UR's action is the result of the other's behaviour. Perhaps the "image" you both projected to each other ... is not way it should be ... Both of you will simply reject each other's way of speech/words ... becoz the mindset has been imprinted that everything is against he/she ...<br><br>A conselling may work ... rephrase - The conselling will work, ONLY if both party are wiling to listen and accept what the councilor's advise, willing to work 2gether to save the Marriage ... IFn NOT ... it will just be a formality.<br><br>A couple, both he and she, must be MATURED enuff to understand, what is a Marriage, why they are in a Marriage, what is Communication, what is Commitment ... in order for them to walk the path down blissfully ... Do u both know, the oath you both took during the ROM, what it means? Is it from your heart? Will u honored it? If it's not, then it's no longer an oath, but just words - english words.<br><br>Remember, it's easy to go thru a Marriage, but never easy to go thru a Divorce.</div>
