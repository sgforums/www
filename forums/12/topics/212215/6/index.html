Allow each other to do own things and try not to cling onto her. Let her initiate the outings. When you two are together, try to enjoy time together and don't talk about negative things or appear sad. Try always to make her laugh and appear cheerful even though you are dying inside.<br><br>Like previous posts mentioned, don't accomodate her hobbies. You have your own values and programs as well. Always treat her with respect and expect that she do the same to you as well.<br><br>The feelings for each other is always never the same. The other party's feelings is always lower, be it the girl or the guy. My take is that your girl has very low feelings for you. Other than that, from what you have said, her character is fine. That doesn't mean you should divorce. Whatever the case, try to make your life more busy other than just accomodating her and see her less. She has to think more about you. Remember, divorce is not cheap and should be the last solution.</div>

That's the difference from a normal breakup. A breakup is much less troublesome but a divorce is not very simple.<br><br>As I have previously mentioned, I am against divorcing. The reason is because we do not know how low her feelings are for the man... if the man turns her off so much it is beyond the point of no return, it's goodbye. And the woman remembers everything the guy did or did not do. They have very good memories when it comes to relationship stuff. But if the woman still has some feelings for him, it may still be saved. Give each other more space. But that doesn't mean they dun see each other, but not too much. Once in a while date each other(maybe once a week) to enjoy each other's company. Allow her to think about the man.</div>

I learnt alot from this thread because I am ignorant of many things discussed here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>[b]To TS</strong>:<br><br>5 common things you and your wife both enjoy does not seems to "help" solve the issue on the surface, BUT have you wonder why the counsellor want you two to do that when he/she/it can ask you two to do so many other things?<br><br>A couple are together so they can both do thing together and enjoy each other's company. <strong><span style="color: red;">My GUESS</span></strong> is that the counsellor is trying to use this to build up a situation to help you two repair the current issue. But do not force yourself to find 5 things your wife loves doing and accomodate her. You are cheating yourself this way and this is NOT what the counsellor wants.<br><br>A counsellor's job is to help both of you find the root of the problems and you two are to remedy it. If you or she cheated the way through, then it defeats the purpose of going for counselling.<br><br>Frankly speaking, this is out of my league for I am young and foolish in this. The counsellor is doing a fine job to help both of you. Period.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><strong>To shrekho</strong>:<br><br>You want career and $$$, your GF wants commitment and family.<br><br>I can't advice you much on this, but <strong><span style="color: red;">I can give a suggestion, WHICH you can ignore</span></strong>: Tell her what you want (the career and $$$ stuffs) and let her tell you more on what she wants. THEN give both yourselves a time frame IF you two agrees to it.<br><br>This time frame can be long or short. Say three years?<br><br>Why? This time frame is for you to set your goals on your career and for her to test her resolve on her love and commitment towards you. Sounds abit unfair you are not using it to test YOUR resolve and commitment for her right?<br><br>It may seems to be unfair but it also at the same time test your feelings towards her and your passion for career. During the time frame any of you may change. Perhaps you find that all your career moves are good but you lack something. Something vital that it seems incomplete in your life. You have no satisfaction earning millions or such, then you think of her. OR for her case, she may think that having a career herself may be a new excitement? She won't have so much inkling of being a housewife as she initially thought she wanted to be.<br><br>You two can still date and have fun. Call each other, sms, msn, email, send letters, etc, etc during the time BUT the main topic is still the time frame. You two have decided to give a certain time to think about these issues and marriage and such are out of the way during this period.<br><br>Once the time frame is up, meet up and assess the whole situation again. Recall back during the period on what you did, how you felt and what things changed. Maybe by that time you are not as career-minded as you used to be? Or she is more adventurous than before? Maybe the love is even stronger because you two seldom meet up due to you travelling alot? Or there are more not so idea situations by then?<br><br>Its up to you and her really. You both want to make things happen, some form of sacrifice has to be made first. Its basically the "time makes love grows fonder" thing, or it can be the other way round...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>In any case, I pray for all of you to handle your issues the best way possible and you all be happy and have peace at heart no matter the outcome.<br><br>Cheers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> [/b]</blockquote>Hey bub!<br><br>Thanks for the advice. i did mention to her a time frame<br>of 5 years at least. Well, hopefully by then I can save up enough money<br>for a wedding and hdb, and she has graduated from NTU and start<br>working.<br><br>I do have plans, which they are very long term. At least 5 years plan<br>is considered long in my POV for a relationship.<br><br>Perhaps money and materialistic gains are all inside my mind now,<br>that I can forgo a date to settle a business deal. Or answer business calls<br>when a client needs technical help, and don't answer her call while I am<br>at work.<br><br>I only meet her once a week, and try to make it quality time, just her<br>and me, sit at starbucks, chit chat, read a book or even go gym together.<br>That's all.<br><br>To her, the time spent together is not long enough. Haiz... Would like to<br>invest more time on work and money schemeing ideas(oops, i meant<br>schemes and proposals :-) )<br><br>Anyway, I really hope all the best for the husband to be.</div>

But did you really try to dominate her? And is it her money you are talking about or your own money? If it's yours and if she is understanding enough, she shouldn't have said all these.<br><br>And what kind of wife is she going to be when she says she wants to travel and work overseas? So she finally spilled the beans eh? Her heart has no place for you?! Is that what she is trying to say? And she doesn't know. Don't get me wrong. Im not against women who are very focused in their career but where's the lovingness from her? Think about that. Again, it all boils down to low feelings. She can't put you into her priority. What kind of statement is that coming from a wife huh?<br><br>I'm not trying to put her down or what. She is not mature and loving in this r/s and she has low feelings for you but she will never tell you this. If she has high feelings, she will have stayed with you through thick and thin. Also, where's her integrity? She will just speak secret women language but will never say I don't like you anymore.<br><br>Guy, this is tragedy. Im against divorce but if you find your woman not willling to stay with you, it is very sad. So much for unconditional love! Like what your dad says, there is no point draggin this. Ultimately, do what you feel best is in the interests of both parties concenrned.<br></div>
