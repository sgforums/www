              <p><br>I can't speak specifically about your uncle's experience. From my own experience working with the prison department in Singapore, I know the prison officers talk to the inmates under their charge every now and then to see if they're coping alright or whether there is any complaint. Simply 'talking' is not counselling. The inmates also get to attend religious classes on weekends if they choose to. Again these are not specialized drug treatment.</p>

              <p>I will have to disagree with you. Religion can help to change a person, in many ways more than one. I say this as an ex-convict, though not a drug-related one. This may not be a form of specialised treatment, but it is not something to be underestimated as well.</p>

              <p><br>I concur with you that religion can change a person. Even the 12-step program is based on Christian philosophy. My point is that DRCs do not offer any specialized drug treatment until the final 6 months of their detention. If one is looking for religious help or support or whatever you call it, there is no need to go to prison or DRC. Everyone is more than welcome to step into a church, temple, mosque, or synagouge to seek religious advice and help.</p>
