            <div class='col-md body'>hi all..i have a problem...<br><br>I'm an 18 yr old gal from one of the JCs..<br>i have this friend M who's in year 2 ..he's really good to me, he treats me juz like any guy would treat his gf..even tho we have never got together. he would send me home every week after my ECA even tho we travel in different directions and he's tired. I mean, there are so many other girls in the same ECA..but why did he choose to just send me home? He'd ask me out frequently and be a perfect gentleman when he is with me.<br><br>During the june holidays, he helped me to prepare for my mid year exams, helping me almost every other day. When I got back my results, he was very concerned and was rather disappointed as I did not do well, even tho he did not show the disappointment explicitly. Then on one occasion, he even gave me a pooh bear..for apparently no reason at all. We were having dinner at tt time.<br>He'd be very concerned each time we are together, he'll keep asking me whether i'm tired, hungry or thirsty whenever we go out. He'd even buy food and drinks for me even tho I say itz ok, I'm not hungry or thirsty. On some occasions he even asked me to get the same clothing as him, so tt we have identical stuff.<br><br>There are also many occasions when we ran into pple from our skool, and even once, he lied to his friend abt where he was going. M was supposed to meet me on tt day, but I was late, so he went walking ard the area first. He ran into his classmate, a very good friend of his. M told his friend tt he was going off soon, however, a couple of hours later, his friend caught the two of us together, and confronted M in a joking manner..<br><br>However, recently, things started changing. He got back his mid year exam results, it was good, but not up to his expectations. He was one grade short of his target. He started to distant himself from me, until last saturday when he called me up and asked me out cos he needed to return me my notes. We met up in the evening, and chatted for quite a while before I said tt I gtg. He sent me home at 11pm, only this time he waited for the lift door to close before he went off.<br><br>Somehow, I more or less decided tt I love him, cos he gave me a special feeling everytime we were together, this has been going on since the start of the year and I'm very sure itz not a crush.<br><br>Yesterday, I confessed to him abt my feelings for him. He actually told me tt he's not ready for another relationship now as he has not gotten over his ex-gf who treated him like shit, and he thinks tt gals suck. Studies are more important for him, and he thinks tt we are not suitable for each other. In his reply, he did not state whether he only treated me as a friend, or something more. He did not mention anything about how he feels towards me.<br><br>So right now, I'm very confused and lost and I do not noe what to do...if only some kind souls would help me to analyse my situation now....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have you asked him why he treated you so well in the first place ? And did you tell him because of that, he made you feel special whenever he's around ? If he says he don't ... He's obviously lying ...<br>For me ... i think he loves you as much too ... ( it's pretty obvious ... why would anyone treat a casual friend like what you just said ?!) Just that his grades are slipping by one grade ... perhaps you could help him on that. Call him out for a chat or dinner ... and ask about this ... Well ... Good luck !<br><br>------------------<br>The night is near and dawn is coming... I Lay awake on my bed thinking of you... I wonder ... when will we meet again ? When will we talk once more ? I Know my love to you is deep and true ... but i wonder how you feel for me ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sad Ger,<br><br>I may not be able to help much in yr problem but then guess you will not mind if i give u some of my views.<br><br>When i 1st read yr post, really find that the guy, M, is really a nice guy, sensitive, polite, caring.....basically a SNAG. And i was also slightly confused by his change of attitude towards you, cos all teh stuffs he do in the 1st place, identified T-shirts, send u home (even diff direction) etc are ways and means to get closer to you.<br><br>As for his changes, maybe we can analysis this a little:<br><br>1)He is giving the two of u a chance, after he failed his 1st relationships, but however after giving u all so many time together, he still felt uncomfortable in some ways, like what u say, maybe, still thinking of the past relationship.<br><br>2)He really wanna concentrated on his As as he felt that his future is more important. And the poor result really affected him. And he felt that he's not capable of handling both studies and relationship together.<br><br>Well since u enjoyed his company, why dun u just maintain yr friendship this way 1st, give him, and of cos yrself more time. Sometimes happiness is more important rite? Maybe u can appraoch him again after his As. i am sure u will get a diff situation then.<br><br>So my conclusion is, maintain the happy situation u all r having now, wait for the rite time, and at the mean time give yrself more times......... a hint is, if he goes army that's the best time cos he will miss a lot of things.<br><br>Nevertheless, wishing u all the best eh, guess that's all i can help. Cheerios~<br><br>Regards<br><br></div>

Kindly share with all as i am sure there are really a few kind souls ard very willing to help and know what's going on......<br><br>and yes, aaron84z is correct in some ways, that is the reason he avoid u, the reason i can think of is that if he talks to much, or get too close to you, he may be tempted to 'lost his direction' again. Since he tried so had and finally managed to surpressed his feelings for u (i am sure he has), he wouldn't want it to come back so easy, and i am quite sure that's what he is thinking.<br><br>Relax, maybe u can try dropping he a email or 2.....but make it short and sweet, just a couple of word of concern......i am sure he will be touch.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Sad Ger<br><br>Yes indeed , having a face to face n if possible a heart to heart talk . Let him know how painful it is for u to be avoided by him .<br><br>He cares for u... tts for sure... by letting him know how much its hurting u...how much it had affected ur life... surely he wouldn't remain quiet ... for he cares for ur studies too.<br><br>Try writting him a letter or email... let him know abt . I'm sure he would show some form of response . For he cares abt u.... be it as a fren or otherwise.<br><br>However like wad Atti says... do keep ur cool should things dun turn out nice... life's full of ups n down...<br><br>All the best~~~~</div>
