The key thing is not to get too stressed over it, and let your sincere heart guide you.<br><br>I suggest you read up a book on "Romancing Women", in there, they emphasize on the need to listen to what your girl really wants. And it can be as trivial as rubbing her back, and as costly as a candelight dinner.<br><br>Doing very caring things like being an alarm clock is very sweet, and she undoubtedly appreciates it...  but relationships need to be passionate too..<br><br>Girls want to be loved like a baby, but they also want to be princessess too. Occasionally they want to be indulged, and occasionally practicality takes over, and they want to be a good gf/wife.<br><br>There is room in BGR for SNAGs, sensitive new age guys like you, but you do need to be a little more passionate too, like casanova. Lastly, be a bad boy when it comes to sex.<br><br>You remind me of myself when i was 20+. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
