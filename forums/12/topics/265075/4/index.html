            <div class='col-md body'>TS,<br><br>Communication is not about smsing or calling everyday to ask if she has eaten, to remind her to drink more water, to ask what time she wanna wake the next day.<br><br>it is talking about things that matter more... like when she has problems does she open up to u, do you open up to her?<br><br>with my recent ex, he calls me almost everyday.... he'll ask me those things i mentioned above, and sometimes we just hold on to the phone without even talking... that's NOT communication...<br><br>Do you know how most gals will talk to their best friend about everything that happens/bothers them? how they will bitch abt work, about friends, about little things that upset them...<br><br>To me, If I can't bring myself to even tell my bf these things that i can easily tell my best friend, then we are not communicating well...<br><br>My bf has to be nothing less (if not more) then my best friend. he must be able to share my problems/joy/saddness with me.</div>
