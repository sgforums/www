At least, u noe how to judge her love from her opinion... The only thing that u should do more is to do more things that she feel being loved from her opinion...<br><br>If u want, u can ignore "1 month time to re-consider our relationship" and give a one shot that will touch her--&gt; only one shot...

In fact, most of us in life will have doubt in a relationship at least once. I think none can differentiate between love and feeling comfortable in AA except debates and debates...<br><br>Yr case is not as bad as other case... At least, u noe how to judge her love from her opinion... The only thing that u should do more is to do more things that she feel being loved from her opinion...<br><br>If u want, u can ignore "1 month time to re-consider our relationship" and give a one shot that will touch her--&gt; only one shot... Try to recap on the words that she say previously, brainstorm ideas that she will feel loved from her opinion and give yr best shot to touch her...<br><br>Wish u luck<br></div></blockquote>mmmm any idea wat can i do to make her feel touched?

It feels fake. It's like a chore, like it doesn't come from your heart. Girls are very particular. Don't do it.<br><br>You know why?<br><br>Because you feel insecure. You feel that if you don't say the 3 words everytime, you are afraid you might lose her. You need her to make you happy. Some guys can say "I love you" to their girl everyday every hour every minute but the girl still loves them.<br><br>Why?<br><br>They are not scared their girlfriend will leave them. They are not afraid. They are confident. They don't need to listen to their girlfriend's complaints that it's boring. They just do what they like. It's funny but the girl still like him.<br><br>On the other hand, you are the opposite. You try too hard. You think too much. You are too afraid. You are insecure. Try not to care about what she thinks. Just do what you like to do. Because it's you who are in control.<br><br>Right now, I would say it's time to start getting to know more girls.<br><br>doko</div>
