Instead of hoping to move out one day (which I feel does not address the problem, but instead serves to add on to intolerance of the situation), TS should be looking at how he can change things at home.<br><br>Some people do not know how to properly express their feelings, and when doing so, are not aware that the way they behave is hurting the people around them.<br><br>Talking is useless if you don't apply the right method. Think of better words to use. Is your tone of voice appropriate? Are you able to be patient and keep your calm while talking to your father over sensitive issues?<br><br>Your dad is the head of the family. He probably has a pride he feels he needs to uphold. So when talking to him, try to do it in a way that hurts that pride the least? If you can keep him calm, I think he will be more receptive to your opinions.<br><br>You want to be happy and comfortable, but what do your parents want for you? Well er, assuming they are 'normal parents' with 'normal attitudes' towards their children, they hope for you to perform at least adequately well for your studies. If you can see that your dad's temper has become worse due to your results, aim to score better the next time round. If you can show him that you are capable of being self-disciplined and independent, I think you will have more persuasive power.<br><br>Gently let your father know that his behavior is hurting you. Do not be afraid of appearing weak - just let him know how you feel, and what you hope for him to do and what you will do in return. Don't ask for too much at first, and make sure you keep your promises.<br><br>And then of course... you have to try to talk to your dad more, let him know what's going on in your life. Maybe then he'll understand you more.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have this view that every child is his parents treasure.  Make your son or daughter respect/love you and you will never have to worry about what will happen in your old age when you are too old to work and take care of yourself.  Your children will put food on the table for you, clean up after you when you are too weak to do so, and pay all your medical bills and living expenses.</div>
