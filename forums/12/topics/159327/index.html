            <div class='col-md body'>Zichuan, u sound like a sensible young man. You're right about not rushing into marriage....there are many responsibilities and obligations that come with marriage, and without a foundation of a stable job and some savings, things can get tough. Furthermore, you are still young and studying, and your view of life will change as you cross into mid-20s and then into your 30s.<br><br>To cut it short - DO NOT get married yet. Your gf does not sound like the right partner for you too...not mature in her thinking yet.  Take care.</div>
