I got rejected by a guy and been called a freak. I ask for a stranger guy direction and he gave me a 'disgusted' look. My father keeps saying my legs is disgusting. Last time, I finally found a job and my manager told me to do sales (asking people to buy the products) He told me not to go to the guys for fear I might disgust them. And lots of insecure girls comparing their looks to mine cause they know I don't measure up anyways..<br><br>It's not that I dun want to make an effort to become much better, but I have no money!

            <div class='col-md body'>Looks does not equal to everything.<br><br>If you continue lamenting how ugly you look, how unfortunate you are, you will realise that more ppl will run away from you because all these negative thoughts will build inside you and you will give out a negative aura which turns ppl away from you. Coz they feel uneasy with you.<br><br>Attractive ppl don't necessary look beautiful but they are attractive because they give out positive aura which makes the ppl around them feel good about themselves when they hang around attractive ppl.<br><br>Thus, I would suggest that you try to be more positive in your thinking.<br><br>Looks doesn't equate to everything.<br><br>You are still young. Don't worry about not being to have a bf now. Just concentrate studying and do things that will build up your confidence level. You can do some volunteering for a change. It will give tremendous boost to your confidence level, thus, feeling good about yourself.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

But firstly, if you can't even bear looking at the REAL you and telling yourself that you are an art that needs the effort to develop into one, then you can always push it into your subconscious mind and avoid like what you have been doing all these while.<br><br>The worst thing you could tell yourself is: 'I can't do it...'<br><br>Always ask 'How do I achieve it...'<br><br>When you use 'How' - you forced yourself to think of ways to achieve and not eliminate your chance completely to self and trust me, you will devise a way to achieve your 'How' and not avoid facing your flaws.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Physical beauty is not about the money - that's probably a quarter of the picture. You need intensive knowledge about WHAT and WHERE to improve yourself at good cost-value equation. You are probably thinking of what? Expression to lose weight? Slim Fit to enhance assets? Jean Yip beauty consultant? Lasik surgery to restore perfect vision? Haach Body and Skin care?<br><br>Woman are so insecure with themselves that these business exploit those vulnerability to their advantage, creating desires, needs and in the end, actions with paying for those services. I always believe there are alternatives to those premium services - it depends on whether you want to spent additional effort in research and to pursue them, if you don't have the money.<br><br>Woman who gym heavily, hardly find a need for slimming session and the cost they save is like more than 10 times the amount?<br><br>Then comes dress sense; you don't need designer brands to make you look beautiful. In fact, they don't. You wear the clothes and not having your clothes to wear you. You just need to know your strength/flaws and dress to either<br><br>I) Exploit on strength.<br><br>II) Hide flaws.<br><br>You will need to know what look good with you and how can you achieve them. You will need experiment and experiment comes from various decisions. And good decision comes from bad judgment. You will probably make some fashion mistake, but still, who gives a damn. You will gradually evolve and understand your niche/style.<br><br>Third come personality. Some people don't look fantastic physically, but they have an attracting personality that 'made' people thought that they are charming in some manner. You influence people to 'think' that you are beautiful will indirectly make you feel that you are indeed beautiful (Don't know if you get what I mean).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">pat pat jam on a bread*<br><br>girl, i understand it's very saddening when people around passed such bad remarks about u.  Well, I think they were just being insensitive or superficial.  What matter most is the inner beauty.  I am sure u will be able to find someone who truly appreciates you for what you are and love you for being you.<br><br>Like what Yun and the others said, you have to be confident with yourself.  Looks ain't everything.  If even you can't accept yourself for what you are, and you really mind about your looks, you will not be confident and comfortable enough to mingle around with others...<br><br>Well, I'm a student too.  I cannot afford to go for facial, menicure, peridcure, hair treatment, slimming sessions etc too.  But you dun have to go for all those things.  You can DIY yourself.  Be disciplined enough to wash ur face, tone and moisturise, cut, trim and polish your nails regularly, do hair treatment yourself, take care of personal hygiene and grooming.. you can exercise without having to spend money also.  Hmm u dun have to wear expensive clothing, juz dress appropriately for the occasion will do.<br><br>I duno how ur teeth look like.. but perhaps after u come out to work, you might want to consider putting braces.  If this can help u gain ur confidence, then by all means do it when u can afford to.  I duno wat's so bad with ur legs also.. but if it's really bad, juz wear jeans/pants to hide the flaws.<br><br>Don't let others bring you down. You are unique and nobody can replace you. I dun deny that people judge by looks at first impression, but ultimately it's still ur personality and character that attracts people. </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i used to be like you.but now, i believe confidence resides within you.you cant possibly let someone dictate your life .u are not ugly.you have to find confidence in other aspects of your life .You dont need superficial ppl to criticise you.you need nurturing friends,ppl who can encourage or motivate you to improve yourself.perhaps give yourself some time to heal your wounds before changing yourself physically because i believe you are emotionally hurt<br><br>you need to regain your confidence.its going to be a difficult process but trust me.i believe with time, you would be able to find your confidence.physical appearance is transient, you cant rely on beauty to be confident.you need to find confidence within you.ask yourself. are you good in any realms of your life such as sports.studies,arts etc? and work on it.live for yourself. theres only so much you can do to improve your looks.but you need to have self-confident.tell yourself i am going to be the best and i would strive to be the best.</div>
