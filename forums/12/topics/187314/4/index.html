            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jam on a bread:</div><div class="quote_body">Thanks people, I read through every post here but since i'm quite sleepy, I'll cut short and try to describe my looks and how my insecurities built up because (mostly) of it.<br><br>Ok, about my teeth..it's yellow and protuding when I smile. So ya, I have quite an ugly smile which turns ppl off (I can see the look on their face).<br><br>Secondly, my legs, it's hairy and there's some black marks all over.<br><br>Thirdly, my skin, it's oily and wrinkled (because a few yrs back, I had lots of pimples now it's cured but my skin looks dull and tired)<br><br>Fourth, my hair sucks!! I keep dropping hair. my whole room and living room..my parents always scold me because of this. My hair is messy and untidy no matter how much I comb. Though I admit I do not comb religiously. (I mean i'm not like those ppl that keeps combing their hair for like..a few mins between)<br><br>Ok and lastly, my body sucks..i am flabby and have tummy &gt;.&lt; I still look ugly when I wear nice clothes.  Also, my nose have loads of black heads.<br><br>I never feel happy or satisfied neither can I build long lasting relations. I once went out with my pretty stepmum (now already divorced wif my father). Well, we were in a bus and it was very crowded. We were both standing. Than suddenly, one guy stood up and offered his seat to her, which left me standing..my stepmum, feeling sorry for me, gave the seat to me instead.<br><br>Secondly, that time I arrived to class and I saw a group of grumpy boys seated together. I look at them and they look at me. No smiles. But come the chiobu of the class, most of them started to smile and look at her.<br><br>Thirdly, I once like this guy (ok he was the one tat called me a freak) so his friends knew it and vent their anger on me. One of his friends called me ugly. In the end, his friends made him feel good by trying to matchmake him with another pretty and more capable girl from other class. They seem to like annoucing her name whenever I walk pass them. It was obviously trying to frustrate me.<br><br>Lastly, I jokingly told my friend we could pass off as sisters and the next thing I knew, I kena snubbed by her badly, which leaves me quite scarred after the incident. To think my this friend was once a lonely girl and I found her and now she's sociable and well-liked while she just abandons me.<br><br>Hey ppl , please do not pity me or anything because a few of classmates pitied me and they tried pairing me up with this quite ugly guy. well, obvioulsy he wasn't happy and he even tried to beat me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> So conclusion is, they think ugly is with ugly ppl. When I talk to a handsome guy, they will become jealous and snap at me for being a flirt while others is ok. I talk to this handsome guy (not because he handsome i tok to him hor, but because he helped me when i kena bullied) they tried all means to saboh my ssch life..in the end, I am left with nothing and now, i'm retaking my o levels twice..cause im not ready to face the world..I am just too scared..<br><br>Btw in maple, I met this guy (my ex classmate) he ask me how was I doing all that. I fel that he is the only one that sincerely cares abt me unlike the others. But...it's been two years and he has his own friends so I was thinking that I shouldn't disturb him. Besides, he doesn't play maple, he just use his acc to visit me cause I /find him but he wasn't online after that.<br><br>I read through all of them, it's not that I visualize, trying to self toture myself..lolx, why would I do that? If I can, I wish I can live normally without being restricted here and there...</div></blockquote>wow u must have took plenty of time to type this out....<br><br>yr physical appearance can be improved by regular exercise....Best option is go to a gym but if u r 2 shy, try jogging at nearby stadium or neighborhood n do simple toning exercises, buy a pair of dumbells to work out at home although the BEST option is go to a gym to workout....also have healthy meals..<br><br>with all these in place, i can garantee yr physique n skin condition will improve because i have tried it myself..i was once thin n shaggy, although i m still not satisifed with outcome now, i can see improvements in my physique n most importantly my confidence<br><br>Btw which Maple world u r in ? I m in Cassiopia n if by chance if u r in Cassopia , maybe we can be buddies there  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wow.. four pages already, i hope i'm not too late to  post here...<br>my apologies if i'm repeating..<br><br>Actually looks aren't everything (but of course with looks it's definately a plus point), it's just how you portray yourself.<br><br>But of course when it comes to females, without looks it's quite lugi actually..just look at the entertainment people, male celebs may not be even drop dead gorgeous, but they still make it big. but for females, if u're not pretty, the most u can only end up like Patricia Mok.... whoops, but i believe after packaging, she's quite alright also, there are tonnes of people who look even worse than her loh, i don't know why people keep on labelling her ugly.<br><br>However, now we're talking about our daily normal lives, as long as you're confident and outspoken, u don't need to be really pretty to be a social animal. When i was in school, there was this girl who isn't pretty at all, but she's very outspoken and confident + dress well too, she hangs out with a bunch of babes...after sometime, everyone looks at her in a different light. I never heard of anyone calling her ugly or anything. She just blends well with the others.<br><br>Also, I have another guy friend.. who isn't good looking at all, but he gets all the babes(friends only, not gfs) in school. Everytime i see him at the canteen.. it's like 10 girls to one guy, and yah, he's that guy loh...and also, he got a huge networks (not only girls, but guys too)... He once told me that he was a very inconfident guy too, but later on when he opened up, he realise, life wasn't that bad after all (with all the babes.. of course lah.. )....<br><br>Dear threadstarter, i believe all the flaws that you have mentioned can be corrected, i shan't elaborate on how as the others have already suggested to you.... not everyone's born perfect, so I guess you can start working on improving yourself(both physically and mentally), you're still so young, way to go girl...don't let such things bring you down!<br><br>P.S those peeps were real mean to call you names like freak.. etc.. gosh, it just shows how superficial and immature they are. kids(not all tho) these days, really, no parents to teach them issit? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Seriously, I haven't seen such crude people during my school days... blah.. don't take it to heart... they themselves are freaks actually, and i don't believe that they are any better looking themselves.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BabyRS:</div><div class="quote_body">I personally think age is a major factor here.<br><br>Everyone IS attractive in their own ways - and every individual has his / her own personality trait that sets them apart from the rest.<br><br>Ok - I may be a little bit stereotypical here... but the younger generation more often than not place more emphasis on physical attributes. How often have we heard people muse: "Oh... when I was younger, I would find him/her attractive - but he/she's hardly my type now." It is not uncommon to find that the idea of "beauty" that teens have would be entirely superficial; fueled by the idealistic images portrayed by glossy magazines, movies and glamorous models. This does not apply to all, though... I have come across many young people who know precisely what they want, are able to think beyond their years and put many adults to shame.<br><br>Most prepubescent teens would get excited at a walking, breathing 'run of the mill' sexy person as immortalised by their idols and the faces staring at them from the pages of a magazine... but as they enter adulthood, most will find that their preferences grow with them. To put it crudely, it's no longer enough to have "Wham, Bam, Thank you ma'am(s)" sessions - the ability to communicate with the other person would feature more.<br><br>When a person appeals to you - either through intellect or their little quirks and idiosyncrasies - they become instantly attractive to you.<br><br>Of course it would be hypocritical of me if I said that looks does not matter... for a spark of interest to be ignited in a person, there must be that certain something about another person that appeals to the eye.<br><br>Having said that, it's been proven that we are societal and communal creatures. As much as we would like to disagree, society DOES play a part in what we (as a whole) consider beauty. There have been many studies by sociologists, (Desmond Morris, Dr. Stephen Hawking), that have shown societies' major influence on our "concept" of beauty. For example, there is a tribe in which the women stretch their lips and wear bigger and bigger "lip plates". Many western cultures find this unattractive and even revolting, but to the members of that tribe it is a mark of sheer beauty, and we are the "ugly" ones.<br><br>Hollywood, with it's pervasive print, television and movies, sets the tone for a lot of cultural definitions of beauty in many Western countries... and lately, the Asian one, too. Recent studies have shown that many people all over the world are adhering to the Hollywood 'standards' of beauty... which has led to an alarming increase in illnesses such as anorexia and bulimia in countries like the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and even the UK.<br><br>Society determines, to a very large extent, its version of beauty. However, I do believe that each person is a unique individual with their own unique characteristics. The question is when they find their own personalities. So... just because studies have shown that we react in a more positive way towards what the current idea of beauty is... there is plenty of room for individual interpretation.<br><br>To each his own - one man's meat, may be another man's poison. So long as you have the confidence to highlight your good points instead of letting the not so desirable ones get you down... I'm sure you'd do just fine.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>Wah seh.

            <div class='col-md body'>hi all,<br>firstly to say Looks = everything is a white lie.<br><br>we all know the looks will give you access to a better lie. You may get the free drinks for a gal or guy. You will get a better job when you start working. And sometimes, door just open for you even if you are doing nothing. I meant doors to life opportunity.<br><br>Society doesn't help by constantly protraying stars, models with figures that most gals would die for, or that six packed abs that guys will break their back for.<br><br>but the thread-starter, you need to know where your strong points are and where your weak points are.<br><br>I believe you have identified most of your defects. Can they be repaired?<br>Cause don't change the topics to Looks = $$$.<br><br>Work on one area at a time, and see a professional. Be brave.<br>No doubt, it will costs more, but the most important is to regain the balance in your life once again.<br><br>You may not achieve a hollywood face or body, but at least get one that can lfit your chin off the floor and be parallel to the horizon.<br><br>And at the same time, improve on other skills, like people skills, talking. I would prefer someone with the correct knowledge talking to me, than a air-head who blows hot air.<br><br>Don't compare downwards, and think, "ya, there are many people worse than me". Look upwards and think "maybe, I can try to wear dentures and improve my teeth arrangement, at least I can improve my speech".<br><br>be positive, be bold.<br></div>
