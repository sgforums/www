            <div class='col-md body'>hello jam<br>i see that many others have already replied to your post. What I want to say have already been covered by the rest. I just want to let you know that looks are not everything. What determines whether others will like you is your character and personality. Trust me compared to a girl with good looks and ahorrid personality the girl with a better personality but not-as-good looks would be more well liked.<br>Really what you can do is really dont mind so much abotu your appearance. just socialise more, be mroe friendly, more helpful and you will naturally have more friends. when people see that your personality overtakes your looks, they will overlook your flaws in your appearance.<br>cheer up<br>dont worry so much!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey girl, have to agree with what many of the others have told you.  You said you're still a student, so I guess peer pressure is really a great deal for you right now.  But there are many other things that you can put your energy on, like your studies, family, caring for the less fortunate...<br><br>LOL, I sound like i'm preaching or something!! :p<br><br>but seriously, I believe that you'll bloom into a beautiful girl in time to come.  I had many female classmates that I hadn't thought of as attractive during my school days, and even to the extent of not being 'popular'.  but right now, they've all grown out of that phase and are beautiful in their own ways!<br><br>So, do take heart!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sad but true to certain extent. good lookers are said to have more advantage over the bad lookers. its true to a certain extent. as the saying goes '1st impression'. if 1st impression isnt good, some ppl wont even want a 2nd impression. u cant deny that most ppl look at the looks 1st. cause u have to see the looks before u can see the heart right. so all those looks not impt but personality more impt is crap. i dont really agree that ppl see looks means they are shallow. if they see looks and figure ALONE, this is then call shallow n superficial as they dont care about other things. i think having good looks can boast one confidence also. as u wont feel inferior in your looks.<br><br>u go for interview. the presentables one will normally have the advantage. esp sales type of job or jobs that require u to have pleasant looks.<br><br>looks is not everything, but without it, you are as good as having nothing. unless you have other assets to make it up. eg. brains, good career, happy family etc.<br><br>so if u want to feel better, do tell yourself that you are at least fortunate, physically fit n young. most impt is happiness.</div>
