You know how the society tend to judge a girl by her looks. No looks=nothing. Aiya, that's why I have no friends (yes you are right, no friends, not even one that goes out with me) so I tend to do things all alone. No boyfriends (got one guy likes me but kena swayed by his friends opinions until dun like me liao).<br><br>A lot of ppl dun like me because they dun like my looks. Last time, I have a so-called friend. She said im disgusting because of my teeth. She even avoid sharing food with me for she dun want to know that my teeth have sank into it.<br><br>Thinking back, a lot of ppl vent on me or pick on me for no reason because my looks doesn't measure up. I got rejected by a guy and been called a freak. I ask for a stranger guy direction and he gave me a 'disgusted' look. My father keeps saying my legs is disgusting. Last time, I finally found a job and my manager told me to do sales (asking people to buy the products) He told me not to go to the guys for fear I might disgust them. And lots of insecure girls comparing their looks to mine cause they know I don't measure up anyways..<br><br>It's not that I dun want to make an effort to become much better, but I have no money! Everything costs like hundred bucks!! girls shld know those facial, hair and all those cost like a bomb! Help people!! it's ruining my life! my social life!

            <div class='col-md body'>hihi.. im an average girl no looks and stuff.. + i oso not tat tall.. i used to be quite sad when ppl say about me (esp my height) but over a period of time i gained my confidence and show them what i am capable of.. i am better in sports and some academic stuff, compare to ppl who are much taller or much prettier than me.. Confidence is important. and im sure u are a great girl, u just need to boost your self esteem and dun care about what ppl say. It may be easier said than done, but at least you are doing some thing about it rather than give in and let ppl 'bully' you even more. This takes time, but just don't give up k + you are still young, got a lot of things to learn in life. (I know someone who is a total tomboy back in sec sch but became a beaituful swan now).<br><br>Beauty can be improved by products in the market, but self esteem, confidence and character/attitude need to be build by yourself, at your own will. Without that, no matter how beautiful you are, you are still 'invisible' to others.<br><br>Ps. feel free to pm me ya  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks people, I read through every post here but since i'm quite sleepy, I'll cut short and try to describe my looks and how my insecurities built up because (mostly) of it.<br><br>Ok, about my teeth..it's yellow and protuding when I smile. So ya, I have quite an ugly smile which turns ppl off (I can see the look on their face).<br><br>Secondly, my legs, it's hairy and there's some black marks all over.<br><br>Thirdly, my skin, it's oily and wrinkled (because a few yrs back, I had lots of pimples now it's cured but my skin looks dull and tired)<br><br>Fourth, my hair sucks!! I keep dropping hair. my whole room and living room..my parents always scold me because of this. My hair is messy and untidy no matter how much I comb. Though I admit I do not comb religiously. (I mean i'm not like those ppl that keeps combing their hair for like..a few mins between)<br><br>Ok and lastly, my body sucks..i am flabby and have tummy &gt;.&lt; I still look ugly when I wear nice clothes.  Also, my nose have loads of black heads.<br><br>I never feel happy or satisfied neither can I build long lasting relations. I once went out with my pretty stepmum (now already divorced wif my father). Well, we were in a bus and it was very crowded. We were both standing. Than suddenly, one guy stood up and offered his seat to her, which left me standing..my stepmum, feeling sorry for me, gave the seat to me instead.<br><br>Secondly, that time I arrived to class and I saw a group of grumpy boys seated together. I look at them and they look at me. No smiles. But come the chiobu of the class, most of them started to smile and look at her.<br><br>Thirdly, I once like this guy (ok he was the one tat called me a freak) so his friends knew it and vent their anger on me. One of his friends called me ugly. In the end, his friends made him feel good by trying to matchmake him with another pretty and more capable girl from other class. They seem to like annoucing her name whenever I walk pass them. It was obviously trying to frustrate me.<br><br>Lastly, I jokingly told my friend we could pass off as sisters and the next thing I knew, I kena snubbed by her badly, which leaves me quite scarred after the incident. To think my this friend was once a lonely girl and I found her and now she's sociable and well-liked while she just abandons me.<br><br>Hey ppl , please do not pity me or anything because a few of classmates pitied me and they tried pairing me up with this quite ugly guy. well, obvioulsy he wasn't happy and he even tried to beat me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> So conclusion is, they think ugly is with ugly ppl. When I talk to a handsome guy, they will become jealous and snap at me for being a flirt while others is ok. I talk to this handsome guy (not because he handsome i tok to him hor, but because he helped me when i kena bullied) they tried all means to saboh my ssch life..in the end, I am left with nothing and now, i'm retaking my o levels twice..cause im not ready to face the world..I am just too scared..<br><br>Btw in maple, I met this guy (my ex classmate) he ask me how was I doing all that. I fel that he is the only one that sincerely cares abt me unlike the others. But...it's been two years and he has his own friends so I was thinking that I shouldn't disturb him. Besides, he doesn't play maple, he just use his acc to visit me cause I /find him but he wasn't online after that.<br><br>I read through all of them, it's not that I visualize, trying to self toture myself..lolx, why would I do that? If I can, I wish I can live normally without being restricted here and there...</div>

So ya, I have quite an ugly smile which turns ppl off (I can see the look on their face).<br><span style="color: red;">&gt;&gt;Yellow teeth: Buy those toothpastes that has whitening formula in them...keep it a habit to brush your teeth after every meal..(I know it's troublesome, but then, if you don't put in your efforts to improve, no one can help u). If after every meal to brush your teeth's hard to accomplish, well..at least do it twice a day then..</span><br><br>Secondly, my legs, it's hairy and there's some black marks all over.<br><span style="color: blue;">&gt;&gt;1] Hairy legs: Shave/wax your leg hairs regularly...at least twice a week, i would sugguest...</span> <span style="color: red;"><br>&gt;&gt;2] Black marks: Buy those creams that can fade the marks (Need to apply twice a day, if i'm not wrong). Can be found in those Watsons/Guardians stores.</span><br>Thirdly, my skin, it's oily and wrinkled (because a few yrs back, I had lots of pimples now it's cured but my skin looks dull and tired)<br><span style="color: red;">&gt;&gt;Oily Skin: Again, there're such facial wash/creams that you can buy from Watsons/Guardian stores. Apply twice a day.</span><br><br>Fourth, my hair sucks!! I keep dropping hair. my whole room and living room..my parents always scold me because of this. My hair is messy and untidy no matter how much I comb. Though I admit I do not comb religiously. (I mean i'm not like those ppl that keeps combing their hair for like..a few mins between)<br><span style="color: blue;">&gt;&gt;Hair drop: Becoz you've an oily skin, try using the right shampoo for ur oily hair/scalp. Wash your hair with luke warm water (Not too warm)...</span><br><br>Ok and lastly, my body sucks..i am flabby and have tummy &gt;.&lt; I still look ugly when I wear nice clothes.  Also, my nose have loads of black heads.<br><span style="color: red;">&gt;&gt; Flabby body &amp; Tummy: You need to tone up yourself. Either you go to the gym or you do some exercise yourself at home... Try to do crunches or sit-ups everyday. </span><br><span style="color: indigo;">&gt;&gt; Black heads on nose: U need to wash your face at least twice a day. If you want, after washing, apply some toner to close up.</span><br><br>All in all, i don't feel sorry for your state. You're just plain lazy to do up yourself. Be hardworking on yourself abit.<br><br></div></blockquote>To add up. You might not turn pretty overnight but it would probably take time even if you decide to do so... Put in CONSTANT EFFORT for what you WISH to GAIN and ACHIEVE over night... It can HAPPEN only if you ALLOWS it to HAPPEN....<br><br>Meanwhile just try to keep your COOL and CONFIDENCE?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
