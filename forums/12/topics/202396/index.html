Many of you may say, "Is there a reason to love?".

Perhaps even that person has a direct, or blunt, approach to life that you wish you too could have that approach. Think about what makes you so attracted to this person.<br><br>There are cases when the time spent with a person is nothing compared to the QUALITY time spent with another person. I known a friend for many years, but due to a misunderstanding started indirectly by me, he said, "Can dun be frens wif me de...".
