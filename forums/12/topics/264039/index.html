            <div class='col-md body'>I am curious as to how it was considered harrassment.<br><br>Telling crude jokes among collegues who dont mind are a matter of bonding.<br><br>If the crude joke was directed at TS, with specific mention of TS' private sexual performance or with suggestion to be intimate with TS himself.<br><br>Then you can safely consider it a harrassment.<br><br>If he is merely continuing with the joke just to annoy you. With the rest of the collegues knowing that it annoys you yet do not ask that fella to stop.<br><br>Then its definitely your sensitivity level is higher then them and they do not support you in the same group.<br><br>You seriously has to consider walking away and stay away from them if you cannot handle their kinda joke.<br><br>And yes, talk to HR about it.  They have a better legal knowledge as what constitute as right or wrong kinda joke among colllegues.<br><br>You have to remember, you are not pressured to stay with that group of collegues and joke with them if you are not comfortable with them.  They themselves should  be more worried about how their image will be if they continued to harrassed you or offer crude unacceptable jokes..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tsk tsk  tsk... must tread carefully. Avoid taking part in too many sexual jokes at work. Harmless flirting at the office bar or during lunch is fine. But personally I would find it offensive if a sexual joke is targetted at my private body part in the presence of a group with everyone else laughing at it afterwards.<br><br>Whether colleagues will target disrespectful remarks at you explicitly largely depends on how you carry yourself as a female also. So take care in that aspect lah. When things like that happen with a male group at work and they laugh like monkeys, it helps to keep a straight face, give a condescending smile, then they will apologise afterwards. No point laughing with them just to fit in, especially if the joke is at your expense. You're not a guy remember?<br><br>What about other female colleagues, do they find him offensive?<br>Or does this only happen to you?<br>If so, ask yourself is there a reason why you're the target?<br>Is there anything you can do to change that?<br><br>Avoid joining the group for lunch too often and maintain a safe distance for the time being and hang out with other colleagues first.<br><br>When someone asks you why you no longer join them as often, then you can tell him or her the reason. Hopefully he or she will be the one to relate the message and tell the male colleague off.<br></div>
