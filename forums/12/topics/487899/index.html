I am solely seeking advice regarding my unberable predicament which I will try my best to explain in the next few posts while keeping the authenticity of the story to the best of what I know. Being extremely complicated, please take time to read and tell me what you think. I am aware it is not an easy problem but refrain from writing negative remarks.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">I am a 37 year old male, or shall I say it is what I am listed as. I have a deep psychological illness which is currently being diagnosed and seeking treatment. I have a past history of being abused by my stepmother ever since my birth mother passed away when I was 10 years old. I began to develop the mindset that all "females" are aggressors and there exists in this world, two types of people. One, the "male" gender who is typically the strict, unforgiving and profit driven character, and the other, the "female" which I created to be people who exist to equalise the former. Because of that, I also see actual females as mostly people who belong to the first category due to my upbringing, and certain males to be the second. My father runs a well established business and I see him as a business person who is good in making profits. After graduating from my primary education, I was homeschooled and the only friends I made were other homeschooled kids whom I played together with. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">I got to know a childhood friend, Thomas who later become my lover. We been through thick and thin, and he has supported me in many ways. However, I was afraid to bring this up to my father. I am the only child of my family and the sole inheritor of my father's business and he was rushing my marriage since I turned 35. A sudden twist came and we are finally getting close to being together when the nightmare happened....</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"> </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">2 years ago, I learnt that my cousin, Alice is seeing a girl. At that time, she did not know of my relationship with Thomas and I was not a bit suspicious of her behavior. I offered to meet the girl with her one day. One thing led to another and I came to find out that the girl was actually Thomas's sister, Tina. Months later, we went on trips and double dates without our parents' knowledge. Due to my father's constant presurring to set me up with matchmakers, the four of us came up with a devious plan. Alice and Thomas will get married first, allowing Thomas to stay at my house as my uncles's son-in-law and then Tina and I will get married after that. The four of us often got together at family dinners and soon, Alice and Thomas got married. I was extremely nervous during the ceremony, but I swallowed my pride and we began living together since last year. It was then I started to find out the unimaginable. </p>

              <p>When my suspicion of Alice actually being a lesbian rose, I dug up her actions using a PI. I gathered information that there are few evidences showing that Alice is dating Tina, and she has been acting strangely when Thomas was around. Digging deeper had caused me countless heartbreak when I found that Tina was the birth daugher of my stepmother whom she has pushed away when she married my father years ago. Tina was raised an orphan by an unknown family. Then, at my company, I found out through some records that my father had past convictions relating to him being a whistleblower when he was still an employee. The CEO at that time was sentenced harshly and he did not spare my father either so he made him the scapegoat for some of his crimes. My father then grew the company enormously with the help of some contacts from the earlier company, set up his own which is dealing in the same business. It was indeed strange that we became rich so quickly but I was too young to understand then. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also learnt that the CEO had passed away, and the family who raised Tina and Thomas was related to the CEO, and they are plotting revenge against us. Although Tina and Thomas are not related, Thomas's mother groomed Tina to be a smart attractive young woman who somehow got in the good books of my cousin. Now, that family already has one leg into my family business. It breaks my heart to think that perhaps, Thomas approached me intentionally and made use of my condition to marry into my family and the whole lesbian thing is all staged. In light of this, I confronted my step mother recently about knowing that Tina was her birth daughter. However, she said that has no knowledge that it was the CEO's relative who have adopted her. From what I observed, Tina does not know that my step mother is actually her real mother and she has been manipulated by her adoptive mother who is greedy to take over the company. </p>
              <p>I feel that all of them are out to swallow my family business and I can't break this news to my father either since he has bad health. It has been awkward lately when I met up with Thomas because of my recent findings. I want to believe that his feelings towards me is sincere, but if I happen to marry his sister Tina, our company is as good as gone. </p>
              <p>My father and uncle are pressuring me to marry her at the end of this year but I need to think of a way to solve this problem. </p>

              <p>If I really got married to her, I would become in-laws with my father's rival, which he has no knowledge of right now. When Alice and Thomas gotten married, his mother and husband showed up but they managed to keep the secret of being related to the past CEO very well. They are indeed very crafty and it seemed like well devised plan to rob us. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I also started to have thoughts that my uncle also wanted the company for himself, so he allowed Alice to marry Thomas while possibly shaking hands with the other side to chase away my father and I. It is very possible because he was one of the only few who knows about the company, how the CEO lost his fortune and how my father grew the company. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My step mother, on the other hand might have intentionally adopted out her daughter to that family so her position is secure. If the daughter secret is exposed and my father wanted a divorce, she would still not lose her assets because of her daughter's marriage with me. I really don't want to marry her but I can't tell this story to my father. Is there a good way out? </p>
