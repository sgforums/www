I'm ashamed to say i do. Attention from pretty women are always welcome. Hmm, actually attention from any women are welcome, so long they don't really pester me.<br><br>Since i don't have a gf, or just ended a r/s, i won't comment on that, but if there's a chance, and i'm confident of it, i would.<br><br>No. This may be insecurity on Her part. What's it got to do with me? If i can convince her that security can be found through me, maybe she'll change. *shrugs*</div>
