What I can suggest you to do is to treat your sister like a primary school girl, giving her the care and concern and bear with the nuisance of what a primary school girl gives.<br><br>I believe as time pass, your sister's mentality will soon grow old and become mature too.

            <div class='col-md body'>hi, i suggest bring her to the doctor instead of IMH, the place is not for her. Let the doctor diagnose what's the illness and decide what to do next always let your sis know that everyone is concerning about her, she will feel it, spend sometime with her and accept her, talk to her nicely and yes have some patient, as long as there is a will, there is a way. dun be sad... cos no1 is perfect, all the best<br>Good luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in my 100% reliable opinion, your sister is being influenced by her friends. not so much a slow-learning brain but rather the maturity of the peers she hangs out with. Remember the saying, if a man dwells in the company of snakes, he will also become a snake? Yes, that's the reason why she's still so childish. As for the computer you can allow her up to 2 hours of playtime seeing that she's such a game addict. Cure her slowly lah.. no need IMH...yet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think your sis is a late developer... She sounds like she's suffering from mild autism... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>She's not MAD</strong></span>...<br><br>My step sister is autistic (really serious kind)... She can't talk clearly, and she's like SUPER hyper-active and doctor had instructed us to reduce as much sugar from her diet as we can (that's why no more sweets and chocolates) cos sugar will make her even more hyper active.<br><br>She cannot take simple instructions properly, half the time I really wonder if she really register what we say, but when you least expects it she does the correct thing with good effort.<br><br>One more thing... She's really really good with the computer... Anything computer related, she's a whizz.  Though I have not tried if she could break passwords... But trust me... She's very intelligent...<br><br>Read up on this web, maybe it can help you... http://www.autism.org/contents.html<br><br>No matter what, I still love my step sister, cos it is not anyone's fault that she's born that way... She's a loving person by nature, just that genetics played a joke on her.  There's no cure, so the best way is to understand what she's suffering from, and making it easier for her and the family to live with her condition, and hopefully provide a nurturing environment for her to grow up.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, i believe i have a similar problem with my sister, she`s however almost 19. simply put it, laziness and naive. You can guess, her education is a mess, can't get into teritary of any sort, and simply spends btw never thinks of the consequences, and gets easily influenced. Just takes things for granted, no means of income,(what can u do without a proper paper cert these days?)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> i mean there are bills to pay and at an age of 19, i would say one would prob wake up to reality.<br></div>
