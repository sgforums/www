Is it completely random or just some word that is long enough that is guessable?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Seriously, if you have a password like xetundiwtymbretf132 and she guessed it, she is really a geek. If you have something like computersAREdumb3432, then it's only a matter of time that she guessed it.<br><br>As for dying for the computer, I guess she's addicted to the PC. The newspapers covered about PC addicts a few years ago. They are no different like drug addicts. For the very serious cases, they even threaten death if you don't let them use the PC. If that's the case, IMH is needed or if your family doesn't want, try counselling instead.<br><br>Eating habits are just eating habits... who don't like sweets?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
