              <p>i have this guy friend A.  he met girl B at a time when she was involved in a break-up with guy C.  at the time A met B, B did not tell him that she was going through a break-up.  A sensed her depression and stood by her, caring for her as he himself went through similar situation and could empathesize with her.  all the while B was in contact with C and trying for patch back several times.  A didn't know about this till he found out one day which shocked him. </p>
              <p>due to her depression and break-up, A went through shit to be by her side, almost every day.  A didn't expect anything in return.  he could have left, but he couldn't bear to leave her alone.  then B slowly grew to like A.  by this time, A's passion waned since B was never present with him.  B got angry and put on show with C (purposely flirted with C in front of A) to make A jealous and hurt him.</p>
              <p>under such circumstances, where nothing was EVER explained to A by B, who could blame A for getting angry ?  in response B played more games to hurt A - the one who stood by her when C threw her aside for another girl. </p>
              <p>C was obviously playing with B and purposely want to break A-B by slandering A.  but B was either blind or biased, despite A's advice to her.  what amazes me is that, B sides C despite his wrongdoings and his actions to hurt A.  B NEVER admit that C is wrong in hurting A (both B and C ganged up to hurt A).  B even demands that A gives her unconditional love and accuses him of a selfish person who gives to expect her doing something in return. </p>
              <p>my friend A never really cared for her returning stuff.  *pui* who wants stuff from her ? he is more pissed at her conspiracy with C, and her double standards.  and to think of the hurtful words and actions both C and B do to intentionally hurt him.  she is just a dumb-ass who doesn't think and see clearly.  demands unconditional love from someone, yet gave it back in BIG BITES.  only know how to talk airy theory.  her hypocrisy and stupidity appalls A.  may you both B and C rot in hell and pay for your bad karma.</p>

              <p>I am very experience in dealing with woman esp Holly Madison and Kendra Wilkinson. Because you know I own a mansion with many bunnies. So I give you my advice, my fellow man...</p>
              <p>A is obviously facing the "game". I don't know what A did but it is obvious that B is detecting some attraction from A. Do not get the wrong idea - B is not interested in A. Girls who play the game want to make fun of the guy. Girls who are interested in the guy will never bring in another guy to make him jeolous.</p>
              <p>My advice to you. Oh to Mr A. Is to ignore B and C. Just act like a statue and show no reaction. Then you will see Ms B become very desperate and do a lot of funny things. Actually it is very funny. But keep on behaving like a statue, no reaction, no smile, no unhappiness. Sooner or later B will leave you alone. And yes Karma will get them some day. Just be happy and go back to your usual things. I am sure you deserve better than B. Don't worry about C. C did not dump B. C is only chipping in to play a game to fool you so that you can be lured to chase after B and B will after that dump you and make you feel pain. B will enjoy high market value while you wallow in your pain. So best policy is to dump B and ignore B. Remember show no reaction because B intention is to make you angry. When you show no reaction, you do the right thing and you make B angry because B will get frustrated when she realise that she means no value to you. Yes, treat B like B means nothing to you. That would hurt B.</p>

              <p>well, thks for yr "enlightenment".  rest assured that A is not attracted to B.  neither did he intend to chase after B.  if anything, it was more out of sympathy and probably a little boredom.  anyone interested in you would give you more attention than what B pined for.</p>
              <p>and yes B did do many funny things when A ignored B.  it was a funny sight to watch B in desperation. it stroked A's ego seeing both B and C dish out so many bunny shows and hat tricks just to catch A's attention.  oh to great length they both went, even unto jumping through hula hoops and lighting themselves on fire.  it provided some entertainment when one is bored.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Good ! You must ensure that this is the end of B and C's funny games. Now it is time for closure. Let me enlighten you how to conduct closure. You do it by lobbying. Yes you must lobby to your friends and acquaintances about B and C. Talk about how bad people you think they are. Oh sorry, I mean A not you. Then A must go and tell everybody about the kind of true relationships he only seek and he don't seek fake women like B. So this is what I call lobbying and campaigning so that A can stop B from talking bad things behind his back without his knowledge.</p></div>

              <p>hmmm see A's mood lah.  sometimes the bunny shows by B and C are quite funny.  he throw a little fire and they jump like crazy and start to spew crap all over the place.  it's rather entertaining to see them so captivated and affected by A. </p>
              <p>i don;t think A need to waste effort to talk bad about B lah.  fake-ness shows on its own.  oh did i mention that C cheated on B ?  see... they already live in misery.  fake attracts fake.</p>

              <p>for the 
              record, A is not attracted to B.  if he did, at most the look at first 
              glance.  beyond the skin, unfortunately either there is nothing else or B
               is too shy to show it.  but i'm tempted to think it's the former, bcos 
              maybe that's why B and C maintain a FWB relationship.  besides being a 
              wreck and a bad-mouthing guy-bitch, the reason C always comes back to B 
              despite their failed relationship like a son crying for his mother is, i
               believe, lust and probably that B makes C feel good.  C is hollow 
              himself and needs B's attention to sustain his leaking self esteem. </p>
              <p>pathetic
               pair...  they think A is blindly led all along by their smoke screen ? 
               he just keep quiet because he feels pity for them both.   è‹¥è¦�äººä¸�çŸ¥ï¼Œé™¤é�žå·±èŽ«ä¸ºã€‚</p>
              <p>B
               is a strong "proponent" of and likes to demand unconditional love. 
              well, if you practise it, would you play those games to hurt someone 
              else ?    revenge is what you used, not unconditional love.   that's why
               i say, talk only...  double standard...  don't expect ppl to respect 
              you if you can't walk the talk, especially when you are one who should 
              be teaching other ppl by virture of yr maturity and age.  you should be 
              telling your kiddy ex to stop those things he did.  yet you conspired 
              with him to play games ...  against someone who stood by you in your 
              darkest hours. </p>
              <p>see all the rotten things from you.  stain ppl's 
              mind with your crap 
              theory of love which is only smoke and hot air. </p>
              <p>you are an 
              emotional leech.  you bleed and leak from the hit by C.  then you suck 
              from A to sustain your self esteem.  while you leak some more to give to
               C the other leech.  playing this game round and round.  if you now see 
              what in fact was going on, pls take a minute to smell the stench

              <p>under such circumstances, where nothing was EVER explained to A by B, who could blame A for getting angry ?  in response B played more games to hurt A - the one who stood by her when C threw her aside for another girl. </p>
              <p>C was obviously playing with B and purposely want to break A-B by slandering A.  but B was either blind or biased, despite A's advice to her.  what amazes me is that, B sides C despite his wrongdoings and his actions to hurt A.  B NEVER admit that C is wrong in hurting A (both B and C ganged up to hurt A).  B even demands that A gives her unconditional love and accuses him of a selfish person who gives to expect her doing something in return. </p>
              <p>my friend A never really cared for her returning stuff.  *pui* who wants stuff from her ? he is more pissed at her conspiracy with C, and her double standards.  and to think of the hurtful words and actions both C and B do to intentionally hurt him.  she is just a dumb-ass who doesn't think and see clearly.  demands unconditional love from someone, yet gave it back in BIG BITES.  only know how to talk airy theory.  her hypocrisy and stupidity appalls A.  may you both B and C rot in hell and pay for your bad karma.</p>
