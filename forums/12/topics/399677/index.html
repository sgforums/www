              <p>i have this guy friend A.  he met girl B at a time when she was 
              involved in a break-up with guy C.  at the time A met B, B did not tell 
              him that she was going through a break-up.  A sensed her depression and 
              stood by her, caring for her as he himself went through similar 
              situation and could empathesize with her.  all the while B was in 
              contact with C and trying for patch back several times.  A didn't know 
              about this till he found out one day which shocked him. </p>
              <p>due to 
              her depression and break-up, A went through shit to be by her side, 
              almost every day.  A didn't expect anything in return.  he could have 
              left, but he couldn't bear to leave her alone.  then B slowly grew to 
              like A.  by this time, A's passion waned since B was never present with 
              him.  B got angry and put on show with C (purposely flirted with C in 
              front of A) to make A jealous and hurt him.</p>
              <p>under such 
              circumstances, where nothing was EVER explained to A by B, who could 
              blame A for getting angry ?  in response B played more games to hurt A -
               the one who stood by her when C threw her aside for another girl. </p>
              <p>C
               was obviously playing with B and purposely want to break A-B by 
              slandering A.  but B was either blind or biased, despite A's advice to 
              her.  what amazes me is that, B sides C despite his wrongdoings and his 
              actions to hurt A.  B NEVER admit that C is wrong in hurting A (both B 
              and C ganged up to hurt A).  B even demands that A gives her 
              unconditional love and accuses him of a selfish person who gives to 
              expect her doing something in return. </p>
              <p>my friend A never really 
              cared for her returning stuff.  *pui* who wants stuff from her ? he is 
              more pissed at her conspiracy with C, and her double standards.  and to 
              think of the hurtful words and actions both C and B do to intentionally 
              hurt him.  she is just a dumb-ass who doesn't think and see clearly.  
              demands unconditional love from someone, yet gave it back in BIG BITES. 
               only know how to talk airy theory.  her hypocrisy and stupidity appalls
               A.  may you both B and C rot in hell and pay for your bad karma.</p>

              <p>i have this guy friend A.  he met girl B at a time when she
                      was involved in a break-up with guy C.  at the time A met B, B
                      did not tell him that she was going through a break-up.  A
                      sensed her depression and stood by her, caring for her as he
                      himself went through similar situation and could empathesize with
                      her.  all the while B was in contact with C and trying for
                      patch back several times.  A didn't know about this till he
                      found out one day which shocked him. </p>
              <p>due to her depression and break-up, A went through shit to be by
                      her side, almost every day. <span style="color: #ff0000;"> A didn't expect anything in
                      return</span>.  he could have left, but he couldn't bear to leave her
                      alone.  then B slowly grew to like A.  by this time, <span style="color: #ff0000;">A's
                      passion waned</span> since B was never present with him.  B got angry
                      and put on show with C (purposely flirted with C in front of A) to
                      make <span style="color: #ff0000;">A jealous and hurt him</span>.</p>
              <p>under such circumstances, where nothing was EVER explained to A
                      by B, who could blame A for getting angry ?  in response B
                      played more games to hurt A - the one who stood by her when C threw
                      her aside for another girl. </p>
              <p>C was obviously playing with B and purposely want to break A-B
                      by slandering A.  but B was either blind or biased, despite
                      A's advice to her.  what amazes me is that, B sides C despite
                      his wrongdoings and his actions to hurt A.  B NEVER admit that
                      C is wrong in hurting A (both B and C ganged up to hurt A).  B
                      even demands that A gives her unconditional love and accuses him of
                      a selfish person who gives to expect her doing something in
                      return. </p>
              <p>my friend A never really cared for her returning stuff. 
                      *pui* who wants stuff from her ? he is more pissed at her
                      conspiracy with C, and her double standards.  and to think of
                      the hurtful words and actions both C and B do to intentionally hurt
                      him.  she is just a dumb-ass who doesn't think and see
                      clearly.  demands unconditional love from someone, yet gave it
                      back in BIG BITES.  only know how to talk airy theory. 
                      her hypocrisy and stupidity appalls A.  may you both B and C
                      rot in hell and pay for your bad karma.</p>
