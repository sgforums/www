I know this sounds pretty blunt, but it's his life, and you can't expect him to to make potentially life-changing decisions based on your own needs.<br><br>If he thinks that repeating the year is in his best interests, then you should respect his wishes. A true friend is one who respects the wishes of others irrespective of their own feelings. By expecting him to conform to what you want, you're just being plain selfish.<br><br>I'll say it again: accept his decision and move on. That's what a true friend would do.</div>

I have lost a good friend to a girl. The girl means more to him than our 2 years of ups and downs.
