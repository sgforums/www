              <p>I'm not sure if there is something wrong with me or what. I have an unsettling urge to want to get a whipping with the rotan cane. Not like the school version but like the ones in prison. LIke when I see videos like these:</p>
              <p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7vbn9mqKv8</p>
              <p>http://www.youtube.com/verify_age?next_url=/watch%3Fv%3DPBE7p5gDNe4</p>
              <p>I want to be the girl who gets subjected to that and feels that kind of injury and pain, and feel very depressed that Singapore for whatever reason does not cane girls or women because it excludes me.</p>
              <p>Then my rational side takes over and says why would anyone intentionally want to get flogged? I guess I just want to feel and to overcome hardship and to have a sense of strength or maybe I just really like the idea of intese physical pain I'm not sure. I do not know if I am loosing my mind or if this is a normal thought process or what?</p>
              <p>When I see something like this video I really want to be the person on the receiving end. It's like an overwhelming urge. Can anybody give any advice on why someone might feel this way?</p>

              <p>Okay but killing is not my thing. Whipping is not either really, that is my point of confusion. Actually at some level I am terrified of the idea and of what I see in the videos I posted links to, but it is like an urge, or uncontrollable desire, like a sense that I need it or deserve it.</p>
              <p>I did try to get a boyfriend to spank me once, he did it but not very hard, it was like he was afraid of hurting me or something. I do not know how many boys might be into that. But my feeling is deeper than that anyway. Its like an deep sensational urge to get punished by someone who professionally punishes people and I do not know if I did something really bad when I was younger and just blocked it all out and feel really guilty or if it is some type of sexual fetish or if I am just going insane, but I have had feelings like that at least since puberty if not before. <br><br>I have not seen the film you mention but I will try to find some information on it. Maybe something like that will shed some light on things.</p>

              <p>maybe its just a sexual fetish, you are the submissive sort that likes to be dominated. or maybe you feel a perverse subconscious urge to feel pain and hurt although it scares you, in which case read the story below. you aren't loosing your mind.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffee;">IN THE consideration of the faculties and impulses- of the prima mobilia of the human soul, the phrenologists have failed to make room for a propensity which, although obviously existing as a radical, primitive, irreducible sentiment, has been equally overlooked by all the moralists who have preceded them. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffee;">Induction, a posteriori, would have brought phrenology to admit, as an innate and primitive principle of human action, a paradoxical something, which we may call perverseness, for want of a more characteristic term. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffee;"> Through its promptings we act for the reason that we should not. In theory, no reason can be more unreasonable, but, in fact, there is none more strong. With certain minds, under certain conditions, it becomes absolutely irresistible.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffee;"> I am not more certain that I breathe, than that the assurance of the wrong or error of any action is often the one unconquerable force which impels us to its prosecution. Nor will this overwhelming tendency to do wrong for the wrong's sake, admit of analysis, or resolution into ulterior elements. It is a radical, a primitive impulse-elementary. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffee;">It will be said, I am aware, that when we persist in acts because we feel we should not persist in them, our conduct is but a modification of that which ordinarily springs from the combativeness of phrenology. But a glance will show the fallacy of this idea. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffee;">The phrenological combativeness has for its essence, the necessity of self-defence. It is our safeguard against injury. Its principle regards our well-being; and thus the desire to be well is excited simultaneously with its development. It follows, that the desire to be well must be excited simultaneously with any principle which shall be merely a modification of combativeness, but in the case of that something which I term perverseness, the desire to be well is not only not aroused, but a strongly antagonistical sentiment exists.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffee;">There lives no man who at some period has not been tormented, for example, by an earnest desire to tantalize a listener by circumlocution. The speaker is aware that he displeases; he has every intention to please, he is usually curt, precise, and clear, the most laconic and luminous language is struggling for utterance upon his tongue, it is only with difficulty that he restrains himself from giving it flow; he dreads and deprecates the anger of him whom he addresses; yet, the thought strikes him, that by certain involutions and parentheses this anger may be engendered. That single thought is enough. The impulse increases to a wish, the wish to a desire, the desire to an uncontrollable longing, and the longing (to the deep regret and mortification of the speaker, and in defiance of all consequences) is indulged.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffee;">We have a task before us which must be speedily performed. We know that it will be ruinous to make delay. The most important crisis of our life calls, trumpet-tongued, for immediate energy and action. We glow, we are consumed with eagerness to commence the work, with the anticipation of whose glorious result our whole souls are on fire. It must, it shall be undertaken to-day, and yet we put it off until to-morrow, and why? There is no answer, except that we feel perverse, using the word with no comprehension of the principle. To-morrow arrives, and with it a more impatient anxiety to do our duty, but with this very increase of anxiety arrives, also, a nameless, a positively fearful, because unfathomable, craving for delay. This craving gathers strength as the moments fly. The last hour for action is at hand. We tremble with the violence of the conflict within us,- of the definite with the indefinite- of the substance with the shadow. But, if the contest have proceeded thus far, it is the shadow which prevails,- we struggle in vain. The clock strikes, and is the knell of our welfare. At the same time, it is the chanticleer- note to the ghost that has so long overawed us. It flies- it disappears- we are free. The old energy returns. We will labor now. Alas, it is too late!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffee;">We stand upon the brink of a precipice. We peer into the abyss- we grow sick and dizzy. Our first impulse is to shrink from the danger. Unaccountably we remain. By slow degrees our sickness and dizziness and horror become merged in a cloud of unnamable feeling. By gradations, still more imperceptible, this cloud assumes shape, as did the vapor from the bottle out of which arose the genius in the Arabian Nights. But out of this our cloud upon the precipice's edge, there grows into palpability, a shape, far more terrible than any genius or any demon of a tale, and yet it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one which chills the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the delight of its horror. It is merely the idea of what would be our sensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a height. And this fall- this rushing annihilation- for the very reason that it involves that one most ghastly and loathsome of all the most ghastly and loathsome images of death and suffering which have ever presented themselves to our imagination- for this very cause do we now the most vividly desire it. And because our reason violently deters us from the brink, therefore do we the most impetuously approach it. There is no passion in nature so demoniacally impatient, as that of him who, shuddering upon the edge of a precipice, thus meditates a Plunge. To indulge, for a moment, in any attempt at thought, is to be inevitably lost; for reflection but urges us to forbear, and therefore it is, I say, that we cannot. If there be no friendly arm to check us, or if we fail in a sudden effort to prostrate ourselves backward from the abyss, we plunge, and are destroyed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; background-color: #ffffee;">Examine these similar actions as we will, we shall find them resulting solely from the spirit of the Perverse. We perpetrate them because we feel that we should not. Beyond or behind this there is no intelligible principle.</span></p>

              <p>I understand your feeling. I wanna get a severe canning too, and I know many people want it. I wanna say please feel easy about such a desire. It's absolutly normal.</p>
              <p>But I have to say that most people cannot resist so much pain. And on the other hand, most people cannot strike someone so hard like the professional punishers. I can cane you if you want, although I'm more like a spankee rather than spanker. I don't think I can beat you as severe as that in the videos, but I believe it's still well beyond what you can tolerate.</p>

              <p>I hear stories of people who got their buttocks whipped with the cane and I hear it makes your entire body shake and you get whipped so hard it makes you cry out and howl like a dog. And then I see pictures like this and think, "Wow, I want to howl like a dog!! - The sensation must be overwelming." But yes, I could take that. I would have no problems taking that whatsoever. Even if it were excruciating. It's not like a woman is going to die from it or something, just because she is a woman.</p>
