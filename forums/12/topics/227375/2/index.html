            <div class='col-md body'>$1800 per month? Ok what. How much u earn and support yr family is depend on the mentality of the couple and yr partner. If she cannot take hardship and want good life. Even you earn $10000 per month also cannot satisfy her.<br><br>If what she wants is a reliable man,a man who really loves her. A man who really gives her yr best. No matter,how much you earn will not be very critical to her... Most critical is you love and care for her! As what some other say,don afford luxuries and yr finacial abilities can handle it.<br><br>I remember a lot of gys saying they wanted to make a mark for themselves before they will marry their gal. Cos they want to give her the best,let them live in bungalow,drive big car so that she will no be under the shade and work so hard. Having a maid to serve her and she having all the necessary money to buy her wanted items. But I ask them if u are so sucessful,will u have the time to acc her? They just answer me back. ' Aiyo! All those thing will compensate her! What's most important is don't let her take hardship...' But is this what really yr future wife want if she can afford everything she want but staying inside a empty big house without u by her side? If she is a materialisti gal,I will say 'Yes' but is she that type? What she really wants?<br><br>Remember to give her what she wants and not what u want to gives her!</div>

But I was also thinking, should a woman with children be loved less? I think no right? She is no matter what still a human with feelings...<br><br>But when I think of the possibilities, the one with her in my life seems more beautiful...<br></div>

Its difficult in financial terms, but I can understand the standing of the woman. Its hard for her too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>go slow... don't be so anxious to dive into a serious relationship yet cos you still have many years ahead of you.<br><br>correct me if i'm wrong, but i've always felt that wooing a girl when she's undergoing what could possibly be the most turbulent times in her life is a rather fatal thing to do. the relationship could then go both ways: ideally, the feelings could be mutual and she has grown to love you. on the other hand, she could have taken it on herself to love you for all the affection and care you have showered on her during these troubled times. The latter scenario does not exhibit true love but rather her vulnerability and susceptibility to what may seem like an offer promising provision for both mother and children...</div>

All those thing will compensate her! What's most important is don't let her take hardship...'

If she is a materialisti gal,I will say 'Yes' but is she that type?

We don't eat out in restaurants but cook our own. But think it's my own ego, I want to give the 2 little angels a good life.
