If you feel that you can be there emotionally for the kids an act as a father figure to them, then that's one problem solved. If the kids acknowledge having you around as a father figure then to me that's a job well done. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>As for the financial aspect... what are you and your girlfriend working as? What I believe is that if you're willing to work hard and put in the effort, then the both of you combined can raise those kids.<br><br>If you want to know, my taxi driver father worked hard to put all his four kids through university. It wasn't easy, for I sure as hell remember the times when I had to go without food just to buy lecture notes. And yet, my father succeeded in doing so. My two elder siblings are working as schoolteachers now, and my younger sis and I are both in uni. I'm sure you can pull it off with her kids, too.<br><br>Bear in mind, though... if you do marry her, this means that you have to put off having a child of your own with her until your finances have become more stable. Unless you're willing to bear the responsibility and burden of raising three kids, I would suggest putting off having a child with her for some time if you do marry.</div>

The 2 kids are very lovely.<br><br>Now my job is not paying well but she is not asking for much. I really don't want to give her up as she is really perfect in my eyes. Never once has she complained of difficult times with me. She is unlike many singapore girls, she never expect me to pay everything for her. We get alone very well and can talk about anything under the sun.<br><br>Why is bringing children up in Singapore so expensive? I wish I have the ability to raise those 2 lovely angels up, but I don't want to destroy their future. I am sure she will have no problems finding a richer man.<br><br>Sad...
