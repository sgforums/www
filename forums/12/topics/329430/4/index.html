              <p>why waste my time with such a girl when there are almost 500,000,000 other girls out there?</p>
              <p>you can choose æ€§æ ¼ but i rather spend time and money with other girls that are actually worth it. not some self proclaimed one</p>

              <p>Heh, give her a break. I don't think she meant to disrepect any guys here.</p>
              <p>Anyway, back to topic...I'm not very good-looking, but had my fair share of the wooing game when I was younger :D Just to share some laughs...</p>
              <p>Had a complete stranger walk up to me from her giggling group of female friends, saying that she'd love me forever. Kinda corny when I think about it lol.</p>
              <p>Also, a girl once dedicated a song w/ a love message to me on valentine's day, while I was iceskating with my friends in Leisure Park. We got together for a while, altho she's pretty, our personalities kinda clashed and we broke up. She contacted me several times and a few years later, she called me to say she was getting married...hmm. That was the last I heard from her.</p>
              <p>Then, there was the awkward moments of girls trying to seduce me in a pub, and even few close female friends hinted me for sex (naked massage etc.) <br>Just recalled an incident when I was studying in the States, a huge sized girl (like twice my size) tried to force herself on me when she was drunk. It was hilarious as my American friends tried to help drag her off me.</p>
              <p>Now that I'm much older, all I've left of these memories are a pile of love letters :)</p>
