Let's refrain from hijacking the thread to make unconstructive comments. This is a friendly place, right?<br><br>I think the friend can talk to his mum to understand why she is opposed towards this relationship. Normally parents are afraid that children will be distracted from their studies, or don't have the maturity to handle a relationship and hence do certain things they may come to regret.<br><br>Friend can then address mum's concerns and show that he is grown up enough to handle it. That is assuming best case scenario la... but depends on the maturity of friend and the temperament of mum la.</div>

Is the girl too ugly for him?<br>And how come it's the guy's side who reject the girl and not the other way around? How did the parents found out about the relationship?<br><br>Anyway, it will also depends alot on the girl if she still wanna have this relationship with the guy. It seems that the girl already don't like your good friend anymore. Cos if she still likes him, she would've suggested an alternative way to stay together. -&gt; Important point, she is ignoring your good friend and that's a clear signal that she wants to end it on her own accord and for her own good.<br><br>As his good friend, you should keep him busy with other activities to help to get him over his grief. Nothing stays forever...people will change. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Only one week and they fall deeply in love? Happy everafter??? Think better remain as friend first. Let the guy mother to know her better then decide what to do in future. I fall in love with a bag bought it back and love it for less than a month. Now is sitting on my table.... So what is love?</div>
