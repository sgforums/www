            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by eilse:</div><div class="quote_body">why all the promise became nothing when he want to leave...<br>why he can hurt me like that,<br>Why it is so easy for him to go without look back....<br>why....</div></blockquote>sorry to hear about what you went through.  the painful bits caused by all the unfulfilled promises, promises of a future and of things to come, things that you looked forward to... apart from other reasons this is one of the reason why it hurts so bad... all the promises.<br><br>How long it takes really depends on how much you have given of yourself and how much you have expected out of the relationship that you had.  The amount of time you guys spent together also have a bearing on how long it takes to heal.<br><br>For serious relationships, it can afew years to completely get over a relationship.  sorry I'm not kidding.  But that does not mean that you actually need so much time to heal... NO!  how fast you heal will depend on what you actually do to help the healing.<br><br>But during this period it DOES NOT mean that you are incapable of forming new relationships.  Its just that until you heal, you will to a greater or lesser extent continue to feel the little tingle of hurt in your heart but it will fade with time.<br><br>Its not really productive to talk about forgetting someone... it more like dont think about someone and when you do, you dont experience that little pain in your heart.  That is real healing.<br><br>So what can you do to help yourself heal in the meantime... giving yourself time and dont rush the "forgeting" part... time will do it for you when you purposely choose not to think about him.  when now and then he pops in, its ok thats normal... just gently push it out.. bit by bit you wil think of that person less.<br><br>Next, talk to someone, ventilate your pain and frustrations and disappointment about the promises and hopes that you had and now dashed... talk these things out... get the emotions out of your heart and head then after that analyse it and learn from your relationship if there is anything to learn about loving and giving and about knowing THE TRUTH about a person PROPERLY.<br><br>Often when we grieve, we dont see the proper and complete picture... we tend to idolise the guy/girl and still cannot see the wrong tht the person did or that we are all ready to forgive etc... you need to vent your emotions first before your head can absorb and after your head has absorbed the truth, bit by bit your emotion will start feeling different.<br><br><strong>it has always been your head that controls your emotions... how you think will dictate how you feel!</strong> <span style="color: red;"><strong>and love is also the same... you think love you feel love!</strong></span><br><br>(That is why when anyone wants to talk sense into a hurting person... first thing to do is not to talk sense but let the person vent all the emotions otherwise he will never see the sense bec the emotion is blocking the mind.)<br><br>So while you are doing the above, in the mean time, go out, circulate, make new friends.  But please dont try and get into a new relationship so soon.  A new relationship cannot help heal the old hurts infact it will make it worse.<br><br>jumping from one relationship to another is very damaging to yourself.  of course it feels good to be wanted but guess what, sooner or later, the old hurts/problems from the last relationship will surface and guess what ... the new relationship will also start (like every relationship) have prolbems and you end up having to deal with 2 sets of problems!! This is why getting into a relationship to try try see if it works is a very expensive way to find out if you guys are compatiable.<br><br>It takes time to clear the baggages from the last relationship anywhere 6months 1 year to 2 or even more years.  But what is most important is that you clear the baggage.<br><br>Let me give you an example that I think will sound really familar to alot of people reading this thread... new guy does something that irritates you, but this is the first time he has done this thing so he doesnt know that it irritates you... but you over react and you feel inside... why is it always like this... or why is he always doing this.. or you simply blow your top more than the situation would normally deserve!  why is that?? Thats bec the irritation left behind by the ex hasnt cleared like a computer cache or buffer.. the irritation has built up so it takes very little to cause you to blow... that is one simple example of not clearing your inside of the last relationshp before going into the next one.<br><br>take care<br></div>

Love yourself first before you can even walk out to look at another great guy coming by..<br><br>Dun be swallowed up by the past bitterness, memories and all the bad things, whatever you can think of.<br><br>Dun listen to sad songs.. listen to those songs that can kinda be uplifting or be stronger for your soul..<br><br>I cannot express myself well.. but I am quite sure you know what I am saying cos I just gotten past a few days back.

So should you!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Be happy, walk away, dun look back. Put down everything as soon as you can. Believe that you are growing up each and everyday and this relationship teaches you so much more than you will beleive for now.<br><br>Believe that you will get a super duper great guy. Maybe not now, maybe not even 1 year later, but he WILL come..<br><br>Be happy and believe you can do it!!<br><br>If you are into religion, go for ur cell grps or temple mediation then.<br>If you like going chiong.. go!! But dun get too drunk wor..<br>If you like to spend time quietly healing yourself, be it. Go library, go shopping, make yourself preety, eat nice food, dun be afraid to make yourself pretty.<br><br>There are 6 billions ppl on earth and 4 millions ppl in Singapore, why you CANNOT get someone suitable for you?<br>Perhaps he wun be better than ur ex in all ways, but surely he will be more suitable for you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>If you are into music like hip hop, R&amp;B, PM me!! keke...<br><br>Okie la.. 1st time I write so long fro someone I dun even knw..
