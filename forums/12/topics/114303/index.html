            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sorry.<br><br>I remember 3-4 years ago i posted a thread on "To nurse a heartbreak."<br>Not sure if its still there, but there were some good pointers.<br><br>Ah! I found it!<br><br>The exact message:<br><br>_____________<br><br>There is no magic "plug and play" formula but there are certainly things that you can do to speed up the healing process. We hope to explore some ways that can help you nurse that heartache.<br><br>The breaking up of a relationship forged over months or years will inevitably cause much pain for both parties when it ends. The activities that you used to do together, the places that you thronged together will rake up the old feelings. Still, what's gone is past and you must let it go and move on with your life.<br><br>Many people feel lost after exiting from a relationship they had for a long period of time. This isn't unusual but these same people must learn to relish the joys of singlehood again!<br><br>You can start by putting away all the things that remind you of your ex-lover. Get hold of a big shoe box or carton and put in all the tokens that he/she has given you previously. Put in those photos that you'd taken together too. Not forgetting those cards as well. When done, seal up the box with masking tape and keep it in a place where you are unlikely to come across it in your daily routine. It could be your attic, your store or even the dark corner in your garage.<br><br>Subsequently, redecorate your room. Start shifting things around and re-arranging the furniture where ever possible. It could mean giving your room a fresh coat of paint to brighten it up or adding a small potted plant by the window. They will all count towards you making a step in starting a new chapter of your life.<br><br>You can also choose to get a new look - a new hairdo or new dress sense. Go for a makeover. Re-style and re-invent yourself. Pamper yourself and pick up new clothes. You can get ideas from your favorite magazine or spend time hitting the shops.<br><br>Then, take this chance to re-discover your friends. When in the relationship, old friendships, undoubtedly, would have been neglected. Take this opportunity to ring up your old chums or mates. Reminiscing those good times over the phone is the first step for you to re-join their circle of singlehood.<br><br>After calling them up and catching up with them, do take the initiative to join them for their nights' out to the pub or coffee joint. This would help you to bond with them faster and also to pass your time faster. Else, you can throw a small party or have a barbeque at your place. At the end of the day, whether it is at your own party or the pub, the key is for you to really enjoy their company and have fun all over again.<br><br>Most will tell you that the key to mending the broken heart is to keep yourself really busy; especially if the first week after the breakup because the wound is still fresh. Here's a list of things that will help keep you busy and that would complement our above suggestions:<br><br><strong>(1) Working overtime</strong><br><br>Load yourself with work but do not overwork. Put extra effort to complete your projects and assignments fast. Let them be of high quality too. The blessing is that your manager may take notice and give you a raise.<br><br><strong>(2) Exercising</strong><br><br>Shed those extra kilos off and get into tip-top shape. Everyone likes to have a nice, well-toned body. It is part of healthy living and well, you could flaunt it at the local gym too.<br><br><strong>(3) Learning something new</strong><br><br>Have you always wanted to pick up German or learn to play golf? Well, this is an ideal opportunity for you to sign up for time-consuming classes. Attending such classes also gives you the chance to meet more people and widen your social circle.<br><br>&lt;- Extract from http://zap.to/lovemoments<br>So that you all will read it, and not just dispose the website as any other =)<br><br>_____________________________________________<br><br>Hope that helps...<br>Pity they took down the website.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh oh, sounds like a case of first love lost!  If that is so....<br><br>The sad truth is that you will never recover, not fully anyways.<br><br>A part of you will always be left with them and them with you. So in that sense you will never be the same, never recover.  Which is not the same as not being whole again.  Love is an addiction, an obsession, we will always find other forms of affection, in this regard you will recover.<br><br>But like the others said, time heals all wounds, or at least we forget about them after a time.  For now, you're screwed! Learn from it, but at the same time, try not to be jaded so that the next time around things will workout better, and trust me, there will be a next time!</div>
