            <div class='col-md body'>my attachment was no better than yours. That was a few years back. i was attached to this particular company which is very near to my house. It takes at most 15 min to this company. But they sent me to their client side, located at Tiong Bahru. As a result, I've to travel for 1 hr to my workplace. To make matter worst, i was the only one sent to this particular client company, working with only a few colleagues, in a bedroom size office. To be exact, i had only 4 colleagues back then. All 4 of them were men. Why not all 4 are women. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Everyday i was like wasting my time there, doing nothing. I was there for 3 months. I can't imagine how i survive there..</div>
