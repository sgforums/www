There isn't any fast method to forget someone you love so much, but you can only let time takes its course....YOu just had to move on  and eventually when you suddenly remember him one day when doing something, you know you had already forget him. Your condition now is that you are now in a small circle and not dare to take a step out of that small circle of your to relised that there is a bigger outside. Try to make more friends and have more choice for yourself and not to confine to one only....<br><br>All the best..<br><br>BrenBren</div>
