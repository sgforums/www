To explain what does the word " love" really means.<br><br>A group of professional people posed this question to<br>a group of 4 to 8<br>year-olds, "What does love mean?"<br><br>The answers they got were broader and deeper than<br>anyone could have<br>imagined. See what you think:<br><br>"When my grandmother got arthritis, she couldn't bend<br>over and paint<br>her<br>toenails anymore.<br><br>So my grandfather does it for her all the time, even<br>when his hands got<br>arthritis too.

Then when you get<br>tired of<br>kissing,<br>you still want to be together and you talk more.<br>My Mommy and Daddy are like that. They look gross when<br>they kiss"<br><br>Emily - age 8<br><br>"Love is what's in the room with you at Christmas if<br>you stop opening<br>presents and listen."<br><br>Bobby - age 7 (Wow!)<br><br>"If you want to learn to love better, you should start<br>with a friend<br>who<br>you hate,"<br><br>Nikka - age 6<br>(we need a few million more Nikka's on this planet)<br><br>"Love is when you tell a guy you like his shirt, then<br>he wears it<br>everyday."<br><br>Noelle - age 7<br><br>"Love is like a little old woman and a little old man<br>who are still<br>friends<br>even after they know each other so well."<br><br>Tommy - age 6<br><br>"During my piano recital, I was on a stage and I was<br>scared.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Tiffanie,<br><br>It isn't necessarily true that a 16 yo doesn't understand love.  Many still don't, even when they're much older.  However, as a 16 yo, your definition of love, &amp; what you want are still in its infantile stage.<br><br>The usual case is for a person to go through a few relationships, so as to understand what they truly want in a relationship, &amp; how both parties can grow together.  This is a difficult process, which involves many heartbreaks, but it'll also shape your view for future relationships.<br><br>You'll be surprised when you look back 10 years later, to see how your needs &amp; wants have changed as you age.  The experience in learning how to handle a relationship that's constantly evolving will come in useful later when you wish to settle down &amp; commit to 1 lucky person.<br><br>Not everybody gets it right, &amp; some still can't get the mix right today.  It's Not necessarily their fault, but perhaps it might boil down to different circumstances...<br><br>In a nutshell, 16 isn't too young to know what true love is, because feelings are most pure when you're young.   But what makes a relationship last isn't just about true feelings most times, it involves much more than that.  Hence, the older you are, the more you'll understand &amp; know how to cope &amp; how to grow together with your partner in terms of what both of you want.<br><br>I hope this helps.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tiffanie:</div><div class="quote_body">Is it true that a 16 year old is definitely not mature enough to understand what exactly is love between a girl and a guy?<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
