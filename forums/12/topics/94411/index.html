Too da nan ren zhu yi liao.. First thing.. You have your own freedom and privacy to do things you like.. there's no reason for you to report to him everything you does.. Yes, he may not like about you joining forums and chat to know ppl.. he shows concern.. and scared that you might be cheated online.. which alot of cases are like tat.. meeting online friends this n that.. but then he jus too over protective and selfish in his doings..<br><br>Secondly, even if he found out that you did have multiple account, he got no rights to go and check your personal stuffs and read your messages... this is too much.. intruding your privacy.. He dun show respect to you.. and wat's more.. he dun trust you at all..<br><br>He can do watever things he like.. and you can? Most couples becos of such reasons.. always end up quarrelling.. He's taking you for granted! Do you have to be so tame and let him do his way.. Come on.. Get up and bring yourself.. change him.. let him understand.. if this is the way he wants to lead his life.. he's not goin anywhere far~ Try to see each other at the same level.. let you do your things.. and let him do his.. there's no need to fear whether one day he/she will leave you.. even if it is.. it will be a good ending.. like tat jealousy and possessiveness can be reduced.. less quarrelling also..<br><br>Always have a talk to each other which ever things that you aren't satisfied.. compromise with each other.. this will make the relaionship.. better.. and still going strong.. harmony!<br><br>He said he's fully devoted..Everyone can say that... but has he proven it? I can't say totally you are not in the wrong.. In the first place you know he dun like about all this.. then you should not use his computer and log into all these accounts or webby you go to.. You jus throwing yourself into the tiger's mouth.. And for him.. he jus being over concern and "kan cheong" over you.. Don't worry.. He have to learn.. have a talk with him.. Try ways (if possible) to change his thinkings.. and understand not only on this matter. but many many consequences..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
