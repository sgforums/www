During this period, sometimes, you would either see two drastic differences: either the begging: I am sorry kind or the 'You asdjfsad!@#%^jd898982e4!!!' kind.<br><br>As long as you are in a relationship, you have the right and ought to something about the holes in your love. Drop the 'aiya-whatever-lar-he-won't-listen-one' - it will do you better in the long run. Keep trying until you see no reasons in the relationship and forces you to leave.

So i did not tell him about it.<br><br>When he's asleep today, i used his pc and log into my multiply account. When he woke up, he used his pc and realised that i had visit multiply site and he asked me if i have an account. And i said yes... he asked for my password because he wants to see my contacts. I have no choice so i gave it to him.<br><br>He read my messages sent and there was this msg i sent to a friend's friend whom i had never met before. Coz he is coming to sg next month and i asked him if i can show him around.<br><br>Because of this msg, my bf flew into a rage. He felt that i'm looking for a chance to have a fling. I have an intention to cheat behind his back.<br><br>When i sent that msg, it was just purely a friendly msg. But he felt that i have tat intention to cheat. He said by initiating to show him around, i'm throwing myself at this guy.<br><br>When i said it was purely a friendly invitation, he said i'm finding an excuse. He asked if the guy looks like moses lim, would i wan to show him around? Yes i admit this guy is pretty good looking.. but i really dun have the intention to do anything with this guy, however he dun believe.<br><br>He says by doing this, how can he trust me? It's the behavior of a s.l.u.t.<br><br>Do you guys really feel that gals who msg u first and wants to show u around is trying to throw herself at u?<br><br>How can i appease his anger? Whatever he wans me to do i already try to accomodate him. He doesn't wants me to go out too much, i did. He doesn't wants me to drink when he's not around i did. I'm a very friendly person before i met him... But because he doesn't like me to be to the wrong crowd... i kept to myself a lot and act dao...<br><br>In the past i did checked his email acc, he sent an email to someone on this adult forum to this gal who's looking for a one time affair for her criteria....<br>In his friendster acc, he msg pretty gals to add them.<br><br>He said he's fully devoted to me now yet i do this kind of things...<br><br>But i really wonder... is it wrong?<br></div></blockquote>tell him he's a jerk(my opinion) and that he'd better know how to treat girls nicely if he wants to hang on to ya any longer. and that double standards will beget a fitting retribution very soon.</div>
