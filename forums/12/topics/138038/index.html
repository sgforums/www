            <div class='col-md body'>I have been in such position before. I am now currently married to my bf of 6 years before we got married 4 years ago.<br><br>When we are about 2 years plus, we do have lots of quarrel and I even mentioned to him about breaking up many times. But in the end, I gave in because I was soft-hearted and of course, there are still love in us.<br><br>My advice is to talk to her again if there are still chance, but one thing to be warn is that, if there are third party involved, then it's unlikely that you will patch back because she may not love you anymore.<br><br>If that's not the case, then have a really good talk with her. <strong>Dun hold on to your pride and let her know how you really feel. Be sincere and truthful as this may be the only chance. </strong>She will get it.<br><br>There's no regret and now I am happily married with a boy of 2 years old. We have been together for 9 years now.</div>

Our love is still there.<br>The main problem is that, our thinking and character have changed over time, we had slight differences. We had disagreements and quarrals pretty often.<br><br>But I believed, since our love is there, we could use this bond to adjust ourselves to fit each other. I mean, we needed time to adjust for the changes.<br>But she had gave up.....mainly because she feels insecure...she have doubts if this relationship would work out at the end of the day.<br><br>It has been 2 weeks after the breakup, she had became part of my life, i tried making myself very busy, but i still can't forget her, i've only kept her in the back of my mind everytime when i focus on something else.<br><br>I wonder if i should really talk to her about this again, asking for another chance to rebuild this broken relationship...</div>

Letting frustrations fester can do a whole lot more irreparable damage to a relationship.<br><br>Do you know the reason why she's feeling insecure with you? This isn't something that can be corrected over a few weeks, especially if she's been directly telling you or hinting at the cause of her insecurity and you've been ignoring or trivialising the matter.<br></div>
