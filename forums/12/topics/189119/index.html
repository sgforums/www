Lost my HPs too many times before too. Never got any single one of them back. Found HPs and returned to the owners too. So what?<br><br>My personal advices for you would be...<br><br>1. If something is really so important to you, perhaps you should think TWICE about just leaving them around UNATTENDED or even be so careless to LOSE IT <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>2. Do BACKUPs for your contact numbers in the HP next time...</div>

With dangling accessories on the HP...?? Very unlikely... And where got people sell HP never check their contact list one...? No backup or deletion..?

I usually would try to return the HP to the owner unless it's really quite impossible... Imagine how many contact numbers and information one could be losing just through a HP alone...? Sell the HP? How much can you earn from it...? On honest fact, I think I would rather be keeping the HP for myself than to sell it 2nd hand... But since I've never had the habit of owning more than 1 HP at a time.. Nor to replace my HP unless it's really not quite workable or really out of model... I simply don't see why the extra HP with me?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>And when I 1st started having HP in the past, I kept losing them.. Then I thought of doing security PIN lock on my HP so that even if people steal it from me or pick it up, they cannot use it... Until I realise that I can simply unlock the PIN but paying the service fee.. No document check or anything required..
