            <div class='col-md body'>She comes from a well to do family, pretty girl, a part time model and a lovely character. While I come from an average family, live in a HDB, average looking, an average person...<br><br>We met few years back in Uni, she was in year 2 while i was in year 1. We are both the same age. Started to know her, talked to her... and we became good frens. Whenever she misses her lecture, I will take notes for her.. Sometimes we met for dinner, went supper, and movies...<br>Soon, I knew I have fallen for her. But, I know she has a bf for almost 10 years since sec school days. I talked to her abt her bf, and she mentioned that her feelings for him after so many years have dried. It is just more of a habit than really love. Anyway, her bf work require him to travel a lot. Sometimes, her bf can be away for like 1-2 years for his work. So most of the time, she is just alone..<br><br>Then i started to buy her flowers for valentine, buy her teddy bear. She also buy me presents sometimes...And, i started to msg calling her "dear dear". She also replied me... she also in her sms started to call me "dear, sweetie etc"<br><br>One day, over the phone, i confessed my feelings for her. I asked her if she knows my feelings for her. She said obviously yes lah, by the things that i am doing to her.. she said she knew. And, i asked her if i stand any chance? She said she dunno, but she said she haven settle her things with her bf also..<br>She said she is confused..<br><br>Soon, she graduated and started to work. She became busy with her work and we slowly met lesser and tok lesser on the phone also..<br>But, my feelings for her, is still there...<br>Again, i met her for supper. And she sent me back.. In her car, before i left. I told her again. My feelings for her is still there.. Do i stand any chance?<br>She said she dun think so.. she is too busy to think about relationship..<br>That was like 1 year ago...<br><br>Now, I still love her... We still tok, we still go out sometimes..<br>My feelings for her still there..<br>Should I ask her again? i really dunno...<br><br>Thanks for reading my story.. can give any good advice?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) If she really loves you then why is she still having a bf for 10 years?<br><br>2) how many years do u know her? All this years u know her and she never accepted you at all rite?<br><br>3) She cares about her job more than you, can't u see?<br><br>4) So what if you ask her again and again? you and I know the answer liao. Does it change anything?<br><br>5) She had a 10 year bf and she still call you "dear, sweetie" wow cool. If she can do that to you why not to other guys out there?<br><br>My advice<br><br>Stop torturing over a girl who treats you only as a friend. Even if she say yes can you afford her lifestyle? Are you sure she will not call other guys "dear, sweetie" behind your back? If she can do it to a 10 bf, what makes you think you are so special? If seriously wish to waste your life on this girl then go ahead no one can stop u.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok goaler since you want to hear advice on not to give up I will give it to you.<br><br>Goaler she will dump her bf of 10 years to be with you. U r so much better than the bf of hers and you believe that she should have dump him years ago.  She will come flying to your eyes the next minute she looks at you and she will dump all her work just to spent time with you. You will give her the tender loving care that no one will ever give her. She will never look at another guy other then you for you are the only man in her life. She will move from her private house into your HDB room to hugz you every nite.<br><br>Is this what you are hoping to hear?<br><br>If yes then keep dreaming on.</div>
