We still tok, we still go out sometimes..<br>My feelings for her still there..<br>Should I ask her again? i really dunno...<br><br>Thanks for reading my story.. can give any good advice?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div></blockquote>Just have some questions to ask, is she still attached? I kind of assumed that she wasn't anymore.<br><br>I guess she really is busy with work, give her some time to at least balance her life first. 1yr may not have been enough time after studying for so many years.<br><br>What matters really is that your feelings are true and sincere. I would encourage you to give her a chance and continue to give yourself a chance. I don't mean to ask her again now, but continue to be around her and be part of her life. At least she won't forget you, and you'll still be close to her and you can be there for her when she needs you.<br><br>Don't take too long though, lest she really gets stuck with the idea that you're a close friend and nothing else. Nothing wrong with being a friend though, how many people can say they're still friends with people they used to like, and close friends at that. But would you be willing to accept if for the rest of your life you two are friends and not something else.<br><br>If you tell her, you risk losing a friend you've had all these years. I'm quite sure she'll be sad too to lose you as a friend.<br><br>Ultimately it comes down to what you know about her, what you anticipate her move to be and what you want for her and for yourself. Whatever the decision is, I hope it's in the best interests of everyone involved.</div>
