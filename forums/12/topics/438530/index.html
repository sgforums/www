              <p>orh i see, typical fb and affection love at first sight. stalking him 2.5 years online do you know himmthat well? in person. sometimes even those can create a good impression of themselves online or even off in reality can be the opposite. there are many good guys out there. don;t regret later and waste time reading what people post online and think that its true. really online at foriums soime can post and write beri good, in real life i meet with them so so lah. so its better to just stay in love with him online and get a rea l love offline.</p>

              <p>sometimes when u wana "aim high", u got to look at yourself first. u seem to have very high standards because u claim that u had never found anyone who is worth it. u seem to have no experience with approaching people or isit that u have nobody approached u before?? if the latter is inclusive then i guess u better dont try lah.</p>
              <p>if he is as good as u have said, then he will have a girl by him already. if not, then probably 2 reasons; either he got heavenly high standards for a girl, or he is gay like me =)</p>

              <p>orh i see, typical fb and affection love at first sight. stalking him 2.5 years online do you know himmthat well? in person. sometimes even those can create a good impression of themselves online or even off in reality can be the opposite. there are many good guys out there. don;t regret later and waste time reading what people post online and think that its true. really online at foriums soime can post and write beri good, in real life i meet with them so so lah. so its better to just stay in love with him online and get a rea l love offline.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but like 2l over likes at ffb i think my photo shoot will be the fastest way for the two of u to meet <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
