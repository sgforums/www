              <p>You guys surely crack me up, especially angel and gorgor! haha.....and i would like to believe he is not gay! </p>
              <p>And Gerberad, you got it quite right there. I wonder if my expectation are unrealistic sometimes. I am in my late 20's, been through a string of relationship. Never quite find someone who I feel is worth it. I ask myself if I should compromise on my expectation and live with it or should I live by this rule, Never settle for anything less and the best will happen. After all, life's too short to go for 2nd best right? </p>
              <p>Since young, I am a go-getter. I go for what I want or at least i tried. But when it comes to relationship, I am always a really "see how it goes" person. I never initiate. I worry about what men feel if I initiate. You know he is 36 this year, what would he think if I initiate? I mean, in general how would men think if a woman initiate, would they kinda think this woman has no principle and get turn off? </p>
              <p>Omg, it's driving me nuts, to initiate or not to initiate? </p>

              <p>Since young, I am a go-getter. I go for what I want or at least i tried. But when it comes to relationship, I am always a really "see how it goes" person. I never initiate. I worry about what men feel if I initiate. You know he is 36 this year, what would he think if I initiate? I mean, in general how would men think if a woman initiate, would they kinda think this woman has no principle and get turn off? </p>

              <p>ha...seriously i am not thinking materialistic cos I am good on my own. What I admire is his charitable character and good remarks from so many of his peers. How did he find such positive energy and passion in life especially in this judgmental world. I am truly amazed how he keep his level head in so many things and how he manage to get people of young and old to adore him alike. I want to learn from him, I want to know how to view this world through his eyes. That's all I want to know.......</p>

              <p><br>1st and foremost hahahhaha, i dont get women coming after me for certain motives, ever in my life. :)  but i do get Hellos from my girlfriends.. anyway u get what i mean lah.</p>
              <p>i wont get turn off if i am him. since he is an extrovert and cheerful man, i think he will welcome friends greetings. yes, he may get it many times, but he will most probably think u are trying to be friendly with him. if u want him to know that u like him, just tell him directly.</p>
              <p>do u know there is something called Bisexual too?? some people are bi and those people are harder for u to see through them. Having ex-gfs or peer comments doesnt mean he doesnt have special feelings for same gender. if he is a famous person as u said, maybe he would conceal his gayness from his friends/group. u must understand that there is people who are homophobes. i mean c'mon, u dont see most famous ppl telling the general public he is gay. even the local drag artiste kumar had to conceal till recently...</p>
              <p>i have friends who live with parents but are closetted homos.</p>
              <p>Nothing is for sure guaranteed until u know him personally. if u are go-getter, then go get it. u are not that young either...</p>
