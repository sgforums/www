              Ts,
              Why is there a need to initiate? Most probably it is cos of the fear as to whether it may work out or not? I surmise the fear is not of love in intself hurting oneself but the fear of losing onself in it or not being able to find oneself in another or even that of fear of the loss of self! Of course, the motive (if there is any) cancels out love but reinforces needs/expectations. Only in being self-honest may one see thru one's own folly and inadequacy!
              
              Ego and love can never co-exist. One cannot do away with the former - but the least one can do is having a POROUS ego. 
              
              If one adopts the stance of waiting for the other or some conditions to be fulfilled - one is not not living but waiting to live or preparing to live!

              The highest form of prejudice is to ignore what one knows not nor cares to know about - that seems to be your predicament.
              
              By labelling others, you are not judging them (in this instance my postings) but rather  what you are all about. In other words, you define yourself.

              <p>Exactly Fugazzi, I know what you mean by waiting for some condition to be fulfilled. Becos  most of the time, it never will. I mean if it would happen, it will already have happened. That is why I am thinking of taking a first step. It doesn't have to man taking first step all the time i guess in this era of our time. I think it is better to choose than to be chosen by others and leave us with limited choices which are usually not what we want or the best. </p>
              <p>But having said that, it is my lack of courage that stop me from doing certain things especially in relationship.  haha....guess it can't be love as you said. But just admiration at this point.  </p>

              When one is too full of the self - one is already disconnected/alienated from oneself. How to relate to another. At its best it is going to be superficial n contrived and at its worst exploitation of another to fulfil onself. 
              
              Imagine two people coming together and behind the word love, the above ''phenomena'' were to transpire. 
              
              When one ceases to cherish opinions of .... - living is easy. Mine, not excluded!
              
              
              Ps - Courage cannot be cultivated, learned or ... cos behind it is the fear that is the barrier.

              <p>Love is a strange thing and in cases like this, I always encourage. I believe to try is 50% but never is 0.</p>
              <p>From the way you describe him, he seems to be quite a good natured person with patience too and probably too good to be true but you certainly need to know him in real and not in FB.</p>
              <p>Asking him out seems too abrupt and it's not really a good thing because he is a busy man plus the fact, who would go for a date with someone they don't even know. (I won't for sure) </p>
              <p>Get close by choosing wisely, following his agenda. I think leaving a deep impression is important and of course, opportunity must allow a good impression and not just any. </p>

              <p>Try to do something / some activity together.....</p>
              <p>At first I dont recommend asking for "coffee" or something like that immediately....because sometimes it can be awkward.......and maybe too forward, which make the guy may reject and decline it.....Initially you must try to do some neutral activity together that you can pass off as something innocent, something low key and low pressure.</p>
              <p>Keep doing it a few times without him thinking he is on a "date"....</p>
              <p>Then afterwards you can slowly "upgrade" your approach.....</p>
