(ta cao jing she)<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Trashing when you have little information about who and what's going on is at your disadvantage. Appear as if nothing happens, first. If you boyfriend/husband knows that you receive the message, generally, I can bet you, he will do one of these few things:<br><br>I) Explain to you before you even ask him. Under MTG, this is called First Strike. Listen to his story and check out his body language. Few experts who lie, are good at concealing body language and knowing how to spin a good tale at the same time.<br><br>II) Plan his words already, but choses not to initiate the explaination. If you were to question about it, then he will speak. Therefore the plan is act normal. If he falls under this category, you will feel that he may treat you a little nicer than usual. Under Theory of Y&amp;Y, whats negative are balanced by positive. If he is gulity, he will replace the gulit by treating you better to minimize this gulity to a significant balance. Unless your relationship is already rocky beyond hope of redemption, then usually, he wouldn't go such measures to conceal things - he just wants to go. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>III) He wouldn't initiate his explaination like above, but when you question him about it. He will blast and throw temper OR he will simply admit certain things. Usually, under this category, he wouldn't even bother to treat you better because he already wants to leave the relationship (like explained above)<br><br>P.S: Think smart, act blur.<br><br>Cheers</div>
