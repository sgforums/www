              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">This is going to be a long story….. I need advice….</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">I am married for 8years with no kids.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">All these 8 years, I carry the status of ‘married’ in paper. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">This doesn’t mean my hubby doesn’t love me, its just that we did not consummate our marriage – no sex at all. No he is not a gay!!!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">We are like any dating couple – holding hands, sometimes watching movie together.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">Things start to change for the past two to three years. He has been playing online games and spending more his time computer than going out with me. Other than normal meals and buying necessities, the rest of the time, he is hook on the computer.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">Some of you may say that its ok since he is not going out to gamble or fool around. And he gives you freedom to do whatever thing you like, not many married women get this freedom. Yes I admit this freedom given but I believe in communication and spending a little more time together.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">I told him before but he will just say that I am not going out to gamble, drink or fooling around, I am playing computer games. What is wrong with this ? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">He still cannot see what is the problem.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">5 months ago, our flats were sold – the agreement of selling the flats was decided by him. The reason is that property market was good and we can make big profit ( which we did).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">There were no ‘but’ on this transaction and I have to sign on the dotted line.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">I was too (emotionally and physically) tired to argue with him (the whole transaction took place when I was on business trip)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">We moved to stay with my parents after the flat was sold.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">Every night, he will just play his online game while I do my own things.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">Up and until now the flat was sold, I have lost interest in this marriage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">I am beginning to feel like doing things alone and staying with friends are more happy than to be with my hubby.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">Recently I met a guy, someone which I wanted to know him more. And if there is a chance I will like to develop a relationship with him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">Whenever I am with this guy, I feel guilty….guilty not towards my hubby but to this new guy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">This guy doesn’t know the above situation and I really wanted to tell him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">I wanted to tell this guy about the above situation and prepare for a divorce (which I have been thinking since the time I sold my flat, so whether this guy appear or not, it doesn’t matter)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">Do you think after telling the whole situation above, I will still be able to be with the (new) guy ?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Arial Narrow;">If you are in the shoe of this (new) guy, what will you think ?</span></p>

              <p>i feel that u shld give ur hubby another opportunity...the last one in fact.</p>
              <p>talk to him seriously abt ur problems and how u feel towards this marriage, how it is not working out etc.</p>
              <p>if he remains adamant in his ways and habits, its perhaps time for u to move on. no point wasting ur youth on this hubby if he lacks in communication with you.</p>
              <p>marriage is not a method of keeping a partner to oneself. the love and communication between the two should continue and remain strong after marriage.</p>
              <p>ask urself if u really want to spend ur life with a guy like this for ur years to come before making any final decisions.</p>
              <p>dun regret..when its time to move, u go on.</p>

              <p>Sure. I believe one is never too old to restart anything in life again. You
              should be in ur
              mid 30s. 34yrs soon, if i am not wrong.</p>
              <p>The only thing that i found weird is why din u couple ever consummate ur marriage? What is the
              point of having the paper marriage when u are doing nothing that a married
              couple should do?</p>
              <p>I sense that there is something u are not telling us. Is this an arrange
              marriage? Are both of u local? If u are in ur mid 30s, can i also assume that your
              husband is in nearing his late 30s? And he still behaves like a teen
              addicted to games?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It isn’t wrong to love someone else regardless of the age. But
              it is only responsible to do it when u is single and not while u is still
              married. For all party involved.</p>

              <p>if u want to be fair to ur husband, perhaps going for family counselling would be good.. if really no hope, then.. like wat bear said, u can actually apply for annulment of marriage bcos of non-consummation. </p>

              <p>Whether the new guy will still be able to accept you will depend entirely on how much he loves you - it will be the ultimate test. If he loves you, I don't think your untold story will/should  bother him one bit. On the other hand, if he doesn't love you enough, he might get shaken.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In any case, between you and your hubby, you don't hafta get a divorce. You can go for an annulment on the ground of non-consumation though it's difficult to substantiate this claim. Who's gonna believe that there's no sexual relation between a couple living together for so long a time?</p>

              <p><span>All these 8 years, I carry the status of

              <p><span>We are like any dating couple – holding hands,

              necessities, the rest of the time, he is hook on the

              <p><span>Some of you may say that its ok since he is not

              Yes I admit this freedom given but I believe in communication and
              spending a little more time together.</span></p>
              <p><span>I told him before but he will just say that I am

              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>5 months ago, our flats were sold – the agreement
              of selling the flats was decided by him. The reason is that
              property market was good and we can make big profit ( which we
              did).</span></p>
              <p><span>There were no ‘but’ on this transaction and I

              <p><span>I was too (emotionally and physically) tired to
              argue with him (the whole transaction took place when I was on
              business trip)</span></p>
              <p><span>We moved to stay with my parents after the flat
              was sold.</span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>Every night, he will just play his online game
              while I do my own things.</span></p>
              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>Up and until now the flat was sold, I have lost
              interest in this marriage.</span></p>
              <p><span>I am beginning to feel like doing things alone
              and staying with friends are more happy than to be with my

              <p><span> </span></p>
              <p><span>Recently I met a guy, someone which I wanted to

              <p>i think that dun do anything behind ur husband or be unfaithful to him first. i feel that communication is very important in any kind of relationship particularly ur marriage in this case. i mean does 8 years of marriage really counts for nothing at all?</p>
              <p>try talking to him. no dun try, have a serious talk with him on how you feel. make him see the problem the seriousness of it all. i mean try to save the marriage first. i personally do not think that divorce will resolve anything at all, it's just a way of running away though. If you never solves the root of the problem, it will come back to haunt you. think about it urself.</p>

              <p>I seriously dont think a normal and loving (you mentioned he loves you right?) husband will do such a thing. There might be more then meets the eye.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are so many possibilities so the only way to find out is to ask him. Get him out to a park or whatever and communicate your fears to him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My guess is there he is hiding something from you, could be he has became impotent? could be that he has lost his job? I don't know. Its up to you, as a wife, to find out. Care for him instead of jumping into conclusion. Show him you care and as humans, we'll reciprocate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My suggestion to you is that knowing someone in a world of billions of people arent easy. Treasure what you have instead of thinking of escaping.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hopew everything turns out good for you. Give your hubby and yourself another chance. Give it a timespan, maybe 1 month? In this month, cook for him, sit by his side when he is playing his game and chat with him, give him a massage... things that show you care and then see what happens.</p>

              <p>Actually Im unfit to post this msg,</p>
              <p>but I do have something to say,</p>
              <p>Ur relationship with ur husband went wronge a few years back,</p>
              <p>now you now longer feel anything for him,</p>
              <p>I believe no matter what he do, you wont go back to him anymore.</p>
              <p>cause the feelings dies off.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It seem really sad to let go, but what done has been done,</p>
              <p>what has happen have happen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You live only once,</p>
              <p>not many people were given a 2nd chance to start afresh. </p>
              <p>No matter what decision you make, its either you will suffer or he will suffer. I believe one day he will regret but its too late for him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do what you feel its best for you.</p>
              <p>What ever decision you made, be happy with it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck and all the best for you.</p>
