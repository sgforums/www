Perhaps even you have noticed so... Still, you won't wanna give up so easily...? This is LOVE (or whatever other factors that may be causing you to believe that this is LOVE...)....<br><br>Whatever role she've contributed for who you are today... Going into a BGR just because of these and such is NOT a MUST... (not to mention that it might not even be practical at all...?) To you, you might be a SINCERE guy who LOVES her... Now even IF you are, there's no GUARANTEE that there other MANY guys out there going after her ain't genuine and sincere...? In her eyes perhaps you're just like one of those guys... But of course I won't know for sure because I'm NOT her.... Think about the CHANCES here... I'm not just trying to be negative here, but have some sense into yourself before ya get too carried away....?<br><br>But THEN OF COURSE, there CAN be a CHANCE that she might CHOOSE you....? Personally, I don't know you too well you know...? Perhaps you've got that 'X-factor' which I've not learnt of... OR MAYBE your HANDSOME look might attract her...? (Ya did mentioned that now didn't you...?) Yes yes.... It's really SO HARD to tell now isn't it....<br><br>Now, these are the final few pieces I've kept for you.... For now... If you've GOT it, you've got it... And she might just ACCEPT you IF you APPEAL to her... If she's those type into YOUR CHARACTER, ONLY TIME can tell you the answer....<br><br>You ain't gonna get much of an advice here ya know...? Personally we don't even know her... Different girls go for different things... All we can do here is a GUESSING game...? Is that what you wanna play with us...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>TELL ME, what is it that you REALLY LIKE about her...?

You mentioned that you've got this cochlear implant in you.. I don't know if she would mind this, but this is gonna either be a MINUS or NO SCORE for you... Either way you've got little advantage... But of course this issue might not be so important in her eyes...<br><br>2. DIFFERENT Lifestyle. TRUE. Opposite DOES attract at times. But usually not when you're TOTALLY OPPOSITE. And you and her merely know which other, I wonder what kinda 'attraction' are you talking about here...?<br><br>3. ADMIT it, she've got tonnes of guys going after her. From hunks to don't know what qualities... SURE you can be ONE of them.... There's no saying that you won't stand a chance. But you'll have to admit that this can be rather disadvantageous to you... Another thing and no offence? Judging from the way you've replied, you're just taking a chance and see how things go? By this very fact alone I can assure you that the probability is NOT on your side... Besides, you did mentioned that she's a nice girl with good qualities combined? You don't even know what you want... PERSONALLY, I'll ADVISE you not to waste her &amp; your own time....

Do you know HOW MANY 'merely decent looking gentlemen' out there...? BESIDES... What ya see is JUST the SURFACE... Never judge a book by its cover...
