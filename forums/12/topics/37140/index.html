If you haven't, you should have more confidence instead of being sure that you will be rejected whenever you try to make friends with a girl. Girls are not as superficial as you think. You said yourself that you are a "friendly harmless normal human being." Which normal human being has never been rejected before? You KNOW you are friendly, at least <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Give yourself more confidence! Don't let those hurting remarks or rejections get you down. The people who once rejected you are only a very small minute population of the world.<br><br>Ah. Opposites do attract, you know.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Like how the North and South poles of magnets do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Not all couples who are made up of similar individuals get along well... because life may be dull.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Hints that she might not mind your presence hmm.. When you speak to her, do you get the feeling that she is trying to keep the conversation short and also trying to avoid speaking to you? Do you say 'hi' to her whenever you see her, only to see her trying to look away? [Actually I'm not really good at this... But the above two, keeping the conversation short and trying to not look at the guy are things I do when I try to avoid them... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ]<br><br>Erm. NATURAL for a girl to force a smile if she doesn't like you? I don't think that's necessary. Some girls don't even bother to smile at the guy. They simply look away as if that guy was transparent.

You were only rejected ONCE. A bad start to a journey doesn't mean the rest of your journey will be a bumpy rollercoaster ride.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> A brand new day starts off dark and gloomy too, but the sun rises and ta-da! you have a beautiful, warm and sunny day!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>It's not strange for you to go out with one of the belles of the school. After all, as I said, it's not like mushrooms grow on your head. You can hear mah, so I'd say you're perfectly normal. I've got a girl in my school who's hearing impaired too. She wears those hearing aids that are obvious and somemore she ties her hair into a ponytail so everyone can see her ears. But she's darn popular in her school. It's not how you look like that determines your ren2 yuan2 but it's the kind of person that you are.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>it's nice to know her smile's genuine. Perhaps to find conversation with her... you could ask her what she normally does as leisure or something.. then who knows, you might find something in common and there you are, a topic for conversation! That might not be the best way but actually I'm like you, I have trouble finding topics for conversation with people I just got to know.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> erm, what boomeranging the questions back and forth.. I don't quite understand. -scratches head-<br><br>I'm not sure, but maybe you shouldn't rush. Let nature take its course...

I'd love to type more but the pesty brother at home wants the computer for a while.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>meanwhile... don't worry too much.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey ntu slacker, frankly this battle of urs is going to be tough. First of all, you have a hearing disability. Not that i have anything against that, but pple may find it harder and weirder to come into contact with you. I think the best you can be with her is good Friends. Not that i am trying to discourage you from trying harder, you should in fact! But i advise you to be pragmatic in affairs of the heart. I suppose you now are in that state of 'high' feeling where your emotions are running high, but you gotta use your logical thinking to think the matter through.<br><br>First: If your hearing disability is ok other than the fact that you are wearing a hearing aid, then all should be fine for appearance once. But pple with hearing disabilities even when they have ear devices to assist them in hearing tend to have speech problem. So do you talk smoothly? She might actually find this cute in fact!<br><br>2nd: you said she is real popular with the hunks. So you gotta ask yourself, what is it that you have or is interesting which makes you stand out from the hunks grp? We are all humans and prefer at first sight to go for good-looking pple. If u dun have the looks, do u have the money, power, influence which is an equal babe magnet? Dun get me wrong here, i am not saying that you can substitute money for love. But history has shown that the ugly but rich/influencial/powerful men get the best babes usually cause in the end u need money to eat, not love! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Well, maybe you might be juz so lucky that she has an unknown attraction for you, the so called 'unexplained attraction' which is almost a fantasy thingy with the chance of that happening 1% in relationships. Remember, u need that X-factor which makes u attractive to her. Be it looks/popularity/money/power/influence. But pple our age usually dun have the last 3 so u gotta work on the first 2.<br><br>3rd:   I would strongly advise you to approach her as a fren first. Dun be too overbearing and wanting to attack her juz to have her as your gf. Go for the slow back-door approach as a fren, and basically be there for her. Give her good vibes, be different from the rest of the hunks who try to impress her with their good looks, body. U impress her with your in-depth conversation u can have with her. So that even if u can't have her as a gf, u can have her as a buddy. And its good to know more girls, cause they alwaz come in packages( u can get to know their frens!). I also advise u not to do the 'confess-my-feelings' method which would result in terrible aftermath if she is immature in handling such matters( where most girls your age still are). In short, approach her as a fren and keep things there! If she likes u and wants more, she will drop hints, girls of our age and culture drop hints mostly, they mostly dun make the first move to confess. When u are sure about the hints she is dropping which would be damn obvious, u can then try to take the friendship to a higher level.<br>When she sees that you value her as a fren and not be a superficial hunk who only sees what is on the surface, she may feel differently for u. And u nvr know, things could happen... but juz dun harp on it. Continue living ur life and at the same time, try to build up a solid friendship with her. See how things goes and tell us all of the outcome!<br><br>Rgds</div>

If I were to tell them that disability doesn't really matter when it comes to making friends, I think at least more than 75% would still remain the same.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Ok, back to your present situations. This girl, who is popular with guys and is very socially active - seriously speaking, in my view - it would be rather difficult for her to take the time and effort in going to know someone, unless she is really interested in that guy. It has nothing to do with your disability - even if a normal guy comes along, he will face the same problem. Her time is fully allocated and since she is so socially active, I doubt it does matter to her whether she has one less suitor, one less guy, etc.<br><br>The wonder of love can make 2 different personality come together and work - HOWEVER (I stress on the this word), this is only applicable only if *she* wanted it to. If not, everything will fail.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>By the way, when you say hi to someone - it is natural that she would smile, nod or at least to reply you verbally or non-verbally. It has nothing to do with liking you, etc. You thoughts and feeling tells you that she doesn't think highly of you because she doesn't know you - even still, do not place your hope too high due to the reasons I have mention above.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>To a girl of that standard - she would only be willing to know you as a person, unless you attract her interest. If not, its difficult.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi yun!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>yes i agree disabled people usually are socially withdrawn because they have weak social circles. actually i am not in the 75% of the group. i am quite popular among my friends and have no problems getting various friends for company despite them having to repeat what they said sumtimes in conversations. the only downside i never have the confidence to approach the girls i liked. only now, i had the confidence to walk up to her and introduce myself.<br><br>the confidence has to be built over sometime. physically disabled people usually feel that they lack influence and popularity. it is because they feel that being disabled lowers their abilties. actually not so. i mean true friendship comes from the heart, not from the ears, the eyes and so on. for example helping friends require one to be humble and helpful but it doesn't require the eyes, the ears or whatsoever. but i can never be myself and act wierdly when i am with the girls i like. usually these girls are extremely cute or extremely pretty. yes i am talking about exteemes here but perhaps my standard is low?<br><br>actually, that girl, though being extremely pretty, she seems to keep to a specific clique of friends. yes i have been observing her rather clandestinely. she's a nice girl. well popular with guys? not so when outside her own clique... but i wouldn't be suprised if she's attached. well as for me i am happy that we were friends after erm i irritated the hell out of her unknowingly. but i think i do not wish to elaborate on that. i have already apologised to her yet she doesn't seem to be petty at all.<br><br>"The wonder of love can make 2 different personality come together and work - HOWEVER (I stress on the this word), this is only applicable only if *she* wanted it to. If not, everything will fail."<br>totally agree... but i do not wish to be marginalised merely because i have a hearing problem. fair enough, about other aspects involving a clashing of personality and so on gives truth to the statement. some people who are disabled may take offense at what i am going to say later but i can tell you that its the truth.<br><br>some disabled people they just beaer with their disability and go on with life. they do not make the effort to improve on other aspects which may overshadow their disabilty. for example, popularity? intelligence? wealth? influence?<br><br>in my case, i had to work much more than a normal person. i needed to do academically well throughout childhood to leave my so-called special school to go to a mainstream school admist insults, doubts and malicious people. even when i made it.. it still wasn't over  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  but the issue here is that its quite unfair to say "hey this guy is hearing impaired..." etc etc and all those preconceived notions that we are inferior. no we are not actually! do you note that disabled people are steadily climbing into the higher echelons of society. is it so wrong that we want a partner to love? i mean i would consider myself on the same overall footing as her "suitors" in the uni except when intense hunkiness or yan-daoness comes into the picture or she has the typical singaporean biased view of disabled people.<br><br>she always smiles. she's beautiful when she does that. that's one of the things why i am so hopelessly infatuated with her. agree its courtesy unless that person totally despises or hates your guts. she doesn't think highly of me yet... my friends comment that i was too humble in her presence. i have this tendency to playdown my strengths whenever i am in the company of pretty girls. it kind of makes them think twice about getting to know me better when she finds that i am a nobody. how to overcome this without appearing to be pretentious and proud?<br><br>attracting her interest? i am thinking of many topics to talk to her about.<br><br>but is being quite wealthy helps? showering her with treats and gifts may play down my disability but i never had done it in my life and i feel its a very cheap thing to do. but i feel so erm <span style="font-style: italic;">desperate</span> to have a girlfriend.<br><br>dont get me wrong. she's not for male ego... i am tired of being lonely and carrying my feelings around without anyone to share them. of course i have friends but no matter how close i am with them, we only talk about current affairs, gossip, politics and work.<br><br>and u said it was difficult to make her fall in love with me given my attributes. you havent seen her yet.<br>"Its not Mission Difficult. Its Mission Impossible"<br>-Anthony Hopkins in M:i-2<br><br>anyway thanks again for ur comments  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>and i hope i am speaking up for the hearing impaiured community in general. do consider their other worthy attributes as we are human as well.[/i]</div>

If not, everything will fail."<br>totally agree... but i do not wish to be marginalised merely because i have a hearing problem. fair enough, about other aspects involving a clashing of personality and so on gives truth to the statement. some people who are disabled may take offense at what i am going to say later but i can tell you that its the truth.<br><br>some disabled people they just beaer with their disability and go on with life. they do not make the effort to improve on other aspects which may overshadow their disabilty. for example, popularity? intelligence? wealth? influence?<br><br>in my case, i had to work much more than a normal person. i needed to do academically well throughout childhood to leave my so-called special school to go to a mainstream school admist insults, doubts and malicious people. even when i made it.. it still wasn't over  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  but the issue here is that its quite unfair to say "hey this guy is hearing impaired..." etc etc and all those preconceived notions that we are inferior. no we are not actually! do you note that disabled people are steadily climbing into the higher echelons of society. is it so wrong that we want a partner to love? i mean i would consider myself on the same overall footing as her "suitors" in the uni except when intense hunkiness or yan-daoness comes into the picture or she has the typical singaporean biased view of disabled people.<br><br>she always smiles. she's beautiful when she does that. that's one of the things why i am so hopelessly infatuated with her. agree its courtesy unless that person totally despises or hates your guts. she doesn't think highly of me yet... my friends comment that i was too humble in her presence. i have this tendency to playdown my strengths whenever i am in the company of pretty girls. it kind of makes them think twice about getting to know me better when she finds that i am a nobody. how to overcome this without appearing to be pretentious and proud?<br><br>attracting her interest? i am thinking of many topics to talk to her about.<br><br>but is being quite wealthy helps? showering her with treats and gifts may play down my disability but i never had done it in my life and i feel its a very cheap thing to do. but i feel so erm <span style="font-style: italic;">desperate</span> to have a girlfriend.<br><br>dont get me wrong. she's not for male ego... i am tired of being lonely and carrying my feelings around without anyone to share them. of course i have friends but no matter how close i am with them, we only talk about current affairs, gossip, politics and work.<br><br>and u said it was difficult to make her fall in love with me given my attributes. you havent seen her yet.<br>"Its not Mission Difficult. Its Mission Impossible"<br>-Anthony Hopkins in M:i-2<br><br>anyway thanks again for ur comments  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>and i hope i am speaking up for the hearing impaiured community in general. do consider their other worthy attributes as we are human as well.[/i]</div></blockquote>I am not saying you are at an disadvantage; it is mostly the way how self esteem is shift around. Most of the time, when something turns out to be sh|t, Imparied people would think it is because of their disability that indirectly causes it - which is a major blow to self esteem and render them inferior. As long as one could cope with this self esteem problem by constantly encouraging yourself - you are no way lower than any average humans. Keep it up, I like the way you state - have to work more than average human, etc. Its good for you psychologically. Trust me, even if there is no sparks now - I am sure there would be one in the future (other ladies) if you persist in this positive thinking.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>How to make her think twice about you? Well, every people has they own special methods in doing that. Some people are more effective than others - but you must remember: Not every charm one exude will affect that lady. Some woman are immune to that kind of charm some guys tried to exude.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>One thing is you realise when you communicate with her, is mostly work or superficial topics. And yes, you are right - topic must change to something less serious. Add a hint of humor in the conversation makes the talk much more enjoyable. And remember *do not* appear to be so desperate to speak with her. its a real *turn off*, act and appear as in she is just like another girl, instead of a your goddess. If you put her the same level as any other ordinary girl - your nervousness will cease gradually and you wouldn't stammer, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The *<strong>LAST</strong>* way of method you would attempt is to play wealthy. Let me tell you, from my experience, this will never work. Unless you are looking for a cheap fling and the lady you are targeting isn't passing score on its character. Find someone who is *appreciative* of you and NOT what you have for her. Come on - if you doesn't even interest her in terms of chemistry, etc - *NO MATTER* (Let me stress again... NO MATTER) What you buy for her - Handphone, Play Station, Diamonds, etc - she still won't move a single bit.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>WHY?<br><br>Such material content doesn't even spark love message across - instead it signal - 'Hey, this is what I could give you when you are with me.' Trust me, most woman may just accept, a word of thanks, and nothing else. A waste of money, time, effort and a deep destruction of impression (A sucker, thats what the layman calls it). Never resort to wealth.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
