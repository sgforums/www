            <div class='col-md body'>Time really flies...... I will be ORDing next Tuesday and will be looking for a job and I will find a job that are relevant to what I studies in the poly - Electronics engineering.<br><br>In the past I never have the intention of getting a distance-learning degree but as years goes by I have this plan in mind, that is, to work for a few years for experiences and money then goes for a part-time distance learning degree, preferably relevant to electronics engineering.<br><br>I saw many of my friends who are studying Engineering in the poly goes to SIM to study business degreesand I really wonder whether I really needs a degree in the future. However I don't feels like taking a degree with different field (I am not interested in business, otherwise I'd take up business course in Poly as I am eligible for that) but I won't rule out this possibility of me taking a business distance-learning degree as long as it is a needs for me to do so.<br><br>Another things that bothers me is that from what I know there aren't many distance-learning degrees in electronics engineering here and even if have, it might cost more than that of a business degree. Furthermore, the GPA in my poly result aren't that great either, only 1.62 only. (However I managed to pass all my modules without taking any retests or repeat of modules) I wonder whether my low GPA will affect my chances of being admitted for distance-learning degree in the future.<br><br>You might suggest me going overseas to pursue a degree but due to many reasons I can't do that. Also I did considered taking a relevant advanced diploma back in the poly in few years time but I doubt whether the advanced diploma will be of use to me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>electronics engineering; sad to say.. very difficult to find jobs. You do not have a wide field of jobs to choose from too.<br><br>Get a degree in something which you have passion and interest in. Stop wasting your time in local polys and local unis (NUS &amp; NTU).<br><br>SMU is a different case altogether.<br><br>If you have the chance and money; go study in an overseas university. Stop being a pathetic f*ckin hermit and stay in damn Sg all your life without having any beneficial overseas exposure.<br><br>Of course; to each his own and going overseas ain't always good. You are exposed to new dangers, discrimination, etc.<br><br>Go to Aussie or Britain.<br><br>Some prestigious Universities inculde: Monash University, University of Southern Queensland, University of Portsmouth, University Of Melbourne, etc.</div>

I am more interested in electronics stuffs compared to business stuffs so I didn't take any business courses as my field to study.<br><br>However, if it is really difficuit to look for a job in the electronics sector then I might have to switch to business distance-learning degree provided that the business sector is easy to look for job.
