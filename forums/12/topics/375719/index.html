              <p>It's very frustrating. Someone misunderstood me base on something I post. I think textual medium is inadequate in conveying tone and inflation.</p>
              <p>I realise people are complex, layered and prone to moods and there will always be a margin of error between what we give out and what others interpret. For example, you may assume you’re behaving one way (amusing/risqué) while others are picking up different signals (sarcastic/rude).</p>
              <p>But if we can work towards consistency in our thoughts and behaviour, we’ll find others responding more positively in return.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you often feel you are being misunderstood? Is it confronting to think this could be <em>your</em> fault? Or is what you see what you get?</p>

              <p>in reply to this topic.. actually it reminds me of an article..<br><br>i will try to express the meaning, of cuz i cant rmb the exact article..<br><br>it goes like this, the title of the article is "7 sources of anger"</p>
              <p>well there are many many, but one of it that leave the deepest impression is the one that talk about how technology make misunderstandings...</p>
              <p>it says, according to some research, only 7% of the words used in conversation conveys message.. the other percentage are based on tones, facial expressions, body language, eye contact and so on.. is it that they had some machine to calculate all these? i dunno, but what i am sure of is that during a conversation, tones and body languages and so on are very very very important and can make a lot of difference in the meaning u are trying to convey..</p>
              <p>the article continues.. there was once i tried making a delicious chilli sauce which i took many days of effort to make it, it was my first try and i wanted others to taste it and hear their comments.. i myself thought it was very very nice, my wife and family members thought so too... and here i got some leftover chilli... then i decided to SMS my friend,</p>
              <p>to : "hey i got some leftover chilli made by me, want some? i will bring them over if u want."</p>
              <p>reply : "no thanks"</p>
              <p>i interpretted this "no thanks" as sarcastic remarks of meaning saying " eww it is leftover? not specially made for me? no man i do not want such a thing, "THANK YOU"" i was so angry and i broke this friendship... half a year passed and my wife saw this friend of mine somewhere.. she clarified with this friend what he was trying to say, and the truth is that he does not like chilli and when he said thanks, he meant it...</p>
              <p>now u see, a simple SMS can convey what? a 7% meaning of what u are trying to say? sometimes things can go very wrong with a little lacking of eye contact or body language.. etc... if u are nervous talking to the girl u like, yet u are trying to cool urself down, the body language tells the girl that u are trying to act cool.. well such misunderstandings can cause lots of trouble.. so becareful not to use the wrong body signs... the article continues to talk about the other 6 source of anger..</p>
              <p>well it is quite true eh? however, i felt that most body languages, eye contacts and stuff like that are the only thing u can trust, in this modern society, words can be very deceiving... and from those body languages, i can definitely tell who is true to me as a friend and who is not...</p>
              <p>o ya btw penqueen... this forum... u seldom see proper replies... unless u are in real trouble, to me the replies in Aunt Agony makes most sense and is most proper.. definition of proper to me would be giving replies that makes sense... but of cuz, dont ask stupid questions haha!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and ya.. most of the ppl in this forum is very against PAP... well.. in my opinion PAP had done a great job in both the governing and the sucking of _ _ _ _ _.... (fill in the blanks)</p>
              <p>hope i dont get any trouble.. haha!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheers<br>IA</p>

              <p>haha if i were to comment on this video as a normal viewer, i will rate is 7.5/10 and i will say that it is good but too so called "normal"</p>
              <p>but if u ask me for the room for improvement, as a starter/beginner on video stuff, as a person who think too much...</p>
              <p>1. no music and picture sync, the person just put the music and picture together, like if the drum or other musical instrument comes in, the picture should make a sudden change (most song have an "intro", starting with instrument 1 then #2 then #3).. make use of those change and create the change effect</p>
              <p>2. use the same effect too much and inappropriate</p>
              <p>3. can try to categorize stuff like "eye", "holding hand" and "hugs" since it is a romance amv.. i can see that the part, especially, on the eye keep scattering around the video...</p>
              <p>4. the song is more suited for something constant.. u realise the video keeps changing scene.. from fighting to romance and romance to fighting and to parting... this is something that needs a song to have more "climax" and "relaxing" parts.. i can suggest that u can start off with a scene of sasuke and sakura holding hands then show other scene for 3 secs lidat then make a miniature of "sasuke holding sakura hands".. then the mini sasuke and sakura will watching the scenes changing at different environment... also it would be great if there were to be a continuous story like showing scene 1 about war, then scene 2,3,4 about something else, then when scene 5, show back the continuation of scene 1...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>o well.. i only know how to talk, no action de haha... i am too lazy to find those resources, download the scene and edit them haha... or rather i also have no time since i have to study for now... if u interested can come to my forum...i think the link is <a title="Video Stuff" href="http://www.videostuff.sgforums.com">www.videostuff.sgforums.com</a>.. or something like that.. but the fourm is as good as dead..</p>
              <p>u have interest for video too?<br><br>btw care to tell me what anime u watched/watching?</p>
              <p>i recommend lovely complex, ichigo 100%, one piece, hitman reborn, naruto, kenichi, bleach... i also watch gintama, bamboo blade too..</p>
