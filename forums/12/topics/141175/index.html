Can u heck care about this friendster thingy? Just call her n ask her out n from there u'll know. The problem with you is.. you are thinking so much now when u dun even know for real about what u are thinking! Are u sure what you debating about mentally is the truth? Go out with her n you know.<br><br>Drop hints that u still have an interest in her. But this time... come on differently... be confident n sure about ur feeligns for her. Chicks dig that. They love confidence in men who dare to say n touch them. If you gonna be spineless, n keep thinking n thinking, you can go to bed every nite with your hand.<br><br>Sooo.... Be a real man n do something!</div>
