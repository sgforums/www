              <p>Call the police if I were you.</p>
              <p>Like someone who put it this way to me long time ago: "Be strong"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't mean to preach but you seem like in a bad situation and it's not just you but your family too. During my crisis the thing that held me together was my faith( I was pretty much broken inside but I held on). You know what after a few years of crisis some miracles here and some (literally)miracles there started to show. I'm not really alone. So neither are you. Pray to Jesus. God is only a prayer away.</p>
              <p> You know what the craziest thing I asked of God was to make me an earthquake right there right then. He gave me just that..... I couldn't stop smiling afterwards. People were squatting with hands on the floor afraid of falling down I was standing up hey I'm not afraid of my God I did ask for it....It was a stupid, useless, silly request but He did give me that well after waiting for a 3 seconds interval. Of course nobody was hurt nor the building damaged. Now wouldn't He give you help too. But you must put faith, and hold on to your faith no matter what. I do not  insist that you believe this story but I wrote it(It did  happen) just to make the point nothing is impossible with God.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Be strong. You are not alone in this world. Jesus loves you. God knows.
                          He'll let you know He knows just as He has let me know that He knows.</p>

              <p>Dear Sir,</p>
              <p>Ending your life is not a solution. There are many disabled people but they keep on leaving. They might not have so many problems like you are facing now but I believe you can go trough it.</p>
              <p>As for your brother, only solution is to call the authority. There are no point living in fear for the rest of your life. If you can't pay full or installment, the interest rates will accumulate more and more.</p>
              <p>I pray for you and hope you have more peace in mind to solve all your problem.</p>

              <p>Thanks you all, btw my brother serving NS is 20 yr old. Hope you all could understand the immense pressure from the bookie is causing us unable to live our life normally. I slowly understand how people would have the courage the end their life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I still have to see if there is better option... going to the police might not be the best solution. The police will catch those bookie runnner, those small fish and we might not know how the bookie boss is going to react.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bookie boss basically is heartless... even bookie runner who saw our family condition give sympathy by repeatly calling their boss to nego how to clear the debt slowly... but the boss refuses, money or my brother.</p>

              <p>The villians make life difficult for u and your family , so make life difficult for them. Make a police report and visit a MP as suggested by fellow forummers. To die because of this is not worthwhile. Not worthwhile. Just not worthwhile.</p>
              <p> If i am any of your family member , i just take a chopper and be prepared to fight them or to scare them. I hate to be threatened by others .</p>
              <p>Dont let your family and your life be overshadowed by this. Need any help or feeling miserable , just post here. We will do what we can to help you.</p>

              <p>Bookies are only interested in making money,btw your brother should know the runner or agent.try talk to the agent,why he allow your brother to lose and own up to so much?</p>
              <p>the agent should stop your brother account until he pay up what he own before letting him bet again,i believe something is not quite right here as i believe your brother can't lose up to 18k in a week and since he can't pay the 1st payment already,why did they still allow him to bet and lose more before clearing up the previous?</p>
              <p>worse come,tell them you will call the police.all this bookies is more afraid than you if you inform the police as you think will they let this 18k ruined their business?their motive here is to collect the money and i am sure they will be very willing to settle up this problem with you.</p>
              <p>i knew quite few peoples who is in this situation too,losing more than they can pay up and the bookies gladly accept the payment by instalments.</p>

              <p>I believe there is some loan shark involved in the outstanding amounts and as Nameless Wonder has mentioned these people are only interested in money. So your brother here will need to be honest as to how much was actually involved (minus the interest). Stop the interest from rolling and negotiate for a reasonable and agreeable amount to pay back - just let them know that raising 18K will only make things difficult for you and longer for them to recover the outstanding. On the hindsight, such amount can also be possible considering the no. of matches on one weekend - EPL, German League, Spanish Liga and Italian as well.</p>
              <p>Also, if any harrassment or looking for your mother for money, from henceforth would mean immediate stop to the payments and no hesitation to go to the police which is the last thing they would want in this "business".  Although, I do not condone to this form of betting, but since your brother has betted and lost - it is only right to payback what is being owed.</p>
