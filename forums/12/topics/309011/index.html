              <p>If your brother is truly willing to right a wrong, then surrender himself to the police and let those bookies be caught. First-time offenders for illegal gambling would just be slapped with a fine of 1 grand.</p>
              <p>You mentioned that he is still in his secondary school, so I shall assume he's probably below 17... If that's the case, he might sentenced to probation and community work order... Whatever it is, it'd be good for him...</p>
              <p>As for self-reproach and guilt, you should put them aside for now and solve the immediate problem first. If you haven't realize it already, the immediate problem being the bookies coming for your family in a few more hours! So don't delay! Get the cops already!</p>
              <p>I got so much to write, but I'm already sleepy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"> </p>
              <p>But remember; you can't control what the bookies will do, but you are in control of your reactions. Don't face your problems with fear! Again... For the last time and love of God... CALL THE COPS...</p>

              <p>important things first.. go to the police.. make sure they follow up because they're overworked to hell and may not do so.. if necessary, get help from the Grassroots Leaders or MPs or whatever.. just get help..</p>
              <p>your brother may be in trouble with the law but it's going to be less than the trouble with gangsters.. a heck of a lot less.. and the judge will be fair with him if he really regrets and is willing to repent.. also, a lot of mitigating circumstances will come in... so go to the police..</p>
              <p>the rest, you'll have to be strong and keep going..</p>
              <p>if you think suicide, you're just inflicting even greater suffering on your loved ones..</p>
              <p>things will get better.. hang in there.. make sure you get a good education and start working so that you can make things better..</p>
              <p>by the way.. don't cry over spilt milk.. what is done is done.. the question is fixing it.. being depressed won't help much..</p>
              <p>get your family.. talk to them.. have a family meeting.. iron out what you all have to do.. make decisions and then go do them..</p>

              <p>I hope someone can help me with my problems, recent event have make me extremely depress and i almost have no means to live anymore...</p>
              <p>[U][B]Myself[/B][/U]<br>I had a terrible accident 2 years back, ended up being disabled, servered sciatic nerves from my left leg. Unable to walk without suppost, but still i continue to strive hard studying in local university hoping to achieve something in my life. During this 2 years i had tried hard to be happy and positive.</p>
              <p>[U][B]My Family[/B][/U]<br>My family is not a well to do family but we do tried hard to survive... only able to have decent meals everyday, i had 3 younger brother 4th brother studying in sec sch, 3rd brother serving NS and a low mentally 2nd younger brother who always get sacked from his job and now jobless. The only family income is from my mother who works as a cleaner for 600 per month and father who is a private bus driver.. income just able to support 3 meals for us.</p>
              <p>[B][U]Bad company[/U][/B]<br>Worst thing happened, my 3rd brother mixed up with bad company. He is very naive to trust those bad company. A group of bookies who encourage him to illegal gamble by giving him large number of credit luring him into great debt. As of this few days, i dont know how he accumulate a debt of 18k from his bookies friend.</p>
              <p>[B][U]Harrassment   [/U][/B]<br>My family had tried to offer money and pay monthly to clear up his debt<br>but His groups of friend wanted demanded him to pay up 18k in 1 day, and wanted to force him borrow money from loan shark to pay up his debt. I had stopped him in time and manage to move off from his friends. Today those bookie waited downstair my house to wait for our family member to come home. My mother had been stopped by them and they demanded money from her.</p>
              <p><br>[B][U]Threaten [/U][/B]<br>The bookie boss repeatly called my brother today and threaten to beat him up. He said if there is no money from us today in the afternoon he will not want the money anymore. My 3rd brother become very depress, he had truely repent on what he did but the bookies are not giving him any chance in repaying the debts. Yesterday i found him in serious depression and even wanted to suicide cause he is unable to face our family by causing so much trouble, He had been crying non-stop since those calls. I cant stand to see my brother so helpless...</p>
              <p>[B][U]My fault[/U][/B]<br>As the eldest in the family its my duty to educate my younger sibling, i feel its my fault in letting my 3rd brother go astray. If only i had been more careful, i would not be in serious traffice accident 2 years back with more than 13 surgery ( i Even had lost count). I ought to be helping my parent with the financial burden. With medical condition right now i cant work to help out......i ...cant :(</p>
              <p>[B][U]Helpless[/U][/B]<br>What can i do now? My 3rd brother had thought of surrender to the police for the illegal gambling but those bookies will not let us go off so easily. He had repent willing to surrender but he is afraid those bookies will take revenge on our helpless family. It is seriously ruining our life. We cant go out, afraid those bookies will do something to us. I had not slept in 2 days, perhaps it is more easily if i just jump down from my house :(. What shall i do T_T................What shall i do T_T...... Another few hours in the afternoon the bookies will be here demanding money if not force my 3rd brother to borrow money from loan shark. Something bad will happen to us.</p>

              <p>TS, please update? I hope all is well with you and your family.</p>
              <p>I've seen police work from a first person perspective, please believe me that the force is capable enough to oust the mastermind. I believe that particular bookmaker is just a small time player; imagine telling his debtors to borrow from a loanshark to pay off a gambling debt.</p>
              <p><em><strong>''Bookie boss basically is heartless... even bookie runner who saw our family condition give sympathy by repeatly calling their boss to nego how to clear the debt slowly... but the boss refuses, money or my brother'' </strong></em></p>
              <p>Quoting you. And how do you know they weren't play good cop bad cop? Don't let fear envelop you, fear is a mind-killer and it certainly robs you of whatever rationale to think. So my final advice to this problem is still go to the authorities without anymore delay.</p>
              <p>As for your not-wanting-to-live-because-life-is-bad.</p>
              <p>Let me tell you what life is about, young man. Life is about tackling problems; life is fair, even though everyone begins at different levels. Because a rich man could lose everything tomorrow and a pauper could win the world. Life is fair because our choices will lead us to where we will be. So if you choose to end your life today, not only you give up your chance to fight but also your dear family's chance of bettering their life.</p>
              <p>For now, I encourage you to  work hard and not be too affected by that small hiccup. The real test of human character only comes when the bottom drops out of their lives. Let this be your test of character.</p>

              <p><br>Destroybot,</p>
              <p>It isn't your fault that lead your brother ends up in bad company. He has a head that can think for himself and he is ultimately responsible for his own action. Let him take this as a life lesson.. he will learn it well.</p>
              <p>Hmm i think you should report to the authority and let the authority deal with the bookies.. eventually.</p>
              <p>Don't ever incur more debts by borrowing from the loanshark.. which u have already done.</p>
              <p>Take a deep breath. There is really nothing in the world that you can't handle.</p>
