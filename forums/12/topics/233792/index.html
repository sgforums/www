            <div class='col-md body'>From what I hear from my friends in banking, OCBC is better bank to work in than UOB - in terms of staff welfare and career prospects... I don't know exact details but that seems to be the general notion. Pretty sure UOB has a larger market capitalisation though.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you're getting into personal financial consulting better make sure you do it good and do it well. Both the banks offer a basic pay on top of your com. You can do it extremely well and jump to be their private banking relationship managers (RMs)  (handles customers with at least US$1mil net worth) or you can jump ship to other banks when they're head hunting. A large number of a local bank's private RMs jump to a foreign bank last year, causing a near destabilisation in the private banking arm. They brought a large number of their customers away too.<br><br>Also a number of officers from a foreign bank jump to a local bank in late 2005, causing the foreign bank to be overworked in that particular dept. The foreign bank had to issue a warning through MAS to the local bank not to "dig" their staff away.<br><br>People who started in financial consulting but did not do well are generally "not well received" by some banks and FAs. One can still get a job, but usually not something managerial, where the career could be to a VP or SVP.</div>
