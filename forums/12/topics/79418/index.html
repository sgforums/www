            <div class='col-md body'>pretend nothing happened. U 2 were juz to drunk to do anything properly. That's why I dun club or drink at all. When u drunk u do stupid things, stupid things which would make u regret later on. If drinking is a must for social reasons. Control the speed of drinking to lessen the alcoholic effects.<br><br>Just pretend nothing happened. Keep things strictly business/professional r/s from now on. This is not only for ur safety but also for his family too.</div>
