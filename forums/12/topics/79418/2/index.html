Thinking too much might leads to quite unhealthy effects... What done cannot be undone.. Look forward...<br><br>It seems quite unlikely that he'll sack you or anything if you just pretend that nothing has happened... (though there's a chance that he might, but no point worrying about that for now as it's slim chance and not much within your control...)<br><br>Just be careful next time when you out partying... Take necessary precautions if you have to... Afterall, you're a lady... And it seems for now, quite a vulnerable one in a certain way?<br><br>If he don't make advances, it's ok... If he does, better job or not... It's always advisable for you to change your job... Or alternatively, you can just show no interest in him (but avoid a direct rejection)...<br><br>If his advances continues, then it's time for you to step up... Find a new job...

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks for all the replies. Just want to give an update...<br><br>i went back to office today. felt very nervous, not sure what to do when i see him. thank goodness he was in a meeting. i thought i won't have to meet him face to face. but his meeting ended. then he called me into his room. was very friendly to me and asked me why am i back in office. i was kinda stunned. but i replied him in a smiling manner and left his room.<br><br>abt half hour later, he asked me into his room again, to talk about work. he was uncharacteristically cheerful. usually he is stern when he talk about work. i don't wish to read too much into this. hopefully he acts differently only because he is in an exceptionally good mood today.<br><br>when he left for the day, i told my very close n trusted colleague aboutt the incident. she told me that on that day, he told her he will send me home (my colleague was supposed to send me home). my colleague agreed because she always thought he was exceptionally nice to me and she thought he likes me as a younger sister, hence he will take care of me. (he loved to give me friendly pats on my head when we were out drinking in the past)<br><br>now she thinks she has misread him and she feels he actually do like me in the more romantic sense. and he was taking advantage of the situation that night. she feels it was preplanned (otherwise he would not have insisted to send me home - there are many other colleagues who lived nearer to me)<br><br>well, i hope not. but whatever it is, since he does not show any recollections of that incident and he is still friendly towards me, i will try my best to forget the whole incident. though frankly speaking, having my colleague telling me she thinks that he really likes me, makes me quite apprehensive. but i guess there is nothing i can do about it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A teacher gave her fifth grade class an assignment:<br>Get their parents to tell them a story with a moral at the end of it.<br><br>The next day the kids came back and one by one began to tell their stories.<br><br>Ashley said, "My father's a farmer and we have a lot of egg laying hens.<br>One time we were taking our eggs to market in a basket on the front seat of<br>the car when we hit a big bump in the road and all the eggs went flying and<br>broke and made a mess."<br><br>"What's the moral of the story?" asked the teacher.<br><br>"Don't put all your eggs in one basket!"<br><br>"Very good," said the teacher.<br><br>Next little Sarah raised her hand and said, "Our family are farmers too.<br>But we raise chickens for the meat market. We had a dozen eggs one time, but<br>when they hatched we only got ten live chicks, and the moral to this story<br>is, "don't count your chickens before they're hatched."<br><br>"That was a fine story Sarah. Michael, do you have a story to share?"<br><br>"Yes, my daddy told me this story about my Aunt Karen.<br>Aunt Karen was a flight engineer in the Gulf War and her plane got hit.<br>She had to bail out over enemy territory and all she had was a bottle of<br>whiskey, a machine gun and a machete. She drank the whiskey on the way down<br>so it wouldn't break and then she landed right in the middle of 100 enemy<br>troops. She killed seventy of them with the machine gun until she ran out of<br>bullets. Then she killed twenty more with the machete until the blade broke.<br>And then she killed the last ten with her bare hands."<br><br>"Good heavens," said the horrified teacher,<br>"what kind of moral did your daddy tell you from that horrible story?"<br><br>"Stay away from Aunt Karen when she's been drinking."</div>
