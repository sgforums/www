            <div class='col-md body'>Introduction<br><br>IÂ’m a 32 old guy whoÂ’s never been on a date before, never cared about BGR until now. I consider myself as an average looking guy so when I talk to girls itÂ’s merely as friends. I never thought that itÂ’s not this way with some girls.<br><br>Secondary School<br><br>Never cared about anything, just play sports and enjoy myself.  At this stage my friends started to have BGR. I never really understood why they do this. Girls are just problems.<br>One day I met a guy friend from another school, he said that I have a lot of admirers but I just Â“act coolÂ”. I thought he must be joking because I was never interested in girls.<br><br>Poly<br><br>Got a bit curios about BGR but never gave it try, no confidence. When I see a girls staring at me I thought Â“Cannot be lahÂ…..She must be looking at someone else. SheÂ’s too good looking to be staring at meÂ”.<br><br>National Service<br><br>No time to think about BGRÂ…..hang out with my guys friends and kept busy with hobbies. Totally never thought about getting a girlfriend.<br><br>Working Life<br><br>This is where all the drama started to happen. IÂ’m still the same guy..Blur about BGR  but now my colleagues are not Girls anymore but Women. I was slowly going to find out the difference. Still blur about the opposite sex I did not know what to do or think or say when they give me compliment,<br><br>Compliment				Reply<br><br>You very cute			ErrrrÂ…..thank you<br>You got girlfriend			Why are you asking me this question?<br>You very handsome			Â“StunnedÂ” No replyÂ…..Just smile<br>IÂ’m not seeing anyone right now	No reponseÂ…wondering Â“WhatÂ’s that<br>got to do with meÂ”<br>Bring your Gf to the chalet	          Wondering..Â”Why she want to see my GfÂ”<br>You look like my Ex.Bf 	        No reponseÂ…wondering Â“WhatÂ’s that got    to do with meÂ”<br>When are you getting married	                Why u want to know?<br><br>Once my male colleague(already married) hinted to me Â“that girl likes uÂ…chase after her lahÂ”. I replied ,Â”Are you nutsÂ….thatÂ’s my friendÂ”.<br><br>Most of my friends now have steady Gf or getting married and having kids. After all<br>these years I finally woke up. Hopefully there is hope for me, I regret never took the time<br>to understand the opposite sex. I think my life would be different now. HaizÂ…Â…(&gt;_&lt;)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Group outing my late blooming friend.  Just make sure that everyone else has a partner so the two of you will be 'stuck' with each other.  Advantage:  You can be yourself.  Since she likes you already (so u say ur fren says) then it shouldn't be a problem.<br><br>Send her home and say 'you had a good time' and ask her if she would like to go out another night.  Of course, be truthful, nothing's worse than a lying bastard.  Good lead up to popping the question is to ask at anytime of the outing what she likes to do.  Try to find out more about that hobby (by talking to her about it) and You can always say you like to try it and ask if she can reccomend how to go about it.  Then you ask her to accompany you since it's going to be awkard to go alone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh...u are a rare gem. Its not too late to start the dating game but most gals will have had much more emotional bagage and experience in love and relationships than u had. Can u handle it and their expectations towards their bfs?.As u know, most gals's standard of the bfs tend to get higher with each bf as they want to correct the previous' faults and seek even greener pastures. At an age of 32, i will say thats if it is destined for you to find someone, you might. But if not, living your life as a single aint too bad either.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This week I just "broke a girl's heart". I did not want to do it, i gave her so many hints that i was not interested. I hoped to avoid this moment but it was not avoidable.<br><br>We are colleagues for 5 years and work together, I know she like me but i only treat her only as a fren and nothing more. I never once implied that I was attracted or interested to her. She been involved in BGR before and even has an admirer. I was very happy when I know this guy was chasing her.<br><br>I'm already blur sotong about BGR. It began when I told her that I'm thinking of getting another job, then she started to behave strangely. Everytime she behaves likes this, I just walk off. I really did not want her to say something that she will regret because to me we are just frens.<br><br>During lunchtime we sat at the same table, she was very upset. After seeing this i got very upset. I really,really did not want to hurt her. I couldn't even finish my lunch.<br><br>Later we did not talk for a while. Going home time, we took the same transport home, talk as though nothing has happened.<br><br>Why did she have to do it, she aready know what the answer will be. She hurt me and she hurt herself. After this I don't how to be myself around her anymore. Things are going to get weird when we are working together.<br><br></div>
