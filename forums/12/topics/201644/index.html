            <div class='col-md body'>I am very upset. Last Saturday, traveled all my way to my parent house and they just went out to meet my elder sister. Ever since I moved out of the house, the only time they visit me is during Chinese New Year and I visit them weekly. Now I sell my car away, so the only time I can get together with them is during the weekend. I still contribute the same amount to her even though I donÂ’t eat and live there. Yet my elder sister who live near her, eat there everyday still contribute the same amount as me. She take great care for her, care for her babies and many other. They call each other everyday yet we seldom on the line. Even if I talk to her, she just keeps on talking about them non-stop. She complains that I am earning very little since I am a degree holder. If she thinks so then why take so much from me? Plus I use my own money to get a degree. Maybe due to I donÂ’t have finance burden. Recently, she just told me that she has closed a joint account with me and reopen another account with my sister. The reason she given me is because the joint account interest is low.

So we donÂ’t own one another. She can leave it to her darling. I have my own hand and feet to feed myself.<br><br>Just a word to those parent, donÂ’t ever play favoritism. If you are then donÂ’t give birth to so many children. For the sake of old age? Like the Chinese speaking, fingers also got short and long. I will just give birth to a child and give him/ her all I have.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...Honestly, I don't see why you should even strive to be like your sister in the eye of your parents to begin with - you are who you are and ultimately, it's up to them to accept you as you are. I mean, why should you live your life any differently just to get in the good books(and there are no guarantees that will happen to begin with) of someone(even if that's a close next-of-kin)?<br><br>Ultimately, I don't think you should decide how much to contribute to your parents based on the perceived injustices that go around either - if you don't feel good giving what you're giving now, then why not give something within your means and more importantly(in your view at least), reflects what they have done for you over the years(regardless of how much better off your sis may have been, just view that as a seperate and independent entity)? At the end of the day, there just simply such a thing whereby you equate fairness with equality!<br><br>Someone once said something to me about the notion that for people who shared your beliefs, no explanations are necessary and for those who don't, no explanations are possible - and I suppose he is right in the sense that human relations is one of those things where you can't explain and reason rationally and tangibly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Saying that, I certainly don't think it appropriate if this episode <strong>alone</strong> should shape your view to having just a single child as in many cases that I know, children from single child households tend to neglect certain aspects of their emotional development(but that's a story for another day)...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I only got S$50 from my mother every month... to buy bus stamp... if I want to eat and spend... find a job... and that is what I been doing... which is to work since polytechnic... and I have see myself to a degree recently... but she also didn help... well... I am used to it anyway... she say I am working thus I should use my own money but she can spend thousands on my sister's education without complain.. maybe because she is the only daughter... but I also see enough liao loh... waht for you "fight" win her... like what I said... its ok that she don't love you but you die die must love yourself... one day she might need your help right...<br><br>As for me... I just contribute to the family and if you got any problems... find the precious daughter of yours as she is better mah...
