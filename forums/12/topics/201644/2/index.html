            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FORGET-ME-NOT:</div><div class="quote_body">I am very upset. Last Saturday, traveled all my way to my parent house and they just went out to meet my elder sister. Ever since I moved out of the house, the only time they visit me is during Chinese New Year and I visit them weekly. Now I sell my car away, so the only time I can get together with them is during the weekend. I still contribute the same amount to her even though I donÂ’t eat and live there. Yet my elder sister who live near her, eat there everyday still contribute the same amount as me. She take great care for her, care for her babies and many other. They call each other everyday yet we seldom on the line. Even if I talk to her, she just keeps on talking about them non-stop. She complains that I am earning very little since I am a degree holder. If she thinks so then why take so much from me? Plus I use my own money to get a degree. Maybe due to I donÂ’t have finance burden. Recently, she just told me that she has closed a joint account with me and reopen another account with my sister. The reason she given me is because the joint account interest is low. The new account that she put her money in is OCBC and can fetch a better interest. I search through the OCBC website but no special promotion. I donÂ’t need her money but all her saving is lock with my sister. Is very unfair because part of her saving is my allowance to her. I donÂ’t know why she is so bias since young I have been striving to be the same as my sister. I give her the same allowance as my sister, I buy gift for her during mother day and her birthday. I even drive her around. I am sick of it. I am not going back every weekly. I think I will still contribute every month as a token to her for bringing me up as for her money. So we donÂ’t own one another. She can leave it to her darling. I have my own hand and feet to feed myself.<br><br>Just a word to those parent, donÂ’t ever play favoritism. If you are then donÂ’t give birth to so many children. For the sake of old age? Like the Chinese speaking, fingers also got short and long. I will just give birth to a child and give him/ her all I have.<br></div></blockquote>my parents play favourtism too. they act like they dont but i know very well they do.<br>my elder bro finished his a lvls and is serving ns now while me i finished sec5 and currently in my poly year one.<br>i dunnoe why but it always seems like whatever my elder brother wants he will get it without paying a cent at all<br>as for me,whatever i ask for they will say, 'you go save your own money and buy'.<br>even my younger brother gets whatever he wants including a new handphone he asks for the very next day<br>they recently paid fully for my elder's bro license and i asked them if they were paying for me, they said no. after that they told me they could loan me the money instead.i was like wtf?<br>probably this is happening becos im the 2nd son.my pri school teacher told me once that parents love the first son and dote on the last one,the second one usually gets left out.<br>are you the second child of the family ?</div>
