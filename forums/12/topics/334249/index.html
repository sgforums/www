              <p>I did felt that everything went wrong and was in a long state of depression when my last relationship ended tho. Such events probably will cause one to be overwhelmed by his/her own emotions..</p>

              <p>Well, I do feel it too. I guess 1 way is to reflect why is people behaving this way. Thnk about your actions, did you cause it? Or are you the very Mr nice guy that people know that you can tolerate very well. Hence they keep joking with you, ignoring how you feel, thinking that you are able to take those jokes. Well, for me, sometimes I find that I think too much and hence, thought that everyone dont like me too. If you keep thinking and find no fault in you, then ignorance is bliss.</p>
              <p>I would advice you to confide in your best friend that you are feeling this way and ask them if they know what's the problem in you. It helps to have a best friend whom you can really trust in. All the best man! Don't think too much! Else, more ppl will not like u ;)</p>

              <p>Yup, maybe that explains why i feel tat all the time. But actually, in hindsight, it could be just the peron's cold personality, or his temporal mood, or simply that you aint very good with him so he doesnt respond very warmly.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is you cant let tat limit your potential friendships. Also, everyone is different and thus it is almost impossible to find a friend tat has a complementary personality. Thats why most ppl only has 1 or 2 very close friends.</p>
              <p>This thread came at a good time, right after i said thanks alot!! for a classmate who helped me alot and he just replied 'okay' which is kinda cold, contrary to his warm help.</p>

              <p>hahaha Xiiaostarry... u must be an very alluring person.. too bad I dont have looks of those famous actors/stars.. hahah..</p>
              <p>however I think that attractiveness can be accounted to two acpects, the inner and the outer. Good looks (outer) definitely gives an advantage to a person, but what actually counts more is the inner acpect of a person, which is defined by a person's personality, behaviour, attitude, etc..</p>
              <p>yeah sometimes I do have paranoic thoughts on how people think about me, how people judge me etc.. but everytime when i think back the roots of the problem mostly the problem originates from my ownself..</p>
              <p>So.. the advice is watch ur own behaviour.. and if the person is still against you or what, simply ignore him or her.</p>
