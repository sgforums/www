              <p>When you have stopped putting in efforts to preserve and/or nurture, of course the relationship start to fall apart and rot away.</p>
              <p>Drifting apart means neither of you are sharing common interest. And neither bothered to participate in a common interest.</p>
              <p>Why is saying i love you so difficult nowadays? Perhaps there's resentment yet to be resolved. Perhaps withholding of affection is a punishment for unmet needs.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you should try saying "i appreciate you"... instead of I love u. If you can't do that honestly.. then it's not likely your relationship will survive "till death do us part". </p>
              <p>If you can't survive this one.. next one will be no different.</p>

              <p>I will add on to jojo.</p>
              <p>In your post you said "feeling is turning into family rather than lovers". Do you love your family?</p>
              <p>That feeling is normal.....hence the saying your partner is your best friend or to similar effect.</p>
              <p>Sharing common interest is important because it allows both to be in close proximity whilst participating in daily life.</p>
              <p>It can be as simple as eating.</p>

              <p>All relationship started off well. If it ain't well.. there'll be no relationship to start.</p>
              <p>Long term relationships that stands the test of time, went through ups and downs. But will always be solidly anchored to each other.</p>
              <p>Your gf's world does not simply revolves around you.</p>
              <p>She will be pre-occupied with many things along the way. So will you. After every venture, after the novelty is done, will you/she be there ?</p>
              <p>Even after both of you get married, she may be pre-occupied with many many things in the future. Everytime she puts her heart somewhere else, into the new baby, a new job, a new hobby. Are you going to pout and get discouraged ?</p>
              <p>Instead of feeling excluded, why don't you try harder to be included ?</p>

              <p>The problem is her,not you.If she coudln't continue to make feeling for her, it means she is nott he one for you. But this is not something the feminazis or wussies can accept after years of brain washing. Don't be pressured to marry her just because she sucked 5and half years of your time. If you do and is sure, well then start with a pre-nup.  If she wants you to stay with her,she has to do a better job of pleasing you.If not there are always better gals,you deserve someone better who will trat you like a king.</p>

              <p>From the likes of it this Chinese gal(?) will divorce you and take away your flat(the one which you plan to buy). So dump her and move on other than waiting for her moods and emotions to be have some sense,it will never. Imagine her impregnated and taking your life. Be free man,find a good gal.</p>

              Ts,
              Muse over this -lah!
              When one looks for love, security or â€¦ in a  relationship,(marriage not excluded) it is merely that of exploiting each other by all means possible to fulfil each otherâ€™s needs. It is fine if it is made known at the outset or at least acknowledged. However, it rarely is done so as is it bound to reveal oneâ€™s one foibles. Many lack courage, many lack self-honesty and simply jump into a â€¦ so as to secure and milk the â€¦ for whatever it is perceived as worth. This is a self-effacing stance and in the long run most likely untenable and unsustainable. Blaming another for oneâ€™s predicament is a cop out. In short, it is a mutual benefit scheme. 
              Mutual benefit scheming does not and rarely lasts long. Mutual benefit scheme : put simply, is that of expectations, needs masquerading as love! It is beggary. Being self-honest and acknowleding this lacunae in oneself may stand one in good stead to come to terms with oneâ€™s cirumstances. Otherwise, it is being incarcerated in oneâ€™s predicament and suffering immensely cos extraneous factors (whatever comes to mind) may not elicit fulfilment. It is merely a house of cards, an accident waiting to happen.
