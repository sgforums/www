Anyway, they are not as strict as your sec school on hairstyle and usually you can siam the hair checks unless you really too obvious.<br><br>Go Jc people there more pretentious and less sincere than those in Poly I feel. At least thats what I feel when I go to Army.<br><br>Good luck to you anyway... I always advise people to go to Poly rather than Jc coz its so not worth it going to Jc anymore... You get more time and space there and entering Uni from there isn't difficult at all either.</div>
