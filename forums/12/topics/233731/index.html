            <div class='col-md body'>Read this on tickle.com<br><br>There are three main types of communicators: <strong><span style="color: blue;">Diplomats</span></strong>, <strong><span style="color: red;">Expressives</span></strong>, and <strong><span style="color: olive;">Harmonizers</span></strong>. <strong>Different types of communicators get along better with some types than others.</strong><br><br>For instance, because you are a Diplomat, you will tend to get along best with other Diplomats. This doesn't mean that a successful relationship between you and an Expressive or a Harmonizer is impossible. It simply means that those matches are a less natural fit for you, and those relationships will likely require more work to keep things going smoothly. Here's the complete rundown of how you get along with all the communication types:<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Diplomats</span></strong> with <strong><span style="color: blue;">Diplomats</span></strong>: This is your best match in terms of communication since another Diplomat will usually be happy to work through problems with you. As Diplomats, you'll both typically enjoy openly discussing your thoughts and feelings around issues and will each offer a sympathetic ear to one another.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Diplomats</span></strong> with <strong><span style="color: red;">Expressives</span></strong>: A Diplomat/Expressive pairing can work, but it will likely take some extra effort. Expressives tend to be quick to boil and can be single-minded when they get angry. As a result, their approach to tough conversations may make you feel like they are not listening to you. Before you can establish a truly productive relationship, these are some issues the two of you will want to work through.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Diplomats</span></strong> with <strong><span style="color: olive;">Harmonizers</span></strong>: This match can be successful with a little extra effort. For the most part, Harmonizers dislike discussing negative emotions and are comfortable ignoring some heated topics. This tendency runs quite opposite of your own need to get conflicts out in the open. The two of you may need to find a happy medium between these styles before your relationship can move forward.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, communication is about effort as well.<br><br>Even if two person same frequency, must put in effort to communicate. That's why sometimes ppl with same frequency still fail, instead end up with ppl who they can't communicate well, but love to death.<br><br>Effort. Can make hard communication that much easier.<br><br>So, yes and no. That's my opinion. Cos I'm a scary person and my dar dar can actually talk with me. (In fact, we normally go on talking marathon like nobody business...)<br><br>Great luck to everyone!</div>
