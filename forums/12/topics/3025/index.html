            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Aunt Agony,<br><br>I am totally lost and confused of what should I do next.  My boss whom loves to give me a lot of work to do.  Now I probably work from morning 8.00am to night 11.30pm everyday before I can go home and rest.<br><br>Furthermore no O.T pay and no rest even on Sat and Sun.  Now he wants me to create a database system for dept.  Oh shit!!!.  He is getting such high pay and yet cannot do things by himself.<br><br>Imagine a Technical Service and Operation Director does not know how to use windows/dos/ms office packages/emails and only with a Secondary education.  Shit him.<br>I dunno why my big boss likes him so much while he cannot even manage nor run the dept.  No engineers like him and can cooperate with him.  Even a technician would pick a quarrel with him.<br><br>Just last year in 1999, three batches of newly recruited engineers left in groups when they only work for less than four months.<br><br>Here am I stuck with this shit job and I cannot get it off since I was so stupid and dumb to sign a bloody contract with them.  I was so dumb to think that all American company was good.  Never did I expect it to turn out this way.<br><br>After entering this company, they change my contract policy and reduce many of my pre-said benefits.  There was no confirmation increment as said.  Annual leave was reduce from 14 days to 10 days.  Working days increase from 5 days to 5 1/2 days.  Working time increase from the normal 5.30p.m to 6.00p.m.  Medical benefits are limited to a max of S$18 claim per visit which was initially $25.<br><br>Now my boss told us that in order to save cost for the company, the management has decided all engineers and techincian to pull cables and to do all work by ourself.  This was his idea and not the management idea.  He wanted to gain our big boss favour.  Imagine engineers with a degree pulling cables, drilling, crawling under the drain, climbing up the roof top of any building and getting ourselves real dirty.  Even our customers laugh and make jokes about us.<br><br>Now even my pay was reduce by 5% on top of all this.   Damn stupid company.  They even cancel all pagers claims and they still expect us to be on 24 hrs standby.  All handphones claim are reduce from the normal 50% of the total bill to just 30% per month.  No hospitalization leave, no off days even when you work on Sunday and public holiday.<br><br>Shit this company.  I think this is the worst company in Singapore.  Furthermore the company has blocked all our PCs from accessing internets where it is important for us to search informations.  They even use dial-ups 33.6kbps modem to download emails.  Any IT guys out there whom are backing up their servers with floppy diskettes.  I do.  Imagine backing up all those junks with floppy diskettes.  Not even with a zip disk.  Wah kao.  Now the whole dept of technical team share two old PCs(486DX-100Mhz 16Mband Pentium 90Mhz 32Mb).  Imagine we have to create one whole lump of reports every day.  Shit and we have only a lousy bubble jet printer share amongst us. Sometimes we need to type manually.<br><br>Imagine my big boss ask me to entertain customer.  So I brought one big and important customer for a lunch which cost  $41 at Jack Place.  I was told later by my boss that it cannot be claimed.<br><br>Wahhhhh!!!.  Shit!!!.   Anyway I can bring all this frustation to the authority.  Help!!!!.  I am bursting<br><br></div>
