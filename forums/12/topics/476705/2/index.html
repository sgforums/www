                              <p>But just to clarify, we all hope for something in life. People
              want different things in life. For me, my self-identity is deeply
              tied in with my work, I have very little to show for in life,
              except for my work. My self-worth is determined by my career. So
              now that my career is not doing well, I feel quite sad.</p>

              All work and no play makes you a dull person Andy. Take a break...go and relax somewhere and think about nothing. Don't think about your work. Open your eyes and ears wide, observe and then adapt..learn.

              <p>a lot of people cannot quit. face it - they either, cannot get anotehr same position elsewhere, cannot get another post with the same or even hugher salary, or the mind just cannot imagine changing into another environment. some probably their education and resume experiences just cannot make it in a same post elsewhere, or maybe even lower post also.</p>

              Thanks FireIce, i have accumulated a good bit of savings thoughout my working life, to be frank, I, theoretically speaking, can take take quite a long break, but i love to work and I fear the future impact of taking such a long break, becoz I believe that having a salary is better than having no salary.
              
              But to be frank, I am quite losing it.

                              <p>You are showing perseverance and maturity by staying put in a
              job. Glad that you are putting other considerations like not
              wanting to be considered a job hopper, shows that you know what you
              are doing. But after 2 years, no promotion, underappreciated by a
              nasty boss and under stress, maybe its time to change job.</p>
              <p>At the moment you do not know which job to seek. So suggest you
              start logging your CV into monster.com and check around to see
              which job suits you. Donâ€™t quit your job just yet, find a job then
              quit.</p>
              <p>Life is tough dude, if you just quit and stay at home, means you
              just gave up in life. For this reason you have to withstand the
              stress before you can find a job.</p>
              <p>Interesting that you talk about your self identity. Yeah most
              people ties their identity to certain intrinsic values, like work,
              relationships, money and religion. So likely is your problem is
              that you donâ€™t know what meaning is your life. Why? Because you got
              no objective, no goals and no vision. Probably your vision is to
              excel at work but work is becoming dull and dread. This is what is
              causing your depression. This is very common, as I read in
              newspaper about a guy in Malaysia who has a 10 year relationship
              with his gf. But when his childhood sweetheart decides to break up
              with him, all hell broke lose for him because his whole life is
              her. So his life became meaningless, he murdered her in rage and
              tried to kill himself. Today he is in a hospital under remand and
              waiting to be charged for the murder of his girlfriend. So you must
              decide what is good for yourlife. Donâ€™t just live for one objective
              for your life (like that malaysian dude), in your case is your job.
              Look for several objectives to live. Like, go seek new friends, go
              play basketball in the weekends. Do something adventurous. Take up
              new hobby like photography. Count your blessings, like your family,
              they love you as a son.</p>
              <p>Medicine is only a temporary solution. You got to find the root
              cause of your depression. Go talk to a psychologist or get involve
              in religious activities that can free your soul from the bonds of
              worldly life. I give you an example. One of my friend, he got
              frustrated at his job. One day, he found out about this ship that
              sails around the world to help the poor understand about education.
              The ship has its own library and reguarly docks ports of major
              third world countries, so the poor people can come in and read
              books about the world. He volunteered as a crew with a bunch of
              foreigners, made up of europeans, americans, australians, asians,
              africans, etc. After 6 months, he came back, and he felt refreshed.
              He realised how good his life compared to the poor people of other
              nations and he was glad he made new friends and found a new refresh
              way of looking at life also was able to help other less fortunate
              people.</p>

              <p>Two years... Time to jump.</p>
              <p>I don't know how old are you, but so what if you're a job hopper? Neither you nor your company owes each other a debt. In fact, 2 years seems perfectly acceptable.</p>
              <p>Even when I went for my job interview before I joined my current company, when they ask me how long I intend to stay, I also told them 2 years... UNLESS there's opportunities for growth and career development. I even asked them what career development plans they have in their company. Interview is a session to negotiate, not comply, unless your chips are low and you couldn't find anything better in a long time.</p>
              <p>People don't need to job hop if their company makes an effort to grow their employees and give them better benefits. There's nothing wrong when you tell your next employer that you're changing job because you're seeking career development. How much you can grow in an SME is quite limited anyway, given their organisation size. UNLESS they expand. Which would be really interesting to stay on. :)</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, housing loan is really a drag in Singapore. But with 2 years of work and being frugal, there should be enough saving to take a half year break and start looking for job. In any case, it's advisable to do so while you still have a job anyway.</p>

              <p>I reached an understanding sometime ago. Your boss only pays you maybe 20% to 30% of the money he or she can make from you. That means that you can definitely find somewhere happier and make at least the same amount of money.</p>
              <p>I quit my previous job after spending 3 years there. Usual story, no overtime compensation, typically 12 hours at work, sometimes 70 hours per week at work. I put on over 30kg in those 3 years. Now, 6 months after leaving that company, I lost 10kg, am better paid, work better hours and I kick myself for not making the decision to leave earlier.</p>
