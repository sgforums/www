              would you quit a job if you were facing the below situation? 
              
              I have been working very hard in a job for 2 years, and putting up with snide and sarcastic remarks from my boss. My boss sometimes just scold me. 
              
              I was working very hard hoping for an promotion but did not get it. I feel sad because my self-identity is deeply tied into my work. Now I am really afraid that i would be passed over for promotion.
              
              I am very unhappy in my work place. I have been taking anti-depressants for the past 3 months and even thought of committing suicide. I know that I am not a lazy person but my boss always aim me. I no longer feel like working hard or doing work for which I am not appreciated for. I really find it hard to go work every morning.
              
              I tried hard at work to recruit new students but always get marked and scolded.. if I quit, I also don't know where I can go.....
              
              My parents know I have depressions and taking ant-depressants and advise me just to quit my job and take a break
              
              But I am very afraid that if I do not stay for at least 3-4 years, in the future, I would be marked as a "job-hopper". At work , my colleagues do not really help me; I feel terrible.

              yes you should just quit your job considering the fact that you are actually taking anti depressants medicine now!
              
              A job is just a job.  There is no point killing yourself over it.
              
              I have encountered all these before, and I will not take all these nonsense and affect my own well being just to stay on the job.  I will just move on.
              
              Who says a person must stay on the job for 3-4 years?  So long you prove yourself to your potential employer and justify your reason for leaving, you still can find a new job.
              
              For your health sake, please just leave the company.  I am sure if you have the right attitude you can do better elsewhere.

              <p>I do not understand why are you staying on a job that you are not happy with? You can only maximise your potential when you are happy with your job and life. Is it worth to carry on? Think it over......</p>
              <p>The depression you are having is due to your job and it is going to cause more problem for you if you carry on.........issue like health, family, relationship, friends are all going to be affected by your job unhappiness.</p>

              You are showing perseverance and maturity by staying put in a job. Glad that you are putting other considerations like not wanting to be considered a job hopper, shows that you know what you are doing. But after 2 years, no promotion, underappreciated by a nasty boss and under stress, maybe its time to change job. 
              
              At the moment you do not know which job to seek. So suggest you start logging your CV into monster.com and check around to see which job suits you. Don't quit your job just yet, find a job then quit. 
              
              Life is tough dude, if you just quit and stay at home, means you just gave up in life. For this reason you have to withstand the stress before you can find a job.
              
              Interesting that you talk about your self identity. Yeah most people ties their identity to certain intrinsic values, like work, relationships, money and religion. So likely is your problem is that you don't know what meaning is your life. Why? Because you got no objective, no goals and no vision. Probably your vision is to excel at work but work is becoming dull and dread. This is what is causing your depression. This is very common, as I read in newspaper about a guy in Malaysia who has a 10 year relationship with his gf. But when his childhood sweetheart decides to break up with him, all hell broke lose for him because his whole life is her. So his life became meaningless, he murdered her in rage and tried to kill himself. Today he is in a hospital under remand and waiting to be charged for the murder of his girlfriend. So you must decide what is good for yourlife. Don't just live for one objective for your life (like that malaysian dude), in your case is your job. Look for several objectives to live. Like, go seek new friends, go play basketball in the weekends. Do something adventurous. Take up new hobby like photography. Count your blessings, like your family, they love you as a son. 
              
              Medicine is only a temporary solution. You got to find the root cause of your depression. Go talk to a psychologist or get involve in religious activities that can free your soul from the bonds of worldly life. I give you an example. One of my friend, he got frustrated at his job. One day, he found out about this ship that sails around the world to help the poor understand about education. The ship has its own library and reguarly docks ports of major third world countries, so the poor people can come in and read books about the world. He volunteered as a crew with a bunch of foreigners, made up of europeans, americans, australians, asians, africans, etc. After 6 months, he came back, and he felt refreshed. He realised how good his life compared to the poor people of other nations and he was glad he made new friends and found a new refresh way of looking at life also was able to help other less fortunate people.

              Andy, this was written by you within this topic...
              
              How am I paid in comparison with my peers?
              
              " I just want to get a perspective of my salary range. Am I reasonably well-paid or I am underpaid?
              
              I am 28 years old and a degree holder, with about 4 years of full-time work experience, in private education industry, I do both student recruitment and student services.
              
              My take-home pay is 2.4 K, I completely do not have any commissions, but it is still kind of regarded as a â€œsalesâ€� job. My admin work load is very heavy. There is no year-end bonus or AWS, just a Chinese New Year Bonus, the most i can expect to receive is 1.7 months (if I am a top performer and management really like you. I do not expect to receive a good bonus next chinese new year because I recently argued with my boss and I got a warning letter.
              
              The problem is sometimes, people seem to earn more than me. I spoke to one diploma holder in electrical engineering with also about 4 years of working experience and his take-home pay is also 2.4K. Everyone I spoke to says that as a degree holder at the age of 28, I should be at least an assistant manager and making around 4K but that seems to be out of reach
              
              In my first job, I worked there for 1 year 10 months. In my second job, I worked for about 6 months, in my third and current job, I worked about 1 year and 10 months."

              Job hopping is very common among Singaporeans. Most of Singaporeans are job hoppers for good reasons....Better job prospects, better wage, better working hours / environments..etcs. So you are not going to be the only one. So what do you want in your job?

              <p>Job hopping is very common among Singaporeans. Most of
              Singaporeans are job hoppers for good reasons….Better job
              prospects, better wage, better working hours / environments..etcs.
              So you are not going to be the only one. So what do you want in
              your job?</p>

              <p>would you quit a job if you were facing the below situation?</p>
              <p>I have been working very hard in a job for 2 years, and putting
              up with snide and sarcastic remarks from my boss. My boss sometimes
              just scold me.</p>
              <p>I was working very hard hoping for an promotion but did not get
              it. I feel sad because my self-identity is deeply tied into my
              work. Now I am really afraid that i would be passed over for
              promotion.</p>
              <p>I am very unhappy in my work place. I have been taking
              anti-depressants for the past 3 months and even thought of
              committing suicide. I know that I am not a lazy person but my boss
              always aim me. I no longer feel like working hard or doing work for
              which I am not appreciated for. I really find it hard to go work
              every morning.</p>
              <p>I tried hard at work to recruit new students but always get
              marked and scolded.. if I quit, I also don’t know where I can
              go…..</p>
              <p>My parents know I have depressions and taking ant-depressants
              and advise me just to quit my job and take a break</p>
              <p>But I am very afraid that if I do not stay for at least 3-4
              years, in the future, I would be marked as a “job-hopper”. At work
              , my colleagues do not really help me; I feel terrible.</p>

              <p>looking at the complete picture of your working experience, you don't seem to have spent enough time for your boss to think about a promotion, or what have you done to deserve a promotion?</p>
              <p>What exactly is your job that should give you commission? Student recruitment or student enrollment?</p>
              <p>You think you should be assistant manager, but does your boss think? Why do you think others are earning more? you know, some young graduates who are working as financial advisors are earning $10,000 a month, some working as school teachers are no having take home pay more than you do. stop comparing with others, find a job that you enjoy, not just the job that should give you the money you want. Work with your colleagues, and your boss, help them to do well, and don't expect others to help you get promotion.</p>
              <p>If you don't change your attitude, you will never find the right job.</p>

              <p>â€� I just want to get a perspective of my salary range. Am I

              <p>I am 28 years old and a degree holder, with about 4 years of
              full-time work experience, in private education industry, I do both

              <p>My take-home pay is 2.4 K, I completely do not have any
              commissions, but it is still kind of regarded as a â€œsalesâ€� job. My
              admin work load is very heavy. There is no year-end bonus or
              <span class="">AWS</span>, just a Chinese New Year Bonus, the most
              i can expect to receive is 1.7 months (if I am a top performer and
              management really like you. I do not expect to receive a good bonus
              next chinese new year because I recently argued with my boss and I
              got a warning letter.</p>
              <p>The problem is sometimes, people seem to earn more than me. I
              spoke to one diploma holder in electrical engineering with also
              about 4 years of working experience and his take-home pay is also
              2.4K. Everyone I spoke to says that as a degree holder at the age
              of 28, I should be at least an assistant manager and making around
              4K but that seems to be out of reach</p>
              <p>In my first job, I worked there for 1 year 10 months. In my

              I am doing student recruitment. For nearly the entire industry, everybody is getting commission.
              
              I also took up a lot of projects to manage and coordinate.
              
              
              I never expected anybody to help me get a promotion, all along. I already stated my work experience at the beginning of my post. And nearly all other people I have spoken to say I am lagging very far behind

                              <p>But just to clarify, we all hope for something in life. People
              want different things in life. For me, my self-identity is deeply
              tied in with my work, I have very little to show for in life,
              except for my work. My self-worth is determined by my career. So
              now that my career is not doing well, I feel quite sad.</p>

              Career show your self-worth? That is only a job. Right now I see you experiencing inferior complexity. Is that it or am I wrong?
