            <div class='col-md body'>Hello heaven,<br><br>Though I am single, but i think i can understand what you r feeling and going through now. Age, to a ger esp, is a major obstruction in a relation. To make things worst, u hear nags from yr parent often, and there nothing much u can do cos its not yr fault at all.<br><br>Think the problem lies with yr hubby. To a ger, being in the late 20s is defintiely not young oredi but to a guy, he may not feel it. Actually frankly speaking i don't think u have much choice but to sit down and have a heart to heart talk with him, even if u 2 have to end up quarrelling. Stress to him, make him realise the importance of a custom wedding, just like what u told us in yr posts. Make him understand yr fear such as yr age, and insecure he have given u so far.<br><br>This may sound silly but worst to worst, CRY in front of him, or at the very least shed a few tears let him see  :p. Think most guys' heart will soften upon a ger's tears. So he might just give in. Who knows rite?<br><br>Hope my advice come in handy in a way or another. All the best and take care.

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree wif wat atti said to have a heart to heart tok wif him. But try to focus the topic to wat's on his mind?? like y he has such a tot?? I mean it will make him feel important and he will be more likely to say things becoz it's all abt him. (Com'on lahz. all of us have a selfish side lahz. we all usually think of ourselves. See photo also look for ur own face first lahz. anyone who can tell me he/she dun do that??)<br><br>Anyway back to the topic, being able to understand him and that way he thinks... Wait for him to completewat he wants to say and not argue, coz if u r to rebute, there goes the whole effort.. there will be no stop and it wun solve the prob.. it will be good try to give him a little space to breathe after u have listen to him.. compromise a little... will make him feel happier... then tell him ur position...<br><br>Hope i'm of help... and do keep us updated... coz we are really concerned<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>=========================<br><br>()""()<br>( 'o' )<br>(,) (,)<br>(.)_(.)<br>~.~.~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I do belong to the category of disfavouring of going through customary marriages. But was convinced to do so by my parent.<br><br>U must let your husband know that such customary marriages are to give a woman status. Although we are living in the 21st century, most of our parents' mindset is still stuck in the 20th century. Without a proper customary marriage, there is no status for the woman.</div>
