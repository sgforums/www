But there isn't enough evidence to conclude that the girl fabio9999 is with is someone like this.... Don't jump to conclusions so easily... You'll only make this boy's mind wanders even more....</div>

You CERTAINLY CAN choose to accept her rather than trying to change her.... But no promise that the odds would be any higher.... Moreover, the problem probably doesn't lies with her anyway...? It's YOU.... And Your LONELINESS that makes you want to have a partner as company.... Why not you try working with yourself 1st...? How much do you really understand yourself mentally...? If you don't even know who you are and you can't even accept yourself by knowing truly who you are, there's little doubt as to why the girl ain't convinced too....<br><br>Of course, you can also choose to go through what most everybody else might have gone through... Acceptance of your love for her faithfully and suffer in silence... Blah blah blah.... The THING is... You don't necessarily have to go through that... It's probably the fact that your hormones are playing the tricks on you.. Or it could also be your personal life-style... Try changing your life-style and do some self-exploration on your mind.... The rest probably have to wait for now... Not like it's gonna do you much help if you rest on into a relationship now without any experience or sense of awarenessness about yourself anyway...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guesss you give yourself some more time, although it might be testing being together having your "kind of Problem".  Exceptance and adapt would be the better choice, afterall, 2 people sharing life together like husband and wife has their woes too, let alone bf/gf.  You may really need to talk to her about it, else as many said, its tough and hard, never know what would happen.  But patience and having a clear view of what you intend to do if you really want to except and tolerate.... reflect upon your thought over times as you may tend to sway due to circumstances, then you turn away from her if you are not steadfast enough to still firm.<br><br>When I 1st met my wife, some what similar to your case, but don't seems to be couple whenever we were together as I simply carry on just like my norm (my SELF, EGO) and often ignored her and her request as she thought she should act as one since she think I had excepted her (but I am not very sure, just find her nice to be with and want to be with her when she is not around), feel very restraint by her and can't do what I used to do, wanted her to be away from me,  but really the initial problem was me. just not matured enough to think that way.<br><br>Changed her? that's what I thought, went through a painful, hard knocks giving her 2 years  to get things changed.  Of course, she never do anything, but I was the one pushing/planning to get things my way hoping in the process, I could change her.  It was so difficuilt and I almost gave up.  In fact, at the end of 2 yrs, I told her, she just missed my target, she was sad, but since I had set the time frame, I kind of feel sad if I let go the effort  I had put through because of this, since there were some results, it means I can do more to change her.  Anyway, Its not about changing, I think I would regret now if I changed her the way she is, it means she conform to your idea.  WAIT!! if that's the case, when U are bored with that, than what would U do? change her again?  certainly not. As I look back, in some ways, I was also influenced by her trying to change her the way I think should be.  I also learn to adapt to her short coming and adjusted to the each other's life style we both lived in the process.  Seriously, both our characters the opposite. something I never thought would be possible when I started, but had it not be or my 2 yrs trying and then, perseverence, I think I won't be what I am.<br><br>So think about it carefully, take sometime off to think and may be take it easy and possibly if it is real, considers each other short coming and action that makes you feel the way you think.  fyi, my wfie then, was very possessive type, so can you imagine how sticky she was to me, even more contraints and obstruction to my freedom.<br><br>"No point changing things around if you can't, you can't change anybody &amp; everybody in this world, and what makes you think you won't change too, we are all evolving, you change to suit something, but that something might change to suit anohter, so we co-exist and live in harmony"  ...thinkg about it.</div>
