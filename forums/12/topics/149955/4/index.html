Most registered pharmacist jobs require at least a degree at entry level -- a diploma would probably get him an assistant position, but that's about it.<br><br>He may be tired of studying right now, and can't wait to work after serving his National Service, but you'd never know if he changes his mind after two years in the army. Many young Singaporeans hated studying when they were students, but a few years in the work force with their limited qualifications, and they'd usually think of further education, part-time or otherwise.</div>
