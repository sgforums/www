He tell you something, but somehow, nothing is told.<br><br>He seemed empty; both spiritually and in reality, with no proper interest that he could work for and no goal to achieve. His life seemed to be very receptive to what-comes...comes - the typical kind of young Singaporean behaviour we are having these days, who doesn't know what they want and expect for themselves.<br><br>He probably realise this by now, but lack the wisdom to go about doing it or at least find the answers he want. As a result, he returned to his usual lifestyle, delaying the realization and enlightenment that is necessary for him in his world of games. Each day, the burden of 'how now?' gets onto his mind and he became frustrated.<br><br>***<br><br>If you want to know what is he really thinking, my advice is to open up yourself FIRST through a sibling talk and later try to induce those hidden suppression out. You may like to talk about something... say your views on your own future and such. One good way to get someone to open up is to open up yourself first... this will put a influence on the other party to response and talk.<br><br>If nothing works, you may like to introduce him to some new things in life. Say get involve with Church or something. Redirecting the mind is very important, especially if you want to change the way of life and mindset. Before one can change, the mind has to evolve first. His lack of experience in life and personal resistance might reject your attempt to introduce... so you probably have to talk your way out... to get him out of his chair occasionally and indulge in something else other than just plain games.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

It is so hard to find a solution if you do not know what the problem is.<br><br>also about his friends, are you aware of them doing anything nasty or bad to him? because i am aware that there are some people who stick with a group of people, call them friends, but they always just bully that one person.<br><br>if your brother wants to have any friends at all, and the only type of people around him are narrow-minded, then i guess it is time to make other friends, search for greener pasture. if narrow-minded people is all he have around him, then if he really wants friends, he has to accept the fact that he is different from them and he has no choice but to befriend the narrow-minded people that he dislikes. i hope i helped a little</div>
