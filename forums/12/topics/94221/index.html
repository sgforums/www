The reason why you are tired or burnt out could be that you are focusing too much on your studies and neglecting to eat well / sleep well / exercise etc.<br><br>If you can afford it, take some time off to recharge before hitting the books again. Go catch a movie, go jogging, catch up with friends etc.  It might help you relax a little.<br><br>Life should not always be about studying for good grades only ...

Just understand that there's a time for work... And there's a time for PLAY... There are books available in the market and library to help you change your mindset... Source for them...<br><br>Balance your personal interest and try to live a healthier life style... Only when you're content with your personal life would you be able to perform better in your academic ones...<br><br>And understand that life is not all about 'performance' and 'efficiency' alone... If that's the case, might as well we just live as 'Energizer batteries'...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
