              <p>im actually quite troubled over this relationship &amp; wanna get some response from more people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i
              have been with this guy since last year april on my bday. we started
              off underground till a period of time whereby a guy keep chasing after
              me &amp; i gt abit irritated, we decide to let our relationship be
              known. as time goes by, he treats me better and better. we stayed tgt
              for a period of time when i leave my hse for some personal reasons. our
              r/s is kinda strong thru all thick &amp; thin, but im more emotional at
              that point of time as im still quite insecured &amp; all.</p>
              <p>until
              he got into NS, he somehow changed due to the environment he is in, and
              he wanted more freedom &amp; time with his NS friends. there was a
              conversation we were in and im kinda upset cos i tot he always
              understand how i felt (&amp; he really understands me v well,
              everytime.) im super hurt &amp; starts to drift away, &amp; moved to
              another friend's hse. den we ended up like silent break(ard nov last
              yr).</p>
              <p>this yr around feb we got back in contact, ive grown to be
              more matured &amp; after so long, i realised tt i still loves him
              deeply, so i tried to salvage the r/s back. but he gone thru hurt tt
              time &amp; he also think thru alot, knowing what he wants more is
              freedom and everything else has more priority to r/s now. so no matter
              what i do, how i can touched him till he cries, also he refuses to
              patch.(however while he refuses to patch, when we are alone, he still
              hugs me, kiss me, and sometimes even like sex. he still treats me
              nicely, trying to be there when i need him.)</p>
              <p>but once a third
              party is around, he will fall back to like a normal friend, i feel
              super depressed after everytime we met due to this. and its like hot
              &amp; cold,</p>
              <p>until one day (after we didnt meet for 3wks due to
              his NS), when he has been consistently nice to me for th whole wkend, i
              cried again, cos i dunoe when this will end and all. i told him all
              these and said i dunoe how to response to ppl when they asked abt our
              r/s(cos 1 fren actually saw him hug me,den i impossible say frens only
              rite). he somehow like ask me to be with him again.</p>
              <p>i noe that
              being together again this time wun be totally the same already cos of
              his shift in priorties and all. but i dunoe whether he still loves me.
              cos like other den his family, nobody else really noes, and he didnt
              really treat me like before, i felt like he didnt cared about me
              sometimes like the period of time whereby we arent considered so called
              BGF. im sad, but i dun dare to bring across again, cos i believe that
              will further stress him or might make him regret. =(</p>
              <p>what should i do? or how can i make him treats me like before?</p>
              <p>&amp; any idea what can we do if a guy has alot more priorities &amp; you are at the bottom of the list?</p>

              <p>Frankly, it is an uphill task to regain what u 'think' u have lost or re-experience what was then.</p>
              <p>Unwittingly u acquiesced to whatever transpired between the both of u.</p>
              <p>To think that he alone is responsible for these state of affairs and the present predicament that u are in - in short,  is simply passing the buck!</p>
              <p>Perhaps it is neediness as opposed to love that as lulled u into assuming that all is hunky dory till now.</p>
              <p>I would only suggest this lar - unlearn what has been drilled into u that love is ... , life is .... happiness is ... and fulfil yourself from WITHIN, ie, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">self</span>-love,<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> self</span>-respect, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">self</span>-esteem and ... .</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Self-acceptance</span> is essential for love to bloom. Love starts with self-love. Instead of being selfish one can be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">self-full</span> (fulfilled in ....love,acceptance, respect,esteem, reponsibility ....).</p>
              <p>Always, acceptance creates the milieu for love to grow.</p>
              <p> Also, a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>porous</em></span> ego and a little foolishness to make mistakes and a little wisdom to avoid past errors would go a long way.</p>

              <p>&amp; any idea what can we do if a guy has alot more priorities &amp; you are at the bottom of the list?</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> The condition of how this relationship began wasn't exactly beneficial to its long term growth. Even if you did not explicitly state why this burgeoning relationship had to first exist in an 'underground' state - it subtly reveals a sort of love difficulty, smelling like that I would call a 'Neptune-affliction'. </p>
              <p>The transitory cohabitation you had with him had a parallel reality; I will explain a little and then you might gradually form a logical portrait of your own circumstances beyond your current POV.      </p>
              <p>People leave/run away from their home for all sorts of reasons. The problem in leaving their household is not about leaving their parents per se - it's the instability that the situation carries with the person that makes him/her vulnerable. Hence naturally at first sign of trouble, you would seek shelter from your ex-boyfriend, because he is probably your next safe haven. </p>
              <p>But what is probably unanticipated is that you would subconsciously be coerced to appease whatever situation or state your relationship is at, simply because you needed a place to stay. Although sex is almost assured on the bargaining plate, but seriously, it is more than just being physical. You are now stuck with a greater quagmire - the prospect of losing your relationship and finding another place to stay, if he should dump you for whatever reasons.     </p>
              <p>You claimed that you were perpetually insecure. So what would you do to manage this? Of course it would be you suppressing your conflicts and giving in into his requests - sexual or not. I do not deny that women do have her own sexual needs and it would be unfair to say that only the man wants it. But should the notion of sex be more prominent in your situation, this is subconsciously one methodology that your unstable emotion employed itself to 'stabilize' your insecurity through the physical exchange, in hoping that he will stay true, while you still enjoy roof security over your head.    </p>
              <p>In simple, you have little mobility in your choice of actions.</p>
              <p>The 'freedom' excuse he had conveniently cited is almost like saying 'I had enough of sex-at-home routine - I need life outside you for a change'. Now that change has happened, obviously he do missed the sex-at-home routine. The 'checking-back-on-you' strategy is just a facade for another possible occasion for sex, should it arise.</p>
              <p>Why do I say that?</p>
              <p>As much as you would like to think that you been through a lot of emotional times with him, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">it's more of how much you needed him than he needed you in reality</span></strong>. You see, he could effectively survive through his love life rather uneventfully, even without your presence. If there are drastic differences between his attitude towards you in private and in presence of a third party, I will explain this discrepancy in a brutally honest manner:</p>
              <p>I) He needs the title of being 'single', so as to be 'socially eligible' in our society that values monogamy, to date other girls without being branded as a bastard.</p>
              <p>II) He is exceptional nice to you in private because he has a hidden agenda and he doesn't want to reveal to anybody, in any ways. Basically he wants to avoid putting himself in situation where he would be 'questioned' by another person. No question hence no answer needed</p>
              <p>He reason for his refusal to patch back is simple. I will be equally brutal here:</p>
              <p><em>"Why do I need to get back with her and shoulder the responsibility of a boyfriend when I can <strong>still</strong> get intimacy WITHOUT having to shoulder this responsibility? Surely, there are less sex, but there is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">STILL</span> sex."</em></p>
              <p>Then what's his way of keeping you? Yes! It is the hot-cold treatment! <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Being ambiguous is the key to prevent you from walking away completely, yet distant enough to deter you from coming too near.</span></strong> You are trapped in this cloud of confusion, so dense that you couldn't even maneuver. Hence remaining stationary is the perfect position for milking and emotional exploitation.  </p>
              <p>P.S: Your man seemed to display a tendency of being involved in a sub-rosa relationship. Somehow, he seemed to prefer a double life in aspect of his love relationship and is probably karmically linked to a Neptune affliction.</p>
              <p>You need to get hold of your life in general and not seek for this anchor in your past relationship; you will find none in this illusion of grandeur. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>im actually quite troubled over this relationship &amp; wanna
                              get some response from more people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i have been with this guy since last year april on my bday. we
                              started off underground till a period of time whereby a guy keep
                              chasing after me &amp; i gt abit irritated, we decide to let our
                              relationship be known. as time goes by, he treats me better and
                              better. we stayed tgt for a period of time when i leave my hse for
                              some personal reasons. our r/s is kinda strong thru all thick &amp;
                              thin, but im more emotional at that point of time as im still quite
                              insecured &amp; all.</p>
              <p>until he got into NS, he somehow changed due to the environment
                              he is in, and he wanted more freedom &amp; time with his NS
                              friends. there was a conversation we were in and im kinda upset cos
                              i tot he always understand how i felt (&amp; he really understands
                              me v well, everytime.) im super hurt &amp; starts to drift away,
                              &amp; moved to another friend's hse. den we ended up like silent
                              break(ard nov last yr).</p>
              <p>this yr around feb we got back in contact, ive grown to be more
                              matured &amp; after so long, i realised tt i still loves him
                              deeply, so i tried to salvage the r/s back. but he gone thru hurt
                              tt time &amp; he also think thru alot, knowing what he wants more
                              is freedom and everything else has more priority to r/s now. so no
                              matter what i do, how i can touched him till he cries, also he
                              refuses to patch.(however while he refuses to patch, when we are
                              alone, he still hugs me, kiss me, and sometimes even like sex. he
                              still treats me nicely, trying to be there when i need him.)</p>
              <p>but once a third party is around, he will fall back to like a
                              normal friend, i feel super depressed after everytime we met due to
                              this. and its like hot &amp; cold,</p>
              <p>until one day (after we didnt meet for 3wks due to his NS), when
                              he has been consistently nice to me for th whole wkend, i cried
                              again, cos i dunoe when this will end and all. i told him all these
                              and said i dunoe how to response to ppl when they asked abt our
                              r/s(cos 1 fren actually saw him hug me,den i impossible say frens
                              only rite). he somehow like ask me to be with him again.</p>
              <p>i noe that being together again this time wun be totally the
                              same already cos of his shift in priorties and all. but i dunoe
                              whether he still loves me. cos like other den his family, nobody
                              else really noes, and he didnt really treat me like before, i felt
                              like he didnt cared about me sometimes like the period of time
                              whereby we arent considered so called BGF. im sad, but i dun dare
                              to bring across again, cos i believe that will further stress him
                              or might make him regret. =(</p>

                              before?</p>
              <p>&amp; any idea what can we do if a guy has alot more priorities

              <p>maybe it's time to start thinking about what u want and how u want to be treated. why? because he's already made it clear to u about:</p>
              <p>u being the least of his priorities</p>
              <p>not wanting to be in a r/s at this point</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em><strong>if a guy has a lot more priorities and u are at the bottom of his list, </strong></em>start developing ur own priorities as well. stop looking at his list. start looking at ur own list.</p>
              <p>always look at ur own list because to begin with, ur list is always more important than anybody else's.</p>
              <p>more importantly, since he's already made his stand, everything else that transpires between the both of u, including exchange of emotions &amp; physical intimacy is now "ni qing wo yuan"... for u and for him.</p>
              <p>telling u he doesn't want to be in a r/s with u is his "get out of jail card". i doubt he'll be there to shoulder the burden or blame should anything unsavory happen. </p>
              <p>u're on ur own girl. and it's not so bad!</p>
              <p>because there are 1,692,817 males between the age of 15-64 in Singapore. minus the ah ceks, the homosexuals, the salah ones, the bad ones, the evil ones etc, there's still huge pool out there to pick and choose from. y get bent out of shape for the 1 lousy guy out of the so many okay, so so, and fantabuloso guys in Singapore?  </p>
              <p><em><strong>what u should do?</strong></em> just like what yunhaier said, getting hold of ur life is the way out of this quagmire. don't depend on him for the happiness and laughter u deserve.</p>
              <p>ur life is ur life.</p>
              <p>his life is his life.</p>
              <p>no one is responsible for either one of u.</p>
              <p>u can go to school, learn archery, find new social circle, watch District 9 with ur friends, read ernest hemingway, go taka and shop, get a new ipod, buy a skirt from topshop and make urself pretty, run in the rain, go for a jog at the reservoir. so many things u can do... </p>
              <p>y waste all ur youth, emotions, time and effort on a guy who doesn't even like u enough to give u the basic love and affection u need?</p>
              <p>please ignore him. for all u know, when u ignore him and gain ur life back, he'll come to realise what he's missing out on.</p>
              <p>but too bad for him, by then u'll realise u deserve much better.</p>
              <p>let Time do its work but first, u must move away from this toxic r/s and stop being dependent on him for ur emotional needs. u can do it! u can be trouble free! and problem free!</p>

              <p>As much as you would like to think that you been through a lot of emotional times with him, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">it's more of how much you needed him than he needed you in reality</span></strong>. You see, he could effectively survive through his love life rather uneventfully, even without your presence. If there are drastic differences between his attitude towards you in private and in presence of a third party, I will explain this discrepancy in a brutally honest manner:</p>
              <p><strong>I<em><strong>) He needs the title of being 'single', so as to be 'socially eligible' in our society that values monogamy, to date other girls without being branded as a bastard</strong>.</em></strong></p>
              <p><em><strong>II) He is exceptional nice to you in private because he has a hidden agenda and he doesn't want to reveal to anybody, in any ways.</strong></em> Basically he wants to avoid putting himself in situation where he would be 'questioned' by another person. No question hence no answer needed</p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p>(...)</p>
              <p>Then what's his way of keeping you? Yes! It is <strong>the hot-cold treatment</strong>! <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Being ambiguous is the key to prevent you from walking away completely, yet distant enough to deter you from coming too near.</span></strong> You are trapped in this cloud of confusion, so dense that you couldn't even maneuver. Hence remaining stationary is the perfect position for milking and emotional exploitation.  </p>

              <p>do all these include..not letting anyone (not even the friends) know the gf's existence even though he promised her his whole heart when they got together?does it also include a sudden change in tone in messages and giving excuses not to meet up?</p>

              <p>actually after that day's conversation, he asked me if i wanna be with him.</p>
              <p>after which, he did intro to me to his family as his gf, but i can somehow feel its different as how it is from the past. i wished to know whether he purposely wanted to be cold so that i wouldnt be relying him so much or he doesnt have to be ALWAYS there for me when i needed him, or what does it means.</p>
              <p>we seriously have gone through alot, and i dare say that he's the one that understands me the most, thus i don't really believe that he's such a bastard to only want sex from me.</p>
              <p>is there anything that i can do to maybe test his love? or what can i do to make things be the same again?</p>

              <p>he's not someone that will like give excuses not to meet or anything, most prob he will just say how he feels. and yes, his tone of sms-es is different, last time he used to express his affection alot, but not really now.</p>
              <p>hmm he's like selectively some friends is ok to know but not all. like his family &amp; our religious group he's ok to let them noe but his other friends, i feel that he dont really wanna let them noe about us. eg, facebook in a r/s with part, he didnt acknowledge tt part, or sometimes when i tag him in some photos, it will appear on his profile pg, he remove th notice on his profile pg.</p>

              <p>Ms. Troubled,</p>
              <p>He has grown up, changed and evolved from his past.</p>
              <p>Can the relationship ever be the same as before ? No.</p>
              <p>You need to look forward, not backwards.</p>
              <p>His inability to openly admits the relationship hurts your self-esteem. You wonder if you are not good enough for him to be proud of you. What you seek is <strong>validation</strong>. That is something he is not ready to give you, as he is keeping his option open.</p>
              <p>He is still wondering if there is a better gal out there more deserving of his love and commitment.</p>
