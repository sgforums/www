The cert just provides more security to the vow. Likewise, a person can vow all that, but only for material gains, and not abiding by those vows.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </blockquote>What happens when the couple wishes to start a family? Or when a new family member comes along unexpectedly?<br><br>Marriage is the outward expression of a commitment -- commitment towards an internal arrangement between two people to live together and to start a family. It may seem a formality, but a formality that seals and strengthens the commitment nonetheless.<br><br>And there are too many irresponsible people out there for us to let such an important commitment be built on verbal vows, mere words promising dreams of happy ends, freely given in moments of lust and passion and just as easily forgotten once the heat abates.</div>
