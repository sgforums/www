              <p>Wow, love that dominates - in other words , its not love lar-

              <p>To think that by stating what is rite for u and rite for her -

              Phyrric victory. When one has to work on a marriage- know jolly
              well - that the downslide has inexorably begun - the march to
              oblivion or the journey to ...</p>
              <p>Love – when it is a friendly fragrance (loving) in which no one
              is superior, in which no one decides ‘things’, in which both
              understand and are cognizant of the fact that they are different
              (personalities with individualities behind the social masks), that
              both their approach towards life is different, that they think
              differently, and still, with all these differences, they love each
              other and yet allow space to evolve without encroaching, without
              possessing .. without the need to behave or even extract promises
              for tomorrow – both would remain a mystery unto themselves, and
              when the journey and the goal is one – its an existential
              experience, subjective and yet never dull or certain. It is akin to
              a river flowing and yet everfresh!</p>
              <p>Please, intuitively, this is what i feel - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">both of u are lacking
              within</span> - and no matter what u do or say, or acquire - 
              its window-dressing!</p>

              <p>Well, i dont know what balance sheet u are ...  when two people are loving and presupposing they are SELF-fulfilled and not 'other'-fulfillled - the question of rt/wrong or balancing is no longer relevant. One shares, cos one is overflowing, as opposed to ....... one seeks, one demands ...</p>
              <p>However, when one is lacking within -  my meaning here is self-love, self-respect, self-esteem - one is going to be a psychological/emotional burden (though not consciously).</p>
              <p>Too many people have confused eg . self- love with other-love = love that emanates from within one's being is always a fountain, an everspring. however, other'love  seeks out another and fills up one's void within and rationalizes that it is self-love.</p>
              <p>Two individuals (not personalities (are social masks)) evolve and when one is cognizant of this aspect - it does not matter whether its in a marriage or relationship ----- one intuitively responds to the situation at hand.</p>
              <p>Two beings can have a human experience in a marriage, relationship. It is the QUALITY OF relating that adds to ....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Two wolves (being, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">INNER landscape</span>) reside in each of us, the first is needs, fears, beliefs, jealousy, sympathy,possesivness, insecurity, fear of loss , anger, prejudice, <em>always reacts</em> ... the second is love, kindness, emphaty , gratitude, <em>always responds</em>.</p>
              <p>The one that is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fed daily</span> evolves - whom are u feeding, even as u are reading it now?</p>
              <p>Both is love - but with a <strong>BIG</strong> difference:</p>
              <p>the first is ego- based <span style="text-decoration: underline;">personality</span>! - it eventually suffocates and kills (accidental/periphery) - the bird is always trying to take off, but wings are always clipped - cos love is  bondage here - the giving here is to take back - what is one sharing- complaining, whining, ....</p>
              <p>the second is soul-infused <span style="text-decoration: underline;">individualit</span>y! - it is everflowing abundance (essential/centre), it is a bird on a wing - one wing is love, and the other is freedom - love is freeing - the giving here is simply sharing what one is, appreciating what IS</p>
              <p>The predicament of many is that they search and desire answers on all four quarters when the answers are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within</span>; what is missing is the essential, the accidental - aplenty!</p>
              <p>The above is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">expansive</span> - not <span style="text-decoration: underline;">confined to relationships or marriage</span> but other areas of one's daily ... and what have you.</p>
              <p>This is my experience observation and understanding, that's all</p>
              <p>Superimposed on a circle - one can only understand and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">transcend</span>, one cannot improve on a circle!</p>
              <p>The first ripple .... watch and ....</p>
              <p>This is BEYOND psychology!</p>
              <p>Lest its miscontrued, i m not against marriage or .. its the LACK WITHIN that i opine</p>

              <p>1) maybe ur not speaking her language of love?</p>
              <p>lang of love: words of affirmation, acts of service, gifts, quality time, physical touch</p>
              <p>Most people will have 1 or 2 dominant ones.</p>
              <p>whats ur lang of love ? whats hers ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) some girls like their man to be 'stronger', take the lead and not give in to her all the time. Maybe it's a good idea to sit down with her and ask what does she really want from the relationship and tell her what you want. Settle in the middle ? Communication is key.</p>

              <p>Well the word love is often used so promiscuiously that there can be many interpretations i think if u love in the correct sense there shouldnt be anything wrong</p>
              <p>Loving by giving Plenty of attention to the individual - there is no such thing as too much, that is, of course respecting boundaries</p>
              <p>'Loving' by texting too often and infantisizing her (not respecting boundaries) will cause the relationship to be strained</p>
              <p>Even though marriage is a union of 2 people i still think there should be clear boundaries. Maybe your 'loving' is invading into her personal space i dont know but it is worth looking at</p>

              <p>1) maybe ur not speaking her language of love?</p>
              <p>lang of love: words of affirmation, acts of service, gifts, quality time, physical touch</p>
              <p>Most people will have 1 or 2 dominant ones.</p>
              <p>whats ur lang of love ? whats hers ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) some girls like their man to be 'stronger', take the lead and not give in to her all the time. Maybe it's a good idea to sit down with her and ask what does she really want from the relationship and tell her what you want. Settle in the middle ? Communication is key.</p>

              <p>Lemontea, i c u have been reading that new book . Very interesting &amp; informative.</p>
              <p>Yep, Pappy, no harm in u taking a look at it..&amp; ya, if u give in to her all the time, she might have no respect for u?</p>
              <p>It's hard to have an equal partnership without respect-it'll just go downhill...&amp; r u happy anyway always giving in to her wishes? U don't sound so actually..</p>
              <p>No point trying to give to her if you feel resentful - u deserve to take too!!</p>
              <p>Ya, TALK to her.</p>
              <p>Do let us know the outcome, ya <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>u make it sound so simple that a 10yr old kid can understand.</p>
              <p>but i wonder why itis so hard to follow it through...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like most kids said, adlut like to complicate stuffs, making it confusing and often, we end up lossing focuse of the goals over trivial fights.</p>

              <p>i guess going back to basic might help setting thing straight.</p>

              <p> Well... I don't want anyone to judge me having no respect for my wife. So I won't mention anything more than what I already mention (thought my hand itches to =3).</p>
              <p> Take care guys! And also very lively forum, I like it here especially the you know which section, although it doesn't have what I thought it has in there.</p>
