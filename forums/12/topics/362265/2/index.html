              <p>Bro. Be yourself. Whats yours, is yours. Whats not meant to be, never shall be.</p>
              <p>She's disturbed, ask her why. She's annoyed, ask her why. She's irritated, ask her why. And dun bother "solving" her problems, because she darn well can settle it herself. She just needs a listening ear.</p>
              <p>Goodluck, and chill out. Sensitivity in guys are appreciated, but never cross the line. Where's the line? you decide it for yourself.</p>

              <p>@mancha: I didn't realize I am talking behind her back. At least I am not gossiping about her or is this already considered so? I am not so sure...</p>

              <p>Anyway, thanks for everyone's time. The reason for her behaviour is far from what I have feared to be. I hope this very vague answer wouldn't be considered talking behind her back.</p>

              <p>Well.. you did tell her she can get her own car.. did you not ?</p>
              <p>If it's a family car shared between the both of you.. then it is logical for you to have your personal input and share the decision making process.</p>
              <p> You don't have to keep pleasing her.. you just need to stop insulting her.</p>
              <p>I'm just telling you how you can please a woman because I am a woman myself.</p>
              <p>If accepting your personal input in the decision process for buying her car most pleases you.. then it is important you let her know of your needs too.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you are unhappy because you have a dominating streak ?</p>

              <p>I understand that men typically wants to have their say in family affairs.</p>
              <p>But I gota warn you though.. there are some areas that a woman will perceive as more important to them. If you try to dominate every aspect of the family life.. you will be unceremoniously kicked out to sleep on the couch.</p>
              <p>Identify which area is most important to you and ask that she respects your decision on these areas.</p>
              <p>And likewise.. you must also let her dominate some part of your marriage/family which matters to her most.</p>

              <p>Wow, love that dominates - in other words , its not love lar- sth else masquerading as love lor - that is the crux of all these 'problems' that u are faced with now.</p>
              <p>It is more like mutual ego-gratification - at least that is what it has degenerated into.</p>
              <p>To think that by stating what is rite for u and rite for her - (is divisive)one is caught in the game of rite/wrong.</p>
              <p>At the end of it all - no-one would emerge a winner, at most a Phyrric victory. When one has to work on a marriage- know jolly well - that the downslide has inexorably begun - the march to oblivion or the journey to ...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Love – when it is a friendly fragrance (loving) in which no one is superior, in which no one decides ‘things’, in which both understand and are cognizant of the fact that they are different (personalities with individualities behind the social masks), that both their approach towards life is different, that they think differently, and still, with all these differences, they love each other and yet allow space to evolve without encroaching, without possessing .. without the need to behave or even extract promises for tomorrow – both would remain a mystery unto themselves, and when the journey and the goal is one – its an existential experience, subjective and yet never dull or certain. It is akin to a river flowing and yet everfresh!</p>
              <p>Please, intuitively, this is what i feel - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">both of u are lacking within</span> - and no matter what u do or say, or acquire -  its window-dressing!</p>
