              <p>Hello! I am a first-timer here, nice to meet all of you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My issue with my loved one is that I gave her too much attention, how is that bad?</p>
              <p>From the threads I see here, what I have been doing for my wife is absolutely something girls have been wishing for themselves.</p>
              <p>From the first day I married her which is approximately a year ago, I have changed my way to suit her better. I don't restrict her or anything. She wants her own car, I let her choose what she wants of course with some added sighs from my part.</p>
              <p>What I think may be the problem is, my spouse just gotten tired of me? I talked to my mum for her advice on this thing, and she agreed with me. Should I give my spouse more breathing room? I don't know what's the issue with girl's.</p>
              <p>Girl's complain and complain and complain, from my grandmother to my wife, I woudn't want a daughter next.</p>

              <p>YESYES! That's what I thought too. 1 year and you are tired of me. The hell?</p>
              <p>HAHAHA!</p>
              <p>If that's really the case though, I would really be saddened, because I really love her. Since our marriage, she had been my motivation to work hard.</p>
              <p>So this should illustrate how much I love her.</p>
              <p>Anyway, thanks Fantagf. I would try to start a dialogue with her later. Can't mess with family politic.</p>

              <p>and its a fact that some girls still stick to their boyfriends

              <p>Hello! I am a first-timer here, nice to meet all of you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My issue with my loved one is that I gave her too much attention, how is that bad?</p>
              <p>From the threads I see here, what I have been doing for my wife is absolutely something girls have been wishing for themselves.</p>
              <p>From the first day I married her which is approximately a year ago, I have changed my way to suit her better. I don't restrict her or anything. She wants her own car, I let her choose what she wants of course with some added sighs from my part.</p>
              <p>What I think may be the problem is, my spouse just gotten tired of me? I talked to my mum for her advice on this thing, and she agreed with me. Should I give my spouse more breathing room? I don't know what's the issue with girl's.</p>
              <p>Girl's complain and complain and complain, from my grandmother to my wife, I woudn't want a daughter next.</p>
