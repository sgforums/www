            <div class='col-md body'>I fully understand how u feel.I'm also in the same situation as u.I withdrew from my course(DIP in Info-Comm) at TP in november due to the lack of interest(and i seriously hate engineering and engineering maths).I don't know how i manage to pass my modules and my lecturers tried to persuade me to stay on.<br><br>This year i tried to apply for courses and they told me that i being a ex-poly student will be given the last priority for all choices.In the end i ended up with no courses at all!I'm also from normal stream and i bought a laptop too for my course.My only choice left is to go NS first before going to SIM to take my business management course.<br><br>This could be a little off but it's to let u know that u're not out there alone with this kinda problem.I think what u should do now is to sit and think properly what course u're interested in and decide whether u want to serve NS first or wait till next year for the next JAE.<br><br>All the best to ur future endeavours and keep me posted if possible.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What is it about the youngsters now? Last time, we never had such people amongst our classmates.<br><br>It was either you did what your folks wanted, get shunted off to Law or Medicine or Engineering, do well, and explore your own path after that. Or you stopped dillydallying and decided what you wanted, maybe against the wishes of your folks and just went ahead, did it well to prove them wrong..<br><br>I'm not trying to be callous or what-not, but I think the threadstarter needs to look at his own attitude and realise how well his mom has treated him with regards to his education.There are children out there who would love to enter a poly and further their education.<br><br>Is it just me, or does every teen today look for instant self-gratification and not be bothered to delve deeper into a subject they initially chose. Then, choosing to crap and whine because they felt they were given the short end of the stick.<br><br>Think it about it.If you didn't like it, you should have made a choice and stuck with it.The lesson here is that you made your bed, and now you have to live with it. I suggest you take the remainder of your time to decide what course you want.Go and read up on the curriculum and the internship/OJT prospects, not to mention industry trends. Don't just walk into a course because all your friends are there, or that the course is glamourous etc..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
