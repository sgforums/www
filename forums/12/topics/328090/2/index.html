              <p>Generally, it is not advisable to start an office romance. It is not encouraged and many discouraging stories have been flying off the rack to have (I supposed) called your attention to this supposed "code red" romance.</p>
              <p>However, I have a cousin, and she met her boyfriend at her office. They even went for company trip together in Korea last year and may be planning to get married next year. They've been together for about two years so far (I asked her). I'm not sure whether she has seen his side of relatives, but I met her boyfriend this year when she brought him to our grandfather's birthday gathering.</p>
              <p>So far so good.</p>
              <p>I guess so long as the relationship is sustainable, it should be fine. However, horror stories always occur when the relationships fail to meet its mark.</p>
              <p>Perhaps let's start by getting to know her better as a colleague? How much do you know of her? And <strong>how much does she know of you</strong>? Did she get to see the sweet and considerate side of you? Are you what she's looking for?</p>
              <p>In my humble point of view, I think a relationship that starts off based on friendship would be more sustainable than whirlwind romance where one does not spend enough time understanding one another. Whirlwind romance may be passionate and hot at first, but sizzle out quickly afterward and perhaps give rise to what you call, the ugly side of office romance. That's just my two cents' worth.</p>
              <p>Jia you!</p>

              <p>An update..... She knows and can sense tat i like her but she only
              treats mi as a friend now, I found out abt this from a friend who told
              she tat she can sense it also...... The problem is she might already know the ger tat i talking abt is her..... I will need to see her reactions to this again......</p>
