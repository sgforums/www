              <p>Just relax and don't stress urself so much. She said Nov so for now give her the benefit of the doubt and wait. 4 months more is not really that long. During this period just remain in contact with her, continue chatting and remaining close.</p>
              <p>Don't betray her by starting to look for a girl now just because shes away. Thats being unfaithful.</p>
              <p>Just wait and see how things progress ok?</p>
