They can be similiar, but the degree, feel and everything else will differ even if it is a small details. We try to balance them consciously and this is the theory explaination of people putting in the effort into the relationship.<br><br>For example: You felt gulity because you had not been treating your gf well these days because of your emotional down-side in life, therefore you decide to write up a small card to let her know that she is being appreciated.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> These are but one of the millions of other things people do to 'balance' up these emotional gaps.<br><br>P.S: Don't think too much into her words dude. Emphasise more on what can you do for the relationship and how can it be done - your personal rewards will flow from that direction.<br><br>Cheers</div>
