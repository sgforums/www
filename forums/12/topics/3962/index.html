Better take an unoccupied cab - free to go wherever you want to go.<br><br>Respect yourself, and you'll gain her respect for you...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>She is not true to herself, disrespects herself and you (with the in's and out's of her bf) and is playing the fool with her boyfriend by showing interest in you. If she truly loves u, I doubt she'd want to do anything at all to hurt you. Would you do anything to hurt her?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Question now: Will u be able to tolerate this type of behaviour if she becomes your girl (again) in the future? (Kindly note that all claims of different character in subsequent future relationship will only be validated upon the crystallization of that character... in other words, only when she practises what she preach, or preach what she practises, then believe her).<br><br>Go, go, go... move out,.... get out of the estate, blah blah blah.

I am not trying to have a great love story but the truth is I  love her too much to let her go, I am not actually asking for people to tell me to stay or to go, I guess I just want to have some company when I'm alone and that I know that there are people out there who know my problem and is willing to share it with me.<br>What I am trying to say is to all of you I'm but a fool who is willing to give it all and not expecting anything in return and when in pain just take it as it comes...if thats what you all think then yes I am that fool.<br>I am have fallen too deep to let it go.<br>Tell me have you ever fell in LOVE before, have you truely love a person with all your heart and that with her nothing else matter?<br><br>This is my defination of a PERFECT WOMAN:<br>She have a light in her eyes, an infatuatious smile, talking to her you found you told her things you never told anyone before, you begin to see things you never see them before, and deep in you you knew somehow things are irreversibly changed... and it would never be the same again... and that woman is her.<br><br></div>

I feel that sometimes you just have to hang in there. And I guess thats what I am doing, believing in something and hoping for the best.</div>

I wouldn't comment on what kind of women she is as i don't know her, but pls spare a thought for yourself.I can see that you are hopelessly devoted to her,and i know that no matter what we say wouldn't change your feelings for her,thus i just want to pray for you. I wish that she will realise how fortunate she is and comes back to you soon =)</div>
