              <p>I am not a priest, I am a teacher.</p>
              <p>Of course it is natural for me to advise people not to take the wrong path, though ultimately it is still their own choice. Many people find it acceptable to have flings all over the place before marriage as long as they get a good spouse in the end, but I find it morally wrong.</p>
              <p>Well, my view is something which is pretty rare, so probably you might find me an idiot or something along that line, but I still believe that the greatest gift that a woman can have is her chastity. And mind you, I am not a christian.</p>
              <p>The TS might have did something foolish by dumping her bf, but that doesn't mean she should go around having flings as a result of that. What most girls want is a guy who will truly care for her and love her, and that is why I advice her to hold back until she can find a good guy for herself.</p>

              <p>I respect your view on this and encourage all opinions be brought out on the table so we could all learn a little bit of something along the way.How many people are lucky enough to fall in love one time and spend the rest of their lives with only one partner? Do you think many won't wish for it if it was that plain simple? Now back to TS,She didnt mention anything about wanting to go for a fling neither did she say she was Ms Venezuela......Ahemmm .Ok sorry about that.The thing is that they broke up and if it can't be fix then dont fix it.I know you mean good but how you vouch for her bf that mi amigo I don't comprende</p>

              <p>to put it bluntly, it is very easy for a guy to move on especially when he knows he has tried his best. on your part, using 'breakup' as a leverage to try to gain more attention was itself a big no-no already and it reeks entirely of childishness, which, he might read it as something you will definitely do again in the future. Like a kid that throws a tantrum, blackmailing the parents by shame or emotion. you see, as much as we love our partners, theres only a certain amount of bending over backwards that we're going to do, before we realise that we're taken for granted and finally say to ourselves "fark this shite." and walk away.</p>
              <p>some, are truely looking for mates for life, whereas, some are more for the moment. at this stage, we will never know which was he.</p>
              <p>If anyone is thinking that the guy is enjoying a good time, thats where you are wrong. In a failed relationship, both parties get hurt. Its just that pride, sometimes does not allow us to show our hurt and we as humans deal with it differently. Some try to take their own lives, in an attempt to block out the hurt, shame and the wrong decisions we have made. But isnt that what life is about? To learn and grow? To not make the same mistakes again?</p>
              <p>Imagine if the toddler whos trying to walk, fell, and gave up. by 5 years old he still would be crawling!</p>
              <p>In closing, I just have to say that, before anyone can love you, you first have to love yourself.</p>
