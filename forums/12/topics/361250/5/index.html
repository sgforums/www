              <p>Since you have given up on him, good.</p>
              <p>The most important thing now is what do you plan to do next. Please do not try anything as selfish as to commit suicide again. You are only indirectly passing on your sadness of losing someone close to you to your parents and family members.</p>
              <p>For now, you should stop thinking about having relationships and concentrate on your studies. I know you probably heard this line many times, but it is the most obvious thing to do and unfortunately the least followed.</p>
              <p>Another important thing I have to tell you is to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>never let yourself degenerate</strong></span>. I know of quite a number of girls who couldn't recover from their broken relationships and ended up having flings all the time. Never ever let yourself be like those girls who will change men like changing clothes.</p>
              <p>If there is anything else you think you need help on, post it here. If you really feel like talking to someone in private, you are free to pm the forum mods or me.</p>

              <p>TS, most guys would not change their mind once they have decided to move on..</p>
              <p>I was in a somewhat similar situation, and have learnt that we gals are usually more soft-hearted and willing to give a 2nd or 3rd chance to re-work things out. Guys simply move on in their life.</p>
              <p>Forbiddensinner has a good point. Some girls give up on love &amp; become cynical on relationships &amp; turn to flings when loneliness creeps in. I hope you would never thread this path.</p>
              <p>What you can do right now is to occupy your time with activities &amp; friends. Do not let yourself have too much time to think about the past. Join outings, go out shopping, take up a new hobby, go for a short holiday, exercise, surround yourself with family, friends and people who care about you. This will help you to slowly regain your foothold again.</p>
              <p>Do take care!</p>

              <p>After reading more I realised that you are sincere with your problem and that you are really sorry for what you have said and done to your bf but telling us will not improve your situation.You need to tell him exactly what you have typed here and if he doesnt accept you back then you would have gain a valuable experience from this relationship.Good Luck!</p>

              <p>Well, once again, I will say it is your choice. Just please don't get a random guy into your life, it will be better to find someone whom you have known for quite a while.</p>
              <p>I am honestly worried about you being taken advantage of, given that there are plentiful of pickup artists who likes to target girls who are emotionally weaker than others.</p>
              <p>And to be honest to you, guys of your ex-bf's calibre doesn't come too often, you will be disappointed when you get another bf and realise he is not even half as good as your ex-bf.</p>

              <p>I am not a priest, I am a teacher.</p>
              <p>Of course it is natural for me to advise people not to take the wrong path, though ultimately it is still their own choice. Many people find it acceptable to have flings all over the place before marriage as long as they get a good spouse in the end, but I find it morally wrong.</p>
              <p>Well, my view is something which is pretty rare, so probably you might find me an idiot or something along that line, but I still believe that the greatest gift that a woman can have is her chastity. And mind you, I am not a christian.</p>
              <p>The TS might have did something foolish by dumping her bf, but that doesn't mean she should go around having flings as a result of that. What most girls want is a guy who will truly care for her and love her, and that is why I advice her to hold back until she can find a good guy for herself.</p>
