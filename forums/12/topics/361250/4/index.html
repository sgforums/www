              <p>Also, you are controversing yourself by saying you believe that your 1st will last you through marriage and beyond, when you are the one who asked to break up with your ex-bf.</p>
              <p>Let me put this directly, regardless of how old you are, you are still not mature enough relationship-wise. You didn't plan ahead and act on your impulse, and now you are regretting it.</p>
              <p>I said this many times on this thread, and let me just say it again. Move on, he can never truly forgives you, and I will say he is smart enough not to take you back as his gf. If you can do this to him once, you can always do it to him again.</p>

              <p>No, it was not because of other guys... i always wan to break up with my bf because i wanted his attention... i know it was a very immature act.. i was trying to make my bf jealous.. now i know im wrong... all i ask is another chance... i love him a lot, ill nvr betray him .</p>
              <p>Yes i acted on impulse ... perhaps it was because it was my first relationship... and that i do not have many guy friends, therefore i made some wrong move..</p>

              <p>i seriously need advice on what to do now... im not those flirt
              type .. and to be honest i really wont give up unless i see him
              with other girls... yes this is going to hurt me but ... ill rather
              stay with him as friends and just purely have a crush on him than
              to totally break everything.</p>

              <p>If this is the path you choosen, no one can stop you.</p>
              <p>Only one who has fallen into darkness know how precious light is.</p>
              <p>I can assure you that nothing good will come out of your persistency, as he has already made his choice. If you are really set on going to the extreme, the first people you should talk to now are his friends and family.</p>
              <p>Talking directly to him won't make him change his mind, so you should rely on outsiders to help you out. The most important people whom you need on your side are his parents and best friends.</p>
              <p>If you are unable to get them to assist you in talking him into giving you another chance, there will be no other way out for you. The most important thing is to let his family and friends know that you are really sorry, and show that you are truly sincere this time, and will not make the same foolish mistake again.</p>
              <p>You must also apologize to his family for dumping their son, and ask for their forgiveness and help. As a son, most probably he will be closer to his mother, so talk to her first. As a woman, she will be more understanding.</p>
              <p>His best friend comes next. Depending on whose side ( Yours or your ex, though most likely your ex ) he is leaning towards, you might have to resort to talking to somone close to him to make him help you out. The person who can help you out this time round will be most probably his gf. Get her to come to your side, and ask her bf to help you put in a good word with your ex.</p>
              <p>From there, you should slowly make your way through his social circle, getting more of them to stand on your side, and less of them to dislike you.</p>
              <p>If you can successfully do this, there will be a small bit of hope for you, but don't count on it too much.</p>
              <p>As a last resort, you could always ask your ex to come here, and we will try to help you out by talking to him directly. The mods here are pretty powerful in terms of their counselling and advicing, though they will probably stay neutral in your case.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And one last thing. If you manage to get him back again, please don't make all of us here regret helping you out.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I can't stand this anymore. Why are you being so clingy to him? He already said it is over between the both of you! Once he has made up his mind, there is absolutely no way he would change his decision. Just move on &amp; find another guy! Using the words "break-up" to threaten your bf &amp; seek attention. Thinking looks will get you far in a guy's dictionary of a desired girl(sometimes they do but not in your ex's case). You really remind me of my ex! You can continue to remain as friends with him or jeopardise your friendship by carrying on being a pest &amp; eventually making him hate you &amp; losing him as a friend. Seriously, you got to change your attitude or else the same thing would happen to you again in your next relationship. Stop treating your bf like some playtoy that can be thrown &amp; flung around as &amp; when you desire it...</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well slowly work things out... since he said he like freedom, i dun think he will be with other girls within these few years... but anyway, just be his normal friend for now.... until he ask u back to be with him, if not, those things that you do now he will react with a different way that you would not want it to happen... so relax... do things slowly... i mean very very very slow..... maybe you don't contact him for a day or two, make him call you out... i think both of you are still in this kind of situation where both of you can really live without each other.... both of you are used to seeing each other everyday, everytime... just try not contacting him for 2 day... see whether does he contact you or not... if he still contact you,that means you still have hope...</div>
