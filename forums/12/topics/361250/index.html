              <p>wait till after his exams, have a heart to heart talk to him.  Assure him you will change for the better.</p>
              <p>Never take bf or husband for granted.    Treasure every moment u spend with him.     Learn to be more understanding, caring, considerate and sensitive to his needs.    vice versa.</p>
              <p>Good luck</p>

              <p>invite him to seafood buffet every week...make sure they got fresh and very good food.originally i would have told u to make a buffet dinner fer him every week but most modern gals they would be lucky to even fry an egg without burnin it.</p>
              <p>make sure got lots of fresh prawns,lobsters,crabs etc etc at buffett.....the more fresher foood items the faster he will forgive u!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The very first thing to do is, change your attitude before you get back with him. Otherwise there is absolutely no point in getting back with him if you are going to screw things up again with your "princess" mentality. You would only hurt him &amp; yourself again. That said, the next time you go out with him, just do something romantic for him. Something to prove your sincerity to him. Maybe a card or cookies or something like that? I can't give you a definite answer as it depends on his preferences. Then bring him to the places that you both used to frequent to jolt back the sweet memories. At the end of the day, you just pop the question of patching up again...</p></div>

              <p>If you've tried and tried but it just doesn't work it out for him, move on. At least you learnt that having excessive å°�å§� attitude will not work out for a relationship..</p>
              <p>If you've gotten back together but you both realize that your å°�å§� attitude is in the way of the relationship, let it go and move on.. At least you learn that forcing your way back into a relationship doesn't have a good ending..</p>
              <p>But if things turn out to be well for both of you in the end, then you've learnt how to cherish and compromise for the well being of the development of a relationship..</p>
              <p>In any case, don't brood too much about the sad things in life, coz' every single happy/sad experiences teaches us a lesson. Learn from it.. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
