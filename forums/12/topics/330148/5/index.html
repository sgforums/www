              <p>in my previous entry i wrote that he called me to work with him..(coz i am a surveyor), that was last thurs..here the strange thing..we were ok on thurs..to the fact that both of us are joking n playing happily..everything seems perfect..working and enjoying the company..but he changed after when he went msia with his gf on fri and wkend..and just ytd when we went back to office(to submit our stuff)..he started to tell me things like we shouldnt meet anymore becoz i do not wish to go out with you and let you think that there might be chance of us together(which nv cross my mind)..i was in total shock!! so i keep askin why then you still ask me to acc you on thurs when in fact you didnt wish to see me?and before he left for msia he say something like "i going msia then after that dunno when you can see me again le.." is he hinting that he doesnt wan to see me anymore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so after submitting our stuff we went vivo coz i am going home while he waitin for his mum..but while we were there..althought he keep emphazing dun wan to see me or go out with me..while shopping he still will ask me this nice that nice..and still can play lo..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>one moment he tells me he doesnt wan to go out with me becoz he wan to prevent himself so that i wont threaten him..but why still call me out?when i call him last night...he says there is no way we will see each other again...so i ask him so why did he call me on thurs..he cant tell me the reason..he is driving me crazy...it's not i cannot find new friends..it's not i dun have friends...it's that we know each other for very long and was very close...that i find it so difficult to treat him as a nobody...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>damn sad..i cried very hard ytd...losing a gd friend is worst then losing a bf lo...that's what i think la..</p>

              <p>what was he thinking...seriously...</p>

              <p><br>I can understand how you feel. When i broke up with my gf back then, it was like losing two close friends at the same time. Because at that time, my other close friend was very very close to my gf and she started ignoring me after i broke up with my gf. I'm back on talking terms with that friend le, but we are that close anymore and there's like a great barrier between us. I was far too naive and immature back then. Maybe even till now i am. But enough about my problems, back to yours.</p>
              <p>Why would your friend suddenly say that to you? Even though i'm a guy, i can only speculate his reasons.</p>
              <p>Haven the both of you been going out together along this time and had many happy times? From what you type, his actions are contradicting his words aren't they? If he says that it is best for you both not to meet, why on earth would he still ask you out?</p>
              <p>He's either very unsure of his feelings or being immature. A guy shouldn't let a girl tear that much.</p>

              <p><br>unsure of what feelings?erm...i think it's hard losing someone close to you..just like when i lost a girlfriend of 9years..i cry like mad also...i feel that knowing people who share the same thoughts as you is difficult..esp those who use to go throught thick and thin with you..but suddenly just poof and disappear...possesive?maybe...but no intention of having him as a bf..that's all i can say...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>perhaps one day i will get use to it...but it's a great loss for sure..</p>

              <p>haix..i also dunno what he thinking..that's why seeking opinion..</p>

              <p>unsure of his own feelings towards you bah. But that's only my speculation as it may be the reason why his actions contradict his words.</p>
              <p>Is there no way for your friendship to continue? When he says that it is best for the both of you not to go out together anymore, does it mean that he wants a clean break of the friendship or just not go so close in the future?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">Maybe you should do abit of soul searching, sometimes when we like someone theres soo many things we actually can do that makes the other party hate us, as i felt what you say, i kinda understood what you meant by having feelings for that person and sometimes we react in another way than what we expected ourself to do. Like play it cool, try to stay as friends, try to love that person silently. Easier said then done isent it, because we want that person, we try all means to break that person, Close your eyes, search your heart feel that pain inside, and try to put urself in his/her position, now maybe you will understand why he cannot accept you as a friend. Start thinking what are friends for? Think about it and reflect, Maybe he/she feels that you are not a good friend not once but thrice ye? Dont blame him/her just learn from your mistakes, maybe if you really did confess to him how you felt and resulting in your actions, everything would have been solved...Love cannot be forced. And if you really like/love the person you may not have to be with him or her, just to see him or her happy is the greatest joy already. And as a friend im telling you maybe its time to let go...move on it just aint worth it anymore.</span></p>
