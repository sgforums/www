              <p>Friends don't really have to shower gifts on each other to improve their friendships at least in my opinion. Even a simple act of concern can help to enhance the relationships between friends. Guys are usually very easy to please unless you made him real mad. Gifts may not necessarily help to patch up the friendship.</p>
              <p>You shouldn't really have repeated your mistake once and once again. And yet, he was big-hearted enough to forgive you all this while. You have hurt him once and once again but he has forgiven you each time. Even as mild-tempered as I am, I may not have forgiven you if i were in his shoes. That goes to show how big-hearted he was. The last straw breaks the camel's back. All this are most likely due to the fact your lingering feelings for your friend which may have induced a jealousy in you when you see him together with his gf, cuasing you to do what you have done. However,  are you very sure that you wouldn't commit the same mistake again if the both of you patched up and become close friends again? You must learn to draw the boundary between friends and boy girl relationships and be sure never to cross the line. Be honest to him about how you truly feel towards him so that he would understand you better as well. Consider more about his feelings everytime before you decide to do anything if both of you do patch up.</p>
              <p>Maybe he needs some time to chill down and mow over things. Have a heart-to-heart talk when he is ready. The word 'sorry' becomes meaningless if you used it over and over again and do not actually mean it.</p>

Cos the time will come where the odds of making friends are though, due to your lack of social skills.<br><br>Don u have friendster?<br>New friends are loved!</p></div>

              <p>in my previous entry i wrote that he called me to work with him..(coz i am a surveyor), that was last thurs..here the strange thing..we were ok on thurs..to the fact that both of us are joking n playing happily..everything seems perfect..working and enjoying the company..but he changed after when he went msia with his gf on fri and wkend..and just ytd when we went back to office(to submit our stuff)..he started to tell me things like we shouldnt meet anymore becoz i do not wish to go out with you and let you think that there might be chance of us together(which nv cross my mind)..i was in total shock!! so i keep askin why then you still ask me to acc you on thurs when in fact you didnt wish to see me?and before he left for msia he say something like "i going msia then after that dunno when you can see me again le.." is he hinting that he doesnt wan to see me anymore?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so after submitting our stuff we went vivo coz i am going home while he waitin for his mum..but while we were there..althought he keep emphazing dun wan to see me or go out with me..while shopping he still will ask me this nice that nice..and still can play lo..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>one moment he tells me he doesnt wan to go out with me becoz he wan to prevent himself so that i wont threaten him..but why still call me out?when i call him last night...he says there is no way we will see each other again...so i ask him so why did he call me on thurs..he cant tell me the reason..he is driving me crazy...it's not i cannot find new friends..it's not i dun have friends...it's that we know each other for very long and was very close...that i find it so difficult to treat him as a nobody...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>damn sad..i cried very hard ytd...losing a gd friend is worst then losing a bf lo...that's what i think la..</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Why can't you just confess your feelings to him ?</p>
              <p>You keep saying friend friend friend.. but it is obvious you want to possess him.</p>
              <p>If you really like him.. just rip him away from that woman if you can.</p>
              <p>But once you're very sure he will never fall in love with you.. then it's time you retreat to your little genie bottle. Give up this relationship after the closure.</p>
              <p>Friendship supports and give comfort.. not cause so much heart aches.</p>
