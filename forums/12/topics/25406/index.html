            <div class='col-md body'>maybe from the start u are wrong,in leaving a trail for him to follow.whether ornot it is intentionally,it is best u do some soulsearching abt urself.<br>if u find out u dun really "love" him,juz try to bring up the topic while u were chatting wif him den try to express it.or u can be very direct and ask him whether ornot he like u,den u tell him how u feel<br>i guess u are rather troubled thatif u told him abt ur feelings,he would stop giving u the kind of "affection" he is giving u now<br><br>juz my 2cents worth<br>god bless all</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hello girl pls do not lead the poor guy on? from my heart i feel for the poor guy who's going to be devastated when he hears that actually you do not love him at all. and from the start you 2 started out as if everything was fine, those "i love u, u love me, we are happy family" types.<br>but in actual fact it is only him that is doing the loving. you play along and induces him into believing that he struck gold and you're his one and only. NO. this is not the way girl, please, save this poor guy from his future agony. tell him now, tell him straight. dun keep for him to sacrifice himself more and get deeper before you break the truth to him. he will be in deeper pain.<br><br>do it now. pick up the phone<br><br>the worst thing to do. is to give people false hope in a relationship.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>my 2 cents</div>
