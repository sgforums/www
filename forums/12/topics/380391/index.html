              <p><br> That would be a common/normal behaviour towards your good or
              best friends.</p>
              <p>But it is an idealist concept towards your lovers, which in
              reality would makes you a very unhappy and sad person
              whenever you think of how happy your lover is with another
              person. </p>
              <p>If you did felt miserable and depressed, tell yourself that you
              are normal and it's your ex-lover who is abnormal for believing you
              would be happy for them.</p>

              <p>I agree a lot with you, and most of you guys here. I think if any of us could really feel happy for the other person, then I think we are not very in love with that person. I feel as though like its giving up your happiness to another person. </p>
              <p>Sorry for creating such a topic, cos I'm facing such a situation right now. =(</p>

              <p><br> Pure love does not exist, sometimes it's better to have

              <p>I always hear from people that, if you really love that person, when that person is happy you would be happy. </p>
              <p>What I want to know is, if you really love this person, and you two can't be together for some sort of reason and have to let them go. e.g. cannot be together cos parents object, cos they found someone new. . .</p>
              <p>Would you be happy for your other half if their happiness does not come from you? Are you happy with them being happy in this manner? If you say yes, are you truly happy and don't feel a single tinge of jealousy or what so ever?</p>

              <p>Love is subjective, for it touches and moves a person differently in many different ways, based on one's maturity, perspectives, needs and priorities in life.<br>If I had truly loved, and given my best, yet my best is not enough to make her happy, then I must let her go....why 2 persons to suffer in continuing on?</p>
              <p>Better to let her go...to find her own happiness..and when she had found it..and is happy with someone else...then I would be happy for her, for her happiness is where my love lays.</p>
              <p>I am human too, and will know pain, but the pain is more than made up when I see her happy arm in arm with someone else, even carrying her own baby with the other person, a sense of joy that I had failed to give her.</p>
              <p>Within the realisation of mistakes I made, only then I can succeed with another when the time is right to find my own happiness. In the meantime, better a smile with courage and hope to live on, then to linger on a pain of loss that will only prohibit me from maturing and moving on..... </p>
