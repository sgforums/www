            <div class='col-md body'>It is very rude not to reply to message,SMS, at least acknowledge. It is his fault. you might want to try message him again. maybe he forget to reply or lost in air..<br><br>but His reply is most likely,"yup, my apologies, got something on."<br><br>like you say, he is very shy, so you expected him to go to your party with no friends around? who he talk too? he is sure to feel uncomfortable .</div>
