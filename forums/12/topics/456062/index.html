              Hi, yesterday I and my fiance agreed to meet up with the wedding videographer for discussion at 3pm. We agreed to meet at 2.45 pm outside Guardian's in Parkway Parade.
                      
              So I got ready and started waiting at the Guardian's outside at abt 2.44 pm.
                      
              I realised I have forgotten to take my hp with me but since the shopping mall was not big, I thought I could easily catch sight of my fiancee and furthermore we have agreed on the venue for meeting.
                      
              As it was a Sunday, alot of people walking around and such. I kept my eyes at the door and at the people to 'catch' my fiancee. I waited until 3.15 pm plus still no sign of him. Feeling frustrated, I was at a lost whether to continue waiting like an idiot standing there with some sales person looking at me or to go home and take my hp or find a public phone.
                      
              I decided to walk off still worrying what if my fiancee came late and can't find me. 
                      
              I walked past a public phone and quickly made calls to him but he did not answer. I rushed home and took my phone and called him.
                      
              Then he said he already at Starbucks with the videographer. I rushed down to parkway again, perspiring and my face black. When I reached, they have finished discussing.
                      
              I was not feeling happy. My fiancee said don't give him the black look. I argued withhim why he didn'd bother to look for me when I was waiting outside Guardian's for a good 30 min plus. I told him I called him by the public phone twice and he didn't answer and asked him to check got 2 'missed call' or not.
                      
              He argued saying the phone number he did  not recognise.
                      
              I stomped off feeling so angry. In the end I turned back thinking nevermind, perhaps itis just a small matter.
                      
              Is it?

              my fiancee and furthermore we have agreed on the venue for
              meeting.</p>
              <p>As it was a Sunday, alot of people walking around and such. I
              kept my eyes at the door and at the people to ‘catch’ my fiancee. I
              waited until 3.15 pm plus still no sign of him. Feeling frustrated,
              I was at a lost whether to continue waiting like an idiot standing
              there with some sales person looking at me or to go home and take
              my hp or find a public phone.</p>
              <p>I decided to walk off still worrying what if my fiancee came
              late and can’t find me.</p>
              <p>I walked past a public phone and quickly made calls to him but
              he did not answer. I rushed home and took my phone and called
              him.</p>
              <p>Then he said he already at Starbucks with the videographer. I
              rushed down to parkway again, perspiring and my face black. When I
              reached, they have finished discussing.</p>
              <p>I was not feeling happy. My fiancee said don’t give him the
              black look. I argued withhim why he didn’d bother to look for me
              when I was waiting outside Guardian’s for a good 30 min plus. I
              told him I called him by the public phone twice and he didn’t
              answer and asked him to check got 2 ‘missed call’ or not.</p>
              <p>He argued saying the phone number he did not recognise.</p>
              <p>I stomped off feeling so angry. In the end I turned back
              thinking nevermind, perhaps itis just a small matter.</p>
              <p>Is it?</p>

              <p>Isnt your fiancee the lease worried that he couldnt find you? Since the supposed meeting time between you and him had passed. In fact, he left you out of the discussion without your consent. If I were you, i'd call off the wedding with him. From your story, it looks like he doesnt give shit about you and doesnt respect you.</p>

              <p>Last time something similar happened to me before!</p>
              <p>Was meeting someone at Marina Bay, but my phone died on me.</p>
              <p>Actually I thought we both have enough chemistry, but it isn't the case on that day.</p>
              <p>She waited at Marina Bay the seats there, while I waiting at the MRT control station <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>End up, I use pay phone to linked up with one of our common friend, and called her. LOL! That incident is very epic~</p>
              <p>Teaches me to really finalized the meeting venue and time before meeting. Great lesson to learn.</p>
              <p>End up when meeting, both face black black~ but after a while, everything okay le lah! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I believe it is the gentlemanship that fail, wedding is not a one man show, you need 2 hands to clap, so obviously, you need both to in the picture.</p>
              <p>But those medicated male ego guys will alway tell you, I handle it, you shut up. And when thing get cork up, they start to blame their gf or wife. It is therefore uptmost important that before you decide to get marry, take control of your man, otherwise, no matter how much medicated oil you use, also no use.</p>

              <p>He might have lots of other affair, that is why so sensitive about phones nos on display, if he got nothing, why do not dare to answer a call? He is keeping something very big from you, to me, this look like a marriage of convenenice for him.</p>
              <p>End up, marrying for the sake of being married, buy house, and you become the children production dept for him, after 2 to 3 kids, he might not even answer any phone call from you.</p>
              <p>One of the sign of unfaithful partner is when partner are wary about phone calls.</p>
