            <div class='col-md body'>It's a part time job, obviously we can't expect a very high pay. But if a male and female poly grad were to find a part time job, there's a tendency that the female will be able to get a slightly higher paying job (probably for some roadshow).<br><br>There are usually more female than male workers at such events. If it's not sexist, then why is it a requirement for the females to wear short skirts?<br><br>My friends and I are earning between $5-6/hr at a restaurant, while a female friend is earning $10/hr for promoting mobile phones at roadshows. Why don't we apply for the post as well, you might suggest? - The management are not keen on hiring males (they have more female staff than male staff as a result). Male staff can't wear short skirts, so maybe that's why they prefer female staff. There's sarcasm in what I said, but I can't help it.</div>
