Many rich people who will not even blink twice and spend money on branded goods, restaurants, etc never know what tough live means. They were born with a golden spoon and moreover, working to 'em is hardship, so they'll rather stretch out their hands to their parents and ask 'em for money. sad case..</div>

Just $4.50/hr, pathetic rite??<br><br>Actually get this lobang from my sec sch friends. Then I intro 3 of my poly friends but the 3 of them have left after working for 1 month.
