But sad to say - the method you use is not only repulsive, very turn off and it makes making friends difficult.<br><br>Your first mistake comes from telling that you are stalking her to her house - I mean think about this bah, is it neccessary to tell? No right! Then, by telling her that you *did* stalk her, the first thing that comes to her mind is her own safety, and *NOT* anything else. Come on, if someone stalk you, you don't feel good - Trust me. Especially women.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Her impression in you would be: A stalker, a freak, a weirdo, etc and *not* someone who wants to know her genuinely with a sincere heart. Its not your motive that is wrong... its YOUR way of doing things.<br><br>Seriously speaking - its difficult to alter the impression she has in you unless she is willing to give you a chance and don't mind getting to know you better - in which sorry to say, is virtually impossible.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Learn from your mistakes and vow never to resort to such stalking ways, etc - you only creates fear and uncomfortability in which *ANY* ladies will avoid you like a plague. Well, who doesn't make mistake anyway? Learn from it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Your 1st 'appearance'... A stalker and (perhaps in her eyes) a WEIRDO who 1st stalked her and then try to tell her his little 'fantasy'.... (I'm not saying you're doing that.. I'm referring to the likely impression she could have of you then...)<br><br>2. Your 2nd 'appearance'.... COMEBACK of the 'stalker' (probably the only impression she had of you then...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) Her agreement to accept you as a 'friend' and your gift the next day was probably just to AVOID the 'potential danger' she thought could have been in then....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>3. Shouldn't be too surprised that she's avoiding another meet up with you... Didn't leave much of an impression for her in the beginning...? (err... Maybe except the bad ones..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> )<br><br>4. It probably doesn't really matter to her whether your gift reaches her or perhaps (no offence) she have thought it better if you don't...?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>NORMAL FRIENDS</strong></span><br><br>1st of all, the things that you've been doing to her ain't exactly 'normal'... Likelihood she won't have any good impression of you by now... Your chances are SLIM... And SERIOUSLY, where do you intend to get about from here..? Just NORMAL friends..? If you're thinking along BGR, I'll STRONGLY urge you to STOP it from here... You've done enough to scare the wits out of this girl...<br><br>If you really care for her, perhaps you can just write her a final letter of EXPLANATION for the things that had happened and things you'd done... Try to make it MILD please... &lt;- Not with those 'how much I love you' things... (you're probably gonna scare the hell out of her if ya do...) If she accepts your apology and don't mind being a pen-pal with you, perhaps you can just get to know each other better from there.... (no FUNNY tricks please...) If NOT, just REST THE CASE... I think you've DONE ENOUGH, and her response to your APOLOGY should be a message CLEAR ENOUGH to you.... DESPITE you can forget her OR not.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
