            <div class='col-md body'>If it were me, I would just tell her. Get the whole thing over with. Most of your pain and frustrations probably comes from the fact that you dun know if you will be accepted. If you dun say anything, you will probably always question yourself and wonder whether things would have been different if you had let her know.<br><br>So just tell her. Even if the answer is negative, you you just feel pain for awhile and after some time you will get over it.<br><br>The worst things is not a negative answer but no answer. Just tell her. Its a win win situation. If the answer is no you can still move on. If the answer is yes good for you. If you dun do anything.......its a lose lose situation. You wonder forever and she will also never know if you like her.<br><br>Guys must take more initaitive !! Wah surely you dun expect her to declare her love for you first -__________-</div>

IÂ’ve been dropping hints here and there and responses were still quite positive. Some what she still engages with me quite often. We are quite close that she tells me of her daily problems, we exchange sms and msn nearly every day.Close friends of mine said I stand a very gd chance somemore.Haix! I used the word illusion cause I juz knew the cruel truth Juz yesterday..<br>The happy and naÃ¯ve me was always still harbouring hopes that  I may stand a chance but now it seems it will never happen. Maybe thatÂ’s her,getting so close with me but only treat me as a fren to her.I dun even know where the hell do I stand in her heart among so many guys in her daily life.<br>Juz knew that she has a guy in mind and sheÂ’s kind of in the same situation like me,like how I like her.Totally taken aback coz she nv told me anything about this.I knew that she had rejected a guy who planned romantic birthday for her but never knew that sheÂ’s been liking this guy and she felt helpless sometimes when she dun get the reciprocated love. And from what I know,they can be together anytime.<br>I m rather confused to whether should I still confess to her although it seems that the chance of me getting her is like 10%?.. Cause she may not know that I like her as a girl NOT as a friend only, donÂ’t feel like giving up. Juz wanna bring my point and thoughts across. Being there for her and stuffs made me happy for so long.So,what should I do..<br></div></blockquote>Just continue as usual until you fall for some other girl and start a relationship with the new girl or this present girl starts a relationship with a guy.<br><br>Just tell her that if she wants, she can start a relationship with you while you are still available.</div>

So be compose and please understand gals dun change their decision in love as often as boy do, when we said we dun want your love, we mean it.<br><br>So in conclusion, it is not that you are no good, it simply that you should find a better gal that can suit you well in term of personality, characteristics, looks, action and the way of thinking.</div>
