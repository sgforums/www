You must be hurting bad <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">( But to be honest you don't seem to have much of a chance wor. Haiz<br><br>But what you *can* do is to tell her... Then see if she can still be a worthy friend by judging her response, whether she still cares that you are hurting, etc.<br><br>However the most impt thing is that you realise, and accept the fact that you will be the one hurting and you must bear that pain and move on to better things!</div>
