But its up to him if he want to reciprocate your feeling.</div>

You will surely meet more better guys out there in UNI. Can you resist it?<br><br>from your height and your weight i think you are not fat. what you can do is to keep fit. maybe go jogging once in awhile.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: black;"><strong>I will start off with my slogan. Let it all out and leave no regrets. If u really love him, don't hold back yourself. Go all way out, if u really do love him why worry abt gossips. Trust and understand is important in a relationship, if he say won't, just believe and trust him. It may not be easy to overcome jealousy, but it will be easier to trust him based on love. As I said, do not hold back in a relationship. I personally held back in my previous bgrs and all did not end well. Go for it, if u really love him, guys don't like hints  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Just let it all out and leave no regrets. Be bless with love and magic in life <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Btw your BMI is 20.4. thus not fat. It is a healthy range, no need to worry. If u want to sleep, try lavender scented stuff. 14 is still a long way to go girl, dont hand around bgr too much, if u think the relationship is not heading a direction. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </strong></span></div>

If he has gotten your letter and not comment anything about it, chances are he's not that keen or stable enough to develop a relationship with you...</div>

I dont even have a present given by my friend ! Let alone a girl. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Hmm... i suggest you move on . This guy doesnt worth your affection for him. He's just dragging it on. There are better guys out there who will be frank with their feelings. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, regarding the "lose weight" thingy , im also caught in such a situation too. Im neither fat or plump in any way. But im very skinny but tall, standing at 175cm with a weight of just 51kg. Every time when my relatives sees me, they say "Wah u never eat rice arh? Eat more rice lah aiyo !" Grrr...its not my fault that i cant put on weight . <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  Also, i have acne problems too. They keep asking me whether i kept my face clean or not . Quite irritating initially. Ok back to you. As long as you think you are fine, dont bother about what other people say . Just be yourself and live yourself and stay happy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Cheers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
