I had nagging too, but not much.  I also had friends comparing jobs, etc.....damned irritating, but I just ignore them.

They could help to complement the skill sets gained from your university education and boost your resume.<br><br>Temporary jobs and contract positions, as gentlerock suggested, are a good way to kill time, earn pocket money, and gain experience. You can also get a good feel of the industry and see if you're working in the right field. Besides, if you perform well, the company might even offer you a permanent position. Try posting your resume with a few job agencies -- sniff around in the forums, as there are quite a few threads on recommendations for such agencies.<br><br>Don't lose heart. I myself have also spent half a year measuring the road outside my home before landing a job. Good luck.</div>
