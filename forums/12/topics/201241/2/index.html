And she also told me he dun like me too.. so there's mutual resentment.  Then last night she told me he's the only one who nv hurt her before.  I asked her "are u sure?"  then she said ya.. she forgot that she told me he hurt her before, and would nv patch with him again.. but they still patched.  Then she said even if she really said that, it was just an excuse.  Then carry on telling me many girls admire him la, he's a good man blah blah.. Initially I tot he's good also, but SHE TOLD ME that he helped her to break up with her ex.  To me, that's despicable.  He break up the 2 of them for his own selfish reason mah.<br><br>I always draw a line between our love life.  I wun go chup her love life, coz it's too complicated.  She always say one thing and does another.  The conversation last night.. she denied the fact that she said certain things.  Then she said I'm mad etc etc which made me more furious.<br><br>Actually lately I have been asking myself whether I can still trust her.. bcos my jie mei told me that she has been hiding things from me or lying to me all these years.  They were from the same sec sch.  And my buddy's exs were mostly their common frens.  She really could not take it anymore, that's why she told me when I pleaded her to.  Then I can't help but suspect she purposely made me and my first ex break up, and told me things that she said he told her about me.  There was so much unhappiness back then.  I was always stuck between the two of them.  Always quarrel bcos of her.<br><br>I dun want to confront her.. coz I'm afraid of finding out the truth.  I dun think I can take it if she really did that.. and I told myself, it's past liao, forget it.  I dun want to give up our friendship.  But if I really wronged my ex, then I should be shot.  I had been hurting and regretting over the break up.  She knows that he is someone very important in my life.  Yet she came in between us over and over again.. caused us so much misery.  I trusted her too much, I believed all the things she told me.  When I confronted my ex, he dun seem to know what I was talking about.  Maybe he's really innocent.  That's what I really feel bad about.<br><br>How can I trust her again?  </span></div></blockquote>I think I would be standing too far to help you judge who should you trust and you should not? Not to mention that you'll probably need to acquire this form of 'ability' for yourself in time to come...?<br><br>Ever heard of the saying "Yi ren zhi xin bu ke you, fang ren zhi xin bu ke wu"?<br><br>Sometimes you don't have to lay all your cards on the table... Even if you trust someone, you should practise your issues on what can be discussed over and what not...? To what extent can you trust a person?<br><br>If you find that a person can't really be trusted (but the person ain't really giving you serious trouble..), you need not totally keep your distance but just have to be more aware and careful of what is going on...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
