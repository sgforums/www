              <p>This is my first post, but i have been reading this sgforums for along time. My english is not that good. I had decided to write this is that after reading so much here and just nice that my son was sleeping beside me make me wondering how is he going to survive if Singapore gov going to go on as they wish. If he is good in study, i will work like a cow in order to proivde him. But not all human are perfect. If i am rich, i dont mind him turn out to be whatever, but the fact is that....</p>
              <p>As in 2010 i am 35 years old, a flat which i am still paying, a lowly educated wife and a 17 month years old son. Currently unemploy but going to drive taxi soon, just pass my TVL. I have been unemployed for a year. I have been a driver all the while until the company get foreigners to replace all the drivers. During 2009, a class 3 driver get home $1300, class 4 get $1600 and class 5 get $2400. Foreigner drivers get around half of what we get, plus OT will be ard what we get. Class 4 and 5 drivers were mostly replaced by ex SBS China drivers who is a PR.</p>
              <p>So i went to join the casino as dealer. The casino accepted me and trained me. But somehow the CRA declined me(i cross the law before). The gov always said give the ex convinced a chance, they are only putting up a show. And just with a driver licence without any other cert, the last resort was to join the cabby.</p>
              <p>This may be the worries of all parents, including me. Not only the foreigners will snack even the lower tile of the citizens only meal providing job. But the way of the gov handle the labour law. They will allow other peoples for oversea to come in to fight for our cray rice bowl.</p>
              <p>Lastly i hope that the gov will do something to us lower tile citizens, orelse we will someday be cornered and eventually turn back to bite.</p>

              <p>Dont worry, education cost should be ok......especially for schooling levels....</p>
              <p>At higher levels (poly or uni) it will be more expensive....</p>
              <p>But it is still do-able with scholarships, etc.....</p>

              <p>Yea, pre-school education cost should be fine. Although it might be tough for you and your wife to provide the milk powder now. Your child is still young. He will survive 2 elections (this upcoming one and later in 2015/2016) before entering primary school. and another when he is 17/18. That's when the real education fees come in unless he goes to a JC.</p>
              <p>Till then you can only cross your fingers and pray hard the gov will change something.  Just my 2cents.</p>

Betting on ToTo and 4-D is fine. maybe just buy a bid sweep tickt or a number in small amount bets. you never know your luck. winning some cash will definitely help you save for your son's expenses or pay for the milk powder. Don;t spend unneccessarily, although  sometimes if your finances allow you can splurge on a little somethigng for the family. Be positive. Right now there is nothing we can dowith this foreigners shit. think of it. the gahmen has run out of ideas already if not you think they wll allow so many foreigners to coe in? They i can say and i am laffing now, really has got nomore ideas left. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p></div>

Left $800. $300 for milk and all baby needs. $300 for food. $200 for transport. You go to apply for help, the gov ppls said my salary is enough. Like that just earn and live with no life. Ask the gov to live like me lol, i dont think they can. If they said they use brain too much need to get more pay, then i also can say that i also got pay GST lol.</p></div>

              <p>Will be a big problem for you if there are no savings...what if you lose ur job one day? What if you get injured and is unable to work any longer? You should consider getting your wife to work part time or supplement your income with another part time job. You need saving of at least 6 months of your current salary in the event something happens to you. At least during that time you can still survive while looking for another job.</p>
              <p>As for your child, dun really need to worry much on him...if he is good with his studies there are scholarship around....</p>
              <p>And for goverment not helping you considering that your salary is this low....what can i say....this is not european country...it is the same everywhere for asian countries...no welfare for the ppl.....government won't take care of the lower income tier group....&gt;&lt;"</p>

              <p>If you dont know, dont kia keong, i mean the gov had to restrict the foreigners, not just FT only to snatch our rice bowl. Also the housing price, we can affort now, but when come to our children, can they still affort.  </p>

              <p>You want the fact here's some for you:</p>
              <p>1. You're 35, more or less you should have working experience. There should be plenty of other jobs out there, it's the matter of whether you accept or not. And dont blame me for being analytical, since you're previously a driver, i can only assume that you're not qualified as well, so how much are you looking at per month? $3000?</p>
              <p>Think about it, how did the foreigners working in Singapore survive with their pay lower than yours (you claimed that they earn half of what you used to earn)</p>
              <p>2. You're married with a kid, i.e. a family to support and a house yet to be fully paid for. So why the heck are u unemployed? Is it because you're selective of the jobs available?</p>
              <p>So are you implying that driving a taxi is a low paying job that you shouldn't be doing? I believe an average taxi driver (i.e. not those who take 5 mins lunch &amp; dinner break + 2 mins toilet breaks) driving a half-day shift can easily earn $2000 per month?</p>
              <p>3. If you're worried about your kid and know that education is important, you should encourage your kid to study hard and not slog his entire life to support his family like you did.</p>
              <p>As the old chinese saying goes, How can people help you when you dont even help yourself? Time to wake up and do something useful instead of venting out your frustration in this forum. Spending $0.80 on a newspaper for the recruit section will be more worthwhile.</p>

              <p>(1) In the minds of people who don;t want 3k per month job if its easy? some more this guy got a family and many money commitment seems so ike he wrote.</p>
              <p>(2) this i agree. but i am curious how he took the plunge. house, kids all at one time when he only a driver. i can only guess that he's previors driver job must be quite good paying. taxi driving is you your own boss. if you don;t want to pick up people, idle drive, don;t leanr and know the places to avoid or pick up ppl so one then one month not enough to cover the diesel and taxes also.</p>
              <p>but his rant and vent on the foreigner issue i support. without the foreigner in the equation things will be much better and i bet he won;t need to start this trehad either.</p>
