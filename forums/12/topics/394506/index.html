              Hi guys, I've been in Thailand doing business for many years now. Met my Thai gf about 1.5 years ago and she works in a bank in Thailand. Long story short, I brought her to SG for 2 times and before that, she made a very serious decision to quit her job in the bank and help me with my business in Thailand. 
              
              Long story short, it seems like it not easy for her to come into SG because she is a Thai.
              
              1st Time: She came, she got 30 days visa and before 30 days visa expires, she did an 30 days visa extension online without any problem. Total stay in SG for 60 days.
              
              2nd Time: Upon reach airport, the customs officer KPKB says the next time she comes, they will send her back to Thailand and refuse entry despite we've return air ticket, sufficient funds, her passport more than 6 months validility, me as a guarantor and she stays in my house.
              
              I called the ICA and they are KNN like robot only know how to say "Her entry is subject to approval depending on the customs officer discretion". KNNBCCB my gf and I have to take a train 13 hours from Chiang Mai to Bangkok and then to Singapore.
              
              If that day that CB customs officer not shiok or last night no F, then how? My time, money spent on air tickets all wasted lah. I don't come all the way from Chiang Mai with my gf to SG to play a game of roulette with the immigration.
              
              FYI, she will have
              
              1) Return Air Ticket (Within 30 Days)
              2) S$5,000 &amp; Above In Cash For 30 Days Stay
              3) Passport More Than 3 Years Validility Period
              4) Me, Guarantor
              5) Stay In My House
              
              How can I bring her to SG the 3rd time without the immigration at the airport send her back to Thailand?
              
              
              If she is refuse entry, we'll have to travel all the way from SG to Bangkok and then to Chiang Mai. NBCB not fun man.

              <p>Hi Kopiosatu, thanks alot for your inputs. My gf and I've been through alot together for the past 1.5 years both business and personal. If not for her, my company in Thailand would have collapse already. We loved each other very much and yes we are thinking about ROM.</p>
              <p>Everytime I stayed in Thailand for about 3-4 months because I've a company there and every 3-4 months, I will come back to Singapore once to apply for a new business visa to Thailand before heading back to Thailand again.</p>
              <p>Each time I come back, I'll bring my gf together with me and we stay in Singapore each time between 1-2 months.</p>
              <p>I've just received a phone call from the Singapore Immigration guy who told me that she is only allow to come into Singapore and stay not more than 2 months on a calender year.</p>
              <p>If we go ROM, she can apply for Singapore PR but the problem is I do not have any Singapore income tax or CPF because all my business are in Thailand.</p>
              <p>How can she apply for a PR after we get married?</p>
              <p>What are the documents my Thai gf needs to bring when ROM in Singapore?</p>

              <p><strong>Ok here goes. </strong>If my gf is applying for Singapore PR, I heard there are some criterias you gotta fullfilled. Once you've successfully applied for let's say 5 years Singapore PR, you will need to stay in Singapore for like 3 - 4 years out of 5 years right?</p>
              <p>If not, the next round when you want to re apply for Singapore PR, you may face some problems.</p>
              <p>Please correct me if I'm wrong and would greatly appreciate if anyone could provide me with the accurate information.</p>
              <p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>

              <p>don't use the ICA website</p>
              <p>give them a call</p>
              <p>i know the lines are always engaged but just keep trying if u
              really want info directly from them</p>
              <p>my friend's wife was required to stay in SG for a certain amount
              of years but i'm not sure how many.</p>

              <p>Yep keep trying to call them and it's super difficult to get the line through unless you're lucky. My friend's wife is also Singapore PR and he told me the same thing too. His wife is required to stay in Singapore for a period of time and so on..... But my friend is now working in Singapore and his wife is staying in Singapore so not much problem.</p>
