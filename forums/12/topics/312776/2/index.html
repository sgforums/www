              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>(Before reading , there are alot of grammatical errors and I am
              sorry about that , I am really too weak to re-read what I had
              typed because it makes me sad)</p>
              <p>Hi ,</p>
              <p>First , I would like to introduce myself first as this is my
              first time posting in Aunt Agony Forum. I'm a Sec 2 Council Elect ,
              an express stream student and ya ..</p>
              <p>This is my problem :</p>
              <p> I got kick out of the student council family recently due
              to : my discipline. I admit that I got into alot of trouble this
              year but you may ask , how could a naughty student like me get into
              the student council. First , I got no bad record found in my entire
              Sec 1 year but recently I got into some trouble.</p>
              <p>1. Shouting at teacher because I'm too stress. (Due to a mark in
              the common test)</p>
              <p>2. Got angry with my classmates easily and quarrel till we find
              the form teacher</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think I got an unfair 'kick' because</p>
              <p>1. Most of my classmates which are in the council family causes
              lots more trouble than me</p>
              <p>2. Shouldn't I be given any chance if I am willing to change ?
              Just because of THIS year , THESE few problems and I got kick out
              ??!!</p>
              <p>3. During one the meeting , the council teacher said : "Some of
              you are not recommended by the teachers , but we gave you a chance"
              AND she said THIS after I got kick out.</p>
              <p> I cried in front of this council teacher when she told me
              personally that I was out of the family.Instead of comforting me ,
              she asked if I am
              alright.          
               I have got  teachers  to support me though.</p>
              <p>First , a teacher told me to write a letter of appeal to be
              a SCHOOL AMBASSDOR since she is a school ambassdor teacher
              .</p>
              <p>Secondly , an acting subject head EL teacher , came and find me
              , on the day itself when I got kicked , and asked me what am I
              suppose to do .. She told me not to give up and patted on my
              shoulder :"You could do it , I believe in you" . and she told me to
              direct all my energy to other leadership skills She said that she ,
              herself ,will make sure I be the CCA leader or ambassdor ..</p>
              <p>Later I found out that she is a newly appointed school ambassdor
              teacher ..</p>
              <p>Thirdly , a teacher also found out about this 'fired' matter
              .  And suggested that he , himself , will write a
              recommendation letter to the council head. But later , after some
              consideration , he said that it's impossible , they may not accept
              it.</p>
              <p>So this is my plan :</p>
              <p>I will write an email to the council teacher but my identity
              will remain annoymous. (Luckily , there are more than 1 council
              elect being kick out)</p>
              <p>This is the email I plan to write :</p>
              <p>Dear XXXXXX ,</p>
              <p> This is your ex-council elect here.I would like to remain
              annoymous and please treat this as a junk mail if you like to
              and as I don't really have the gut to see you face to face because
              I have really lost all my energy talking about council stuff since
              the day you fired me. This is just an email to inform you about my
              unhappiness about council and some suggestion , I hope you would
              not be angry after reading it . I would sincerely apologise to you
              if you are angry about it.</p>
              <p> First , I think there are alot of unfair 'kick' in the
              council elects . I would not mention names here , but there are
              some elects that are so bad till they got into more troubles than
              me and yet remain in the council. Miss XXX , I am not trying to
              gain your sympathy but I just want to tell you that , if you were
              to kick me out of the councill just because I have some discipline
              problem this year then you must be a person which don't really care
              about a person's feeling and past.</p>
              <p>You did not even bother to find out what causes me to be that
              bad this year whereas my record is 'clean' last year. Though you
              don't really have to , but I will prove you wrong. Did you really
              spare a thought for your ex-elects ? You just chuck them aside just
              because of this word : DISCIPLINE .. Do you know how sad it is to
              be kick out ? Do you know the pain of it ? Seeing you reminds me of
              council , and that really affect me , in terms of school life and
              personal ability .</p>
              <p>Do you think I can still lead a group in future ? I'm speechless
              , Miss XXX . Do you think all your councillors have the same
              purpose : To lead ? As an ex-council elect ,  I see my senior
              councilors quarreling over things ,   and WHO ARE the
              ones that can tell me that he/she is HAPPY TO BE IN THE COUNCIL
              !!!??? Instead , they felt like being an extra , just to listen to
              orders and carry out. Best example would be : PTI and Orientation
              Camp.</p>
              <p>Why do they want to be in the council in the first place ? Fame
              ? CCA Points ? I don't know. But let me tell you this , I really
              have the intention to lead if not I would not really bother much to
              'inform' you here.</p>
              <p>Back to the topic , do you think all your elects are that good ?
              I think results in their academics should also be placed into
              consideration . Look at one of your 'Sec 3-2" councillors .. he got
              retain back last year , so do you think he can still lead and at
              the same time , neglecting his own results ?</p>
              <p>Miss XXX , to be able to lead , you must be wise. Look at Mr
              Bush , do you think he can lead US if he is dumb ? Ms XXX , in my
              own opinion , you are more than destorying a person's future by
              letting a 'poor' academics student staying in your council
              family.</p>
              <p>As an elect , do you think people are given a chance to lead ???
              It's much more like hiring a student-maid. All of us got to listen
              orders from the in charge and execute THEIR plans ... How to lead
              in this manner ?</p>
              <p>From rumour , to be accepted to council , you got to go through
              voting and the 'approval' of the excos .. Do you think if I am your
              enemy , you will vote for me ? Do you know that those
              popular ones will get accepted instantly just because they are
              popular for various reasons ..</p>
              <p>Miss xxx , I strong urge you to review back all your fired
              elects 'profile' in half a year time or whatsoever , JUST LOOK
              through and see if they have any more bad records after being
              'fired' by you. If there is , I don't have anymore excuses but if
              there isn't , miss xxx , you had made the worst desicion in your
              entire teacher's career.</p>
              <p>your elect ,</p>
              <p>XXXXXX</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People , do you think it will work ? Or will it invite more
              trouble for me ? I need help !</p>

              <p>Night-time,</p>
              <p>Your letter serves no purpose other than whining to the person receiving this letter that there's <strong>favoritism</strong> within the council group.</p>
              <p>Since you have violated a disciplinary requirement. You should accept the fact that you have done wrong, and gracefully accept your punishment.</p>
              <p>Pointing fingers at others while you have done wrong, does not make you a "righteous " party. It only highlight another undesirable trait/weakness in you.</p>
              <p>So what if they read your letter and re-enlist you into the group ? Will you be happier there? Unlikely, it seems you have so much gripe about the people and the way the group's being managed.</p>
              <p>You're trying to stick a square peg into a round hole.</p>
              <p>Wouldn't it be better you find yourself a square hole to fit in instead ?</p>

              <p>Well, if I am the teacher who is supposed to receive this letter, if I wanted to be truly evil and totally destroy your reputation within the school, I would make a public announcement and read out this letter in front of the whole school and do a very biased analysis of the complaints, rants and illogical statements (if there are any).</p>
              <p>After which, I would follow up by saying :" Whoever wrote this letter with no name is a coward and a whiner. I think that someone who won't grace a complaint letter with his name has no guts and if I ever find out who it is, I will make sure that he is not given any leadership positions in the school, or even better, given negative comments in his testimonial."</p>
              <p>This method would ensure that</p>
              <p>1: You won't ever dare to even ask to rejoin the student council for fear of being found out.</p>
              <p>2: You will most likely lie low until you leave the school.</p>
              <p>I've seen this happen to others in different schools, so I am strongly against sending an anonymous letter. I suggest you go up to your council teacher and ask humbly if you can rejoin council, even though in my opinion it wouldn't be such a good way to go, as your fellow council mates might laugh at you behind your back for being expelled from council once. But since you are so determined to go back into council, what's the harm in trying?</p>
              <p>My advice on the best course of action would be that you join another CCA which you like. Even if you got kicked out from council, it's not the end of the road. There are so many people which DSA to JCs and have a great testimonial for university at the end of their JC career. Council has its prestige, of course, but other CCA's are just as good. </p>

              <p>I strongly suggest you don't send this letter. I understand it is hard to swallow unfair treatment, despite it (the unfair treatment) being a common thing eveywhere.</p>
              <p>If you die die must to send something, just write "sorry I was a fault. I'llimproved myself. Thanks for your tolerance and kind understanding."</p>

              <p>1. Your first reason showed your hypocrisy. Your so-called letter seems to suggest the other members of the council are superificial for they are after the CCA point, but now you said 'need the points to go to my dream school', so you're are of no different from them. I don't know what is your dream school's requirement, but I think if you have good O level results, with very low COP, you should be able to realise this dream too. Tell you what, you can consider joining a sports CCA, bring championship to your school, confirm CCA points kao kao; some more can keep fit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2. So you joined council to make friends? I think you can do the same by joining other CCAs. Or maybe you can start talking to your classmates. Or to put it blantly, is it that being in the council somehow allows you to feel that you have some kind of power and one class above the rest?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. I think any decent and good teachers have high expectations on any students that he/she had come into contact. Stop self-deluding.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. "you get to know more teachers which is good " &lt;-- eh, quite scary leh, so young know how to establish network. You sound more like a curry-favoured boy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, it's amazing that you shouted at a teacher over a mark. Last time we have to beg and cry over a mark. Geez, guess nowadays really different from in the past.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think it is a good decision for your school to keep you out of the council. I think it will be quite a nightmare for your schoolmate, should you be in the council and happen that the council may have certain power in the school.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Humility, honesty, integrity, perseverence, acquired these before yearning for power.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take care.</p>
