            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by k2406:</div><div class="quote_body">here's the situation:<br><br>my gf's taking her a levels this year. i'm stuck in NS till 2009.<br><br>her parents very likely want her to go overseas for her uni education.<br><br>for her, she doesn't mind going overseas (or staying in sg) but her real interest lies in a 'not-so-prestigious' course (local) which her parents would almost surely not approve of. Hence she's more or less given up on pursuing that course.<br><br>For me, of course I'd wish that she stays in Singapore and I feel she should make up her own mind with regards to her tertiary education (after all it will affect the rest of her life) but I don't feel that it's right for me to try influence her to defy her parents.<br><br>I feel quite troubled by this now even though there's still about a year from now before she goes for her tertiary education. It's not a good feeling knowing that there's a fair chance that my gf will be leaving for long term in a year's time...<br><br>Thoughts, anyone?<br></div></blockquote>Hi TS,<br><br>Ok like what other people said, this is going to be a test to the r/s. If ur gf really what to go oversea for studies, my advice is let her be. Although the chance that she will find another bf oversea, you cannot do anything. There is really nothing u can do.<br><br>From what i observe in my long distance r/s, many ended due to lack of communication. Therefore, the most important thing that u need to do is to spend time chit-chat with her on msn... dun find excuses that u are tired or lazy cos u are in army. I am in a worst state than u. Now i am having a tough time adjusting to uni life.<br><br>IF she indeed found a bf oversea, do give her ur blessing. Heartache a bit then just move on with life.<br><br>Just to share with u. I just rejected by a girl i like recently and i am still feeling the pain in my heart cos she totally ignored me despite i tried to initate a conversation. I just want to savage the friendship but apparently she doesn't want me to be her friend anymore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  Now i am so stressed up by my uni life that, i almost want to drop my double degree to a single degree. Luckily, i have a very patient and understanding mentor and now i am surviving quite well.<br><br>Therefore, don't think that u are in a very bad state now, there are always people worser than u --- take this as a comfort. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the replies.  I can foresee the difficulties in maintaining a long distance r/s esp. while I'm still in NS.  I'd prolly break off if it were to come to that...save both parties hurt and trouble later on...<br><br>Anyway I'm not going to think so much for now.<br><br>But I will not stay totally out of the matter once she is done with her exams.  If she, not her parents, truly wants to study overseas then I'll give her my blessings.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
