            <div class='col-md body'>Last time I used to be jealous and irritated the moment my dear mentioned his ex crush or said that he talked to her...<br><br>But now after thousands of reassurances and all his actions seem to show that he and the girl are nothing but just close friends, I have learnt to take it easy and give him more freedom to mingle with his friends. It is kinda unfair to force him to get rid of a friend just because I am being overly possessive and unreasonable.<br><br>I think it would help if you talk to your bf about her, reassure him no matter how many times that you are really true to him and you are just friends and nothing more with your ex. And put your words into action, show your bf that he can always count on you and trust you. Sooner or later he will not even bring up this issue anymore.<br><br>It is just an issue of insecurities on his part I guess...</div>
