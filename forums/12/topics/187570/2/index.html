            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by nerfz:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi everyone, i dunno why i am i always so nervous and shy around girls... is it a turn off to girls..? i also have low self-esteem and low confidence about myself because i have an unattractive phyisque.. and i have quite a broad shoulders so i look kind of weird... and its always hard to buy new clothes for myself.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>btw anyone know where to cut a presentable and new hairstyle for guys.. and where to get comfortable and presentable clothes for ppl like me..<br><br>i really hope i can change myself.. i really hate myself  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>reality check: nervousness means u are not urself. not attractive to gals. being urself means u are like ur natural self when around ur male buddies.<br><br>to give u hope: success doesnt mean u must be attached or married. ppl who are attached or married are not necessarily happy. Having gals in ur life doesnt mean u will be happy.<br><br>what u shd do: Focus on making urself happy by indulging in hobbies that you like and take part in more social activities will make you more confident. As for ur image, maybe u shd ask those ppl who have a good dress sense and help u out.<br><br>Don't focus on hitting on gals. Really know them as a sincere human being and as a friend. Just treat them like ur male buddies. Show true curiosity. Just relax and have fun. Sooner or later ur charisma will be like no other.<br><br>Last but not least, there is no point reading all the posts here. Go outside and practise ur social skills. U will learn much more. Get going pal.</div>
