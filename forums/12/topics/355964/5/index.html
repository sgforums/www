              <p>Hi ts.</p>
              <p>In your case, since it is a 3 year relationship. Perhaps you would consider your decision again. I would strongly advise you to think again .. but most likely end it better bah. You 'll never know when she will go stray again.</p>

              <p>How about a different perspective?</p>
              <p>If you were the one whom wronged others, you would certainly hope for forgiveness. Now that you've being wronged, you can't offer to her what you would hope to recieve?</p>
              <p>But if you genuinely feel that it's impossible to continue with this relationship, just let it go gracefully. Just because she cheated on you for whatever reasons, doesn't mean you've the right to mistreat her - 2 wrongs don't make 1 right, pal.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>You didn't specify the number of men who separate sex from love
              so I speak for myself.</p>
              <p>There are men who associate physical connection with emotions
              and love. We don't separate the two because we don't settle for
              less than what we can get.</p>
              <p>And this is why in turn, women marry and cherish some men. And
              not others.</p>

              <p>You got it right Thick,</p>
              <p>Women has their way of revenge.</p>
              <p>You let her suffer for few years , she will find ways to rip your heart out... slowly.. but surely, the time will come.</p>
              <p>That's why I always recommend guys to treat their women well.</p>
              <p>The problem with your relationship it seems has nothing to do with maturity or lack of love.</p>
              <p>Rather.. the relationship existed at the wrong time. It happened at a time when you are busy building your future.. and she was left.. stranded.. on a lonely island , waiting for you. While she was attached to you.. she cannot see another in broad daylight.</p>
              <p>I suppose she just got sick of the waiting.. and decided to call it quits.. her way.</p>
              <p>When a woman tells you , she slept with another man.. the only purpose is to see how hurt you get.. The more hurt you are.. the bigger her gratification.</p>
              <p>I suggest you wait until you are truly ready for a relationship ..when everything else has been accomplished ...before you embark on another journey again. But PLEASE.. do not bring your excess baggage into the new relationship.</p>
              <p>Find someone who is also at the correct life phase as you. If you find someone who isn't ready. but you are.. it'll just become another emotional roller coaster for you.</p>
              <p>Remember, Age is just a number. I hope you can put your trust in another relationship when the right time comes and you meet the right person.</p>
              <p>Going into a relationship with half hearted effort  and without trust.. a relationship is bound to fail.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>SIM finance is almost like saying u are studying lousy cert.  for the paper to go for finance is CFA.  if not other very quantitative papers.</p>
              <p>so its thickskin being the real bullshiter and being sour grapes.  he is just too lousy and have a high sense of self worth.  so i guess he is the one who is actively sleeping around and then jumping on the gal because she is a good catch.</p>

              <p>hi</p>
              <p>i think thick skin is not an auditor for the way he write and
                  level of intelligence is too low for auditing.</p>
              <p>SIM finance is almost like saying u are studying lousy
                  cert.  for the paper to go for finance is CFA.  if not
                  other very quantitative papers.</p>
              <p>so its thickskin being the real bullshiter and being sour
                  grapes.  he is just too lousy and have a high sense of self
                  worth.  so i guess he is the one who is actively sleeping
                  around and then jumping on the gal because she is a good catch.</p>
              <p>cheers to stupid people who dont know who they are trying to
                  play with.</p>

              <p>Err.. Unker Alex, Yes we already know you big shot private investigator. Yes we know. your wife is accountant.</p>
              <p>Yes we know the economy not so good, so less hubby go out mess around.. so now you don't have many suspicious wifeys paying you to handle their infidelity cases .</p>
              <p>But, please don't come here in Aunt Agony to do your private detective work. I also don't think SGforum will pay you for your work here.</p>
              <p>And I don't doubt your wife is a big shot accountant and she looks down on the SIM cert. But everyone has their right to pursue whatever courses they deem suitable for their own career path.</p>
              <p>If you have anything you are agonizing over.. perhaps.. you have ego issues due to your wife earning more and she being the more knowledgeable one, then please start a new thread... we are more than willing to give you some two cents advise and help you deal with the agony.</p>
              <p>Thank you for being such a considerate person. OK ? Good.</p>

              <p>i mean his attitude as a guy sucks and i think he is not really honest and truthful so i dont think he actually love the gal instead its all a make believe story to make himself and his achievement look better than others!</p>

              <p>if i am not wrong he is just a serial pilanderer and reveling in this kind of farce.</p>
              <p>from what he wrote on the earlier messages - if anyone who had any real understanding of what is a relationship its very clear that this guy is not sincere and there is no real relationship - there is never any mention of actual care and concern just excuses and the constant focus on the sexual aspect  instead of other elements that make a good relationship.</p>

              <p>Unker Alex, welcome to online forums. You will realize that online forums are very much a virtual world. Everyone can claim to be somebody they are not in real life.</p>
              <p>If you are new to this world.. you will be shock.. but having a online persona is very common.</p>
              <p>Here.. they can act out their fantasy.</p>
              <p>A school student pretending to be a businessman.</p>
              <p>A ugly no lifer pretending to be a playboy.</p>
              <p>It's all in their head.</p>
              <p>So a person like you , who is out to expose the fakes.. the work will be endless.</p>
              <p>To enjoy the virtual world.. just take everything with a pinch of salt. If you choose to believe..believe.. if you choose to doubt.. then the best thing to do is to avoid coming online.</p>
              <p> OFcors there are people who are real. These people , they meet up in real person. Go to club30s forum or singlesclub etc.. they meet up for gathering.</p>

              <p>well,  i do go to other online forums but its not as much blatant lying and mud slinging plus promoting the wrong moral values as compared to this - sg forums.  there is no intelligent discussion instead its plainly based on wat the poster said and if everyone believed him then it would be quite bad especially attacks on other peoples character and reputation.</p>
              <p>i  believe his gal must also have loved him otherwise she would not have stayed so long in a relationship with him but his attitude n quick judgement shows very clearly to me as a man that he is only out for this gals beauty.</p>
              <p>i mean i am trying to be fair to both parties , its easier for a man to admit that he lost control compared to blaming his gal for being unfaithful  especially if its not true as a mans reputation is not affected by sexual indiscretion but for women it will be a very serious offence , if he wanted to seek private advice on handling this issue he need not ask on forums but ask his frens since this is a private matter -BGR , i am sure all of us have frens to consult in times of trouble, to disclose all these distasteful things not even assuming if he is jumping to conclusions or trying to debase the gal out of spite and painting himself as a victim is just too much.  just irresponsible behavior on the part of the guy. i think now that the gal is innocent and she did not have any affair with any married man. i think he is instead the married man who is trying to have an affair with an innocent gal.</p>
              <p>public forums being open, everyone is able to access and if untruths are not shot down then people will continue to believe what they read on the net. </p>

              <p>anyone who is new to sg forums will think that sg people has such petty concerns and discussions and advice that is so unplatable to stomach - its beyond human understanding like what worldly businessmen sugguested..</p>
              <p>i will suggest to my bosses to get this forum regulated at least. to stop spreading of rumours and malicious thinking not to mention down right crude thinking</p>

              <p>The online world is bigger than Singapore. I don't think you can regulate it entirely.. and I don't think it should be.</p>
              <p>It doesn't take a whole lot of intelligence to figure out everything posted in this forum is just a one sided account of the story, be it real or fake.</p>
              <p>When we women go confiding in our circle of friends.. we are also aware that the stories will always be one sided. Nobody is gonna tell you they deserved to be dumped or they are guilty of selfish acts.</p>
              <p>Like women, aunt agony just serve as an outlet to vent , and we , like all good girlfriends.. gives our support. Even though we knew the person is probably not telling the whole truth.</p>
              <p>Ofcors, we don't condone it, when the poster explicitly gives out the identitiy of the person involved.</p>

              <p>Hey Alexandra do you have an issues with me, if you do please go and die. I am just telling telling my problem. You even go to the extent of digging up posts previously, You have too much time.</p>
              <p>The previous posts are not written by me, i have some best friends who are depressed and they confide in me, i just tell them to post it here as a <strong>de-stress</strong> method. They are too lazy to register so i let them use my account, i only come to this forum using it as a <strong>de-stress method</strong>.</p>
              <p>Really i have apologise to you if i am rude but you just came biting my tail, i am poor in english, i wont deny. SIM is a commericial school, if you have money you can enrol, i wont deny that.</p>
              <p>The main point is all the while none of my posts have offended any people, when my friends use my account to post topics, i told them to tell their problems and people respond.</p>
              <p>I  am not rich like you, my de stress method is only running and writing in forum. Due to exam i do not wish to run so i post in here, i seriously never expect to meet an entity like you who i completely do not know but seem to have an eternal fuel with me.</p>
              <p>OK OK i apologise to any people who take their time to read this story and feel offended by it. If you seriously doubt my character and intergrity then stop coming in to this topic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Alexandra, to me you are just like a kid who is playing and arcade game and when you are about to win a final stage your character suddenly die and game over. Then you will feel depress and angry as you want a last laugh so you keep putting in token and you keep game over.</p>
              <p> If you want a last laugh you have already got it, i been ditch, i never complain i only post the previous reply as i want to close this topic.  Please do not kick me when i am down, i have already apologise to you if any of my language offend you.</p>
              <p>To me i am only helping my friend to tell their problems, some of them said it make them feel better to post a topic here and after that they register to be member. What is the issue with you, for example you are reading Singapore true ghost stories by russell lee, do you really believe all of it is real. We are all reading it for the entertainment, if you do not believe then go away pls so not insult my qualifications, my school and my job and also do not quarrel with some kind hearted people here who take their time to give me good advice. </p>

              <p> To me posting topic in here is really a de-stress method, i never frequently post any in here and i do not expect the pleasure and the honor of a hardworking guy who dug into topics i never realise was under my name just to insult me.</p>
              <p>I only give my best friend my sgforum account as its not important to me (its not my atm num) and also i just read through their topics written under my name, none of it is offensive to any people but i sincerely apologise if it offend any people out there, to me its just me offering a way to help my friend to deal with their problems.</p>
              <p>Through this experience i realise if someone have an issue with you no matter what you do, they will constantly find fault with you. I am only using this forum as a channel to relieve stress and ease my pain, i never realise i have to brush up my english, go through past topics and be accused a liar, loser from someone i never meet and never offended</p>
              <p>Well Mr Alexandra, i knew you will constantly find fault with me, i never said i was a victim in this relationship, i did neglect her for my job and i am suffering from the pain, i never blame her after i thought it out this few days. Time was the factor, as one of the advice given by a good forumer.</p>
              <p>Thats a good advice, it help me and thats the reason why i am here to get advice to ease my pain, i never see whats wrong with it. Why must you even deprived me of this method of de-stressing my anger and betrayal <strong>When </strong>i have no issue with you.</p>
              <p>This is my last time coming to this forum, i will not use this de-stress method anymore.</p>

              <p>i will suggest to my bosses to get this forum regulated at

              <p>I mean who seriously goes n dig up thier old posts n start to compare n stuff. I hell as dun have the time man..</p>
              <p>But if u think u r on a mission to do it, by all means.. SEXPOSE. U already said that people easily believe the bullshit , lies and more lies. How can u blame us, when we have doubts to your own credibility ? Right ? U know, if u dig out his inconsistencies , MAYBE, we'll check it out ourselves n decide for ourselves capiche ?</p>
              <p>Hell , i was even told who do what to who in PM's... but honestly, i cant even trust the who that told me the who. Thats how fucked up online forums are man. Thats just how it is man. I once thought like you, to sexpose... to weed out the bullshit. But , i got my own shit to do, hell, its gonna be a full time job just smelling them out. And i am not dedicated.</p>
              <p>If you think u can really tell your 'bossess' and have them have the authority to even meddle with the regulatory policy of sgforums, go ahead man. But if u cant even remotely have any hand or influence in affecting sgforums policy, u may just end up bullshitting like the rest of the people here man.</p>

              <p><a href="/users/252918">Alexander 88</a>, if u are so unhappy with things here, why do you still waste your time coming here? This is a public forum where any and everyone is free to post. Clones are common, frauds are common and this is the online world. There are genuine ppl and sure to have some fake people but so what?</p>
              <p>People who choose to post, choose to believe in the problem. Regardless real or fake, whats your problem against it? Your opinion was not specifically asked for so if you feel its fake, you are not required to mention anything at all. Noone will care whether an extra person comments or not especially if its just offensive posts.</p>
              <p>If you just want the truth about everything, please leave the online world and don't ever bother wasting your time on forums if you cannot face the facts about the online world and come complaining about obvious facts.</p>

              <p>ok</p>
              <p>i am doubly confirmed that this thickskin is just riding on sg forummer concern and pity</p>
              <p>look at his other earlier posts on his so called gal fren and his attitude</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/233270">http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/233270</a></p>

              <p>i mean his attitude as a guy sucks and i think he is not really honest and truthful so i dont think he actually love the gal instead its all a make believe story to make himself and his achievement look better than others!</p>
              <p>pinhead! other guys responses are so much better and they are actually trying to help you but instead u take their sympathy for granted.</p>
              <p>this man is a liar and he thinks its a mans way... so let other men prove that its not necessary to resort to despicable means in order to get what u want.</p>
              <p>asshole.</p>
              <p>if i am not wrong he is just a serial pilanderer and reveling in this kind of farce.</p>
              <p>from what he wrote on the earlier messages - if anyone who had any real understanding of what is a relationship its very clear that this guy is not sincere and there is no real relationship - there is never any mention of actual care and concern just excuses and the constant focus on the sexual aspect  instead of other elements that make a good relationship.</p>
              <p>if i were the gal , i would also ditch him . just shaming all the guys for being "uncontrollable"  while rationising his actions as being right  and thinking that all females are just stupid.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>This is a place where folks who have issues would come here to seek solutions or just have their problems bared, someone to listen, AND not be to subjected to a thorough civil investigation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This site is but a place for them to bare their thoughts without fear or favour. and at times, may be the only place of annonymity to bare it. Some of the tales here may be true, or be false, or something that happened to someone else and they didnt understand and would like to seek an understanding.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most who show concern or help do it willingly, not for money or for fame, nothing more than an expression of their thoughts of concern for their own fellow-person who cried for help.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If such cries are fake, then it is not the counsellor who is made a fool. He/she gave with an open heart but was abused by a despicable scum. It is the despicable scum who is the fool and will have to pay a price one day. No person escapes from guilt which will come around one day to haunt him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is better to err on the side of helpfulness, than to be too cautious and suspect everyone else is a clown and ignore offering help. At times, a precious life may be involved, and the counsellor will be one who will be haunted by guilt, just as many of us were when a 14 yr old teenager was murdered by her own mother, her cries denied and not recognised by her friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do respect your concern for others and not wish to see them being taken for a ride, but here many are not stupid and willingly gave their thoughts, not only to help any TS on his/her own thread, but an open source to others who may fear or do not know how to express themselves in writing, that they may relate and have an understanding as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is a larger picture than you may presume on your perceived superficial level of one thread. Each bring his/her own level of expertise and experience into a thread, to contribute towards the well being of our fellow society members, for good or for bad which the reader must intelligently and analytically discern, proving we may not be as apathetic a society as many presumed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I personally thank you for your efforts, but I sincerly hope you will understand what i had posted, and perhaps be more astute, charitable and prudent should you wish to offer your assitance to your fellow society member.</p>

              <p>The more i think of it, the more angrier i am, Mr Alexandra. Why must you say auditors and accountants need to have a strong command of english.</p>
              <p>I have taken essay based exams, Business law, company and taxation law, accounting theory and Ethical issue in audtiting. All of this are essay based questions, they need a good foundation of english i have to admit. But the main points the markers are seeking is how does one argue their cases based on the relevant company and accountants act.</p>
              <p>My company act is UK based so i am using UK company cases and the accountant guidelines i study is Sarbanes Oxley Act  and Clerp 9, Ramsay Report etc. Any accounting student will be able to verify that, i know or any layman can check it in the internet.</p>
              <p>The thing is , i am just a junior auditor, its not a glamorous job like bankers and doctors but i respect this job. The language you are using is clearly abusive of my profession</p>
