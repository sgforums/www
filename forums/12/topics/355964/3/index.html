              <p> i guess that the gal is the one who is an auditor and

                  soft skills needed to do the job and hardworking enough to
                  take additional certs and u are the one who is sleeping around and
                  then after discovering that she is about to dump u , which is a hit
                  to your ego , u tried to discredit her first by saying she is loose
                  and be a good man in this respect.</p>

              <p>hi there</p>
              <p>i didnt want to really hang out at sg forums as u can see its my
              first few posting as i always thought sg forums are for kids.</p>
              <p>but your post happened to be the first one on the forum so i m
              here,, and i started reading so i decided to do some analysis
               so simple and then i realised its a tale.</p>
              <p>because all your facts dont match. if u went to a good UK
              university , would ur english be so poor until u have typos? most
              sg pple wont even have any typos in their work because english is
              so natural to them already. and SIM dont have a master in finance
              only tax.  since i am a bit free now due to a meeting being
              cancelled then i can slowly guess what happened.</p>
              <p> i guess that the gal is the one who is an auditor and
              taking master course because only gals are auditors because of the
              soft skills needed to do the job and hardworking enough to
              take additional certs and u are the one who is sleeping around and
              then after discovering that she is about to dump u , which is a hit
              to your ego , u tried to discredit her first by saying she is loose
              and be a good man in this respect.</p>
              <p>if she went with a married guy then she must be really
              courageous for love or plain silly to sacrifice her name for
              nothing.</p>
              <p>anyway if u really love your gal , greater love is to consider
              and  or even accept as i know of a brother who did tat. 
              but its quite telling that u cant even stand receiving sms from her
              every day which means there is no proper communication and u dont
              enjoy talking to her and not even spending time  with her then
              wat kind of a relationship are u expecting . the unfaithfulness
              issue being so important means u are looking more to a physical
              relationship tats all which is not to be blamed but its just
              immature.</p>
              <p>and anyway if u are so stressed over her which means u actually
              loved her then u should seek psychological counselling to examine
              ur wandering thoughts. i am a guy and i know what that means. i got
              a strong brain and strong body to resist temptations but i guess UK
              had taught pple bad  - cocaine ?  no one smokes cocaine
              in sg. only UK.</p>
              <p>ok stop dissing a fellow man who is weak i should be aunt agony
              now ok cut off the relationship for  u have no time and u
              dont enjoy communicating with your gal then how to get close plus u
              have some psychological problem as mentioned from your earlier post
              of some suspicous stuff</p>
              <p>anyway with ur kind of ungracious lower level thinking which is
              very clear from your attitudes and speech which thinks that only
              they are holy and others are not holy which dont really demonstrate
              the better ideals in life</p>
              <p>oh i saw many case of adultery  that is almost all the time
              due to the men straying or having affairs because its just normal
              so i naturally jumped to the guy first  even when i am a guy.
              only guys will see sex as important and sex in a woman is
              condemnation if its not with him. sad to know of this kind of dark
              thinking still exist. cant be helped loh</p>
              <p>unfaithful men are common but unfaithful women are not exactly
              common as most women tend to value marriage unless they belong to
              the super extroverted types</p>
              <p>so i guess its a men issue here sad to say bud u are in the
              wrong and its even more wrong not to admit and instead blame a
              woman for your mistake like no communication and no time which
              indicate no love loh then why are u with the gal ?</p>
              <p>i was just unlucky to be born with many elder sisters so i do
              respect women a fair bit , they are not just objects of play but
              really people whom u can spend time with and share a life
              with.  too bad u got youur priorities wrong</p>
              <p>thick skinned from ur nick i already knew u are a damm good
              liar, only a liar can lie like anything if they are thick
              skinned.</p>
              <p>pity the gal.</p>

              <p>hi there</p>
              <p>i didnt want to really hang out at sg forums as u can see its my first few posting as i always thought sg forums are for kids.</p>
              <p>but your post happened to be the first one on the forum so i m here,, and i started reading so i decided to do some analysis  so simple and then i realised its a tale.</p>
              <p>because all your facts dont match. if u went to a good UK university , would ur english be so poor until u have typos? most sg pple wont even have any typos in their work because english is so natural to them already. and SIM dont have a master in finance only tax.  since i am a bit free now due to a meeting being cancelled then i can slowly guess what happened.</p>
              <p> i guess that the gal is the one who is an auditor and taking master course because only gals are auditors because of the soft skills needed to do the job and hardworking enough to take additional certs and u are the one who is sleeping around and then after discovering that she is about to dump u , which is a hit to your ego , u tried to discredit her first by saying she is loose and be a good man in this respect.</p>
              <p>if she went with a married guy then she must be really courageous for love or plain silly to sacrifice her name for nothing.</p>
              <p>anyway if u really love your gal , greater love is to consider and  or even accept as i know of a brother who did tat.  but its quite telling that u cant even stand receiving sms from her every day which means there is no proper communication and u dont enjoy talking to her and not even spending time  with her then wat kind of a relationship are u expecting . the unfaithfulness issue being so important means u are looking more to a physical relationship tats all which is not to be blamed but its just immature.</p>
              <p>and anyway if u are so stressed over her which means u actually loved her then u should seek psychological counselling to examine ur wandering thoughts. i am a guy and i know what that means. i got a strong brain and strong body to resist temptations but i guess UK had taught pple bad  - cocaine ?  no one smokes cocaine in sg. only UK.</p>
              <p>ok stop dissing a fellow man who is weak i should be aunt agony now ok cut off the relationship for  u have no time and u dont enjoy communicating with your gal then how to get close plus u have some psychological problem as mentioned from your earlier post of some <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">suspicous</span></strong></span> stuff</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>anyway with ur kind of ungracious lower level thinking which is
              very clear from your attitudes and speech which thinks that only
              they are holy and others are not holy which dont really demonstrate
              the better ideals in life</p>

              <p>Yours is the lowest of low levels. You are such a lowlife scum unbefitting of existence. You are the one who thinks and have a twarped perception of how one side is holy. Get a life~.</p>
