              <p>oh i saw many case of adultery  that is almost all the time
              due to the men straying or having affairs because its just normal
              so i naturally jumped to the guy first  even when i am a guy.
              only guys will see sex as important and sex in a woman is
              condemnation if its not with him. sad to know of this kind of dark

              <p>unfaithful men are common but unfaithful women are not exactly

              <p><br><br>I have been observing the
                  going-ons on this thread for quite some time and I am disturbed with
                  what you wrote. That PATRONISING attitude of yours... The way you DEMEAN OTHERS by talking and scandalizing them is out of place. Is such a LOGICAL DEBATE SO STUPID???<br><br> <br><br>Are you trying to say you are superior to others? You are insulting other people's intelligence when you say,<br><br> <br>"<br>because all your facts dont match. if u went to a good UK
                                          university , would ur english be so poor until u have typos? most
                                          sg pple wont even have any typos in their work because english is
                                          so natural to them already. and SIM dont have a master in finance
                                          only tax.  since i am a bit free now due to a meeting being
                                          cancelled then i can slowly guess what happened.<br>"</p>

                  entitled to express their views. But yours is different. Your post has no good value at all. In this entire thread IMHO the most ridiculous comment was
                  the one you made. Why don't
                  you jolly well do some self-reflection and practice what you preach.
                  Are you so high and mighty and above others? Just imagine how much
                  anger, contempt and displeasure I have for those comments of yours that
                  I have to write this down here.<br><br> <br><br>You sure people don't think before posting stuff???<br><br> <br>PLEASE! GROW UP!<br><br><br><br>Practice what you preach. This is definitely not the way to
                  treat other forumites. Highly outrageous behaviour. Are you proud to say
                  that you generalise and "bully" others like that? Your comments irk me and I do believe
                  it irks others as well. Such highly snobbish attitude is unbecoming of an adult.<br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br>Your post is so freaking repulsive. You need a reality check. And that being said from a third party's perspective. Such patronising attitude too... Wanna get flamed? Too bad, you just degraded yourself to a much inferior creature which u are.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br>You don't deserve a friend. Why? Coz you are treating other people worse than how we treat cockroaches. Get a life. I do stuff for a reason. You don't and that is evident through your post. Such a lowly creature...You
                  know what? You are the coward here. Don't think you are so much better than
                  him or me. You are just such a lowlife person, seeking attention. Purely like scum, I should say.<br><br> <br><br>I
                  hope I never meet you. Yes I do mean that. You know why? Coz you are
                  just so damn repulsive. You are disgusting in every sense of the word.
                  Trying to treat others and generalising people is
                  behaviour befitting of a bitch. How ludicrous. How ironic that you call someone else a weak person when
                  you prolly are the biggest one here.</p>

              <p>Then what about your behaviour. By generalising people that is not sucky??? You have nothing concrete to say thus you say things like let the moderator bar u from posting short replies that flooded the entire post. You are so stupid. I have already mentioned that I am unable to string and multiple quote due to errors in my Internet Browser.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh and I pity your life experience, becoz I believe you must have had a very horrid one. Then again, it is not a good reason to generalise and spite others.</p>

              <p>So? I have a cousin(male) who have five elder sisters and no brother. He didn't suffer hell. I wonder how badly you must have had been treated by your sisters coz there is nothing wrong being gu niang and being gu niang doesn't mean you don't believe and give others the benefit of the doubt here. You are seriously out of touch with reality.</p>

              <p>That is only a theory, and the problem of theories is that there must be a substantial amount of further study in it, under more circumstances and environments to obtain repeatable results to prove a conclusive evidence of such theories. Pfaff's theory are unfortunately fully disputable when other conditions are applied to subject tests. </p>
              <p>Even till today. Darwin's evolution theory is still disputable, so much less for your 'plucking' of a theory to support your discriminatory dream lifestyle.</p>

              <p><br>Just like relationships don’t blossom overnight, they don’t simply die overnight.  <br><br>Forgiveness is a leap of faith. It takes immense strength in character and will power to forgive and move forward. To make whole once again, what was broken. Authors have written about it, philosophers have pondered over it, some couples overcome betrayal, and others don’t so they never will. <br><br>From the moment the both of you fall in love, the gradual need to feel desired by the person you love, your feelings of pressure from everyday responsibilities, her feelings of neglect from the lack of physical intimacy, the moment she strayed, the moment she came clean until the moment you decide to break up…. there are a million strings attached to every decision made. These strings are actions that influence what comes next. <br><br>When you do decide on how to handle the situation, commit to that decision and never look back.</p>

              <p>Dear Worldlybusinessman,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You didn't specify the number of men who separate sex from love so I speak for myself.</p>
              <p>There are men who associate physical connection with emotions and love. We don't separate the two because we don't settle for less than what we can get.</p>
              <p>And this is why in turn, women marry and cherish some men. And not others.</p>
