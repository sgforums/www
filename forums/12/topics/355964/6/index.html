              <p>The more i think of it, the more angrier i am, Mr Alexandra. Why must you say auditors and accountants need to have a strong command of english.</p>
              <p>I have taken essay based exams, Business law, company and taxation law, accounting theory and Ethical issue in audtiting. All of this are essay based questions, they need a good foundation of english i have to admit. But the main points the markers are seeking is how does one argue their cases based on the relevant company and accountants act.</p>
              <p>My company act is UK based so i am using UK company cases and the accountant guidelines i study is Sarbanes Oxley Act  and Clerp 9, Ramsay Report etc. Any accounting student will be able to verify that, i know or any layman can check it in the internet.</p>
              <p>The thing is , i am just a junior auditor, its not a glamorous job like bankers and doctors but i respect this job. The language you are using is clearly abusive of my profession</p>

              <p>well,  i do go to other online forums but its not as much
              blatant lying and mud slinging plus promoting the wrong moral
              values as compared to this - sg forums.  there is no
              intelligent discussion instead its plainly based on wat the poster
              said and if everyone believed him then it would be quite bad
              especially attacks on other peoples character and reputation.</p>
              <p>i  believe his gal must also have loved him otherwise she
              would not have stayed so long in a relationship with him but his
              attitude n quick judgement shows very clearly to me as a man that
              he is only out for this gals beauty.</p>
              <p>i mean i am trying to be fair to both parties , its easier for a
              man to admit that he lost control compared to blaming his gal for
              being unfaithful  especially if its not true as a mans
              reputation is not affected by sexual indiscretion but for women it
              will be a very serious offence , if he wanted to seek private
              advice on handling this issue he need not ask on forums but ask his
              frens since this is a private matter -BGR , i am sure all of us
              have frens to consult in times of trouble, to disclose all these
              distasteful things not even assuming if he is jumping to
              conclusions or trying to debase the gal out of spite and painting
              himself as a victim is just too much.  just irresponsible
              behavior on the part of the guy. i think now that the gal is
              innocent and she did not have any affair with any married man. i
              think he is instead the married man who is trying to have an affair
              with an innocent gal.</p>
              <p>public forums being open, everyone is able to access and if
              untruths are not shot down then people will continue to believe
              what they read on the net. </p>
              <p>i am not  the first person to suspect that he is writing a
              tale.</p>
              <p>i am so disgusted that sg forums is so unmoderated and the
              topics of discussion is worse than any newspaper.</p>
              <p>anyone who is new to sg forums will think that sg people has
              such petty concerns and discussions and advice that is so
              unplatable to stomach - its beyond human understanding like what
              worldly businessmen sugguested..</p>
              <p>i will suggest to my bosses to get this forum regulated at
              least. to stop spreading of rumours and malicious thinking not to
              mention down right crude thinking</p>

              <p>If you do not post, no one will say that you can't type.</p>
              <p>Don't air an opinion for the sake of airing it. Use the grey matter in between your ears, dude.</p>
              <p>The rules here in AA are simple, if you think that problem seems genuine and you want to help him/her, go ahead, else just shut up and be a quiet observer. thickskin23 doesn't deserve the attacks on "character and reputation" you levied on him which incidentally are the very ones you are condemning.</p>
              <p>Talk about hypocrisy. You epitomise it.</p>

To moralize about her is unwise. Negate the ego - life happens each breathing moment. If u are hurting - it is not u who is really hurting, it the lack of love within u, it is who u think u are, what u think of love or wht u think of life (EGO!) If one is centred within oneself, one is being essential , if not, one remains accidental, always.</p>
