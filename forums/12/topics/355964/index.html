              <p>Its always said that a guy cannot bear his girl to be in bed with another guy while a girl cannot stand a guy whose heart is not with her. Guys cannot bear it if they loss the physical body of the girl while girls cannot stand to loss the feelings and love of a guy.</p>
              <p>I would say it depends on how much you love her. Its hard to accept that she slept with some other guy before but if u do love her then you should give her a chance and if you don't just breakup, don't be such a selfish asshole and lie to her to dump her later.</p>

              <p>Just dump her and ignore her sms then. Just saying shes wants to suicide etc is common and she won't do it. As what a counsellor will say, only people who give u a detail plan of how they intend to commit suicide should be paid serious attention since they have thought of the entire process. People who just say they will suicide etc are much less likely to do it.</p>

              <p>When you tell her you will only talk after the exam.. you are essentially just stringing her along. You are giving her false hope.</p>
              <p>Give her a clear cut answer. If she wants to throw a fit, it's her right to do so. There is nothing much you can do.</p>
              <p>The relationship died the night she slept with that man ( married or not it doesn't matter).</p>
              <p>Frankly, when a woman sleeps with another man and tells you what she did, there is only one thing she wants out of it...to hurt you.</p>
              <p>Surely, she cannot expect more love to come out of this confession.</p>
              <p>So let this go, don't go into self denial.. face the problem head on.</p>
              <p>Trying to hide the problem by delaying the outcomes.. only torments the both of you.</p>
              <p>When love is gone.. it's gone. Perhaps you are just trying to vindicate what she did to you. But I can assure you, it's not worth it at all.</p>
