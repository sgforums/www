What is she trying to show??<br><br>Anyway, I discovered that she is a gossiper and whoever is a threat to her, she would bad mouth to other colleagues. She is damn inefficient but knows really well how to suck up to the boss, doing this for him and that for him...so the boss likes her quite a lot.<br><br>What should i do now?? Can anyone advise me?? Why do I have such a unsophisticated and gossipy colleague? I have worked for 7 yrs but have never encountered such a type of person...I am just so upset that i hope she disappears from the surface of earth.<br><br>Can anyone tell me what should i do??

Lastly, a few days later, send a email to her and all colleagues in your department and buy her lunch. Praise her subtlely in front of everybody, try to get her to let her guard down on you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>one more advise..since you are new, i will strongly advise you to watch (observe the fire from opposite-another stratergy) and observe the stituation more..knowing the boss for 10 yrs doesnt mean anything...the boss may not like her, you don know..she may know a lot of things about her work and the boss has no choice, she is also most likely to keep some skills for herself that is so valued..learnt her skills secretly,be humble.<br><br>know stuffs like, what is the characteristics of your boss? shrewd or loyal? meaning will he removed the old thing if he found out you can do her work?afterall she has been so long in the company and the salary she is drawing may be enough to hired 2 you or will your boss valued relationship?<br><br>if you really want to play such game...it will be very tiring...so the choice is up to you...maybe you can just be yourself...</div>
