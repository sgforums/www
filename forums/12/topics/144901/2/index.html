            <div class='col-md body'>What if colleagues do unjust to you (backstab u during their appraisal sessions when u tot things are ok) and still expects you to talk to them? if you don't, you are accused of not having teamwork. What if u are really sick of their lies and hypocripsy?<br><br>What if they interfere with the way you work with your assistant (via emails) just to put you down in front of bosses? What if your assistant was bought over and forward your emails to them just to interpret/misinterpret your emails when she was fine with it for many years?<br><br>What if they openly verbally abused you in front of the whole department , calling you names and boss didn't even interfere, will you still stay on / talk to them? What if you were expected to talk to them after the session and be "evaluated" by the rest whether u talk to them or not. What will u do?<br><br>What if they had unfairly accused you of "hogging" your assistant (to be shared as well), and suggested a change of supervisor? (when most of their projects were already outsourced while u were working on a report. Your assistant did a sloppy job and you had to work thru weekends and public holidays to complete the job.) Will you let them achieve their ultimate aim, since your assistant has been bought over anyway?</div>

(surprisingly)  she was  promoted to GM another year later.  i was senior sales co-ordinator then.<br><br>she, together with myself and a few other colleagues were very close prior to her promotion.  we went for short trips, have CNY dinner, mahjong session at my place, go out at least a few times a week and whatnot.<br><br>after her promotion everything changed.  she was always picking on me.  she accused me of being; in comfort zone for too long; clock watcher; not controlling my subordinates etc.  on and off she will ask me to her desk with silly accusations.  once she banged the table and yelled so loud everybody could hear it.  she apologised for being rude but insist the shoutiing was necessary.<br><br>my last year at the company was the worst i ever had.  i dreaded going to work.<br><br>the last straw was what i posted earlier about my subordinate complaining that she is loaded with work and the subsequent e-mail i got from my new spanish boss.  i quitted my job late nov, forfeiting my bonus.<br><br>working life sucks, female colleagues sucks even more, female boss sucks super big time.<br><br></div>
