Him wanting to see people break has nothing to do with being a chee hong kia. That is simply out of point. You can say he is evil for wanting to see people break, but it has nothing to do with being a buaya.<br><br>For example, as a guy I don't like my guy friend's boyfriend. Hence, I want to see them break. So what? That makes me a buayee?<br><br>If someone comes and tells you to stop being friends with a girl just because he is her boyfriend, you won't like it either. Even if that female friend isn't someone very close to you. If the boyfriend/girlfriend of my friend is going to be so close-minded, then I'd rather that friend of mine not be with that person. So yeah, in that situation I'd like to see them break.<br><br>And there are people who enjoy watching such things happen because its gossip worthy. I personally don't like it or agree with it, but still, it's a different thing from being buaya/chee hong kia.<br><br>The TS may or may not be a good person, maybe he should be more sensitive towards the feelings of others, that's all open to debate. But to just simply label him as a chee hong kia because he's friendly with girls? And so the boyfriend gets to choose who should be his gf's friends and who should not? As the bf, does the other guy have the right to accuse others of making a pass at his gf even when they are not? I'm sure you don't like getting wronged by others as well do you?<br><br>I stand by my stand that a fair number of the people here are close-minded and in fact also insecure. It's a different thing if TS has been flirting with other ppl's gf and if by all means, call him a chee hong kia or bastard. But most of the guys here are just jumping to conclusions and assume that any guy who is able to be friendly with girls is a chee hong kia.<br><br>Some people just need to grow up.</div>

Let me ask you, is it totally possible that someone who isn't the TS would disagree that he is a buaya?
