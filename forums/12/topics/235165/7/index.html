Unlike you, I will not drag other peoples gf's/family into things and get personal.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>i have also make mentioned to her abt having a "safety line", if pple cross the line, u gotta be alert, tats how i got rid of chee hongs like the threadstarter</blockquote></div>Please also see what I have said about the TS in another post to another forumite.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>of cos i make sure for my side, everything is answerable to her as well, i duno if u think i m insercure, but having a fixed system like this , it cuts down on baseless accusations between us, likewise i am always open to her views on my female friends</strong></div></blockquote>That's good.

Nothing he says confirms that as well. At least, not based on his posts here alone. Basically I'm not going to make a blind assumption about people and their relationships.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>so right now, u r supporting the threadstarter, so to me, it makes u one also</strong></div></blockquote>WTF???? Please stop proving to me you are close minded. Also read my posts carefully instead of replying based on knee-jerk reaction. You absolutely have no idea what I was supporting or against in the first place do you?<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>u call me young ? can i say u r personally attacking me ? how do u know i m young ? </blockquote></div>Because I remember seeing your posts about two years ago that you were still in army. And by young, I didn't mean primary 5 or primary 6.<br><br><strong>[quote]<br>hope this will clear the air, i m not accusing u, i m a bery objective person, i say things based on facts<br></strong>Erm.... Which part of what you said about my gf were 'facts'? Also, what fact do you have about TS farking other people's gf (he may or he may not, not proven).<br><br>Comparing this post and your previous, the last one was much more impulsive in nature. This post though doesn't change the <span style="color: red;">fact</span> that you were making a personal attack on someone else and you even dragged their gf into it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To ah_tee, for your convenience I am a few of the posts I've made in this thread here. Please read the entire post instead of getting it all wrong again.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><strong>Seeing how quick so many 'guys' here are so quick to call TS a Chee Hong Kia, Buaya, and how he deserves to get a beating, it kind of indicates how close-minded an insecure some Singaporean guys are.</strong>[/quote]<br><br>I did not name ah_tee here. Neither did I say all/whole lot. If anything, I was being rather general about it. But not once did I say "ah_tee and his buddies" or something like that.<br></div><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>Just what is wrong with being good friends with a person of the opposite sex? Just because you are not able to have good friends of the opposite sex doesn't mean others can't. Get a life.</blockquote></div></blockquote>I don't understand, which part of my posts did I ever say it was ok to flirt with or to fark other people's gf?<br><br><strong>[quote]A lot of times, I find Singaporeans like to call someone who's friendly a buaya or whatever is usually because they are red-eyed. Because these are the people who in such a position will be the one who is Chee Hong and Buaya. To them being friendly with a girl means being buaya. They distrust other guys because they themselves are the ones who cannot be trusted. <span style="color: red;">Not saying all are like that, but there is a large proportion of them who are like that. By them I refer to people who easily label others as Chee Hong or Buaya.</span><br><br>Actually, a lot of Singapore girls a pretty close-minded too. Sometimes they think that just because a guy is friendly to them means he has an ulterior motive. My friend in fact once pointed out to me that he finds it easier to get along with attached female friends. Mainly because his female friends are less likely to speculate if the guy is interested in her or something like that, since they're already attached.<br><br>Quite frankly, Singaporeans are just too close-minded. Grow up you guys.</strong></div>
