What we do here is just suggesting some alternatives and solutions to the people in agony.<br><br>Personally I feel the same thing as you, Yunhaier. We don't have the 'right and obligations' to instruct them what they want to do. But it's unavoidable when someone posts this kind of thread. We just can't sit around and pretend nothing has happened.<br><br>They posted because they wanted some directions. Maybe a little push forward. Maybe something else...<br><br>So in the end, it's not us, it's still them.</div></blockquote>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  v</div>
