What you can do is try your bestto convince him that even though he is leader he should do some work. Maybe say that "Maybe you could do some of the work too for the sake or fairness etc." if it fails go see your prof/lecturer and explain to him the predicament. Worse case scenario, you all kick him out and elect one of the remaining 4 grp leader....everyones happy (except him hehe)</div>

Ask for appropriate advice and suggestion from the lecturer (try to be professional, this is not a sabotage session - at least it don't necessarily has to be one... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ).. The thing is just to let everyone have an idea as to how the project is advancing and what's the problem. Sub - let them feel a bit of 'pressure' not coming directly from you but your 'boss' or overall in-charge. If they wanna take chances with their grading, then go ahead and IDLE.<br><br>'Don't know' is never a solution nor a reason for things to be set aside. Worse if you start to run your own show (I've did that before so I know)... Understand that the project is not about 'work' alone, but 'team work'... And 'team work' is not only about 'pointing fingers', as eventually nothing good would come out of it and relationship &amp; results would only have to suffer for it in the end...<br><br>Have your own 'meet up' sessions. It's IMPORTANT. Don't accept things like 'no time'. As per mentioned, keep a minis or something about such 'meet ups'. Make it FORMAL. No time for meetings either mean that you're doing GREAT for your allocations and we're expecting a GOOD PIECE from you or you have totally NO TIME for the PROJECT. In the latter case, no time for the project means the person deserves NO SCORE.<br><br>During your 'meet ups', discuss the problems each of you are going through and offer either appropriate re-allocation of job scope or allow team to contribute to suggestions and solutions. List down the next 'action plan' to be done and executed by the responsible project mate. Update on next meet up.</div>

Ask for appropriate advice and suggestion from the lecturer (try to be professional, this is not a sabotage session - at least it don't necessarily has to be one... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ).. The thing is just to let everyone have an idea as to how the project is advancing and what's the problem. Sub - let them feel a bit of 'pressure' not coming directly from you but your 'boss' or overall in-charge. If they wanna take chances with their grading, then go ahead and IDLE.<br><br>'Don't know' is never a solution nor a reason for things to be set aside. Worse if you start to run your own show (I've did that before so I know)... Understand that the project is not about 'work' alone, but 'team work'... And 'team work' is not only about 'pointing fingers', as eventually nothing good would come out of it and relationship &amp; results would only have to suffer for it in the end...<br><br>Have your own 'meet up' sessions. It's IMPORTANT. Don't accept things like 'no time'. As per mentioned, keep a minis or something about such 'meet ups'. Make it FORMAL. No time for meetings either mean that you're doing GREAT for your allocations and we're expecting a GOOD PIECE from you or you have totally NO TIME for the PROJECT. In the latter case, no time for the project means the person deserves NO SCORE.<br><br>During your 'meet ups', discuss the problems each of you are going through and offer either appropriate re-allocation of job scope or allow team to contribute to suggestions and solutions. List down the next 'action plan' to be done and executed by the responsible project mate.

There are 6 of us in the team.<br><br>So we've a guy who's tries to show that he is very "siao on" by self electing himself as a leader and started allocating work to the other 5 (including me), leaving none to himself.<br><br>He will make the excuse that he'll overseeing the project and handling the liasing work with outsiders and monitoring the progress etc. And he pretended to be busy when everyone else is busy with their work. Very soon, even the liasing work was pushed to me. He was saying, "can you call/email him and make an appoinment etc., I've got to read the report format first etc."<br><br>During the project, it involves doing cold calling on companies to see whether they're interested in a course. So this self-appointed team leader was reluctant to do cold calling himself. So he assigned the other 5 to do the dirty work, while saying, "I've got other issues to settle, you know, administrative issue." So while others are calling and getting their ego bruised, he was happily and selfishly settling his own school work and reading his emails at his leisure.<br><br>And then occassionally, he'll ask those who are calling, "So have you managed to get any new positive response?" When told no, he'll say, "No. This is very bad. Keep calling more. I want positive answers..." and even if it's a yes, he'll say," that's not enough. You see, you should never assume that they'll confirm agree to the course even if you managed to get an appointment with the person in charge. We need to call extra companies to have backups. So you need to keep calling more companies..."<br><br>Damn him.

Can understand that.. I used to do that during my previous projects in school... Working experience helps alot when it comes to management.... In project management, there's a form of time management which states that you should cut the deadline by some grace... So that when things go wrong, you can actually 'save' it... This experience is to teach you to have a better check on work progress even much before deadline's there...<br><br>I've seen cases where people just bochap... Then I point out things which are not done in advance, in the end things still the same... Try to keep a 'log' or something so that your 'supervisor' is updated on the situation... If your supervisor bochap, then it's really their fault and you can even lodge a complaint on them....<br><br>In project management, having a good team is always crucial.. Like minds can work together better, and even more so for friends... However, understand that this is just SCHOOL. Having a 'bad team' would test you ALOT on your management ability and hence allow you to learn more in a sense.. Not just marks on your papers but also your personal experience... Might not be assessed but definitely a skill which can come in handy in the future... And through projects and school, you can actually learn how different people work and how to handle them... Which type of people to avoid in your team in the future....<br><br><strong><br>imagine a few nites of little slp... not eatin just so that i can rush it out... icy can understand how not eatin n slpin feels like <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></strong></div></blockquote></div>
