              <p>Take your mind off the relationship for a while. Think of a new experience you've always wanted to take on, but never had the time and energy for.</p>
              <p>It hurts to the bone for sure, but when you get through this, you'd have grown stronger.</p>

              <p>The key to emancipation from a broken heart and pain is to move on by planning a new life without that painful thing and living that new life with all your heart and mind. As you become more involved and drawn into living your new-found life, you'll naturally lose focus on the painful past. Keep at it. Be determined to live your life as best as you can. Before you know it, the pain of the past will become nothing but a blur in your memory........ <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> I accidentally come across your topic in Chit Chat and I am concerned regarding your negative domestic environment and the weak bonds you have with people. You probably don`t realized it, but that actually contributed subconsciously to your misery in Love, based on this intense fear of loneliness. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Your fear of being alone is real - this account for your resignation for not confronting your man about the `truth`, because you rather based your emotions on delusional background, thinking that your man will eventually choose you OR thinking that your situation will be better if you don`t do anything that would `seemingly` aggravate the situation. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But I can tell you that your boyfriend, or ex-boyfriend, is merely capitalizing on your inability to face the harsh truth and gradually twirl you around that little finger of his as he continues to fuel your illusionary love. This jerk of yours requested you to wait for him to have his share of loving fun before `returning` back to you and if you are willing to abide by this ridiculous rule, I must say that you are merely living in the shadow of your fear and not in light of Love - that your Love is but a composition of fear masquerading as Love. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As long as your Self identity remains a question - your relationship with people will hardly improve, which inevitable implied that your fear of loneliness will escalate.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">You must find a source to determine this Self component - and it doesn’t come from any individual alone. It often derives from causes you seek to fight for. If you seek Love (BGR), when this Self component is missing, I can almost guarantee you that a series of karmic relationships await at the end of the juncture maliciously. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">One cannot extend Love outwardly if it doesn`t finds it within him or herself. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I seriously reckon that you might want to try some sort of religious group for some network of support and friendship. You must first save your sanity and then remove your negative fear with robust initiative to change your plight. <span> </span><span> </span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Things cannot change if the variables are the same. Although we can`t touch the constant, but we have the freewill to dabble with things we can control. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></span></span></p>

              <p>So if you are not as good looking as the other girl, you can forget it.</p>
              <p>Instead of him telling you to wait for him, WHY DON'T YOU tell him to wait for you ?</p>
              <p>Go out, have some fun. FLIRT with other guys. Then when you are sick of other men, then go back to him again.</p>
              <p>You are willing to wait for him because you love him, yes ?</p>
              <p>If he loves you, he'll wait for you, right ?</p>
              <p>So, if he don't wanna wait for you, he don't love you lor. Simple logic mah.</p>
              <p>And if he don't love you, why waste your youth on him ? Got no other men you can have meh ? PLENTY.</p>
              <p>Since you are not the only one with a hole, he's not the only one with a deek either. CORRECT ?</p>

              <p>You are mature for your age. Too ripe for other men your age to handle.</p>
              <p>Meaning, you need to either go for older guys, or wait till you are older for men your age to appreciate you.</p>
              <p>NOW, Men your age, are not ready for a committed relationship. They still want to try out other shoes. They are more into themselves than their gf.</p>
              <p>So, it is not surprising, you keep getting your nose rubbed in the sand.</p>
              <p>When a guy is ready to settle, they will be usually past 27 years old. When girls are potential wife/long term partners, not tissue papers.</p>
              <p>Go and enjoy your life now. There's much to see and do at your age.</p>
              <p>Loving yourself now, is the right thing to do. A mature/smart man goes for a woman who knows how to love herself first, not someone in need of love from him.</p>

              <p>Life is very short.
              There are so much things in life to look forward. Don't live in
              saddness, lift yourself and brighten up your outlook. Celebrate life as
              it passes you by everyday. Even with all the things that is happening around, it could
