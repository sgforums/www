Then u will have wasted 2 yrs instead of 1..<br><br>Try to understand that ur parents are trying to protect u but at the same time, try to reason with them also. I noe its hard. Perhaps u can try asking them why are they so uptight with u. The most if u feel that if u really need a breather, get ur frens to help u lie to ur parents and go out and relax for a day. Its better than being an emotional wreck at home and taking a break from all that problems will certainly help  u in ur studies as well.<br><br>And try to save up as well in case they try to cut ur pocket money.

I think your dad is trying to help you but he doesn't know how to. Cry in front of him or something. Let all the frustration come out but whatever you do , don't say bad things about your mom or else he also will give up. Just put your situation as plainly as possible.<br><br><strong>She will have to accept it if you fail</strong> and worse if you do terribly in A levels - her future vision for you is gone as well.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, im Tjrain's fren. And i know about her situation. Her mum is jus too much. I know that she is trying to be protective over Tjrain, but i think she is too much. She is treating Tjrain like a criminal or sth. Besides Tjrain is way better then her younger bro.<br><br>Her studies since secondary school was good, and she made it to JC. Unlike her younger bro who have been failing almost all his subjects. yet, her mum is more bias on the younger one. Her mum will listen to every single word from him. But not any word from Tj. I don't understand why a mum would treat her own daughter such a way. It makes Tjrain feel so upset and hurt. It seems that tjrain can't take all these anymore. Her mum is giving her so much pressure on her studies, life and everything she does. She can't even go out wif her frens.<br><br>Tjrain is giving out her best in everything she do, so as to satisfy her mum and to make her life better. But now i think it is getting worse.. She tried telling her mum she cant cope with her studies but her mum still pressurises her and said it is a disgrace to her family if she retains or fail. I seriously dunno how to make her mum understand her better and at least listen to Tjrain for just once. All i know is she somwhow doesnt trust Tjrain and she is twisting the facts.<br><br>I really can't think of any good ways to help Tjrain. It seems that most of the solutions i gave her cant work. Does anyone have a good suggestion and advice?</div>

Can't really think of much at the moment.<br><br>On a sidenote, if it makes you feel any better, how many rich people you know actually have PhDs or even a uni degree to begin with? And how many PhD holders and degree holders end up as their workers, destined to work for the rest of their life?

You may go onto the podium and thank all who has contributed to your success, but ultimately at the end of the day the awards, trophies and accolades of your acheivements are yours. Have a look at the awards whose name will be on it. I am sure it isn't going to be your mother's.<br><br>Your mother as you had mentioned does have apprehension about poly which is quite understandable as she is trying to "help" you to the path of university where hopefully you can get a vast opportunity in your future career and education path as compared to poly. Look at our ministers being conferred with degrees every now and then from local and overseas insitutions of higher learning.<br><br>I do not know where and how you will do well in poly but if you are sure about it (which I hope is all for the better) then you could speak to your teacher and/or school counsellor about your plans. See if what you perceive is true and better than where you are now. I think your mum is concern that you are trying too anxiously to get into the working world by embarking into poly. And maybe for some other "hidden" and "foolish" reasons known to you and anticipated by her.<br><br>Secondly, TRUST. I believe you would recall a saying: A glass once broken cannot be.....mended. I believe that your mother's reaction is not without reason. I do not mean to be offending here, but as you had mentioned that you had a previous occassion when you left home, and there must be some "acts" of defiance which led to her drastic reaction of calling the police and sending you to a girls home. [Pardon me here, if I am wrong but I am just relating from your account. Please correct me here if I have erred.] Now, if someone you love has broke your trust, did you ever feel that it is so difficult to place your trust in that person again? Your mother is also a human being, she may rant and rave but don't you think that she is hurting inside? Who in the sane mind and world would want to have the police and lock up facility for their loved ones? Ask yourself this, can you bear to send her to the old folks home and let people use sub-standards and quality to take care her? You must be mindful that it is not easy to overlook the past especially when something quite grave had happened and it takes time and a lot of EFFORTS on both parties. Look at our Yellow Ribbon project and you should understand this point, why do you think there's a need for this project if all of us are so easy to grant others a 2nd chance? If you think your mother's reaction as over exaggerated then try and imagine yourself at the other end with strangers instead of your mother.<br><br>Thirdly, Responsibility and Love. Did you know that these 2 are the most difficult to teach and practice in a relationship? Have you heard of the story "The Mother Crow"? [Let me know if you have not. I will share in another post]<br>It is just difficult to teach, practice and relate. I hope you remember this you may choose your dress, blouse, food, house and friends BUT you cannot choose your parents and same as your parents too. What makes you think that your parent(s) love you any lesser? TS do they need to put up with you for 17 years if they do not love you?? As you grow up, and being a fairer sex (no discrimination here) you will understand that it is always the fairer sex that suffers and looses the most when they commit mistakes. And since you are the eldest in your family as well, you have a heavier responsibilty to your younger sibilings. Had it occur to you that when she shouted at you--it might be instances where it might be affecting the younger ones? And if you react in a negative way and the younger ones follow--what do u think will happen? Mutiny? Perhaps your younger sibiling reacted the opposite which is why your parents will have to accord them differently??!!<br><br>Look. At the end of the day, you will grow up and have a family one day yourself. The sooner you can place yourself in Her (your mother) shoes the faster you will understand her pains. Will she give you a piece of STONE when you are hungry? Will she abandon you if you needed help? I don't think so, I believe that she loves you so much until she is DESPERATE sick as to when you will understand all her efforts.

Think about it, they have live in this world for 40 years? whereas you only 17 years, and out of which you only started to see the world since 13, sec 1, which is only 4 years.<br><br>There are many types of ppl out there and dangerous things that may happen to you.  So she is just "better be safe than sorry".  You may think she favors the younger child more, but the youngest child happens to be a boy.  Boys won't get pregnant, girls do.  Try your best to listen to her, sometimes voice up.  It doesn't matter if she doesn't listen, it's perfectly normal.  Just follow what she says and you will be glad you listened to her when you finish your studies.  You will gain your complete independence when you start working, most probably.<br><br>with regards to poly or JC, your mum did the most sensible choice (it may not be the right choice, but it's the most safest route to choose)  If I have my kids in future, I'll want them to be in JC as well, cos after you graduated from uni, your future will be smooth sailing!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>Try to endure ok? after your JC, go uni.  Only after uni you can start to enjoy the fruits of your labour.  You will be thankful to your mum and hopefully you still can remember me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Look at me, I'm trying so hard to get a degree now (I've lost touch w studies), but for you it shouldn't be too difficult.<br><br>But if you really tried your best and really can't do well in JC (that's sad) den you may consider going to poly.  That's really your last alternative.<br><br>Hope these helps you in your life <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Maybe at the coffee shop for dinner etc.<br><br>If you really concerned about Tyrain, try to be on friendly terms with her mum, gain her mum's trust on you slowly and afterwhich you may start going to nearby plcs tgt and hopefully she may allow you two to go out once in a bluemoon.<br><br>Trust is the main thing now.

I guess perhaps your dad is helping you if not why should he bother to agrue with your mum. My suggestion to solve this problem is have a word with your mum. Tell her exactly how you feel and it is not nice that you keep rejecting. Use a friendly tone to talk with her.<br><br>If it fails again and your mum has come back to her old habit of rejecting, I suggest that perhaps you will like to seek professional help to solve your emotional problem.<br><br>When talking to her,<br>1. Try to probe the reason why she is doing that to you. Is it because of your safety or because of other reasons like wanting you to take care of your two younger brothers?<br>2. After you have more or less guessed the reason, for example, your safety,<br>try to negotiate with her like you can go out with your friends weekly and come back by what time.<br><br>There is a chinese proverb that says, we depend on our parents at home while we rely on our friends outside.</div>

Besides Tjrain is way better then her younger bro.<br><br>Her studies since secondary school was good, and she made it to JC. Unlike her younger bro who have been failing almost all his subjects. yet, her mum is more bias on the younger one. Her mum will listen to every single word from him. But not any word from Tj. I don't understand why a mum would treat her own daughter such a way. It makes Tjrain feel so upset and hurt. It seems that tjrain can't take all these anymore. Her mum is giving her so much pressure on her studies, life and everything she does. She can't even go out wif her frens.<br><br>Tjrain is giving out her best in everything she do, so as to satisfy her mum and to make her life better. But now i think it is getting worse.. She tried telling her mum she cant cope with her studies but her mum still pressurises her and said it is a disgrace to her family if she retains or fail. I seriously dunno how to make her mum understand her better and at least listen to Tjrain for just once.

You think all that raving and ranting is driving your friend to the wall? What happens when she is out working in the society one day as a CEO?
