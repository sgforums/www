            <div class='col-md body'>I'm 17/f this year, but my parents keep a tight control over me. I got two younger brothers. I tried to be a good daughter, I gave in to their every wants and tried to obey them. Everyday I come home after school, and don't even go out on weekends because thats what they wanted.<br><br>I pass every exams and did fairly well to get on smoothly in my education journey, and ended up getting into a junior college against my wish. My parents opposed to me going poly as they think that poly is not a good route. They expect the best from me, in studies wise and behaviour, but doesn't expect anything from my younger brother.<br><br>I failed badly for my jc, and I didn't know what how to tell my parents that. My mum die die also want me to promote, retain is like disgrace to the family, as so she sees it. And until know, I don't know how to tell it to her.<br><br>My mum is extremely bias to my younger brother, but I tried to live with it. The treatment we have is totally different, she shouts at me over the slightest thing, but talks to my brother very nicely. She doesn't let me out because she sees no need in it, but let my younger brother out. Even going back to school during the holidays, she demands a proof like a teacher acknowledged form or something.<br><br>Recently they went to print out my detailed phone list, showing all the calls I made and recieved for no apparent reason. I did not overspend on my bill either. I don't know what for, than my mum starts scolding me and saying that I am making use of my parents and that I am just putting on an act to be obedient and stuff. She claims that she is the best parent around, and I should count myself lucky. My mum thinks that she is always right, and recently she refuse to talk to me or even respond to me. I feel hurt, and it bothers me a lot.<br><br>I don't know what she wants from me, all she ever do is to shout at every single thing I do. I can't even go out, I don't know what to do at all. The last time I tried leaving house at 15, my parents caught me. During that 2 months school holiday I was kept at home. My handphone got confiscated, I couldn't use the computer and cannot step out of the house at all. From than on she keeps threatening me with the police and girls home. And claimed that I am beyond parental control.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>I don't know where I went wrong. I tried talking to my mum, but she just won't hear of it. She say she will trust me, but it goes back to square one after some time. I feel like she's driving me up to the wall, and I got nowhere to go. Everything I do is wrong, talking back seems useless. I feel like I'm trap in a confined space, unable to take a step foward or backward.<br><br>And today she warned me if I were to step out of the house, she will call the police immediately. I cannot take it anymore. 17 years, and I really cannot stand it but I really don't know what else to do.<br><br>Any help...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>sorry for the long entry.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

Does he listen to you? The reason why I am asking is because you appear to be focusing on your mother and nothing is said about your father.<br><br>With an environment like that, I can see why you don't do well in JC. Your mom sounds rather controlling. In a way , she is overprotective of you because you are a girl ( "easier to get into the 9 months problem , if you get what I mean" ).<br><br></div>

I think she's way over the league of overprotectiveness. Try approaching a teacher, or some other adult whom you trust and tell them your problem. I am sure you have got relatives, like uncles and aunts who would be concerned about you right ? But just remember you are not out in this world to be alone like how you are feeling right now. There will always be people who will love you and care for you want to help you.</div>

I think it is time for you to go out with your father for  coffee  and have a heart to heart chat with him. Tell him what you told us. Cry, wail , do what you have to get him to stand the ground with your mother. I don't know the whole story but if you are a good kid , your dad sees that , he will help you out.<br><br>From what I know of my dad when I was a troublemaking teenager, my dad didn't want to interfere til it gets very bad because  apparently my mom can chant for 3 days nonstop at him and he didn't want to ursurp the mothering role. Might be the same case with your dad - I am just taking a wild guess here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just like some have said, I believe you need someone to help you out of this situation, because it'd be difficult for you to do this alone. Talk to a trustworthy adult. A teacher, a relative or a counsellor, anyone who can be seen as mature. Tell the person your problems and let him/her talk to your parents about it. Your parents are unable to accept your point of view because they may think that you're not mature enough. But they should be more willing to accept the advices of a person they see as mature.<br><br>It isn't right for parents to compare their children with those of their relatives. It's unfair as not everyone is intellectually-gifted. I believe they're forcing you to go through this because you're the eldest child and more so because you're female. As for the threats of calling the police and sending you to a girl's home, don't take them too seriously, 'cause I doubt your mum will bear to do what she say. And she probably won't since she cares about her face so much.</div>
