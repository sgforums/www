            <div class='col-md body'>nv read too many of the posts before this..but<br><br>imo such strict parental control shouldnt be enforced on a teen. we need to have some freedom and our own social circles. in addition if one is having troubles family matters its very unlikely that person can do well/concentrate in schoolwork.<br><br>but i think ur dad should stand up a bit more for you. he's a man, the one supposedly with the power in the family but he got silenced by ur mum with a "no!"???. zzz.<br>clear up this family matter first, maybe through some clarifications with ur mum. yr dad is probably ur best bet to get u out of this mess now...<br><br>and when you get your freedom, dont disappoint them(by getting into gangs etc). get a clear goal of what u wanna do/where u wanna go and make sure u live on with no regrets.<br><br>gd luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i dun think i understand TS's plight, just like you wouldn't understand those who are suffering.<br>but let me tell you this.<br>some mums are always like this,, super egoistic. maybe she's abit over, but try to give in to her at all times. if you have to repeat, so be it, tell her right in her face, its either u repeat or drop school. HER CHOICE. you think she would ask you to drop ? i definitely don't think so. also, it seems that your mum has pride issues and that she wants you to be better academically than people she knows and get along with in order to escape shame.<br>i know of many such mums and things never worked out, most of their kids either leave home for good, some went insane or even worst cases - suicide.<br>i hope you do know what's good for you, if you have a BF, just leave home immediately, if she does loves you, she would put her pride down and look for you, if she doesn't bother, you can forget about having a mum like her.<br>if you do not have a bf, maybe stay at your friend's house for a couple of days ? make ur mum worried and at the same time guilty. about your brother's issue, think its just natural for mums to dote more on the males rather than the females.<br>and she cant lock you in, its absurd, threaten her with the law if she locks you in the house. she threaten you with girls home then you tell her, ok loh. cuz girls home only until 16 years old. call police, go call lah, you are not in the wrong.<br>and u can suggest to her : <a href="http://www.counsel.org.sg/" rel="nofollow">http://www.counsel.org.sg/</a><br>the best suggestion i can come out with is that if your mum continues to be like this, then you should escape from home the next time you leave for school, bring all your valuables and make sure you have friends who can be trusted, so that you could stay over, then start working.<br>if she looks for you, tell her what you feel, tell her to reflect, and until she is ready to change, you wont go back home, and tell her that the family is useless cuz ur bro is just some hopeless waste. if she don't bother, then i believe you could achieve better alone also.<br>most successful ppl are like this anyway.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why don't u tell your mother the truth about retaining j1. Paper can't keep fire and it is a matter of time that she knows.<br><br>I think you should try to stop pleasing your mother cos you want her to love you and to love you more than your brother. Often, we have heard people complaining about others who do not appreciate for what we have sacrificed for.. In this world, there is really only a rare few who know how to be grateful and appreciative.. Our loved ones might not be the ones who know how to be appreciative.<br><br>If you love yourself, stop pressuring yourself to please your mother. When something cause suffering for you, then perhaps you stop doing it for simple reason that you care for yourself.<br><br>There is this thing about reaching somebody's expectation and making there special someone proud. It will be positive when your mother keep encouraging you to reach a certain goal. However, it might not work as your mother is critical and prideful person. Your mum demands a lot from you and you feel perhaps as a daughter, you feel this obligation to meet her expectation.<br><br>Look at it in another way, she wants to push you to reach greater height. However, there is a fine line btw.. in living your life for your mother and for yourself. Don't hinge your emotion and physical well-being in living on her expectation.<br><br>In short, what i have been trying to say here is righting the views about your relationship with your mother...<br><br>I also think your mother loves you. She just demand alot from you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we are all living in a rather conservative society and that will include our parents. Everything about parenting will be trial and error and the amount of control also varies. Looking around you and you will see that there is little mention (if not never) about parents seeking counselling for their shortcomings. And to date there is never a definite yardstick for the amount of control for children. However, you do need to agree that the amount of intensity is definitely given in accordance to the child's response and doing.<br><br>Say what you like about the extremes but has it ever occur to you that there is definitely a  reason behind it and 100% NOT ASKING FOR IT. As children the more you find that it is difficult to convince your parents despite what you have done.....NEVER NEVER take the walk out running away solution. I suggest that you seek for professional help. In all no parents wants anything to happen to their children, it is just that we all have our fallacies and high expectations.</div>

I talked nicely to my mum yesterday again, nothing much happened.<br><br>I told my mum today in the morning that I've got to go to school tomorrow for my exam [oral presentation] , which is true.

Also, somehow I feel that there might be some other incidents that "snowballed" to what is happening to you today. I am not prying and asking you to put it out but to set your mind thinking and perhaps start working out a solution from there.<br><br>I can see that your mother has hesitation TRUSTING you and it is not without a reason. I know it is going to be difficult for her to regain her confidence in you, but there again you really need to be patient and control your behaviour and attitude.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>have u tried talking to your brother? is he the kind who will help u speak up to ur mum or is he those kind who kicks u down further?<br>i dun have much advice for u sorry.. because my gf's mum is exactly like yours.. 19yrs old.. need consent form for class gathering.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br>and guess what.. my gf also retain jc yr1 de.. today A lvl maths paper..<br>there's one thing i need you to know though.. that whatever freedom, to go out with your friends, to go class outing, stay out late, it is going to be hard to realize.. i'm sorry to have to tell you that, but even if she accepts what your father, your grandma, your brother says and lets the leash loose, it's going to be bit by bit, month by month, year by year..<br>it's not going to be an easy ride, but don't give up, keep fighting for it.. keep talking to her, keep being $*($^$ by her, and one day it will get to her that what you ask for is a necessity, and not a luxury.. even though it may be impossible to see how what she does is for your own good (i don't see how locking you up is good either), I'm sure she does it in your best interest.. at least to her it's in your best interest..<br>another point to note is that from her behavior, i think it's quite obvious you have lost her trust in you, hence all the "don't treat me like 3-yr-old" crap from her.. work from there.. tell her your activity, then OFFER to get your teacher to talk to her.. and this must be an on-going process..<br>and about going out with your friends, if you don't have any exams or stuff and want to take a breather, sound pathetic, maybe by saying "ma, <strong>i very long never go out with my friends le</strong>, can i join them for blah blah tmr? i'll be back by   dinnertime"..<br>last but not the least.. your studies.. well retaining sux.. but not retaining and going to yr 2 with crap foundation isn't a bed of roses either.. you have landed yourself, be it by accident or purpose, where you have to choose the lesser of the two evils.. retaining, the three syllables themselves sound like a dull thud to the back of your head.. the not-so-gracefulness attached to it, all your relatives' lame and fake shocking faces like they just realized they crapped in their pants, when they hear the word 'retain'.. it's not pretty im telling you.. the number of times my girlfriend cried in the 1st year repeat is just uncountable.. but thats the way it goes.. retaining is the only way for u to learn, to beef up ur foundation, to pave the way for an easier yr 2.. people go MI also 3 years what..<br>all in all.. you are at the bottom of a deep hole.. all the shit keeps coming down.. but mentally you have to be tough.. Know that whatever your mum says may be true, but if it isn't, dump it.. Never let her words bring you down.. i hope you can get something out of my long and drudgy post..<br>all the best <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
