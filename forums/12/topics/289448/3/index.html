I got two younger brothers. I tried to be a good daughter, I gave in to their every wants and tried to obey them. Everyday I come home after school, and don't even go out on weekends because thats what they wanted.<br><br>I pass every exams and did fairly well to get on smoothly in my education journey, and ended up getting into a junior college against my wish. My parents opposed to me going poly as they think that poly is not a good route. They expect the best from me, in studies wise and behaviour, but doesn't expect anything from my younger brother.<br><br>I failed badly for my jc, and I didn't know what how to tell my parents that. My mum die die also want me to promote, retain is like disgrace to the family, as so she sees it. And until know, I don't know how to tell it to her.<br><br>My mum is extremely bias to my younger brother, but I tried to live with it. The treatment we have is totally different, she shouts at me over the slightest thing, but talks to my brother very nicely. She doesn't let me out because she sees no need in it, but let my younger brother out. Even going back to school during the holidays, she demands a proof like a teacher acknowledged form or something.<br><br>Recently they went to print out my detailed phone list, showing all the calls I made and recieved for no apparent reason. I did not overspend on my bill either. I don't know what for, than my mum starts scolding me and saying that I am making use of my parents and that I am just putting on an act to be obedient and stuff. She claims that she is the best parent around, and I should count myself lucky. My mum thinks that she is always right, and recently she refuse to talk to me or even respond to me. I feel hurt, and it bothers me a lot.<br><br>I don't know what she wants from me, all she ever do is to shout at every single thing I do. I can't even go out, I don't know what to do at all. The last time I tried leaving house at 15, my parents caught me. During that 2 months school holiday I was kept at home. My handphone got confiscated, I couldn't use the computer and cannot step out of the house at all. From than on she keeps threatening me with the police and girls home. And claimed that I am beyond parental control.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>I don't know where I went wrong. I tried talking to my mum, but she just won't hear of it. She say she will trust me, but it goes back to square one after some time. I feel like she's driving me up to the wall, and I got nowhere to go. Everything I do is wrong, talking back seems useless. I feel like I'm trap in a confined space, unable to take a step foward or backward.<br><br>And today she warned me if I were to step out of the house, she will call the police immediately. I cannot take it anymore. 17 years, and I really cannot stand it but I really don't know what else to do.<br><br>Any help...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>sorry for the long entry.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> </div></blockquote>Hmm,your parents seem to be too strict already.haha,is like that one if parent too strict you will rebell.if you leave home you got no money,no friends,parent support more worse.If,you are bored properly ask your friends come to your house tell your mom nicely i believe she will allow.say that,you are bored,have your friends come and talk <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>I think your parent also concern about you.But,too concern already la.17,already!! should have freedom mah dun cage you like a bird at home.But trust me,all your parents do is for your good when one day,you realised you propberly 20+.but your parent to over already.</div>

Then it will come to which man she can marry. Right now her mother is not creating a conducive environment for her to grow in .

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm seriously.. my plight could be eerrieely similar. I failed my promos terribly. And my folks were also dead against in insisting that. i continue to Year 2...<br><br>However, i insisted that i repeat my Year one. Because seriously.. lets face it, your fundamentals in Yr 1 is weak.. thats why the poor result; hence, continuing to Year 2 with such poor foundations is certainly suicidal and will lead to really lousy A level results bah.<br><br>I think the best decision i made in my life was to repeat my Year 1 in Jc. I made a whole new set of better friends, and because i went thru my 1st Year one already... I was more or less comfortable if not steady and stable when.. i re-read my repeated Year 1 again. Reading it a 2nd year. was really so much clearer.. and the clarity in the coursework was really appreciated. Of course sure.. the 1st 3 months will be uncomfortable for u.. becz ur Year 1 peers are in their Sec skool uniforms, while you are already in ur college uniform ler. Sure no big deal... you will get over it. Do not be ashamed that you repeated. It is rather common bah. Think of it. as giving yourself a second to proof to yourself that you can indeed perform and do well bah. And yeah i did very well in my A level exams. ;-)<br><br>Of Course, the above is given to you ONLY if u decide to continue to pursue the JC path. If at this time, you may think it is a Good time to Move on PoLY.. you could also do it bah. I mean convince your mum, that given your promo results, this is indeed indicative that you are not cut for College life. Thus you want to enter PoLy. Perhaps it would be helpful if the Poly course you are pursuing also has great economic value like.. e.g. Business/finance/banking, shipping/maritime or..engineering/aerospace diplomas... thus you can convince your mum and say hey, "this is a $$$ making diploma.."<br><br>As to the.. grounding by your mother; i think. currently.. you are still below 21 so.. heh.. a lot of stuff.. you will still ned parental consent and all bah. Hmm.. nonetheless, i guess.. perhaps its wise to moderately challenge your mum's authority for a while. Insist on going to School/library/or just to meet your friends over the weekend. If she locks you up, call the police and file for illegal imprisonment. If she takes away your mobile phone(thus preventing you from calling), You just scream and scream and scream from your room and beg your neighbours to call the police for you. When the police does arrive, lets see who is at the losing end.<br><br>I think she threatened you that if you go out, she will call the police and send you to Girls Home. Well.. Haha.. frankly, that is jz bull crap frm your mum. It is not against the law for you to leave the house and be in public. On the contrary it is illegal for them to imprision you. Calling the police is futile because you did not break any laws. Either can she send you to a Girls Home because this order can only be effected by the courts. And To be eligible for Girls Home, you also need to break the laws first. There is no way.. your mum can Place u in the Girls home just like that.<br><br>Sometimes.. parents. just use empty threats to scare children into submission. So yeah..the 1st step in gaining freedom is always very very difficult. If all else fails, call the MCYS hotline... and ask for a social counsellor..<br><br></div>

U do not have the opportunity to interact with others and expand ur social circle which hampers your social skills. I have been in that situation so i noe..<br><br>But this is not the main pt. The pt is to try your best influence around her...aunts uncles your father even, to see your point of view and change her. This is wat i feel is your best chance of getting out of this situation. However, if you feel that her overprotective behaviour is getting out of control, u may wan to seek professional help...<br><br>This may sound immature but only use rebelling as a last resort. And even if u really rebel, u must show her that whatever you have done actually showed results. For example if u choose to retain against her wishes, get a fantastic result for ur next promos and then in ur A lvls and show her the results. This may actually gain her trust in you.<br>good luck!</div>
