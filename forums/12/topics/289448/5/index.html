            <div class='col-md body'>Oh my... What generation your parents live in? Show them the difference of the modern world. Last time no tv, now got HD tv. Last time no pager, now 3G handphone. Show your parents you have grown up, let them know you can take care of yourself. Most of the time action speak louder than words. You can act insane if you want, most probably you will be appease.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi Tjrain.<br><br>Firstly, I came from a JC as well, (in fact I'm only 1 yr older, taking my As this year) and I can relate to you when you say the JC route is tough. With regards to your studies, I would say you shoul retain if u don't meet the school's promotion criteria, which is usually a very fair guage. Trying to promote when u can't just cause your mum won't like it would be really suicidal cause I've seen people who "advanced" (a term they used to describe someone who barely made the promotion mark) to year 2 then, crash and burn during the As. Eventually when the results are out, he/she would have a cert that's worth nothing. Retain if you have to, u're the one schooling, not your mum.<br><br>Secondly, I think your mum is probably the more traditional/conservative kind of parent. Being a student myself, I've seen parents of my friends and you can't deny everyone's different. I've seen friends who are like friends with their parents and others who cannot communicate with their parents at all. (me being one of them)<br><br>About your mum being bias to my younger brother, would it be a case of "zhong nan qing nu"? (favouring the male but not the female(sorry but my chinese is really bad)) I personally experience this as well cause my mum does show a slight favour for me against my sister, although it's not that extreme. I think this is probably inherent in the older generation and I think there's nothing to be done about this.<br><br>But there is something too extreme about your mum and I quote from you "Even going back to school during the holidays, she demands a proof like a teacher acknowledged form or something. " and the one about the printing of the phone bill and calling the girls home etc etc. Have you acted in some way or another to allow her to act this way? In your opening you say you "go home everyday after school and don't go out on weekends" and personally I feel if that's the case, your mum acting that way is a bit stupid. I don't agree when ppl say that your mum is doing this for your own good cos what she's doing is def not for your good. A 17 yo being confined isn't going to grow up well, he/she is prob going to grow up as a conformed adult.<br><br>Sorry to say this, but I have no best plan for you. I think the ideal plan would be to really study hard and show her at the end of the As that she's wrong about you. If things get out of hand and she really calls the police, maybe it'll be good to bring this matter to higher authority?<br><br>Anyway if you need someone to talk to personally, you can PM me.<br><br>Cheers.<br></div>
