Till now she still can't forgive me.<br><br>You are lucky. At least she still goes out with you. As for me..when I do bump into her..all I can do is let us both pass be each other like stranger. Will you understand the feeling of someone whom you love so much had actually walked past you like a stranger?<br><br>All these years, I still carry on my life walking forward but she's always there in my heart. I still fall in love and I love my gf but I can't help being honest with her that my past love is still there in my heart and i really hope that she'll be able to accept that but I guess love is selfish.<br><br>Recently met a girl and she knew about my past as well and things seemed to be going on fine between us both. I really hope that she can fully accept me cause I do love her. She got a smile that can calm my unsettled heart. Pray for me too pal.<br></div>

Her shoulders were wrinkled, her b reasts sagged, her ribs were covered by a flabby skin as pale and cold as a frog's."</span><br><br>The protagonist had endured fifty-one years, nine months, and four days of unrequited love before he finally had the opportunity to profess again his love for the woman he had loved since his youth. When she finally accepted him after a series of vehement rejections, when their love was finally consummated after a chain of fateful setbacks, his love still remained true but the subject of his love since youth was no longer the same.<br><br>You can devote as many years as you are blessed with to the love of your life, but you must be made painfully aware of the fact that though your love may still remain true after those years, the person whom you love would never be the same again as she whom you started loving before those years.<br><br>In the end, you may realise that all your life you have been in love with just an image.

It's a torture when I know I can't msg her. And even if i did, she also won't reply me. Sometimes, i would be just like you, hoping that she would call or sms me, or even a simple" hi" on the msn will make me happy. Always thinking of those days when everyday she would sms me in the morning to wake me up, and the good nite msg to complete my day. and the time when every weekends she would be staying over at my place.. i would sometimes, just stay awake to watch her sleep. And yesterday night, it really breaks my heart when i was watchiing the video clips we took in pulau ubin and pasir ris chalet. all the joy and laughers that i missed so much. it's really killing me..</div>
