              I am a student in sim taking a degree coz, this is my last semester, iguess its funny to say at this point that all my previous 2 and half year grades are all distinctions. For the past sem, i still put in effort perhaps even more as good grades to me is very important as my previous poly grades is a mess and i understand the importance of good grades  
              
              I also dun know where to begin with, 4 months ago my whole block was under going lift upgrading and the opposite block was undergoing demolishing buildings, on every day even sunday the noise was unbearable as the block opposite even demolish on sunday. You might ask why cannot i pack my bag to community centre or school or library to study. I did try to go to all this places, i have a bladder problems which mean i have to go toilet a few times every hour and to cure it require 20k, i was intending to go for treatment after i graduate. I did try to study in sch but ever 10 min i have to go toilet and a couple of times my notes and textbook are stolen. 
              
              Anyway i really have myself to blame, to relieve the noise i start to take stress relieving drugs, the side effect of the drugs makes me restless. Either way i cannot remember anything the next day, i mean i was not as efficent as before. I went to see a doctor and he said i have symptons of depressions. Anyway i think i may fail some modules, i feel so sorry to my mother as she had cancer and she wants to see me graduate. i really dun know whats wrong with me.

              <p>If you have been scoring distinctions until recently, something must have triggered the change.</p>
              <p>What were your studying methods previously?</p>
              <p>Apart from a change in study environment, did anything else happen?</p>

              <p>Trips to the loo every 20-30 minutes sounds like a real annoying inconvenience to get past.</p>
              <p>But if it hasn't affected your concentration previously, or if it doesn't affect your concentration when you study at home, I believe it can't be all that serious now.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you can try packing light when you head outside. Just bring a wallet and tote bag for books and notes. Everytime you go to the loo, toss it all in the bag and bring along.</p>

              <p>Mild depression is very common in adults. Especially in this case, with difficulties to overcome both at home and in school.</p>
              <p>I'm not surprised if there is no form of release. For the negative emotions you're feeling, it's no good to be too lonely. Do you have a support system outside of your family? Close friends you can be with and confide in?</p>
              <p>At some point of time in our lives, troubles will strike one after another with seemingly no end in sight. It's simply a cycle. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. Sometimes you fall, before you soar. Don't allow your current situation to affect the big picture - the future.</p>
              <p>Get your priorities right and keep your eye on the prize. In your case, I believe it's success in your studies.</p>
              <p>You can do it, don't be frightened by it.</p>
