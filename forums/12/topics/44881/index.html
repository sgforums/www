She's only 13, and i think she juz got out of Primary School. Thats lot of things in this world, may it be good or bad, that she hasn't experience. At her age, BGR might be new and exciting to her and thats why she going into the area.<br><br>13 isnt a good age to start a relationship. For her, there is a lot of learning to do and also needs alot of reality exposure. For now, its best to let her forgo such relationships and maybe pay attention to more important things like study, etc.<br><br>If you really like her, I think you should wait. For now, you could be just friends, and guide her as she mature. Maybe then, things might start to change. You two might have different opinions then and thats not too late....</div>
