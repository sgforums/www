Since you are living together similar to being married, you both share the equal amount of responsibility in doing the house chores.  It's very unfair that you are always the one busy doing the house chores for him (with little time to rest and relax) while he spends all his time playing his game.<br><br>My husband loves playing video/pc games too and he plays every night for a few hours whenever he can.  I don't mind that, one of the reasons is I've got my own hand-held game (Nintendo DS) to play with  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> but the main reason is that as much as he likes playing his video games, he will always keep the weekend aside to spend time with me and do things with me including house chores, shopping, other activities etc.<br><br>I believe the reason you are annoyed with him is not because he's not sharing the house chores but more because he has neglected you and is not making any effort to spend time with you.  I am sure that if you reason (don't nag) with your partner and manage to get him to at least to spend time with you on the weekend, I am sure you will be a lot happier even if he's still playing his WoW every night during the week.<br><br>Good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>I have tried talking to him &amp; when he takes time off from games, he would be very restless and distracted, and he gives me a feeling that he is just waiting for time to pass so that he will clock enough couple hours to go on to his games in peace...<br><br>You know what i mean?<br><br>Games= Leisure<br>Couple time= Chore<br><br>Anyway, honeymouse..

Seems like either your bf doesn't have you in his plans or playing WoW is his escapism from something hr doesn't want to face in real life. But whether it's one or the other, it seems to concern you.

Also, even though you live together/married, it's important to still go out for a date every so often.<br><br>Don't give up communicating with your partner, Vonderful.  Also, stop spoiling him and start getting him to help you with the housework including preparing dinner etc.   Be strong, be firm and be reasonable!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
