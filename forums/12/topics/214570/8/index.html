And yea, try not to do things for him anymore i.e don't do the dishes for him, don't stay home for him, etc. You have done all these long enough and what did you get in return? Him becoming more addicted to the game instead.<br><br>And to those who suggest her to play the game together with her bf...how does this help in the long run? Both of them becoming addicted together and in the end both also end up with no life?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> I am not sure if this is the best way to solve this problem.<br><br>Of course it is good to share each other's interest when you are both in a relationship, but how much should one share until one personality's totally lost? And why shouldn't the guy pay attention to the girl's interest and share her interest as well? Why must it only be one-sided, and it should always be her to sacrifice?</div></blockquote>Obsessions come in various ways...</div>
