            <div class='col-md body'>Vonderful,<br><br>wanna tell ya a little about myself... I've been in a game addiction before.. DEEP ADDICTION. I tried to balance off my relationship and the game well, but regretfully to say... Often activities for the relationship would have to bite the dust just so that that game can work out simply because the game won't be able to accomodate for me....<br><br>After a while... It makes me realised that the game has no life but only one simple objective. To get me addicted and hooked to it. Some might say that 'giving entertainment' is also one of the game's objective. But I would rather say it's the game's MOTIVE. In order to achieve it's objective number <strong>1</strong>, it provides for this objective number <span style="color: blue;">2</span>. Which really isn't it's interest at all. Do ya think it won't really care less if it can achieve '1' without '2'?<br><br>It's like on drugs once you're hooked. Once you slowly blends in. Especially once you're GOOD. But it's a CRUEL game IN and OUT of there... As it slowly eats off your time and life... Compete for ATTENTION from you AGAINST your LOVE ONE(S)... Even when you realise what it's doing to you, it's just difficult to get off the pills...<br><br>My girl asked me to teach her too, but I declined. I know what's happening to me and I don't wish to see the same happening to her... And since I was thinking that way, I thought to myself... This mustn't be good... The THING IS, one just have got to be HONEST with himself / herself... No point trying to paint a beautiful sky over a TORN sheet of paper....<br><br>Just like what you might think of your bf... I thought I could be real sweet to my gf if I wanna... I thought I could be real caring... But the POINT is, I WASN'T... And I had rather let our relationship take the beatings than the GAME itself... The SWEET... ALMOST INNOCENT LIKE POISON controlling over my mind....<br><br>That's when I told myself, GIVE ME MY LIFE BACK.<br><br>TODAY. I have LOST ALL my GAME STATUS. ALL of FANS. All the ENVY EYES. But I MUST SAY... I SERIOUSLY a MUCH HAPPIER PERSON THIS WAY....<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"When the clock strikes twelve, who would be there for you....?"</span><br><br>PS. You might wanna let your bf read this while he still can?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, not everyone is self-sacrificing like Devil. If that is the case than it is all well and good but it just don't know how to express himself.<br><br>All the guys I know who game and not limited to my guild have this secret wish that their gf/wife plays the game. Alot of them got their gf/wife in the game because it gives them something to do together besides going out and they are happy with the arrangement. On the other hand there is a small minority whom I know personally who prefer to keep their gf/wife out of the game for various reasons. Some of them want someone to cook/clean/look after the baby and others with not-so-good intentions because "I cannot flirt freely with online female players if my gf is playing the game." <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> and some do actually have something else going outside besides keeping it in-game.<br><br>In Vonderful's case, her bf may be feeling guilty coz his gf actually bothered to try and by trying it adds to his guilt, or he is busy trying to hit lvl 60 and doesn't want to 'waste time' trying to teach her the ropes to the game itself.<br><br>My 2 cents.</div>

I am not sure if my bf is being mean or I am really what he claimed but i just didn't realise..<br><br>As some of you here know, my bf is addicted to WoW, and he commits all his free time to the game. I am sickened by it, but came to terms that an addiction is an addiction, you can't expect to pull a man out of his addiction w/o pissing him off...<br><br>And i admit that I complained a lot when he spends everyday on his games and he always say he has no freedom to even play games...<br><br>I felt that all these arguments are uncalled for since this might just be a passing phase in our relationship... So to better situation, i decided to join him by learning how to play the game. But he gets impatient when i ask him questions about the games...<br><br>Then Elindra from this forum offered to teach me and so i went to get the game today, hoping to learn the basics from her then join him in the game so at least we would have some common topics in daily life, and who knows it might bring us closer...<br><br>When i got home, (we stay together), I showed him the game excitedly &amp; he suddenly flared up at me," I already told you that if you want to learn it because of me, and not coz you like it, then NO NEED." Then he just threw the game on the bed...<br><br>Have i done the wrong thing? Would guys feel pissed off when you think your gf is pretending to like something? I admit i don't like games, coz i always die after 3 mins in every game, no matter what games... but i was hoping that i would like it once i know how to play... Of coz i might not like it ultimately, but i just wanted to try &amp; find out...<br><br>Don't know la... Wierd... I'm fine, just puzzled... Coz sometimes you think you've done a darn great thing when in fact, it was a stupid thing to do. Just want to hear from you guys your opinions... You know, you need people to tell you when you are wrong, if not, you forever think you are right one... I want to hear some guys' point of view...<br><br>Thanks Peepz...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div></blockquote>The truth is. If, ANY. I meant ANY . Girl would do such a thing. Any guy would be happy enough to die <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>From what i see, He's far too much . Why?<br>Dude, if my girl were to join me in the activities i liked, Just because of me. I'll cry myself to death.<br>He just doesen't Cherish it damn it</div>
