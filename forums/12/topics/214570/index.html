            <div class='col-md body'><br>I am really confused here. I am not sure if my bf is being mean or I am really what he claimed but i just didn't realise..<br><br>As some of you here know, my bf is addicted to WoW, and he commits all his free time to the game. I am sickened by it, but came to terms that an addiction is an addiction, you can't expect to pull a man out of his addiction w/o pissing him off...<br><br>And i admit that I complained a lot when he spends everyday on his games and he always say he has no freedom to even play games...<br><br>I felt that all these arguments are uncalled for since this might just be a passing phase in our relationship... So to better situation, i decided to join him by learning how to play the game. But he gets impatient when i ask him questions about the games...<br><br>Then Elindra from this forum offered to teach me and so i went to get the game today, hoping to learn the basics from her then join him in the game so at least we would have some common topics in daily life, and who knows it might bring us closer...<br><br>When i got home, (we stay together), I showed him the game excitedly &amp; he suddenly flared up at me," I already told you that if you want to learn it because of me, and not coz you like it, then NO NEED." Then he just threw the game on the bed...<br><br>Have i done the wrong thing? Would guys feel pissed off when you think your gf is pretending to like something? I admit i don't like games, coz i always die after 3 mins in every game, no matter what games... but i was hoping that i would like it once i know how to play... Of coz i might not like it ultimately, but i just wanted to try &amp; find out...<br><br>Don't know la... Wierd... I'm fine, just puzzled... Coz sometimes you think you've done a darn great thing when in fact, it was a stupid thing to do. Just want to hear from you guys your opinions... You know, you need people to tell you when you are wrong, if not, you forever think you are right one... I want to hear some guys' point of view...<br><br>Thanks Peepz...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

Unless you can prove to him that you are way better than him, then he'll treat you like a goddess. it's a hindrance you see, cause they know girls will be a burden ingame, don't know this and don't know that till you know the game inside out, read up on forums or something like that. everyone started our as a nub.</div>

Does he accompany u to go out n do other stuffs together too such as cooking and washing etc? Does he also do other things besides WoW? Maybe he is just been too engrossed into the game and totally forgets about you...<br><br>I had a friend who dumped her bf because he played too much games and refused to do anything else except gaming. Now, he is begging her to patch back but she just refuses because of this gaming incident.</div></blockquote>He plays everyday after he comes home from work.. from 8pm- 2am, sometimes earlier la... He doesn't like to go out, so before he started WoW, we would just stay home and we would just watch TV... Or if there are movies on screen that I really want to watch, i would pester him to go watch...<br><br>He does help me with dishes, but clothes i wash, (which i think its ok... don't expect a man to wash clothes right.. funny...)...<br><br>I never thought of dumping him coz i tell myself it's a phase.. If I want this r/s to survive this period, i have to open my heart... But girls, you know la... sometimes your heart can only open till certain extent, then you start whining again...

I am not sure if my bf is being mean or I am really what he claimed but i just didn't realise..<br><br>As some of you here know, my bf is addicted to WoW, and he commits all his free time to the game. I am sickened by it, but came to terms that an addiction is an addiction, you can't expect to pull a man out of his addiction w/o pissing him off...<br><br>And i admit that I complained a lot when he spends everyday on his games and he always say he has no freedom to even play games...<br><br>I felt that all these arguments are uncalled for since this might just be a passing phase in our relationship... So to better situation, i decided to join him by learning how to play the game. But he gets impatient when i ask him questions about the games...<br><br>Then Elindra from this forum offered to teach me and so i went to get the game today, hoping to learn the basics from her then join him in the game so at least we would have some common topics in daily life, and who knows it might bring us closer...<br><br>When i got home, (we stay together), I showed him the game excitedly &amp; he suddenly flared up at me," I already told you that if you want to learn it because of me, and not coz you like it, then NO NEED." Then he just threw the game on the bed...<br><br>Have i done the wrong thing? Would guys feel pissed off when you think your gf is pretending to like something? I admit i don't like games, coz i always die after 3 mins in every game, no matter what games... but i was hoping that i would like it once i know how to play... Of coz i might not like it ultimately, but i just wanted to try &amp; find out...<br><br>Don't know la... Wierd... I'm fine, just puzzled... Coz sometimes you think you've done a darn great thing when in fact, it was a stupid thing to do. Just want to hear from you guys your opinions... You know, you need people to tell you when you are wrong, if not, you forever think you are right one... I want to hear some guys' point of view...<br><br>Thanks Peepz...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div></blockquote><span style="color: green;">i really envy your bf.. anyway u have done the right thing and it's not like every gal will do the same thing u know..<br><br>U are willing to spend your time to learn so that u can b with him or prolly chat with him thru the game..<br><br>But thing is, it jus don works..<br><br>FIrst of all it will take alot of time to train to his lvl, then u will b spend hell lot fo time on this game.<br><br>PLaying Wow or other online games will really change someone personality..<br><br>Like u mentioned here, he got angry and stuff.. well don b sad k? Cause we gamers will get angry easily..<br><br>Have u notice he has changed personality? Like erm.. when he lost he smash his keyboard, punch the wall and stuff..<br><br>I hope your bf will stop playing wow and spend more time on u. BUt it's v hard and u can't help him, only he can help himself.<br><br>Playing online games addiction is v hard to quit.. And all because of these games, my studies drop.. but i now manage to control it..<br><br>I hope one day your bf will wake up!<br><br>Cheers</span></div>
