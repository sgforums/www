Imagine a vase with many cracks - that's how your relationship looks like.<br><br>I guess you had chose to make an alternative choice for you action - which is something you have to learn in the future too. *NEVER* simply ask for a break just because you can't stand it, etc. Learn to solve things and work together before resorting to anything like breaking, because once you break - everything is different even after you patch. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Stick onto your choice is my suggestion, because you firmly know that it is better in the long run. If not - you go back to this vicious cycle that only serve to suffer in the short + long run.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Imagine a vase with many cracks - that's how your relationship looks like.<br><br>I guess you had chose to make an alternative choice for you action - which is something you have to learn in the future too. *NEVER* simply ask for a break just because you can't stand it, etc. Learn to solve things and work together before resorting to anything like breaking, because once you break - everything is different even after you patch. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Stick onto your choice is my suggestion, because you firmly know that it is better in the long run.

I never say break up for fun. And when I say it, will be once and the last. Never like the idea of patching back.</div>
