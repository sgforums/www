            <div class='col-md body'>seriously, back at a similar crossroad as before,,,before i started poly...<br>then i asked, poly ? JC ? course? and i made a mistake and suffered for 3 whole years.<br><br>Problem 1. now i ask, what do i want to do in uni ? seriously, i cant really choose.  somehow there's this inherent fear that once i plunge into it, i may regret the job because i may not have seen, heard and know a certain job.<br><br>for example, a teacher, and i only know abt the joys of it. but i may not know the backstabbing and others that comes with the job. not saying that i am oblivious of backstabbing in any job but it's 1 example i am trying to put across.<br><br>i do have a list of waht i want to do but.prob is choosing which 1 of the list.<br>apparently some courses are only available overseas<br><br>Problem 2. i am clearly aware of what my dad wants and insists on me taking when i apply for uni. however the list of possible jobs i am looking are totally different from what he insists. i know ppl say " it's yr life...dont care abt him" but...<br><br>Problem 3. probably the most clear and present 1. and also 1 that is the most difficult 1.<br><br>i mean, being honest, my results are quite terrible for the last 5 sems. and i think the ntu biotech staff made it clear, it's a 'no go' for me.<br>she didnt say must have "this grades that grades" nor did i tell her mine...<br><br>but she said an impt keyword " abv average" and that settles it...<br><br>seriously i am quite confused. pressure's mounting in sch and i have some health issues to deal with...</div>
