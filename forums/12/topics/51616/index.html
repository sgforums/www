            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br>IÂ’m new here, and I would hope someone EXPERIENCE enough will give me their advice and suggestion! This was something to do with Â‘under tableÂ’!<br>I was a sales representative and I encounter this UNBELIEVABLE issue in SINGAPOIRE! All the while, I have this though in mind! Singapore was a CLEAN country, and our government has done a good job against the Â‘red tapeÂ’ and Â‘under tableÂ’. On top of this, our business sector was Â‘transparentÂ’ enough to attract investor! ButÂ…. After this few month of working in sales lineÂ… I noticeÂ… I was wrong! I was totally wrong!<br><br>The best part was, these things happen in state board organisation (NCS)! One of my friend whom is working in this company have told me that, although my price was BETTER then my competitor but the project managerÂ’s whose is taking charge of this particular project still INSIST to buy all the item from their LONG TIME supplier! What is this? You want sample, I bring my company sample and show it to you, you want best price, I try my very best to convince my company to lower its priceÂ…. End upÂ… they still bought from someone who quoted much higher then us (40% higher!!!!)  I was so sad and angry about the whole incident! IÂ’m working on a low basic and high commission company, my pay depend a lot on my sales result! And after putting my heart and soul on this projectÂ…Â… really disappointed!<br>I mean, if I lost the deal mainly because of ourÂ’s products was not up to standard, can not meet their requirements or can not meet the lead time or etcÂ…. I got nothing to say! But now the situation wasÂ… that old lady who made the final decision DONÂ’T EVEN GO THROUGH our company quotes! She KEEP awarding to that particular company! And some of my friends working under her told meÂ… a few old timer in the office have CLASH with her about this issuedÂ… but, she got the final say! And thatÂ’s this guy ignored her ORDER and bought some products from another firmÂ… he got SCREW like hell! Please note thatÂ… this guy who place the order have more then 20 years of working experience in Singtel!!!! SoÂ… I donÂ’t doubt his judgement! And thatÂ’s a time when I get to talk to himÂ…. He told me straight! ThatÂ’s UNDER TABLE happening in their office!! And he feel so sad for all his long time supplier! As nowÂ’s day, all his supplier whom have support him for so many years!!! have lost all the chance to deal with NCS again.. as he was not allow to get those items from them BUT only to those supplier whom are DIRECTED by that lady boss!<br><br>So, can any one down here can advice meÂ…. Is there any way I can penetrate into this company? And what should I do now? I told my boss about it! He laugh at me and sayÂ…. NOW THEN YOU KNOW!<br></div>
