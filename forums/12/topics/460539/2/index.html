              <p>Wow , you definately 100% can draw better than Naruto the pang sai. (If you didn't know what Naruto is, just know that it is an pang sai that enough and didn't even try to watch or read the manga, or else you will just get "poison" like me.)</p>
              <p>Anyway for your maths problem, I do heard that local trainer like Adam Khoo do have some study technique which allow you to "study less but achieved more" and there were some positive results from their students. If you want, there is no harm in trying their service :</p>
              <p>1) Adam Khoo Learning Centre : <a href="http://www.aklc.com.sg/">http://www.aklc.com.sg</a></p>
              <p>2) Adam Khoo Youth Division : <a href="http://www.empoweringyouth.com.sg/">http://www.empoweringyouth.com.sg</a></p>
              <p>Otherwise, just in case you need to re-take "O" level maths, I also heard that there is an private school called City College which seen to have good results : <a href="http://www.citycollege.edu.sg/">http://www.citycollege.edu.sg</a> , or you can always take part-time "O" level lesson in ITE while working for experience.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Otherwise there is an maths enrichment centre where they coach maths in all levels : <a href="http://www.mso.com.sg">http://www.mso.com.sg</a> and "O" level Intensive Crash Course from Neuromath Pte Ltd : <a href="http://www.neuromathacademy.com">http://www.neuromathacademy.com</a> . You can also learn maths online : <a href="http://www.mathtutordvd.com">http://www.mathtutordvd.com</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For your info, these are also 2 days 'O' level A/E Maths Workshop for quick revision : <a href="http://ebs.edu.sg">http://ebs.edu.sg</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for your taking in art path, I suggested you contact public organization for example, DesignSingapore Council and they will be able to advise on how you can realize your dream, which schools you can attend and even scholarships for your finanical help :</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In overseas, there is an well-known art school called The Kubert School where A significant amount of their student go onto work for well-known companies like Marvel, DC Comics, Dark Horse Comics, Archie Comics etc : <a href="http://kubertschool.edu">http://kubertschool.edu</a>  </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Yeah I know...that's why I'm having second thoughts about going
              for art. I know I'm not good enough. I'm not the only one that can
              draw, there are thousands of people out there who has it better and
              I know that. Which means, if I screw up my olevels it's all over

              <p>Nothing is over until it's truly over.</p>
              <p>You are still young... O level student.... adult life havn't even start.. don't give up so easily.</p>
              <p>Look at it this way.... you will be working 20-30 years after you come out from school.. so you might as well do something you love to do, because you will be doing it for a very LONG time.</p>
              <p>Talent is very important... and being artsy means you need creative juice.  I think you lack creative juice because you are not exposed to the outside world much.</p>
              <p>Many great artists.. they get inspiration from their life.. from their surrounding world...you are young.. lack of life experience... and I'm sure you havn't travel outside little dot much...</p>
              <p>The reason why in Singapore it's not so easy to be creative ..is because our environment is not conducive to creativity.</p>
              <p>Go out there and live more.. learn more.. see more...</p>

              even start.. don't give up so easily.</p>
              <p>Look at it this way.... you will be working 20-30 years after
              you come out from school.. so you might as well do something you
              love to do, because you will be doing it for a very LONG time.</p>
              <p>Talent is very important... and being artsy means you need
              creative juice.  I think you lack creative juice because you
              are not exposed to the outside world much.</p>
              <p>Many great artists.. they get inspiration from their life.. from
              their surrounding world...you are young.. lack of life
              experience... and I'm sure you havn't travel outside little dot
              much...</p>
              <p>The reason why in Singapore it's not so easy to be creative ..is
              because our environment is not conducive to creativity.</p>

              <p>in a way yes, it's more about the ones on top deciding what the rest are.</p>
              <p>and the definition of art is well defined as well.</p>
              <p>but not really say all aspects. certain segments of the society agree with this and it's not stuffy to them at all. it's only stuffy if you don't agree</p>
              <p>if you like fried chicken it's ok if someone thinks we should eat fried chicken everyday.</p>

              <p>well you can see his postings... he attacks me in other threads ... he doesn't contribute to the thread, just single me out and mindlessly attack. That's online stalking.</p>
              <p>So are you saying he is not crazy ? Why , is it because he is from your country ?</p>
              <p>Lets face it, when he as a Malaysian behaves badly in a SG forum... it makes you ( another malaysian ) look bad too.</p>
              <p>But when you attack me a Singaporean... in defense of him.. you are doing yourself a bigger disfavor.</p>
              <p>There are people you should stand up for..and some you need to let rot.</p>
              <p>Do what is right for the right reason. You are a grown adult.. you should know better.</p>

              <p>like I said, you have a batman effect, and you've created your very own joker.</p>
              <p>can't say I blame him.  you don't see him attacking other people. and his description isn't exactly wrong about you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>oi, can't read ah? how come your reading always so selective. I've referred to everyone who participate as crazy already.  and that's like only 5-6 posts above this.</p>
