              I'm posting here and I hope someone would chance upon this post and give me some advice. 
                  I'm currently in the midst of taking my olevels and I just did my math paper 2 today, I knew I screwed up the paper. I had never passed math even once ever since PSLE. I'm weak in my academics as well. I only do decently in pure geography, elective history and sometimes english. My l1b5 for the prelims is 30. The question is where can I go after olevels?
                  I definitely can't make it into jc however much I want to. And as a math failure, I doubt I can get into any decent poly or poly course. I have decent (I think) drawing skills, so I've been considering nafa or lasalle, but the school fees are extremely costly and I don't want to be a burden to my parents... also, my art style is manga...and I don't even think there's a course for that in singapore... :(
                  To all of you who read this, I'm glad you took the time, it may be weird of me to ask, but can someone tell me what I should do or where can someone like me go after o levels? I'm also worried that if I am to get into art, I would have a very trying future and must struggle to keep myself alive...
                  Someone please give me some advice? :(

              I tried math tuition in sec 2 but it didn't work out... I always had difficulty understanding concepts, this applies to physics and chemistry as well. I don't take physics anymore (took it at lower sec level and never passed), chemistry is a little better because there's still some content work .___.

              <p>OK. So you are a artsy person.. well.. you want to go art school.. but you don;t want to burden your parents with the expensive tuition. Good that you are prudent on spending your parents money.....</p>
              <p>What is/are your special talent ?</p>
              <p>Are you good in drawing ? Designing ? Performance art ?</p>
              <p>Have you checked out the various art instituions in Singapore ? Do you know what it takes to get in ? Do you think you can succeed in those environment ?</p>
              <p>You need to do more ground work to find out if that's where you want to head towards.</p>
              <p>Not every student who take the Artsy path succeed... many will fail and drop out only to restart on their original path.</p>
              <p>So I suggest you tour those schools first... and look at their curriculums... please do not get too distracted with the buildings and students there... what is most important is the education they offer.</p>

              <p>OK. So you are a artsy person.. well.. you want to go art
              school.. but you don;t want to burden your parents with the
              expensive tuition. Good that you are prudent on spending your
              parents money.....</p>
              <p>What is/are your special talent ?</p>
              <p>Are you good in drawing ? Designing ? Performance art ?</p>
              <p>Have you checked out the various art instituions in Singapore ?
              Do you know what it takes to get in ? Do you think you can succeed
              in those environment ?</p>
              <p>You need to do more ground work to find out if that's where you
              want to head towards.</p>
              <p>Not every student who take the Artsy path succeed... many will
              fail and drop out only to restart on their original path.</p>
              <p>So I suggest you tour those schools first... and look at their
              curriculums... please do not get too distracted with the buildings
              and students there... what is most important is the education they
              offer.</p>

              <p>I draw, but I haven't been given any professional tutoring and I don't take art...</p>
              <p>Yes, I've checked out the information on La Salle and NAFA, the prices, the entry requirements. I know as well, that the art path is difficult. I know that it's hard to earn a living on art alone, though things like designing or interior designing may earn better (?) But drawing? I'm not so sure...</p>

              <p><br>There's good money in drawing. And the work is focus on your talents, you get to discuss with clients about design and stuff like that. Also, the environment in advertising is more interactive, playful and creative. Unlike the dull office jobs out there.</p>

              <p><br>you can still draw. but give yourself some time. i am sure your parents want the best for you but at this momnet youshould concerntrate on studies. do your bets for o-levels mayb things wil work itself out. then see how. if results not good then can decide what to do. youar estill very tyoung, providence time and a life with endless possibilities is in front of you. give yourself 10-20-30-40 years, its never too late when you feel ready or still hold the passionfor art later can still take up course.</p>

              <p>stay young but sometimes don;t do things on impulse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its not about who can draw better than you or what, but you need to have a style on your own. a style that no need so many words and explaination online with tons of blogging shit. unlike photography, hand skecthc images are a test of a real artist, not wannabes.</p>

              <p>Then where you live under a rock? You claim you are Malaysian what... your country don't have a forum for morons like you to post meh ? Issit because no one likes you there.. so you come here and get some much needed attention ?</p>
              <p>Don;t worry about my husband.. you get yourself a vagina first then say lah. No need to go share with your local pathetic swingers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And no I am not a houswife.. I have a job.. in my own company.. so please stop your stupid assumptions that all mothers must be housewife... u so sua koo.</p>
              <p>I am starting to think you could be mentally unstable.. looking at your previous postings.</p>

              <p>Same can be said of you, USA don't have forum for you to post meh? You dare to call malaysians live under the rock. 30% singaporeans are malaysians are have relatives here.</p>
              <p>Since when Jojo bitch speaks for everybody here. I think you should look at yourself in the mirror - no one likes you here. Except those newbies like Luleil whom you try to trick and give shitty advice.</p>
              <p>Oh Oh now yuo say I assume, justnow you were assuming that i am from JB and jobless. I see you so free, so must be an asshole housewife. Yes, you have a job, as a sex slave and homemaker fror your husband and your pitiful abused kid. All that thrash talk, he is going to end up like the psycho serial killer in that movie.</p>
              <p>You jealous is it? Jealous of my swinger status. Your husband fool around with so many women, you better get a paps smear. But wait, you are a bitch, so going die of VD.</p>
              <p>Look at yourself lah, who likes you. Your thrash talk, you let out your lonely rants here. Go get a job lah. You did post last time that you are a housewife so don't lie. Also, in USA unemployment so high, no way they will hire a traitor like you. You got no talent but thrash talent. You so free to go into the forum and post your lousy bullshit advice, go and take some xanax to relieve your depression lah. What an asshole and a bitch lady.</p>

              <p>No I don't have the forum all to myself. I get to share this with the denizens of sgforum. A good thing that Jojo bitch decides to leave. Yeah, lets bring out the champaign.</p>
              <p>Miss Traitor has left the building !</p>
              <p>And how dare you call this forum - godfosaken. This forum consist of hardworking, aspiring, talented singaporeans and other nationalities who want to contribute their feedback for their further self development and for the development of the nation.</p>
              <p>No wonder the jojo bitch can talk like this - because she is the traitor who left singapore for white people nation. Jojo bitch migrated so she can have her abuse son avoid National service while other hardworking singaporean brave men proudly join NS to defend the country. What a coward !</p>
              <p>THe title Asshole of the Year belongs to you Jojo Bitch.</p>
              <p>Yes I have fun and at least I am loyal to my country. Ms Jojo Bitch have fun in USA, where all the KKK red-necks and Republican Tea Party racist will chase you and your thrash family out.</p>
