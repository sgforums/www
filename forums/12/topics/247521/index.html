            <div class='col-md body'>Here's a summary, i believe Bontakun, iveco did read something onShoutbox.  So here's me retracing the steps of what went wrong with myself and Devil 1976.<br><br>Myself, VK had a dispute with Mcsquare on another forum.<br><br>And myself Vk commn with Devil on PM regards to mcsquare.<br><br>On the thread where Ghimpeng posted about g/fs who cut themselves. I flamed mcssquare with a emoticon.<br><br>Then I proceed to lay down what I've known, experienced and had done and what worked for females I've known to be cutting themselves.<br><br>Devil then proceeded to 'Stand up for mcsquare' to claim that my advises are flawed, and thats its 'murder on the vunerable.'<br><br>That prompted myself to post on whethers Mods are certified, there was also another thread regards to the intergrity of Mods here.<br><br>Which subsequently, alexrain comes in to complain about Devil seducing his g/f stuffs.<br><br>And devil tries to discredit Alexrain, claiming he is my clone.<br><br>Then we have Alexrain's g/f Bee-gal coming in to also compllain about devil.<br><br>After that, devil proceeded to Club30s to spam &amp; flame myself in 2 of the Club 30s threads.<br><br>I copied the flaming back to AA here.<br><br>Devil then proceeded back to Club 30s and started a thread about both of us maybe having commn misunderstanding and will want to clear the air.<br><br>I agree to a outing to meet up with Devil to shake his hands.<br><br>So things was kept quiet for a while awaiting my return to SG.<br><br>Then I was pm-med regards to Quinsy's issue in her forum, in her thread.<br><br>She was advised on how to legally put her molestor away for good.<br><br>And then I started this 2 threads here regards to date rape &amp; molest and harrassment by phone.<br><br>devil was unhappy about it, typing that he is innocent, and it was a political ploy to drag him down.<br><br>And on shoutbox, devil decides that meeting me will cause him indigestion in his stomach, so he wont be turning up at the pre-arranged meet up.<br><br>I have however scheduled my trips accordingly to this meet up.  And I will still be turning up at the appointed location at the appointed time.<br><br>So folks. Everyone was invited to Kallang Stadium Macdonalds if you really need to inspect who I am and what I am.<br><br>Its:<br><br>Date: 21st April 2007, Saturday<br>Time: 1400 hours-1600 hours<br>Place: Kallang Stadium Macdonalds<br><br>Just bring yourself if you are free and looking for a chit chat session.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, Jason isn't to be blamed or anything yah. Lets look at the mods and admin as separate entities. The person whom started it...you guys know who lah...so not the fault of the other Mods if they don't do anything. Why? Because it by keeping quiet, you won't accidentally say things to side him or what. Frankly, they keep quiet to maintain a neutrality in this crap storm. Pardon me for saying this, but if I were a Mod, I certainly won't wanna be cut in this crap man.</div>
