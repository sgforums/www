              <p>though i tried to think positively, however, all my friends passed and they can continue their studies smoothly.. but me? lots of shit to settled.. eg. to appeal because time table clashes/may not be able to take IA/whats worst.. may not be able to graduate tgther!! Worst case scenerio...... </p>
              <p>rly on the verge to quit sch!!! getting an income is so much impt to the rest of my life. one thing for sure, sure be happier in my life if school is out of my mind.</p>
              <p>p/s: the module i need to retake is totally pain in the ass! cant imagine i'd have to study that AGAIN.</p>

              <p>relax and straighten your thoughts. being so pissed won't help you now.</p>
              <p>and think how to solve it instead just saying. perhaps it would be better.</p>
              <p>Well, tried thinking positive isn't enough. look back at your both post. how much negative thoughts have you been generating? the more negative thoughts you posses, the more negative stuffs gonna just continue to happen to you.</p>
              <p>So think how to solve your issue, and move on.</p>

              <p>Yes, they are actually being invited. and i only know this fact aft I'm admitted into uni. oh wells, whats done is done.. truth is i didn't work hard enough for this particular module. too much negative sayings abt it and i dont accept as a fact that i need to study it too.</p>
              <p>another source of my negative thought is that.. i feel embarrassed because i talked as though i knew and understand alot.. in the end, im the only one who failed among my frens.... feel awfully disgraced...</p>

I saw once in shanghai world expo, my father was there on business with his mistress and i just tact along, then I saw this big Singapore roadshow inviting chinese to go singapore as PR, citizens, scholars or simply bus drivers. That time I was about 16yo, just out of my monastary training in taiwan, the singapore delegates even thought I am a china girl, keep pestering me, show me how good Singaporean are in welcoming China People, I was like, damn</p>
