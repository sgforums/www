            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.. think I'm gonna hurt u by saying that u r not likely to get wat u want. Becoz Econs is already an Social sci subject, that is suppose to be linked to the arts stream rather than to the sci stream. Chances of taking 2 sci and 2 arts subject will not be very high. And having a 4th subject, it will likely be Econs,F maths, Art or Bio.<br><br>Then again diff sch will haf diff courses. they are having an open house soon rite?? visit them lorz... and several others as well. even those not so near ur house one also can visit. juz for knowledge. juz for ur info also, u can put this combi for them to consider also. If there is enuff pple, like &gt;10, they may consider accepting students, and open up another class. But they also consider if this combi will let u haf something to study when u get to the local uni.<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>
