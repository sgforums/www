            <div class='col-md body'>I think in general, this social problem is rather prevalent in developed countries where, when women have high pay and somewhat more financially independent, they can afford not to be married and women mostly, really mostly, marry upwards.<br><br>I think it starts from seeing how women are attracted to a man which is the fundamental basic - Money. Now I know most guys would roll their eyes and think that women are gold diggers. Yeah there are some bad sheep which purely marry for money but women being as they are, have written into their DNA structure to look for a mate which can provide her offspring with the best environment, and seriously if a guy has no money and love only, it's not possible. It's still ok if a guy has no money BUT has the potential to make money like possessing a professional degree, having a business which might strike rich.<br><br>I believe there's nothing wrong with such a view, let's be practical. U need money to survive, not just 'i love u i love u.' I think using the term 'money' has negative connotations, how about financial security? Men must be able to provide adequate financial security according to the requirements of the woman of interest. I think financial security is a pre-requisite but the foundation of any marriage/relationship is chemistry and love.<br><br>So in Singapore with increasing literacy rates and women mostly mostly marrying upwards, we have a problem for the men who have lower earning power. Young that time, can still fool around n love here lover there for fun fun. But when it gets down to the crux of committing to a marriage, I believe women will wisen up and still demand their required level of financial security. And since they are financially independent, they dun see the need to marry if needed.<br><br>I think SG girls like girls anywhere hope to settle down and have a nice family for most of them, just that they now can demand more and have higher requirements. It was not so in the past for the previous generations of our parents. Money n marriage issues are always touchy and a hot topic for debate.<br><br>But then again, I would say our own SG girls though financially independent and smart and pretty, there's just this thing about them which I'm not attracted mostly. I think it's partly cause of the doting of parents and easier life. Eg, we men have to serve NS and NS changes our perspectives of things, makes us appreciate the smaller things in life like freedom, friends, family etc. It's like we are made to taste how hot chilli taste like and now knowing that, we guys appreciate all the more that 'cold glass of water'. But women just don't have that kind of rewarding experience of going thru NS. It's tough but we guys gotta admit, most of us change for the better.<br><br>Foreign girls from our neighbouring countries, mostly are from a harsher background and have to work harder not only academically but also socially to prove themselves and for their families. I find all of the foreign girls I know in uni, who come from harsher backgrounds are more matured and well-mannered. They are beautiful, very very smart, independent but sweet, soft, loving and having those wifey qualities which are just attractive.<br><br>What do you guys think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think you're absolutely right in your analysis...your comments not only apply to singapore girls, but too all girls in general...girls will always look for financial security first before engaging in other considerations...that's the highest priority women place in choosing a guy when it comes to being marriage material...it's not that they're not thinking of other issues like love, feelings, emotional compatibility, but the underlying consideration is that of feeling financially secure with the guy she finally chooses to be her husband...if a guy can't give a woman some of the material things she wants in life the relationship will founder on the inability of the guy to look after her as she thinks he should...not that he's not trying, it's just that current financial constraints prevent him from giving her all she needs...let's take a typical example...when two people get married, the next thing is sharing a home together...who wouldn't want a home set out like the cover of a magazine? every girl wants to have that...no one wants to come home to a living room dressed with two sticks of furniture...that requires a certain amount of spending power on the part of the guy...if he can't match her dollar for dollar, it's going to be a tricky proposition in the long run....you simply can't separate love from wanting to have the good life together...in any society there will always be stratification based on wealth, it's inevitable....if a girl can find love without financial considerations intruding, so much the better, but you've always got to think long term...what are the chances of preserving the marriage long term if every time the guy is broke with no prospect of self improvement....at the end of the day, to get the girl you want, it's incumbent on the guy to improve himself first to the financial level that the girl expects him to reach...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MetalGear:</div><div class="quote_body">I think in general, this social problem is rather prevalent in developed countries where, when women have high pay and somewhat more financially independent, they can afford not to be married and women mostly, really mostly, marry upwards.<br><br>I think it starts from seeing how women are attracted to a man which is the fundamental basic - Money.

I keep hearing the same things again and again. It does get relatively boring..<br><br>Not big money, but lets say i get 1.5k a month. After deducting bills and such i get maybe 700 to bank in. 700x24 = 16,800. That's not a lot right? Its only 16,800.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MetalGear:</div><div class="quote_body">I think in general, this social problem is rather prevalent in developed countries where, when women have high pay and somewhat more financially independent, they can afford not to be married and women mostly, really mostly, marry upwards.<br><br>I think it starts from seeing how women are attracted to a man which is the fundamental basic - Money. Now I know most guys would roll their eyes and think that women are gold diggers. Yeah there are some bad sheep which purely marry for money but women being as they are, have written into their DNA structure to look for a mate which can provide her offspring with the best environment, and seriously if a guy has no money and love only, it's not possible. It's still ok if a guy has no money BUT has the potential to make money like possessing a professional degree, having a business which might strike rich.<br><br>I believe there's nothing wrong with such a view, let's be practical. U need money to survive, not just 'i love u i love u.' I think using the term 'money' has negative connotations, how about financial security? Men must be able to provide adequate financial security according to the requirements of the woman of interest. I think financial security is a pre-requisite but the foundation of any marriage/relationship is chemistry and love.<br><br>So in Singapore with increasing literacy rates and women mostly mostly marrying upwards, we have a problem for the men who have lower earning power. Young that time, can still fool around n love here lover there for fun fun. But when it gets down to the crux of committing to a marriage, I believe women will wisen up and still demand their required level of financial security. And since they are financially independent, they dun see the need to marry if needed.<br><br>I think SG girls like girls anywhere hope to settle down and have a nice family for most of them, just that they now can demand more and have higher requirements. It was not so in the past for the previous generations of our parents. Money n marriage issues are always touchy and a hot topic for debate.<br><br>But then again, I would say our own SG girls though financially independent and smart and pretty, there's just this thing about them which I'm not attracted mostly. I think it's partly cause of the doting of parents and easier life. Eg, we men have to serve NS and NS changes our perspectives of things, makes us appreciate the smaller things in life like freedom, friends, family etc. It's like we are made to taste how hot chilli taste like and now knowing that, we guys appreciate all the more that 'cold glass of water'. But women just don't have that kind of rewarding experience of going thru NS. It's tough but we guys gotta admit, most of us change for the better.<br><br>Foreign girls from our neighbouring countries, mostly are from a harsher background and have to work harder not only academically but also socially to prove themselves and for their families. I find all of the foreign girls I know in uni, who come from harsher backgrounds are more matured and well-mannered. They are beautiful, very very smart, independent but sweet, soft, loving and having those wifey qualities which are just attractive.<br><br>What do you guys think?</div></blockquote>can't agree more.
