Some things are truly out of control, no matter how hard you try and how much effort you put in.

I can't expect to get first class honours or anything, but even if I do screw up, surely I can't screw up that badly. No matter how bad things seem to be, there's always someone out there who's having it worse than you.<br><br>The key here is to be realistic. Some things are truly out of control, no matter how hard you try and how much effort you put in. The more important thing is to realise that it is your effort that truly matters and not just the results. Sure, results are of course important, but what's more important is how you get the results, and not just getting the results itself.<br><br>Like I said, be realistic. Maybe you can't be the best, but certainly you can't be the worst, either. Just put in your best effort and hope for the best.</div></blockquote>I understand the point of "trying your best and appreciate your own effort made" but I guess most people would want others to appreciate what they have done.<br><br>The situation here is quite pragmatic. People only appreciate your results, not your effort. I think the general perception is still that results is equivalent to effort made. The better stuff that you can show to others, the more effort you are seen to have made.<br><br>Nobody cares a hoot about people with average results.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
