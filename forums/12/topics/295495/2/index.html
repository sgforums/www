(:<br><br>Sometimes a stranger can be a better friend than some of your "classmates" (as you call them). Take all of us forumers as an example, all of us are here to help you in your time of need, doesn't that make as even better friends than some of your acquaintances ?<br><br>When you watch a movie and see 2 friends being so close, you envy them. Many of us know how you feel. I had a friend who was very close to me once, but once I showed my sensitive side, she shoved that aside and walked off.<br><br>If you have friends who are not really "friends", all you have to do is walk away from them. When they come to you for help, don't help. Laugh back at them when they make mistakes. I walked away from my clique just this year, and I'm doing fine.<br><br>There are always people who are more worthy of your friendship in this world, you just have to be patient and find them.<br><br>To me, Best Friends are very rare in Singapore.<br>I'm many years younger than you, and still I can relate. Friends come in all shapes and sizes, expand your range and you'll soon find some.<br><br>Remember - a good friend isn't someone who share the same interests as you, it's someone who will pay attention to you and your problems.</div>

Try to get to know them well.<br><br>yes , sometimes friends tend to outcast some of their friends , that is normal , they are talking among themselves with other topic which don't interest you at all , so you must try not to get yourself outcast by trying to start a topic with them.<br><br>and this is the world , people don't tend to care about you when they don't need help , so at the most you should help yourself , because when you help them this time , they might not help you next time when you are in need of a help.
