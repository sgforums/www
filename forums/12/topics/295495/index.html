            <div class='col-md body'>don't worry true friends are those that are really hard to find and it is only a matter of time before you meet them<br><br>I got like only 2 friends who would strike my mind whenever I face problems<br><br>1 is really a nice guy who would sincerely do his best<br><br>the other one I regard her as one of my best friends but I don't know whether she regards me too lol. I would see her as an extremely nice person and that's the reason why I regard her as a faithful friend..maybe she also treats others the same way lol  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>anyway some friends are treated as utilty friends? don't know how to describe them but they are just those friends whom I would usually hang out with but don't really pour my troubles to them cos it seems to me that they don't really like to dabble into the so-called emotional issues..they would just brush off by saying aiyah doesn't matter lah or just change topics sliently. they too forget about my birthday. I remember only one of my classmates asked me on that day and that was the day when they knew about it. like you I paid for their birthdays including the girls who don't have a good impression of me. despite that they still never wish me lol. when my classmate who is the one always buying presents for the birthday babies held an outing for my birthday..only 3 people accompanied including him and the other birthday boy who was quite well-recevied by the boys and girls compared to me. maybe when they heard my name then they all turn down lol.<br><br>my those 2 friends got wish me lah so I was quite contend..but then anyway I think those kind of friends can also your friends mah..trivial things like birthdays don't really matter to me..it is more of a disappointment. patience maybe?..maybe if you have got problems and you approach one of your friends for help and they offer with sincerity then maybe they could be one of your true friends?</div>
