              <p>She is giving you the hot and cold. Looks like she is trying to bargain high price. Probably she is having doubts or second thoughts about you. Anyway look at it the bright side, yuo are better off without her, she is too much older than you. You may not have the maturity to handle her.</p>
              <p>Though her friends say she is single, you cannot be 100% certain. I have known ladies in their late 30s, able to date younger and wealthy guys.</p>
              <p>If she continue to be attention seeking, then complain to your co workers about her behaviour and declare that you no longer like her. Then she would stop disturbing you. It is no secret anyway, according to your story, you have already spoken to your co workers about your attraction to her.</p>

              Yes she is very popular with the guys in my company too. Thing is out of so many guys why is she so eager on the texting. I bet she has lots of work to do too and she could bomb someone else hp instead. 2 weeks of bombing my hp was a little too much.
              
              The only thing I can think of is that she is touched when I made fruit juices everyday for a week when she was ill. I confessed to her 1 day and after a few days later she kept texting me. She even MMS an old picture of hers to me and ask if her previous or current hairstyle is nicer etc. Though she was busy at this year end, she even suggested to take leave together to go USS.
              
              The most surprising thing is she told me who are the guys who confessed to her in the company and why she wouldn't consider them. I also asked why does she like me. She said i'm a cute, friendly shy guy. 
              
              And now she seems to be trying to seek my attention. I really want to ask her why would she want my attention when she has EVERY guys attention in the company.

              <p><br> Yes she is very popular with the guys in my company too. Thing is
                  out of so many guys why is she so eager on the texting. I bet she
                  has lots of work to do too and she could bomb someone else hp
                  instead. 2 weeks of bombing my hp was a little too much. The only
                  thing I can think of is that she is touched when I made fruit
                  juices everyday for a week when she was ill. I confessed to her 1
                  day and after a few days later she kept texting me. She even MMS an
                  old picture of hers to me and ask if her previous or current
                  hairstyle is nicer etc. Though she was busy at this year end, she
                  even suggested to take leave together to go USS. The most
                  surprising thing is she told me who are the guys who confessed to
                  her in the company and why she wouldn't consider them. I also asked
                  why does she like me. She said i'm a cute, friendly shy guy. And
                  now she seems to be trying to seek my attention. I really want to
                  ask her why would she want my attention when she has EVERY guys
                  attention in the company.</p>

              <p>Well, since she is popular than the more you should just leave her alone and ignore everything about her. She will get the hint well and when the new and better guys come in, you will be history. She just need to accept that you are gone for good.I believe you are still seeking her attention as you revealed that you notice her glancing at you and all that. It may be some form of ego boosting for you but not for long.Trust me. Her current behaviour will not be permanent.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>There’s this girl working in the same company as I am but in
              different depts. She’s a single 40yr old lady working in the HR
              dept and I’m a 29yr old guy. One day I found out that she was sick
              at home, I made her freshly made juices for a week and she texted
              me that she was actually very moved &amp; thanked me. (Our normal
              way of communication is through texting as we work in different
              areas of the same company)</p>
              <p>After a few days of texting casually, I confessed to her via
              text. Her first response was ” Are u pulling my leg? Do u know how
              old am I? If you were to know my age u wouldn’t talk to me again.”
              I told her I didn’t care about her age and she doesn’t need to tell
              me how old she is. Ever since then, I would always find a chance to
              pop by her desk with a smile and tease her a little. Our text
              messaging became very frequent. We would call each other up and
              chat on the phone for a while at night. We told each other to take
              this relationship slow and easy so we can get to know each other
              more and etc.</p>
              <p>For 2 weeks, she was texting me a lot. From the time we start
              work till night and we’ll end with a short conversation. I tried to
              ask her out a couple of times but she says she’s very busy
              especially near year end, she suggested that we could take off from
              work 1 day and go out. She gave me a date but can’t promise me yet
              till she confirms her time table. (She’s genuinely busy near year
              end as she’s the manager of the HR dept and she is 24 hours on
              standby to run errands for the boss)</p>
              <p>I asked her out for dinner after work a couple of times but she
              always told me she’s going out dinner with her <span>LADY</span> friends. She seems to intentionally say the word
              “lady” louder to make sure I don’t misunderstand. Even though she’s
              out with her friends, she would still constantly text me and call
              me at night before we head to bed. I got frustrated and wonder why
              does she prefers to go out with her friends than me, it seems she
              was playing hard to get. And her constant text messaging everyday
              kind of made me even more frustrated. Constant texting in terms of
              like every 10-15mins starting from 8am all the way to the night
              including weekends! She would text me about everything she’s doing
              and asking about myself as if we are both dating already. I’ve
              gently reminded her that i can’t keep up with her texting at work,
              she said to ignore her but the text never slowed down a bit.
              Frustrated and running out of patience, I told her ” Stop msging me
              again, I don’t intend to have a cyber GF.”</p>
              <p>She stopped texting me ever since. She was absent from work the
              next day. Out of concern I texted her &amp; called her but no
              replies. The next day at work, I popped by her desk to ask how is
              she. She ignored me and looked very upset. I bought flowers to
              apologize to her the next day at work. She texted me ” Thx and
              appreciate it very much but no need for flowers and your juices. We
              shall remain colleagues and friends and I’m not suitable for you.”
              I asked her whats wrong and she kept replying the same thing. I
              told her i know i made a mistake by sending that text that hurt her
              and not to judge me just on one text. I asked her why wouldn’t she
              give me 2nd chance. we haven’t went out alone with each other to
              feel each other but her response was the same. I got angry and told
              her its fine by me but i won’t even consider her as a friend
              anymore but just co worker thats all. She replied ” Don’t be so
              immature. thx. “</p>
              <p>Next day, a co worker of mine had a chat with her. She suddenly
              pointed at my picture in the company photo and complained why am i
              so fierce and never smiled. Afraid of getting our co worker’s
              suspicion, she quickly changed subject. Few days later, I humbled
              myself and apologized to her. She replied ” Its not your fault, the
              problem lies with me. Its just that I can’t find myself to accept
              someone so much younger than i am and i wish we could chat like
              before.” But ever since then, every time I texted her casually she
              would take a long time to reply or never reply at all. Confused, I
              called her and asked her whats wrong and we ended up in a very very
              very bad argument.</p>
              <p>Since then, I avoided her and stopped all contact for 3 weeks.
              Then one day we accidentally bumped into her other at the hallway,
              she smiled back at me and asked me not to be hostile. At first I
              thought she wanted revenge but i emailed her that night to
              apologize and she accepted it. We would still smile at each other
              at work and greet each other. Feeling regretful and desperate to
              rekindle the relationship before, I apologized to her through text
              like 2-3 times on different days.A few days later, I texted her
              asking how is she, she would coldly reply me. Feeling desperate
              again, I thanked her for forgiving me and saying sorry, she replied
              ” Stop msging me this kind of msg, my bf is getting pissed off.” (I
              knew she was lying cos she was out with a grp of colleagues at that
              time.)</p>
              <p>After a couple of days at work, we bumped with each other at the
              hallway again. She gave me a nasty look. I told myself to forget
              about her and move on so I ignored her since then. But at work
              whenever she saw me she would do silly things like calling out very
              loudly to a friend of mine, interrupting our conversation. I had to
              pass by her work space today and she slammed her mouse loudly and
              signed. When ever she passes the hallway, i caught her several
              times turning her head to my working area. ( She knows its only me
              and one guy working at that area.) I would find her staring at me
              when I’m in the office. She would flirt with the guy colleagues at
              work. A co worker whom I told him about both of us said she’s
              obviously seeking my attention. I have no idea what does she
              exactly want. A few close co workers who are friends with her said
              that she’s already 40 and feeling lonely and that she’s extremely
              short tempered.</p>
              <p>Sorry for my bad english and so much details but I hope you can
              get a clear picture of what i am going through now. The desperate
              and negative feelings i had is gone and I’m my old happy self but
              the things she is doing is annoying me. It seems the more i ignore
              her the more she wants to grab my attention. Yes i still have
              feelings for her as she is really a nice lady but her immature
              actions are actually lame. I have moved on from her but if there is
              a chance i really want to try to rekindle the relationship we had
              before and progress further. I know I made many mistakes like being
              short temperd and showing her my desperateness by apologizing to
              her 3-4x before. At the moment I’m still ignoring her but i still
              do greet her whenever we bump in each other at work.</p>
              <p>I really don’t understand why is she doing this. Is she out for
              revenge now? Or did she regret of letting me go and trying to see
              what’s my response? Or is it both? I’m really confused.</p>

              Im in the process of moving on.. Before I deleted her contact last night.. I texted her how I really felt and wished her all the best to her and her bf. She replied thx.
              
              I know I shouldn't have texted her but I just wanna have my final say. This morning she greeted me with a cheerful smile so I guess no more hard feelings between us.
              
              I guess u guys are right, she might be a player. A very pro experience player with lots of free time. It hurts... This is my first time I ever met such a lady. I guess I've boosted her ego already.
