              Haha.... xiao mei meis, no offense. But in the looks, figure and charm dept. She has it all. Despite her age of late 30s she has the full package. She is one of the very rare cougars able to make guys turn head. No joke. There are lots of girls who wished they could be like her when they are her age.
              
              Anyway I've already moved on. But I'm quite satisfied to actually made a cougar interested in me among all the other competitors. Spamming my HP with her 101% attention on me felt good. ( More like an ego boost .) Thank God I made her angry with that sms i sent, otherwise who knows what the relationship / affair might have progressed to. I'm actually surprised she really got so angry until she MC from work next day and somemore can complain about me to other colleague about my picture in the photo. LOL
              
              The things she did, those silly, weird and daring stuff she did for me when we were on cloud 9. I'm actually quite honored. She was actually quite aggressive. But I'm quite disappointed that she LIED to everyone including me that she's single.

              Yup and she's really good. If I didn't have my emotions attached I could have played along and see how far I can go. I'm quite surprised she actually threw her 100% attention to me and actually chased me. Maybe after a few months of no contact, I'll go disturb her and be friendly with her.
              
              I've been very friendly towards another girl in the office whom is a few years younger than I am. I certainly hope the cougar won't spoil me and the new girl's relationship. 
              
              Even after finding out the truth and her intentions. My gut feelings still tell me that the cougar actually have something for me. Otherwise she wouldn't ditch all her other play things and focus on me. The fruit juices I made for her, and the care and concern I gave her. I think she's just wants to be loved and I somewhat fed that emotions to her.

              <p>Seng, wake up to reality. She has seen so many guys and she can be unfaithful to her hubby and current lover. What makes you think you are that special to her? For all you know..she has made countless of guys falling in and out with her..with all her antics.</p>

              Hi White, yeah I never ruled out that possibility either. I just hope she won't come and disturb the other girl whom I've been close to in the same office as her.
              
              I've already moved on totally and thx for your views.

              I think its better to keep a very low profile. You'll have totally no idea what this cougar is thinking. I do not want trouble. Like i said she may or may not have any feelings for me before but by doing that it might spark something evil in her head.

              No gossip la. Only 3 people in the company knows about us. Whitejewel i think she's quite a stupid cougar ba rather than a successful one. She doesn't know I'm in good relations with many people in the company &amp; she's the one who is frowned at by even the girls in the office.
              
              I feel sad for the current victim actually (Not a close colleague). She told him not to text her after work cos she'll chunk her phone one side when she reaches home. LOL what lies!! If i show him my HP with her crazy texting from morning to night + she calls me every night for the 2 weeks in cloud 9, I think he'll be furious. 
              
              Of cos I won't do that but I wanna see what drama will happen between those 2 lol. 
              
              Damm funny, I got super close to one of the office girl last friday (Teasing loudly and chatting). Then I approached her to enquire about work stuff. Her face color totally black and don't even bother to look at me. She really a pro actress or I would say SIAO auntie.

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>There’s this girl working in the same company as I am but in
              different depts. She’s a single 40yr old lady working in the HR
              dept and I’m a 29yr old guy. One day I found out that she was sick
              at home, I made her freshly made juices for a week and she texted
              me that she was actually very moved &amp; thanked me. (Our normal
              way of communication is through texting as we work in different
              areas of the same company)</p>
              <p>After a few days of texting casually, I confessed to her via
              text. Her first response was ” Are u pulling my leg? Do u know how
              old am I? If you were to know my age u wouldn’t talk to me again.”
              I told her I didn’t care about her age and she doesn’t need to tell
              me how old she is. Ever since then, I would always find a chance to
              pop by her desk with a smile and tease her a little. Our text
              messaging became very frequent. We would call each other up and
              chat on the phone for a while at night. We told each other to take
              this relationship slow and easy so we can get to know each other
              more and etc.</p>
              <p>For 2 weeks, she was texting me a lot. From the time we start
              work till night and we’ll end with a short conversation. I tried to
              ask her out a couple of times but she says she’s very busy
              especially near year end, she suggested that we could take off from
              work 1 day and go out. She gave me a date but can’t promise me yet
              till she confirms her time table. (She’s genuinely busy near year
              end as she’s the manager of the HR dept and she is 24 hours on
              standby to run errands for the boss)</p>
              <p>I asked her out for dinner after work a couple of times but she
              always told me she’s going out dinner with her <span>LADY</span> friends. She seems to intentionally say the word
              “lady” louder to make sure I don’t misunderstand. Even though she’s
              out with her friends, she would still constantly text me and call
              me at night before we head to bed. I got frustrated and wonder why
              does she prefers to go out with her friends than me, it seems she
              was playing hard to get. And her constant text messaging everyday
              kind of made me even more frustrated. Constant texting in terms of
              like every 10-15mins starting from 8am all the way to the night
              including weekends! She would text me about everything she’s doing
              and asking about myself as if we are both dating already. I’ve
              gently reminded her that i can’t keep up with her texting at work,
              she said to ignore her but the text never slowed down a bit.
              Frustrated and running out of patience, I told her ” Stop msging me
              again, I don’t intend to have a cyber GF.”</p>
              <p>She stopped texting me ever since. She was absent from work the
              next day. Out of concern I texted her &amp; called her but no
              replies. The next day at work, I popped by her desk to ask how is
              she. She ignored me and looked very upset. I bought flowers to
              apologize to her the next day at work. She texted me ” Thx and
              appreciate it very much but no need for flowers and your juices. We
              shall remain colleagues and friends and I’m not suitable for you.”
              I asked her whats wrong and she kept replying the same thing. I
              told her i know i made a mistake by sending that text that hurt her
              and not to judge me just on one text. I asked her why wouldn’t she
              give me 2nd chance. we haven’t went out alone with each other to
              feel each other but her response was the same. I got angry and told
              her its fine by me but i won’t even consider her as a friend
              anymore but just co worker thats all. She replied ” Don’t be so
              immature. thx. “</p>
              <p>Next day, a co worker of mine had a chat with her. She suddenly
              pointed at my picture in the company photo and complained why am i
              so fierce and never smiled. Afraid of getting our co worker’s
              suspicion, she quickly changed subject. Few days later, I humbled
              myself and apologized to her. She replied ” Its not your fault, the
              problem lies with me. Its just that I can’t find myself to accept
              someone so much younger than i am and i wish we could chat like
              before.” But ever since then, every time I texted her casually she
              would take a long time to reply or never reply at all. Confused, I
              called her and asked her whats wrong and we ended up in a very very
              very bad argument.</p>
              <p>Since then, I avoided her and stopped all contact for 3 weeks.
              Then one day we accidentally bumped into her other at the hallway,
              she smiled back at me and asked me not to be hostile. At first I
              thought she wanted revenge but i emailed her that night to
              apologize and she accepted it. We would still smile at each other
              at work and greet each other. Feeling regretful and desperate to
              rekindle the relationship before, I apologized to her through text
              like 2-3 times on different days.A few days later, I texted her
              asking how is she, she would coldly reply me. Feeling desperate
              again, I thanked her for forgiving me and saying sorry, she replied
              ” Stop msging me this kind of msg, my bf is getting pissed off.” (I
              knew she was lying cos she was out with a grp of colleagues at that
              time.)</p>
              <p>After a couple of days at work, we bumped with each other at the
              hallway again. She gave me a nasty look. I told myself to forget
              about her and move on so I ignored her since then. But at work
              whenever she saw me she would do silly things like calling out very
              loudly to a friend of mine, interrupting our conversation. I had to
              pass by her work space today and she slammed her mouse loudly and
              signed. When ever she passes the hallway, i caught her several
              times turning her head to my working area. ( She knows its only me
              and one guy working at that area.) I would find her staring at me
              when I’m in the office. She would flirt with the guy colleagues at
              work. A co worker whom I told him about both of us said she’s
              obviously seeking my attention. I have no idea what does she
              exactly want. A few close co workers who are friends with her said
              that she’s already 40 and feeling lonely and that she’s extremely
              short tempered.</p>
              <p>Sorry for my bad english and so much details but I hope you can
              get a clear picture of what i am going through now. The desperate
              and negative feelings i had is gone and I’m my old happy self but
              the things she is doing is annoying me. It seems the more i ignore
              her the more she wants to grab my attention. Yes i still have
              feelings for her as she is really a nice lady but her immature
              actions are actually lame. I have moved on from her but if there is
              a chance i really want to try to rekindle the relationship we had
              before and progress further. I know I made many mistakes like being
              short temperd and showing her my desperateness by apologizing to
              her 3-4x before. At the moment I’m still ignoring her but i still
              do greet her whenever we bump in each other at work.</p>
              <p>I really don’t understand why is she doing this. Is she out for
              revenge now? Or did she regret of letting me go and trying to see
              what’s my response? Or is it both? I’m really confused.</p>

              <p>No gossip la. Only 3 people in the company knows about us. Whitejewel i think she’s quite a stupid cougar ba rather than a successful one. She doesn’t know I’m in good relations with many people in the company &amp; she’s the one who is frowned at by even the girls in the office.</p>
              <p>I feel sad for the current victim actually (Not a close colleague). She told him not to text her after work cos she’ll chunk her phone one side when she reaches home. <span>LOL</span> what lies!! If i show him my HP with her crazy texting from morning to night + she calls me every night for the 2 weeks in cloud 9, I think he’ll be furious.</p>
              <p>Of cos I won’t do that but I wanna see what drama will happen between those 2 lol.</p>
              <p>Damm funny, I got super close to one of the office girl last friday (Teasing loudly and chatting). Then I approached her to enquire about work stuff. Her face color totally black and don’t even bother to look at me. She really a pro actress or I would say <span>SIAO</span> auntie.</p>

              <p>You have to ultimately ask yourself, are you a player or searching for life partner?</p>
              <p>You approach her seemingly without any notion of whether she is the one or even asking yourself what you see in her that makes you like her.</p>
              <p>If you are a player, there are no rules, no holds barred. She think you are game. Yes, its all just a game. So blaming on her its not going to absolve the way you approached her. You seemingly get interested in her immediately without even trying to know her better as a person.</p>
              <p>Doing it in the office is even worse. Its eating and shitting in the same place. Anyway most office people are married.</p>
              <p>Got no answers for you because I have no idea myself. When you post something here, sure get flamed by other forumers. But most important thing is that you take the positives out of the discussion and don't bother about the negative barrages at you. Maybe you learn something better today and refine your approach.</p>
