              Thx for your opinions and views. It's not like I want to fall for her. It's just that I felt really comfy with her. 
              
              I really don't know whether she's playing with me or just insecure. I guess I only can move on and let fate decide. She's really quite a weird lady according to my co workers.

              Hi all thx for your replies.
              
              I talked to her on the phone. She said we are friends. I Told her if being friends from a start will bring us closer, I will give this relationship my all. And if regular contact and spending some time together will rekindle what we had when we 1st know each other. Told her I dont play mind games with her, mind games are for kids and that's way history for me. And i asked her just to give me a 2nd chance and to take things slow.
              
              Her reply was " Sorry i have a BF now &amp; thx"
              
              So yeah that was her reply. I guess its better for me to move on.
              
              I gave her my blessings to her and her bf and told her not to contact me anymore. Even better to totally avoid me even at work cos i can never be friends with her as i will always habour romantic feelings for her. I've deleted her from my HP and blocked her from whatsapp. I guess this is the right thing to do.

              Yeah.. doesn't matter anymore. Blocking her from whatsapp is kinda stupid also cos i know she'll never call or text me again. Its just my way of moving on and breaking all ties to me is necessary. It doesn't really hurt now as I expected the worst when I called her up.
              
              I don't blame her for moving on and getting another guy. If I were her I think I would do the same. Investing all your feelings and hope to a guy so much younger is dangerous. And I think she did the right thing. She's a nice lady, too bad I had to fall for her otherwise I wouldn't had asked for her number and all these things hadn't have to happen.
              
              I learnt from my mistakes.
              
              1) If I had kept my cool on her sms bombing, we might had been together.
              2) If i had left her alone when she mad at me, things would had been different ( If a girl doesn't care about u... she wouldn't be angry. Why waste her emotion.)
              3) I should have considered her feelings before mine.
              
              Anyway it's over! And thx everyone for your views. I greatly appreciate it.

              Not really la... Most girls will still feel insecure with a much younger guy ba. 
                      
              Haiz, but really sad la. She's really an awesome lady except that she's EXTREMELY xiao qi. Maybe its a blessing in disguise that we didn't get together. It was really close though.
                      
              Maybe I look young for my age. Couple of  ladies at my work place call me xiao di di which is kinda annoying. I have to keep telling them i'm turning 30 liao. Come to think about it, I would really give my all if this lady had accepted me but its too late.I guess I can only console myself that at least I was able to get a hot 40yr old lady crazy enough to bomb my HP almost 24hrs everyday for 2 weeks and having her compliment me quite a number of times tat i'm a shy, cute &amp; friendly guy lol.
                      
              She must be damm free at work to chat so much during office hours &gt;.&gt;

              <p><br>You didn't read my earlier post. I could smell that she has a bf miles away (based on your description).</p>
              <p>You didn't make any mistake. You could done it any other way, and still you would have reached the same result. Basically she wasn't that into you. Her bombing your phone was just a mere testing of her market value.</p>
