              I did read your posts. Maybe Iâ€™m over sensitive or over analyzing things but she did a few things that puzzled me.
              
              1) She stopped all contact &amp; ignored me after I sent her a msg to stop texting me and that I donâ€™t want a cyber gf. She took MC the next day. (She usually tells me whether sheâ€™s taking mc / leave that day a not. And that month she already took 4 days MC, she said she canâ€™t afford to take any leave that month becos she donâ€™t want to give the big boss a bad impression).
              
              2) Most girls or all girls I know. when they are over this guy means really OVER. They donâ€™t even waste their emotion of anger or hate on the guy. They totally ignore them as if they r transparent. But instead when my colleague had a casual chat with her, She pointed at my pic in the company photo and keep complaining about me to him.
              
              3) I caught her many many times turning her head to my work area. The hallway only got left and right view of the production floor. And only 2 ppl work at my area and the rest on the other side. Its not that I purposely go see btw, just coincidence cos we are working in a small company.
              
              4) She already told me who confessed to her.. why doesnâ€™t she play with them instead. Most stupid thing is sending pics of herself to me about her hairstyle. Not scared I blackmail her? lol
              
              Iâ€™m just wanna hear your opinions so I can be more careful and be more aware next time. Because this is really my first time i met such a lady.
              
              Your views and opinions are greatly appreciated

              If she's really a player she must be mad to invest all of these. Furthermore she went out to buy things for me to eat. My colleagues at work told me that she will never do that.
              
              The most annoying thing when we were on cloud 9 is that she kept bragging to the other colleagues that how big my muscles are. That really freak me out cos no one except a few whom I told abt her knows we are actually chatting.
              
              Cos ppl in the production rarely communicate with the office staff. She really don't understand what is low profile zzz. She should have been more vary of ppl suspecting us cos of her high post.
              
              
              Think she's rather stupid for being a player.

              <p>Not bad.....you can attract a 40-year old woman...and defeat other competitors....means you have talent.</p>
              <p>But you made a childish and stupid mistake in your texting.</p>
              <p>First, why did you scold her that you "dont want a cyber GF and stop texting me"</p>
              <p>That is so rude.</p>
              <p>Even if she bothers you too much with the SMSes.....you can simply......answer less.....or answer after some delay.....or say you are busy and you will reply later.....</p>
              <p>Those gentle moves are better...rather than scolding her so harshly like that......</p>
              <p>I dont think she is a player or whatever....I think she was angry and hurt by you......</p>
              <p>And then after that, dont keep SMS-ing her back, saying sorry, lets be friends, lets try again..........dont do that, because you are doing to her what shes been doing to you previously, namely, annoying and irritating her.</p>
              <p>Ok nvm.....just learn from this experience.</p>

              Hi veggie , thanks your ur views. Yeah it's entirely my fault. Never blamed her. At least she doesn't give me a black face whenever we bump into each other.
              
              I act normal she act normal, both of us moved on and that's end of story. 
              
              
              And yes of cos I like her otherwise I wouldn't approach her and no.. Not that I have no luck with young girls lol... Just happen to fall for her. I can't help it

              <p>So just enjoy her and enjoy her looks, no need to think too much or think too deeply.</p>

              <p>Just as well. Older partners are a very sensitive lot. They are constantly paranoid of younger competitors.</p>
              <p>There is a big diffrence when a commitment is made. Because then the tollerance level plummets, and the niceties wil be gone, and there will be constant bickering.</p>

              She's actually married with a daughter. Only people in the top management knows about her marriage. She is keeping her marriage a extremely low profile including her facebook.
              
              Her new so call boyfriend is another victim whom she is very close to even before I approached her. I have to give myself some credits able to make her shift all her attention to me among all the other guys in the company.
