The reason being I am feeling very sad at the moment and I am writing this down case my soul needs to express the sadness I feeling for the past few months. My soul is crying for the lady I care about and the saddest thing is that I do not know how express my feelings to her. I think I am losing her.<br><br>I knew this lady through a friend; she is nice lady  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  and as time passed by my feelings for her grew stronger, wanted to get to know her better cause I did not want to fall blindly in love with her. Just wanted to know her better. Went out a few times, but it seems that we were unable to communicate. Both of us are the quiet type.<br><br>Tried to express my liking for her once but I think it misfired and than it was down hill all the way. Tried to called her out few time after that but she always politely rejected me and everytime she does that I felt sad. Is she afraid of me?<br><br>We are slowly drifting apart. Cried cause I think I am falling in love with her but will she ever know how I felt?<br><br>Used to be a happy go lucky type of guy but I have been feeling down for the past year.<br><br>Kept thinking of her for the last 2 years and the last time I went out with her was a few months back.<br><br>Wanted to forget about her but I CANÂ’T.<br><br>Is this what you call lovesickness?

Gers when it comes to r/s are very straightforward..if they dun like you , there is NOTHING you can do to change their mind. That is if they like you , they can even sacrifice anything for you.<br><br>My best advice is to give up and move on. Dont even keep her as a friend cos it will only make u miserable.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone.<br><br>Thanks for reading my post and my appreciation for all you kind words of encouragements. Especially Bontakun, Rock^Star, snowbird82 and even neverendingtrauma Thanks again :O)<br><br>HmmmÂ… from the posts I must acknowledge the fact that I have invested too much feeling in trying know her better and all those emotions seems one sided. Well that is maybe because this is the Â“FirstÂ” time that I have been attracted to a nice lady. (fyi I am not a young teenager blinded by puppy love)<br><br>Tried really hard to forget her a few times as I slowly started to realise that I was weighted down by these emotions. HmmmÂ… even some of my close friends seem to see the sadness in me. You really can see whether the person is happy or sad by looking carefully into their eyes. It seem like they are a window to your soul.<br><br>ItÂ’s just a bit hard to carry on after all those feeling I felt and I guess I have to let go of my foolish emotions and I really hope that the hands of time can slowly wash away all the sadness in me.<br><br>Hope this post will continue and help others that share the same experiences as me.<br></div>
