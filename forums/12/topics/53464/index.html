            <div class='col-md body'>I think we do come across different problems at different times of our life. Like I mentioned in my previous posts, try not to lead a life of regrets, though it's difficult and not many people, including myself. Of coz the only thing we can tell ourselves is we look forward to life, not look back... thus, why leave rooms for regrets? It's like no use crying over spilt milk, which I know, easier said than done. Guess it's only by being optimistic about life that we will do good and be better when we walk ahead... ultimately the world doesn't stop revolving becoz of one...<br><br>Obviously what we can do when we encounter a situation which puts us in a dilemma is that we consider and analyse the situation with pros and cons. When everything else seems to be so bleak and clouded with doubts, stop-think-act.Once a decision is made, never regret or look back. How many times can you live?<br><br>I sincerely wish you happiness...<br><br>Tough times never last, tough people do... be one of the toughest.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks. Jus wanted to share my thoughts. I do believe there are many who face the same problem. I'm taking them in my stride. All these will be memories that will spur me on when I'm down. And no, I don feel sad... its more like a feeling of loss and yet that loss... its compensated by something deep down in myself... something peaceful.</div>
