            <div class='col-md body'>She says I'm fat. She's sending me for a nose job. She wants the perfect material daughter. I used to sing and play the piano and draw. My dad loved those. Now to her, my talents are as good as useless. Im not fat, but she says Im fat. In front of everyone. Family, friends, and they inspect me like Im an exhibit. I fought her concept of a barbie daughter for 20 years. I finally gave up today when she messed up my morning by telling me the harshest things about me, making me feel fat, ugly and stupid. She does this everyday, for the past 20 years. Especially more, after my father passed away. He was really my balance. I'm not weak, I've tried to divert my attention to other things, loving animals, being a better person, at least bringing joy or trying to bring joy to the people and animals around me. But that concept just melted away. I've lost my self-esteem, lost faith. And I will be going for the nose job. I relented after two years of pestering. I'm afraid I'm already withdrawing from my relationship, my friendships and literally everyone. I can't take pictures smiling, in fact I don't smile anymore. Because she observes me and says everytimeI smile my nose widens so much it looks like its going to explode. Is it really that bad.</div>

I make my stupid mistakes like spill nail polish on the sofa (its cleaned liao), but I never deliberately do things to hurt her. In fact, I try not to. Bt its hard. For instance, when I shower, there's a glass door inside the bathroom which closes so that the water from the shower doesn't go all over the floor of the toilet. Sometimes when I shower, it gets abit wet, and she makes noise. Then I can't hang posters in my room, I can't do this can't to that..she even scolded me this morning for buying a bigger tank for my fighting fish. Its not even that huge. I can carry with two fingers. I don't get it.

Remember that it's you who would have to live with that nose for the rest of the life, not her. Tell her that too.<br><br>Secondly, how independent are you? Are you financially independent? If you are capable of it, I would suggest you moving out. If not, just stay on because you have no choice. Shut your ears up to your mother.<br><br>Now, even if you are all that she said you are (which I do not think is the case), she shouldn't be saying all that. You of all people, need to understand that what she has been doing to you, is nothing more than ABUSE. She abuses you mentally, emotionally and verbally. Abuse doesn't just come in the form of physical violence. The fact that she had destroyed your self-esteem so much to the extent that you are going for the nosejob tells a lot.<br><br>Next time she comments about your nose again, tell her that your nose might not be as pretty as hers, but at least your heart is definitely more beautiful.<br><br>Btw, tell her that what she had been doing is nothing more than abuse. If needed, threaten her with it. You do have the right to charge her over it. No parent have the right to do what she did to you. Also, remind that she either have to accept the way that you are, or pretend that you are not her daughter, since she's so ashamed of you or something?<br><br>Stress is NOT an excuse. Shame on your mother.</div>

In front of everyone. Family, friends, and they inspect me like Im an exhibit. I fought her concept of a barbie daughter for 20 years.

But that concept just melted away. I've lost my self-esteem, lost faith. And I will be going for the nose job. I relented after two years of pestering.

Is it really that bad.</div></blockquote>You are just fine the way you are, and I'll tell you why. You had no problem with it except perhaps only your mum. You can smile, make people smile, live with it, be hapy about it... I seriously doesn't find anything much wrong with you. Although it would of course be nice if you wanna keep yourself healthy, slim down or whatever... But I believe for now that it should be because you wanna and wish to do it... Not because someone's forcing you to do it... This can be quite unhealthy... Listens to what your dad has got to say if he's still around... I think you should have no problem trying to figure that part out... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Don't do the nsoe job just because your mum wants you to. Though your mum gave birth to you, BUT it's YOUR nose... Learn to take care of yourself, protect yourself and stand for yourself... Especially when you know you're right on your stand. I used to have a mum who hated me as equally because I never bother to dress myself up when I was very much younger unlike my siblings.. Like your mum, she saw me as a disgrace to her... Would insult me in front of everyone... Even strangers on the streets.. Would make life miserable for me, take away priviledges from me and leave me behind while family went for trips... I couldn't tell you exactly how much she detest me.. But hey. That was only me... And I just stood by that...<br><br>I tell you, you don't just lose yourself like that... Not after all that you've fought for... Not after all that your dad had fought for you, and your friends who stood by your side... Over one person? Whoever he / she is, it's just not worth it....<br><br>No matter how you look or how people might look at you....<br><br>Nothing beats a smile of confidence.. Give yourself what you deserve....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks everyone..for the suggestions..actually..I did cause her alot of pain also because I like funny pets like snake and iguana...I like stuff toys still..kiddy toys kiddy things and it irritates her...Also..I was very rebellious when I was a kid, only because I was fighting what she wanted me to be for so long. Bt I never meant to hurt her...I just wanted her to understand what I believed in.<br><br>My nose I inherit from my dad..of course I love it..its not as bad as Jackie Chan la dun worry...but for a girl..in her eyes and everyone else who bullied me..its huge. So..just go for it..anyway I already push myself to listen to everything she say...she want a barbie daughter..she will get one. I just wanna pour out my heart here because I got nowhere else to turn. I give up telling my friends..better be anonymous here..at least here nobody knows how I look like...but really thanks for giving me such useful advice...<br><br>PS: I have moved out b4..she call me and say she miss me..she finally found me after 2-3 weeks..then i come home only not even three days everything start again...</div>
