              <p>i think this forum is abt asking for help so. </p>
              <p>i lost my mp3. after jogging, i came home and put it on a table which is in front of the stairs.</p>
              <p>i live in a semi-d with 2 lvls. im just 15.</p>
              <p>then later on my auntie whom are very close to me came over to my house to visit my sick grandfaher. close as in we meet each other every week.</p>
              <p>then i went 2 bed, very late. i hv bad sleeping hours. and i usually wake up at 12. </p>
              <p>when i woke up, the renovation work at my house has already started and it requires the workers to walk up and down the stairs. so, im suspecting that they took it. it cant be possible that it's lost. i have been searching everywhr in my house everyday. unless someone hid it on purpose, anyone who walks up the stairs would surely notice it </p>
              <p>i dont know what to do can i go to the police? or should i talk to my father about it? he will only say" what u want me to do?"</p>
              <p>im wondering if going to the police would help. this is seriously affecting me. whenever i try to sleep, i think about this its really tiring my mind out. i just got it this year using my ang pao money. i really treasure it and i just got a new earpiece for it. i saved for like 2 months of my pocket money for it. i ate nothing at school. and now its the school holidays and im at home for most of the time.</p>
              <p>there are too many things for me to think about</p>
              <p>1. did i lose it or someone took it?</p>
              <p>2. is it my relative or the construction worker.</p>
              <p>3. should i let it go or confront them?</p>
              <p>4. how am i going to do that?</p>
              <p>5. will going to the police help me get it back?</p>
              <p>pls help im really in agony im sad everyday. i went jogging on the 14th and the construction workers were there on the 15th of november.</p>
              <p>btw its my b'day on 21st and im not sure if anyone except for my brother remembers it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>please help me!!! ask more questions if it will help</p>

              <p>Firstly i really must praise you.</p>
              <p>Very nice of you to learn the concept of saving money to buy something you want. And i understand how you feel now, losing something that you work so hard to have it.</p>
              <p>But there is nothing much you could do now.</p>
              <p>So, tell your mother about this. Or, wait for school to reopen and save money again to buy it.</p>
              <p>And don't waste police time ok? they have alot of things to do nowadays.</p>

              <p><br>TS, I agreed with Spike.</p>
              <p>You need to be responsible on your property.</p>
              <p>You cannot just chunt it there and assume your mp3 will be there.</p>
              <p>You need to learn to keep your things and not chunt it here and there.</p>
              <p>Treat it as a lesson to you.</p>
              <p>Learn to be responsible and learn to keep your things.</p>

              <p>then later on my auntie whom are very close to me came over to my house to visit my sick grandfaher. close as in we meet each other every week.</p>
              <p>then i went 2 bed, very late. i hv bad sleeping hours. and i usually wake up at 12. </p>
              <p>when i woke up, the renovation work at my house has already started and it requires the workers to walk up and down the stairs. so, im suspecting that they took it. it cant be possible that it's lost. i have been searching everywhr in my house everyday. unless someone hid it on purpose, anyone who walks up the stairs would surely notice it </p>
              <p>i dont know what to do can i go to the police? or should i talk to my father about it? he will only say" what u want me to do?"</p>
              <p>im wondering if going to the police would help. this is seriously affecting me. whenever i try to sleep, i think about this its really tiring my mind out. i just got it this year using my ang pao money. i really treasure it and i just got a new earpiece for it. i saved for like 2 months of my pocket money for it. i ate nothing at school. and now its the school holidays and im at home for most of the time.</p>
              <p>there are too many things for me to think about</p>
              <p>1. did i lose it or someone took it?</p>
              <p>2. is it my relative or the construction worker.</p>
              <p>3. should i let it go or confront them?</p>
              <p>4. how am i going to do that?</p>
              <p>5. will going to the police help me get it back?</p>
              <p>pls help im really in agony im sad everyday. i went jogging on the 14th and the construction workers were there on the 15th of november.</p>
              <p>btw its my b'day on 21st and im not sure if anyone except for my brother remembers it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>please help me!!! ask more questions if it will help</p>

              <p>Psychology says that peope tend to think on the negative side, so why not try to think the other way?</p>
              <p>Since you lost r mp3 player, time to pick up books and pass your exam with flying colour. The money you earn next time is more than a 1000 mp3 player.</p>
              <p>Or let say, no mp3 = no hearing damage. You know, hearing damage is permanent. Yor lost o mp3 player had save ur life.</p>
              <p>i lost MD player costed my $499. But now, ipod is only $329, much more better than my MD player.</p>
