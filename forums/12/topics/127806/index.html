            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Loner,<br><br>There're reasons why she won't accept you, perhaps she feels you're Not the person she's looking for to spend time with, to love &amp; to cherish.  Rather than accept you now only to dump you &amp; hurt you later, she's actually doing you justice as a friend.  Many do Not understand that, but I hope you do.<br><br>At least you're still friends with her, I've had personal experiences whereby the guy turned nasty after I rejected them, or rejected their appeals (read: pressure) to patch things up.<br><br>Enjoy her as a friend.  She has done her duty by you : )  Someone else who's able to appreciate you in a relationship kinda way will come along.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by loner2004:</div><div class="quote_body">Why am i so crazy love a gal which i know she will only accept me as friends and not her boyfriend?

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I would not use a term like "better".  For who is "better" than the other.<br><br>But rejection is a bitter pill to swallow.  Some take it and some can't stomach it.<br><br>Some feel that they can be friends.  Some feel, that after being in a relationship, it would better if they became strangers, for how would the new partner of the one they love feel, if the new partner knows that the ex, who still has intense emotions is still in the picture, even as "a friend".<br><br>A fellow moderator of a forum said it well: how can there be a future when the past is present?<br><br>Maybe, it would be good if he was her friend.  Maybe.  It would also be good if he went away, for what good would come if he sees her all the time, she knows of his feelings for her, and she's finds another.  How would her boyfriend then react when she tells him that he's in love with her but he's only a friend?  He'll be tormented, and her boyfriend would be suspicious.<br><br>It does not take proof to break up a relationship, just suspicion would do.<br><br>There are so many things to think about.  But only one person can make that decision and that would be him.<br><br>I do hope he'll make a good decision.
