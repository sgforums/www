                              Don't think I sounded like I'm rejoicing in this dilemma.
                              Or whether if it is me or or as a 3rd person perspective, would it
                              matter?</p>
              <p>Just trying to get honest opinions here. Glad to say indeed
                              there are the helpful ones among the critics.</p>

              <p>Ofcors it matters who is the true owner of the problem.</p>
              <p>It seems you are just here to validate the evilness of the wife.</p>
              <p>Are you the mistress ? If that husband is telling you all these.. I strongly advise you don't believe him. He is just telling sob stories to get your sympathy so that he can get inside your panties.</p>
              <p>Are you the nosy family member who just want to vilify the wife ? Surely you arn't one of them people who build your happiness on someone else's misfortune R u ?</p>
              <p>Are you a friend who just want to stand on the guy's side and cast the stone on his woman ? I suggest you DON'T continue with this kind of senseless stone casting.</p>
              <p>You sure don't sound like a high flyer yourself, given your ignorance in the whole situation.</p>
              <p>Helpful critics ? Sure.. anyone who agrees with you that the wife is evil IS helpful , no ? So how many helpful "votes" have you garnered so far ?</p>
              <p>And so what if more people here agrees with you that the wife is indeed evil ?  Rally a divorce and break up the marriage ?</p>

              1. Adultery
              2. Separation with consent

              <p>Hi, Im a newbie here and would like to seek some advice/opinion. Im a muslim fulltime housewife and been happily married for 20years with a teenage daughter.</p>
              <p>Recently, I found out my husband had acquainted with his ex. Thru out this 20years of marriage he would never forget to inform me of any personal invitations and I have no objection of him going. Initially when I questioned him, he lied about the matter until I showed him the messages and photos. He said he was being sabotaged. OMG, my life shattered and I cried for few days. What will happen to me if he walks out of my life and I have no savings?</p>
              <p>My husband is a businessman. He made some investment but solely under his name only. All expenses taken care by him and he will give me an allowance of S$200 per month. His income varies from S$5000-S$20000 a month but my allowance given is fixed.</p>
              <p>Is my allowance justified?</p>

              U ask is my allowance justified? Of course, it will never be justified cos u have expectations of what it ought to be and should be lah. Also, u are comparing and hence the misery! 
              
              To simply label his asbad or irresponsible is prematurely conclusive cos only u are privy and know what is actually transpiring. I m not implying that it is ''ok'' for what your spouse choose to be and does. However, it matters what u choose and do from what u are all about. .
              
              As to your question as to whether he would walk out suffices enough cos underlying this stance is fear of u collapsing as a housewife, as a person or .... what u will.
              
              The sensible thing is to understand your folly of desiring and depending on him for your well-being.
              
              It would be wiser to unlearn and understand and be and do what fulfils u. In this way, whether he stays or not - it no longer matters.
              
              PS'= Also, it would have u in good stead as long as you can understand that the past is merely true in your ''head'' - it is akin to holding on to a cancelled cheque which no longer has validity now or in reality.

              <p>just my 2 cents worth, there must be something wrong with the wife here. it'd be good if the husband hires a PI to investigate on her.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>i'm not implying that as a married couple they must report to each other what they do. but with due respect, they should at least open up their plans to their spouse. and as for this case, it is very obvious that the wife is hiding something.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and whatmeworry is just voicing out his opinions. nothing wrong with that, it doesn't matter whether he is in the situation or he is just spectating it as a friend. he would be able to provide good advices to his friend or whoever it is to him then.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>by providing concrete statements and constructive comments is what would be of help here to the poor couple. this kind of marriage is a 100% broken marriage. switch this situation around, if this case is where the guy are buying property in joint name with another woman, how would you be reacting? no offense intended.</p>

              <p>Mr Orgasmic, do you have a daughter or a sister you dearly love ?</p>
              <p>If you do, may I ask, do you jump to her defence whenever some male scum buckets calls her sluts and bitches , or do you stay on the sideline enjoying the show ?</p>
              <p>I am a woman/female, I notice so many guys are quick to point fingers at the other gender whenever there are issues they cannot resolve. In AA, it's usually with regards to relationship and/or marital woes.</p>
              <p>Communication is the key to a <strong>fulfilling</strong> marriage, (not just a long and boring one.)</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, many guys here simply go " You woman, respect the dick."   Then they wonder why they are not getting any lovin from em wifeys. Duh ~</p>
              <p>Now, joke aside..</p>
              <p>If you haven't notice, there are a lack of female posters here who are willing to speak up for the gf/wifes because many males will try their very best to silence one who does.</p>
              <p>If you also havn't notice, I do also side with the guys when the girl/wife is unreasonably wrong.</p>
              <p>However, how many guys you see sides on the rational , instead of the 'brotherhood" ? None so far. As long as they are guys, they are right , yes ? May I ask, why ? Do guys think that as long as they chide a male, they are essentially slapping their own face ? Is it because they believe that is so because "he has a dick, and I have a dick, therefore, if he is wrong , therefore I must be wrong"  kinda thinking ?</p>
              <p>As for this TS of this thread, you know jolly well, he/she is a hate monger. Someone who has no true understanding to the marriage. I have heard many gossips and this one sure sounds like a disgruntled mother-in law type who gossips about her son's marriage. Or a jealous siblings/relative no happy with their success.</p>
              <p>Being a spectator for advise sake you say ? Read through the entire post again my friend, then you come tell me if TS is just trying to stir shit or is he/she truly in all honesty wanting to provide an UNBIASED advise ?</p>
              <p>To answer your question, if my husband purchase a property as investment , I'd be more interested in the legal aspect of the transaction. (instead of bitching about the gender of his business partner). Purchasing a property with another person does not make the asset untouchable to the spouse. The other investor should be more concerned about going into this kind of investment with a married person. So please stop being so ignorant.</p>
              <p>Everyone loves conspiracy theory yes ? Now, let me tell you one blatantly ridiculous detail that is hilarious in this conspiracy TS is trying to promote.</p>
              <p>If the wife really wants to hide her investment, why in the world would she put her HOME address on the document ?????</p>
              <p>Also, I doubt forumers here have ever even tried buying a private property. Buying such a big asset is not like going out with another man to purchase a TV set.</p>
              <p>Buying a property require movements of large amount of money. Now where does that comes from ? If it's a loan based investment, banks are not going to hush hush the whole transaction, mind you.</p>
              <p>Seriously guys.. please use your brain to think instead of your dick , OK ? Good.</p>
              <p>TS is just an ignorant gossiper looking for more gossip fodder, why are you enabling that kind of behavior ? FYI, not everything I post is for women's right, I just like to flush troublemakers like whatmeworry down the toilet.</p>
              <p>Now that you guys are feeling like a bunch of Idiots, I suppose the party is over in this thread.. time to go home .. chop chop !</p>

              <p>Mr Orgasmic, do you have a daughter or a sister you dearly love
                  ?</p>
              <p>If you do, may I ask, do you jump to her defence whenever some
                  male scum buckets calls her sluts and bitches , or do you stay on
                  the sideline enjoying the show ?</p>
              <p>I am a woman/female, I notice so many guys are quick to point
                  fingers at the other gender whenever there are issues they cannot
                  resolve. In AA, it's usually with regards to relationship and/or
                  marital woes.</p>
              <p>Communication is the key to a <strong>fulfilling</strong> marriage, (not just a long and boring one.)</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, many guys here simply go " You woman, respect the
                  dick."   Then they wonder why they are not getting any
                  lovin from em wifeys. Duh ~</p>
              <p>Now, joke aside..</p>
              <p>If you haven't notice, there are a lack of female posters here
                  who are willing to speak up for the gf/wifes because many males
                  will try their very best to silence one who does.</p>
              <p>If you also havn't notice, I do also side with the guys when the
                  girl/wife is unreasonably wrong.</p>
              <p>However, how many guys you see sides on the rational , instead
                  of the 'brotherhood" ? None so far. As long as they are guys, they
                  are right , yes ? May I ask, why ? Do guys think that as long as
                  they chide a male, they are essentially slapping their own face ?
                  Is it because they believe that is so because "he has a dick, and I
                  have a dick, therefore, if he is wrong , therefore I must be
                  wrong"  kinda thinking ?</p>
              <p>As for this TS of this thread, you know jolly well, he/she is a
                  hate monger. Someone who has no true understanding to the marriage.
                  I have heard many gossips and this one sure sounds like a
                  disgruntled mother-in law type who gossips about her son's
                  marriage. Or a jealous siblings/relative no happy with their
                  success.</p>
              <p>Being a spectator for advise sake you say ? Read through the
                  entire post again my friend, then you come tell me if TS is just
                  trying to stir shit or is he/she truly in all honesty wanting to
                  provide an UNBIASED advise ?</p>
              <p>To answer your question, if my husband purchase a property as
                  investment , I'd be more interested in the legal aspect of the
                  transaction. (instead of bitching about the gender of his business
                  partner). Purchasing a property with another person does not make
                  the asset untouchable to the spouse. The other investor should be
                  more concerned about going into this kind of investment with a
                  married person. So please stop being so ignorant.</p>
              <p>Everyone loves conspiracy theory yes ? Now, let me tell you one
                  blatantly ridiculous detail that is hilarious in this conspiracy TS
                  is trying to promote.</p>
              <p>If the wife really wants to hide her investment, why in the
                  world would she put her HOME address on the document ?????</p>
              <p>Also, I doubt forumers here have ever even tried buying a
                  private property. Buying such a big asset is not like going out
                  with another man to purchase a TV set.</p>
              <p>Buying a property require movements of large amount of money.
                  Now where does that comes from ? If it's a loan based investment,
                  banks are not going to hush hush the whole transaction, mind
                  you.</p>
              <p>Seriously guys.. please use your brain to think instead of your
                  dick , OK ? Good.</p>
              <p>TS is just an ignorant gossiper looking for more gossip fodder,
                  why are you enabling that kind of behavior ? FYI, not everything I
                  post is for women's right, I just like to flush troublemakers like
                  whatmeworry down the toilet.</p>
              <p>Now that you guys are feeling like a bunch of Idiots, I suppose
                  the party is over in this thread.. time to go home .. chop chop
                  !</p>

              <p>Hello jojo,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'd say that this is a very interesting reply.</p>
              <p>i didn't quote this one but i'd like to let you know that not everyone knows and understand the content of a legal letter/document.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>she may have found the documents opened up and have been read by the husband, but she knows very well that he doesn't understand it. which it enables her to have the documents sent to her house.</p>
              <p>and i have no intention to offend you by refuting your statements as i'm not doing it on purpose. and i have no "brotherhood" here as i'm more frequent as a reader than a poster.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>basically i don't know anyone here. anyway, there are a few points i'd like to point out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>which they are:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>It is not an obligation to report what you do to your spouse. It"s respect. <br></li>
              <li>if this case is true, the wife is already lying when asked, no? as she says it is a document of contract she's helping her client with. but till the extend to using her name as a joint property owner, is a bit too far, don't you think?</li>
              <li>I suggesting TS to hire a PI to clear confusion and to understand the situation, not gathering evidence. <br></li>
              <li>the wife is applying the "why must i tell you" theory, isn't it respect to just be honest to your spouse? a couple is married based on trust, respect, and truthfullnes. </li>
              <li>i don't agree with "pussy respecting the dick" theory, those are for scums. <br></li>
              </ol>
              <p>yes i do have a dear sister, and i'll defend her with all my life. and same i will do for my girlfriend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i'm a banker, by buying a private asset. of course the bank's not gonna be quiet about the transaction. it requires signatures and also transfers. but if the property is not under her husband's name, the bank will not reveal any information as it is against the compliance law, and the bank could be sued by the wife for revealing informations to 3rd party without consent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so if t he wife does not give authorization, the husband would not know anything. which is why the wife can just move on with the deal, and don't mind sending the documents home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my 2 cents worth. =)</p>
              <p> </p>
