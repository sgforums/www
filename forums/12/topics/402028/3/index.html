              <p>Hello jojo,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'd say that this is a very interesting reply.</p>
              <p>i didn't quote this one but i'd like to let you know that not
                              everyone knows and understand the content of a legal
                              letter/document.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>she may have found the documents opened up and have been read by
                              the husband, but she knows very well that he doesn't understand it.
                              which it enables her to have the documents sent to her house.</p>
              <p>and i have no intention to offend you by refuting your
                              statements as i'm not doing it on purpose. and i have no
                              "brotherhood" here as i'm more frequent as a reader than a
                              poster.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>basically i don't know anyone here. anyway, there are a few
                              points i'd like to point out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>which they are:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>It is not an obligation to report what you do to your spouse.
                              It"s respect.<br></li>
              <li>if this case is true, the wife is already lying when asked, no?
                              as she says it is a document of contract she's helping her client
                              with. but till the extend to using her name as a joint property
                              owner, is a bit too far, don't you think?</li>
              <li>I suggesting TS to hire a PI to clear confusion and to
                              understand the situation, not gathering evidence.<br></li>
              <li>the wife is applying the "why must i tell you" theory, isn't it
                              respect to just be honest to your spouse? a couple is married based
                              on trust, respect, and truthfullnes. </li>
              <li>i don't agree with "pussy respecting the dick" theory, those
                              are for scums.<br></li>
              </ol>
              <p>yes i do have a dear sister, and i'll defend her with all my
                              life. and same i will do for my girlfriend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i'm a banker, by buying a private asset. of course the bank's
                              not gonna be quiet about the transaction. it requires signatures
                              and also transfers. but if the property is not under her husband's
                              name, the bank will not reveal any information as it is against the
                              compliance law, and the bank could be sued by the wife for
                              revealing informations to 3rd party without consent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so if t he wife does not give authorization, the husband would
                              not know anything. which is why the wife can just move on with the
                              deal, and don't mind sending the documents home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my 2 cents worth. =)</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>

              <p>Mr Orgasmic,</p>
              <p>You are a technical darling, but you do realize this is a relationship issue, yes ?</p>
              <p>This is why I asked TS if this "problem" is his or he just kaypohing.</p>
              <p>Because as you know.. when you kaypoh.. you cannot provide much insider details. And the worst part is, the story is distorted and facts skewed to disfavor the person he/she wants to malign.</p>
              <p>Now, I did ask what profession the wife is working as, and TS couldn't reply. All we know is they are both "high flyers".</p>
              <p>As a banker you are well aware of the privacy compliance law ( or whatever you call it in Singapore). Now if the wife's profession also requires her to provide this fiduciary duty to keep her client's info private, should she be telling her husband out of respect?? If she doesn..does this amount to infidelity ?</p>
              <p>Now what about those people who works in industry that requires high level of classified confidentiality ? Are they all infidels to their spouse?</p>
              <p>Also, if a wife wants to commit adultery, would she be investing in any major assets while she is still MARRIED ? Tell me Orgasmic, in the event of a divorce, what happens to this "asset" ? Oh sure, she just wants to screw herself over.. how nice.</p>
              <p>A marriage don't just falls apart overnight, nor does it happens because of one party's fault. - Unless one party is abusive, alcoholic, chronic gambler. etc.</p>
              <p>A marriage is not about technicality. It's about human interactions.</p>
              <p>IF you havn't notice, TS is merely pointing finger.. he/she is not here to find solutions. Why he/she does it ? Only he/she knows.</p>
              <p>Perhaps.. he/she is just trying desperately to justify his/her own act of betrayal. Who knows ?</p>
              <p>My guess is, TS is the naive mistress, and she's been fed all these bad wifey story by the man(husband) she's sleeping with.</p>
              <p>Till date, she's still waiting for that man to divorce his wife, but it ain't happening... LOL !!!</p>
              <p>Don't we all just LOVE conspiracy theory !!</p>

              <p>and let's just advice from what we know. nobody knows the other
                      side of the story. but, let's just based on the current matter and
                      what we know since what we're saying might not even be taken into
                      the heads of the people concerned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'll conclude this healthy discussion with standing firm on my
                      opinions and at the same time respecting and i do not deny the
                      posibilities of your argument.</p>
              <p> </p>
