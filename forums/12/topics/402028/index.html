              <p>PI for snooping on the spouse is affordable. For a week surveilance, it is ususlly in the hundreds + expenses. Provided no overseas trip.</p>
              <p>She buy property with another man, so what. Check first what the property is for. Later it turned out that she and her business partner jointly bought a property for their business, you will look like a clown.</p>

              <p>I have said many times in this forum, there is only one grounds for divorce:</p>
              <p><strong>The marriage has irretrievablely broken down. </strong></p>
              <p>What cause the break down can be ANYTHING. Infidelity, non communication, gambling, abusive language, laziness, religion, anything, just tell the judge you really cannot continue the marriage anymore.  </p>

              <p>She said it is a legal document for something that she is helping her client with.</p>
              <p>Could it mean that she is just helping to lend her name?</p>
              <p>So she just lends her name and let the client register with it.</p>
              <p>Although I would say this is very unusual if someone helps a client until that extent.</p>
              <p>Hmm....your wife stays late, but does she like to not come home as well?</p>
              <p>I do agree something may be wrong from these signs.....</p>
              <p>First , I believe you need to have a good chat with your wife about how you are worried for her safety and health and welfare if she stays late often.</p>
              <p>And then also say it makes you worried and unhappy as a husband, and that you want to spend more time with her.</p>
              <p>Try that one first.</p>
              <p>Try that during some weekend or something. When you both have time.</p>
              <p>She reacted strongly by saying "none of your business" because when you phone her and so on, this created an impression in her mind that you are trying to "control" her or "pressure" her, and so she reacted back and pushed angrily.</p>
              <p>So the way to do it is to do it during weekend or some other timing when both of you have the right time and location, and approach it from the angle I mentioned above. This would sidestep the question about "control" so she wont be angry and pushing you back. You must approach from other concepts.</p>
              <p>Ok good luck.</p>

              <p>Your wife change jobs, works late into the nights nowadays,

              <p>Then one day, your letterbox recieved lawyer letters
                  addressed to her and another man. Found out that its documents to
                  buy a property under both their names without your
                  knowledge.</p>
              <p>But you pretend you don't know the contents and ask her what is
                  it. She says oh it's some legal docs drawn up for contract
                  for some work she is helping the client with.</p>
              <p>Is this ground to divorce her for infidelity although no proof
                  of cheating? Maybe she just investing but didn't want the spouse to
                  know her investments?</p>

              <p>Thanks everyone for the input and hope more opinions comes in.</p>
              <p>Both the husband and wife are quite high flyers in their respective industry. No the husband doesn't sneak around investigating the wife. In fact, for the sake of the family and the wife's career, for a long while already, he decided not to bother the wife with her late night appointments and her manners of not answering her phone. and lived with it, although grudgingly.</p>
              <p>To strike that balance between himself and the wife, despite his busy schedule at work, he always make a point and manage to make sure he comes home as early as possible to spend time with the kid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The husband don't mean to intrude on that lawyer letter addressed to the wife and the other man, but if a family member of yours especially your spouse keeps getting important lawyer letters and for the first and second time are not given a convincing answer with regards to it, as a family matter, he needs to know if it is legally something adverse that may affect the whole family, and if the spouse is not willing to share it early to discuss, it may be too late if the legal matter turns for the worse.</p>
              <p>But in this case, although not so much of a relief, it turns out to be a secret joint transaction for a property with another man. Thus adding yet another big question mark to the husband's head.</p>
