            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps this society in which we live ie. 1 boy for 1 girl for ever and ever and ever blah blah blah... is simply wrong? Is it really possible to be committed to one person forever? If you and your partner have experienced everything together, won't it get boring? Which is why probably there is a need to see other people? This is why we have adultery and infidelity, perhaps that should be the way? Openness in an extreme way, anarchy heh. I dunno.<br><br></div>
