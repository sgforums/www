            <div class='col-md body'>Dont give restriction to yourself on the age group of friends. When you are out in working society there will be lots mrore age differences. I would be rather upset if a younger friend think I am too old to socialise with him/her.<br><br>Learn to get to know more about a friend before you judge them on their outer. Alot of my ex colleage who are my buddies already are 10 years older than me. then alot of school friends are younger than me. Mixing with difference age group let me learn different things also. Regardless of what age, I am sure there will be something to chat about, its just whether you want to talk or not.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's true that the journey is important, but it would be a tragic waste to throw everything away just because of social issues.<br><br>I think you should give it more time and be more open and widen your social circle.  Explore more groups / societies and get to know more people.  You seem like a funny and personable guy. I'm sure you'll be able to find like-minded friends in time.<blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by supafatty:</div><div class="quote_body">What's the use of good results, and eventually a good career, if the path getting there has been so unrewarding?</div></blockquote></div>
