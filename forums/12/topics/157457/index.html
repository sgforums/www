I do have both hand bags and little sling bags. However none of those bags are exclusively meant for women in the first place. All are either unisex or for men. And "hand bags" is a general name. It could mean garment bags, messenger bags, totes, suitcases, shoulder bags and etc. I carry Vuitton Pochette Bosphore, Sac Bosphore and the Gucci messenger bag FNR 1000; all of which are very popular among metros. And I can tell you with much assurance that no one calls those "hand bags" unless you are talking about Women Totes or Clutch bags like the LV Lexington.<br><br>Furthermore,  I do not spend on nice SUITES. I prefer tops from MiuMiu, Helmut Lang, Junya Watanabe and Paul Smith. I lean towards the trendy-but-high-end fashion instead of the overly mainstream labels like Hugo Boss or Burberry.<br><br>I do not have only nice suits and nice shoes. I have a 5500-dollar LV Trench Coat, 13800-dollar Franck Muller watch and a quarter million dollar car. To even begin with, I spend close to 680 USD on spas and micellaneous grooming products and services.<br><br>Don't speak as if you know me. You know nothing about me. N-O-T-H-I-N-G...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Metrosexual.. it was a term coined by a queer (as in homosexual) theorist called Mark Simpson in 1994. Made even more popular by that tv progam Queer Eye for the Straight Guy. Do u knw wat it means? It means a guy who takes care of himself, pampers himself, knowledgeable about fine foods n I dont think a soft toy collection/pillows is part of it.<br><br>Perhaps its the need for humanity to categorise each other n give them labels so we can feel comfortable with the 'difference'.<br><br>Men who like to look their best but are straight go against the old cultural norms, so we got scared and compared them to the homosexual but then on the insistance that these 'new men' where in fact straight we tried to compare them to the 'classic' straight man but this did not work either as the straight man said 'NO' we dont do grooming, then we were left with the image but nothing to call 'it' so we invented one.<br><br>A metrosexual is seen as the 'straight gay man'so what the hell is a 'gay straight man' look like?<br><br>sth to think about..</div>

I do have both hand bags and little sling bags. However none of those bags are exclusively meant for women in the first place. All are either unisex or for men. And "hand bags" is a general name. It could mean garment bags, messenger bags, totes, suitcases, shoulder bags and etc. I carry Vuitton Pochette Bosphore, Sac Bosphore and the Gucci messenger bag FNR 1000; all of which are very popular among metros. And I can tell you with much assurance that no one calls those "hand bags" unless you are talking about Women Totes or Clutch bags like the LV Lexington.<br><br>Furthermore,  I do not spend on nice SUITES. I prefer tops from MiuMiu, Helmut Lang, Junya Watanabe and Paul Smith. I lean towards the trendy-but-high-end fashion instead of the overly mainstream labels like Hugo Boss or Burberry.<br><br>I do not have only nice suits and nice shoes. I have a 5500-dollar LV Trench Coat, 13800-dollar Franck Muller watch and a quarter million dollar car. To even begin with, I spend close to 680 USD on spas and micellaneous grooming products and services.<br><br>Don't speak as if you know me. You know nothing about me.

            <div class='col-md body'>metrosexual men tend to behave in effeminate ways, even though they like girls. but to the average girl, they might not be able to see them as GUYS. even other guys might not see them as REAL guys. perhaps that is why?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Metrosexual or homosexual or heterosexual or whatever is in between and out of the square is all by choice.<br><br>If that is the decision you made so be it. Just ignore what other people say. Unless you yourself have judged others who are different than you and belittle them than expect the same from others.<br><br>Metro is no different from a person who might like certain things or have certain habits that are different from the norm. As Badzmaro said, Otakus are one of them. I am sure some of you have judged others who are different from you. So why BIATCH when others judges you. Unless you have never commit such a sin than feel free to shoot back at those who accuse you.<br><br>It doesn't matter if you are a metro, a freak, an otaku, or others, as long as you show respect for others choices and they respect yours. Than the world will be awhole lot better place to live in. I won't judge your need to achieve physical beauty and perfection or whatever you wished as long as you don't judge what I want and wishes in my life. Simple as that. But if you do judge than be prepared to be judged yourself.<br><br>Great One<br><br>Wisdom is the reward of pain.......</div>
