            <div class='col-md body'>Hey applesweet... though you claim you're not as sweet as we think, i beg to differ~ ^_^<br><br>From your post, i can see that you're still very optimistic and rather happy about your life, and that's a very good thing! Even though i'm not plagued with half your problems, i can't seem to find even 20% of your enthusiasm. I admire you for that.<br><br>Lets look again at the list of your problems.<br><br>1) Alimony. $1,000 a month is truly a lot. Stop dragging this any more. Give the Legal Aid Bureau a call and see how they can help.<br><br>2) Stress because you cannot enjoy what you earn. This is directly linked to 1).<br><br>3) Tuition. Its easier to teach primary school kids english or chinese, and also easier to find students for that, than for Japanese, i believe.<br><br>4) You sound like you spend moderately, that's not too bad. I do know that sometimes we just have to spend on something, and the urge is higher for a girl, so i don't blame you.<br><br>5) Like what the others said, unless you're really a strikingly beautiful girl, you had better not step into the modelling world, its too crowded anyways.<br><br>6) You have a good and supporting boyfriend... how nice... quite a lot of girls would give a lot to be in your position as it is..<br><br>7) Notes. Try getting to know some seniors. Most of them have already photocopied, or have the notes/books ready. Besides, its just rotting in their posession, many would glady give them away, or sell them for a small fee.<br><br></div>

You have no values &amp; are nothing but disgrace to yur parents.<br><br>Wats wrong with deliver newspapers in the morning? or wat good suggestion u can give for someone who is broke &amp; still schooling to do at 5-7am. I know of girls in my neighbourhood who do that for extra pocket money, when I was younger my friend also did that. When you hungry ah dun think so much la.<br><br>House cleaning $40 per 4hr yah $10 per hour. You think money so easy to make these days huh?<br><br>All my suggestions that I gave are time flexible and around her neighbourhood except mebbe for hse cleaning on weekend and all are honest job not asking her to go sell her body.<br><br>My grandma an uneducated single parent brought up 11 children as a washer women, a tailor and 4D bookie in the old days. She was a very wise and business shrewed woman. Being unskilled and uneducated She knew odds were stacked against her but she opened her eyes to whatever opportunities came her way to put food on the table, she organised a teams  of hse wife neighbours to tailor buttons on to uniforms for our early singapore army. As a washer women she didn't make very much so not only did she deliver and collect clothes but 4D bets as well.<br><br>As a result of her enterprenual spirit in the 50-60's she could fully pay for a flat in Peoples Park Complex which was 1 of the few early highrise apartments at that time... how many of you can fully pay for your own flat these days. Not only that she could lend money to all the aunty ah soh neighbours who came to her for help and soft loans, everybody owed her $$$ and favors.<br><br>not bad for someone who is uneducated but you educated gers I dunno.</div>

We talking abt a ger who want to survive &amp; help her mom not want to earn money to party on weekends. You think everything you owned grows on trees, you think your parents owe you a living. You have no values &amp; are nothing but disgrace to yur parents.<br><br>Wats wrong with deliver newspapers in the morning? or wat good suggestion u can give for someone who is broke &amp; still schooling to do at 5-7am. I know of girls in my neighbourhood who do that for extra pocket money, when I was younger my friend also did that. When you hungry ah dun think so much la.<br><br>House cleaning $40 per 4hr yah $10 per hour. You think money so easy to make these days huh?<br><br>All my suggestions that I gave are time flexible and around her neighbourhood except mebbe for hse cleaning on weekend and all are honest job not asking her to go sell her body.<br><br>My grandma an uneducated single parent brought up 11 children as a washer women, a tailor and 4D bookie in the old days. She was a very wise and business shrewed woman. Being unskilled and uneducated She knew odds were stacked against her but she opened her eyes to whatever opportunities came her way to put food on the table, she organised a teams  of hse wife neighbours to tailor buttons on to uniforms for our early singapore army. As a washer women she didn't make very much so not only did she deliver and collect clothes but 4D bets as well.<br><br>As a result of her enterprenual spirit in the 50-60's she could fully pay for a flat in Peoples Park Complex which was 1 of the few early highrise apartments at that time... how many of you can fully pay for your own flat these days. Not only that she could lend money to all the aunty ah soh neighbours who came to her for help and soft loans, everybody owed her $$$ and favors.<br><br>not bad for someone who is uneducated but you educated gers I dunno.</div></blockquote>Oops.. i didn't say there's anything wrong abt delivering newspaper in the morning. But waking up so early in the morning means she has to sacrifice her sleep &amp; i dun tink she'll b able to last thru a whole day of lectures after dat. Besides, who can b responsible for her safety when she's running ard the estate in the dark? Afterall she's still a young gal &amp; i'm sure her mother wouldn't agree to let her daughter be @ risk.<br><br>Of coz $ not easy to earn. &amp; dats precisely Y i suggested to her abt giving tuition. Its not abt being lazy or idle, its abt earning $ the SMARTER way. Y would any1 wan to tire themselves out using sweat &amp; energy for exchange of $ when there's a better alternative? She's educated, y not put wat she had learnt to gd use?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> teaching the young 1s.<br><br>House cleaning? Y not u try cleaning up ur whole hse &amp; some1 else's within a day over 8 hrs? U'r making it sound so easy. When 1 has to work within their limits, 1 has to b calculative. Its clearer after u analyse &amp; weigh out the differences between the $$ &amp; chores. I believe its helping her see which 1 is more suitable a part-time job dat she can handle, without having to affect her health or concerntration in class, risking her safety &amp; abrupting her lifestyle.<br><br>Hey Mister, I've nothing against ur suggestions ya? Every1 here including mi was juz trying to help. I was merely expressing my concerns becoz apple is not a Boi.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>KumSioJui, what Camellias4me said is right.<br><br>But you're not wrong either. There are always many ways of looking at things, and you two just expressed the 2 direct opposites.<br><br>You: Take all jobs that come your way, so long got job just grab and do.<br>Camellias: Take the high paying jobs, so can work less and have more time.<br><br>Frankly speaking, i would do the latter(as i've already pointed out in my post). Its like working at macdonalds for long hours, vs working at banquet. 2 hours of macdonalds = 1 hr of banquet. There's nothing wrong at working at macdonalds of course, but since i'll be putting my time and energy working anyway, why not choose banquet, since the pay is higher and i can achieve more?<br><br>ThatÂ’s what everyone is doing nowadays actually, looking for a better job. But while the people who are older and have their own families cannot afford to do this, Apple, who's only 17, can.<br><br>Lets just not forget that she has a life out there as well, a teenage life. She may be poor, but that doesn't mean she has to forfeit her teenage years working.<br></div>
