            <div class='col-md body'>Lets tackle each problem one at a time okay?<br><br><strong>1) Your father not paying you alimony</strong><br>This is actually quite common in Singapore. What i suggest is that you go to contact <a href="http://app.minlaw.gov.sg/lab/contact.asp" rel="nofollow"> The Legal Aid Bureau</a> and give them a call. It should definately Not cost as much as 1.2k(however did it get so high?), they're a government aided agency i believe.<br><br><strong>2) You surviving on $50. Not having enough money</strong><br>The impulse of buying coloured pens, etc, should have grown out of you by now. I realise a good way for me to not buy things is to be practical, especially in your situation, just look at the thing you want to buy, ask yourself this, do you need it? Look at it and imagine not having it 7 days later, would it make a difference in your life? Or would it be better to save that $3 for another day?<br><br><strong>3) Part time Job. </strong><br>You mentioned having a part time job that's paying very little. Please do not tell me you're working at a fast food restaurant @ the rate of $3.40 an hour or something. If you feel up to it, take up some tuition jobs. They pay much better than them. In fact, i have quite a few friends who survive by teaching 2-3 kids a month, and not having take any money from their parents at all.<br><br>If you're interested, drop me a pm and where you're living at, i'll try my best to help.<br><br>Its okay to cry and feel weak sometimes, but it would be better, if you tell yourself you're going to do something about it, than to just feel sad.<br><br>Come on Girl, you can do it.</div>

T^T last time first three months in sajc, their notes so thick at most also only 90cents. why such a big difference??? haiz!<br></div></blockquote>Hi Applesweetgirl,<br><br>What I want to tell you Aaron has already mentioned. First, if do not have money, dun spend on things that you dun really need in life! Colour pens, magazines etc.....these you can get it when you have the loose money to spend on but now, you have to budget on yourself and concentrate on your studies. Your mum is earning money to support you and herself and dun disappoint her in your studies.<br><br>As for your mum and your dad's problem, let them settle among themselves. They are adults and sometimes you dun understand what problems they have that led to them filing for divorce. Being a divorcee, it's not easy as she's now like a single mum. She has to work and also worry about you and things like that. PPl can ask you to file a suit against your dad but can you apply? Certain things kids can't do about it. It's up to your mum on how she wants to sovle these problems. You can tell her your opinions and what to do and things like that. Adults are very sensitive. They dun like ppl to tell them what to do!<br><br>If you can, try to get a part time job or give tution near your neighbourhood. Where you work is not important. Dun feel ashame if you have to work at Macdonalds'. It's not a disgracing job! Dun let ppl decide for you or tell you what to do. You have to learn what to do and how to deal with situations. You are still young. It's good to go out and get some working experience.<br><br>Try to talk to your mum on your problems and try to open up with her. She's all you got and dun disappoint her. Dun let the divorce issue affect your relationship with your father. No matter what, he's still your father. Without him, you won't come into this world!<br><br>Try to think it in a positive way and when you graduate, repay her for what she has done for you! Now, concentrate on your studies and dun fail her. She will be happy as she will find all the sufferings that she had is worth it!</div>
