              don't be like me, wait until she leave u then u start to regret, by then,
              it will be TOO LATE....
              
              just my 2 cents worth.

              <p><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> There is often a someone 'we couldn't have' and this entity gradually transform into a question mark in our emotional mind. We could toy with possible imaginations, but I am not sure where it would land you.  </p>
              <p>What's pretty certain is that if she hasn't put you onto the consideration list, then it is unlikely that your position would drastically change unless her perception of you alters. Largely because of that fact that the essence of our looks, personality and behaviour towards people is usually quite consistent - which are precisely the reasons why we are on or off the chart.  </p>
              <p>Surely it must be a challenge facing the lady you fancy in the same clique of friends; however, this is just one aspect of your challenge. The real challenge lies in facing a very real possibility of waking up to a reality that this is someone that you might never actually have. The fantasy stage of affection can be rather addictive because everything appears surreal and perfect - you might actually imagine her contacting you because she wants to 'give you a chance', but it is more likely to be one-sided on your end.</p>
              <p>And in this fantasy world - we tends to minimize hard facts which are suggestive of points that are contrary to your form of idealism. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"></p>

              <p><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Putting two women on the equation from your post only seem to suggest to me that you perceived that A is a possible choice. What I mean is that it is possible to like someone/something, while having the awareness that possession is a different concept. For example, I could love Ferrari, but purchasing one is way out of my financial ability. Harboring the thought about h<span style="line-height: 1.231;">aving someone impossible is fantasy; the frustration and pain we experience is likely due to the fact that we desperately want something we cannot get, <strong><em>while </em></strong>maintaining the idea that it is within reach. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Love often gets buried itself under layers of other feelings; more often than not, insecurity being the thickest lot. Using similar analogy, if my friend bought a Ferrari and I get upset over it - perhaps the wisdom lies not in avoiding my friend, but what can I do with myself so that I can also afford one in the future. Perhaps not the same model, but one that I can truly learn to appreciate and love in reality - not just a piece of fantasy dream. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"></p>
