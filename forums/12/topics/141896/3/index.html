No such thing as Ten Years Series for the matters of the heart? You could probably score a distinction by memorising all the nonsense in the book and spill them out in your exam papers - to memorise 'model' answers in love... more often than not, you could not spill them out in exact or the 'answer' wouldn't be your desired result even if you applied the 'model' answer. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I will go through a step-by-step analysis for your heart to see. Forget what you.always.think for a moment and listen.<br><br>You case is very simple - you are reading into her actions.<br><br>Don't understand?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Part 1</strong></span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> WHY must a joke/missing-you/whatsoever-lovely-thingy sms <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>BE a SIGN of interest? </strong></span><br><br>Why can't it be:<br><br>I) Merely forwarding nice message.<br><br>II) A gesture of friendship.<br><br>If you prefer to think and feel that it represent a gesture of liking, WHICH must mean that she would OUGHT to accept your date - then why are you trying so hard to even secure a date? It makes sense to avoid/reject/ignore because she doesn't like you, in a way one would like in BGR sense.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Part 2 </strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WHY must you always equate your situations with events that happened to your friend?</strong></span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If you do not see:<br><br>I) Everyone is unique, with different personality, THUS leading to different behaviour, different reaction. (Receptive reason)<br><br>II) How you apply your stance/method... the feel... is different although it may seemed the same? A good analogy would be when you push a ball, every different push has a different force. It's almost impossible to push a ball manually with the same force each time. (Inititate reason)<br><br>If you prefer to see your situation the way I talk about how Ten Years Series Model answer/expected result never works for love, it clashes with emotional and intellectual logic, thus creating the confusion and doubt and you not understanding why.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Part 3</strong></span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If you think that you would get some kind of reaction/result from her by ignoring then act upon her reaction - then you are in for a game of seduction. You THINK by doing that to her, namely the act of ignore, actually meant ANYTHING to her? If you were to think very carefully, this is actually applying to you, not vice vista. (She ignoring you and occasionally drop an SMS).<br><br>And you actually fell for it because this MEANT something to you. You are affected emotionally and mentally... causing you some form of agony. But do you think it is the same for her? I seriously doubt so.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Advice</strong></span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Going through all three parts, CAN'T you see that you probably only have one option if you want to end this, for good or for ill? You can continue, listen to your heart and support yourself WITH your friend's case (managed to get the girl he wanted after years of waiting/chasing/or whatsoever) - then go what your heart tells you.<br><br>You think merely one case represented by your friend, through relentless waiting and chase, represent a good statistic? To be truthful, most guys actually FAIL through waiting and hard-sell-relentless chase. If you want to succeed through this attempt, it depends on your scenario. For your case, I don't think so. Scroll through all past AA's post and you would discover that there is actually quite a high rate failure-repeated-similar case topic/post of endless waiting, etc.<br><br>AND, WHAT makes you think that EVEN if YOUR friend managed to get her - it promises fulfillment? Very often, it represented alternative choice, rebound, etc.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span><br><br>The conclusion for my step-to-step analysis is: to seriously consider moving on with your life, without actually believing you can get her in the future.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Although there are relation to this, but it is not absolute. But at the level of your wisdom, you are contributing to this statistic. If you must be rejected like a prick, THEN GET REJECTED and learn from it. From where you are, you are NOT only unimpressionable, but also zero gains in enlightenment. Ultimate lost.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Its good not to let urself down but not good to be stubborn. If ppl rejects u lets say a few times and u continue to stalk ppl, it will be irritation instead of the process of chasing.<br><br>Learn when to give up and move on. Learn to overcome things in life. For if u do not, u will NEVER grow matured. If u are no more introvert and can interact well with the gals, I think there is no need for us to teach u what to do isnt it?</div>
