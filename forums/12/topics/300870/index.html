This relationship is probably akin to a drunken stupor, running on marginal consciousness despite experiencing little growth.<br><br>Your relationship is merely being pulled along by sheer force - the moment anyone of you stop pulling it, your Love will perish with immediate effect.<br><br>Already, as it seemed to me, there are signs of a mutual desire in wanting out, but is hindered apparently for some unspoken reason/s. You have found someone comfortable and she has found what she wants in life - then, shouldn't the both of you pursue what you two reckoned that could provide the happiness each of you seek?<br><br>Without growth in relationship, often, there's little to look forward in Love.<br><br>Time change &amp; people change; therefore needs change. True Love might be a constant, but our needs change as our inner self develops. Love may stay, but needs change because our Self condition will not remain forever in the same state as it did five years ago.<br><br>Surely there are reasons why you two ended up together five years back, but when we spiritually and emotionally start to evolve subconsciously - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>what that began the same, might one day diverge and grow differently.</strong></span><br><br>Because Love is truly not about looking at each other, but in one collective direction. The minute the relationship loses this vision, it loses its soul to function.<br><br>Perhaps you might want to discuss with her if there is a possibility of this shared vision and how you want your relationship to move in the future. If there isn't a common goal, then perhaps, it might be beneficial for the both of you to come to a mutual agreement to null this relationship and end this amicably.<br><br>Why delay the inevitable? Reminded me of a Chinese Proverb - liu zi wu yong, qi zi ke xi (Mundane to keep, but pity to throw).<br><br>You don't have many 'five years more' to consider - especially your girlfriend.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Why force yourself on someone when you know deep down got no future and more over they already talk it over. If marriages can end at the snap of a finger what makes you think just a normal relationship like theirs would hold out when they themselves already know it? It's better for them to end now then end it after marrying and discover they really cannot stand each other then start quarrellinglah, fightlay, get hurt emotionally and physically then go courtlah.
