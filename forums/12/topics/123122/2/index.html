And me being such a good <span style="font-style: italic;">jie mei </span>(bleah), we end up being pretty good friends. As we spoke and I got to know them better, there could be thousand and one reasons why their free-will chose this path. However one trait never run away.<br><br>Astrologically speaking, whenever I scan a birth-chart check, the lesbian tendency is often demonstrated by a kind of love-deficiency shown by affliction in relationship/love-related areas of their life. In my studies, almost certain, such relationship have deep karmic roots hidden and to pursue them usually spell the same-effect as most other heavily afflicted relationship - unfulfilling, short-lived or worst, terrible emotional scars.<br><br>Although, a gay relationship is normal (A super long theory involving mascline and feminine energies), however, it's karmic by nature. <strong>Past cruelty in love brought about this present reflection</strong>: everything that happens on earth is part of nature and is in fact, normal. (Of course, not everyone would agree with me, especially if you are religious by personality. New-age idealogy are so often deemed as unorthodox)<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You are confused because the idea of loving a man is a complete new realm to you. This confusion is a battle of the soul and the body - you are a biologically-born female and your physical gender automatically attracts a biologically-born male. Your soul could be somewhat opposite of this flow, thus the lesbian tendency. However, the man you fell for is a mixture of what heng said 'feminine yet gentlemanly...' and because he exude energies of both yin and yang, this magnetic attraction fits your special lock.<br><br>You may have been with your steady for years, but ultimately if that what you are looking for? A companion-ship? There may be 'deeper' feelings involved, but eventually you can only revolve around this keyword. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Economics speaks about price-ceiling - there is a ceiling to how far you could grow in this relationship. </strong></span><br><br>He is attached currently and now the mixed feelings. So how? What to do?<br><br>Have you ever wondered... if you realise that his appearence could be a message/hint for you to attempt a BGR (namely boy-girl relationship)? You may or may not end up with him in a BGR, but if a man like him, could make a lesbian like you, fall in love - your previous lifestyle, mindset and attachment could probably evolve from this day onwards.<br><br>Allow me to enlighten you: you will likely to be hurt from trying out a BGR. But do not feel the pinch, retreat and give up trying for one. Alot of lesbians tried out a BGR, felt the cut, lost the relationship and ended back where they stopped and carried on previously.<br><br>It's silly.<br><br>When you are ready to love, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Love will give you that chance</span>.<br><br>You probably need sometime to research upon yourself. To see if you really fell in love with him or if your heart has a void and he merely fits in nicely.<br><br>P.S: Are you a Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

It's idea that you not let your gf knows about anything before it even get anywhere near maturation... But if you don't tell her and let her find out, also equally bad (you should know her well enough by now...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  )...
