            <div class='col-md body'>wow honey, u're in luck. and then out of it again. straight guys tend to like girls, whatever their orientation may be. so u don't have to worry about yr sexuality as far as he is concerned. Also this might mean u're bi, not les. OF course, if he's attached, then your chances of getting him is smaller. Could this be a phase because he is a "forbidden fruit"? In any case, go with the flow for now, and maybe be friends. Perhaps u just like him as a very good friend and not more.</div>

I say, don't screw things up for yourself, and ruin a happy thing. Push the guy out of your thoughts for now, at least until he is single and available.

I did think that he's probably the way u've described him already, when I saw your 1st post.</div>
