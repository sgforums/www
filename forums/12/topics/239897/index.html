Sort things out together and both must be committed to make the relationship work.

If she goes on like that with you, you  will continue to have headaches and you will feel insecure because you don't know when she will leave u for other men.  Unless you are willing to wait for her to be more mature and by that time if she chooses you then good if she does not then your time and effort are in vain.  just my two cents worth,nothing more nothing less.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>get away from her ! she just wants you because she's used to you , not because she loves you . i guess she likes the feeling of having you around her and just being with her when she wants , getting her what she wants and such . she doesnt really love you , get what i mean ? just being away for 1 month and she leaves for another guy , that's already hard proof you shouldnt get back with her . imagine if you went ns , i think the same thing would just happen again if you got together again . wouldnt the hurt be escalated then ? so might as well put a stop to all this now and make a clean break . cheers .</div>
