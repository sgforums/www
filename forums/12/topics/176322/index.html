            <div class='col-md body'>warning:long story but please help<br><br>hi guys , i've found out some problems about my brother(he's older than me) lately..<br>i happened to step onto this website few months ago and i found out my brother post on this forum too.(hopefully he didn't saw my topic(he usually post on CHIT-CHAT only) , and if he did see my topic , please act as if you didn't, cause it makes me feel akward and i don't wan it to affect our relationship)   I decided to check out what he had posted before by searching his name..i know this is rude as it invades his privacy but i just want to understand him more.<br><br>Most of his topics are okay , but i found out that he shoplift from shops occasionally.In the topic , he asked about how the others felt about people who shoplifts from shops , though most of them gave him negative responses , i have a feeling that he's gonna continue to do it.<br><br>He did told me that he stole a teddy bear from a shop he worked in before but he later changed it by saying the boss gave it to him when i gave a WTF response.<br><br>I want him to realise that shoplifting ain't gonna be so lucky all the time , he's already 18 and if he is caught , the penalty he is going to receive isn't worth all the excitement he gets from stealing.I don't want the whole family suffer with him if he did got caught. You guys should know how bad it is...Please help me..<br><br>By the way , he also mentioned how his computer got spoilt in a topic and asked for help. I know that the reason why the cpu was spoilt is because he downloaded too much porno and all those virus also went into the cpu when he was downloading those porn , the cpu had 40gig but he already occupied around 15gigs with only those vid.Worse of all , he doesn't clean the cpu by running those anti-virus and anti-spyware program , i was always the one who does all the job but i gave up this time. He did asked me why i didn't care when the cpu was spoilt and i told him that the cpu is gonna spoil anyway after it's repaired. I hope he realised it and dun download those porn into the computer which is meant for the both of us to use.(im currently using his labtop now)<br><br>Guys , please tell me what to do...</div>
