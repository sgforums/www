You guys should know how bad it is...Please help me..<br><br>By the way , he also mentioned how his computer got spoilt in a topic and asked for help. I know that the reason why the cpu was spoilt is because he downloaded too much porno and all those virus also went into the cpu when he was downloading those porn , the cpu had 40gig but he already occupied around 15gigs with only those vid.Worse of all , he doesn't clean the cpu by running those anti-virus and anti-spyware program , i was always the one who does all the job but i gave up this time. He did asked me why i didn't care when the cpu was spoilt and i told him that the cpu is gonna spoil anyway after it's repaired. I hope he realised it and dun download those porn into the computer which is meant for the both of us to use.(im currently using his labtop now)<br><br>Guys , please tell me what to do...</div></blockquote>what can you do?<br><br>a) Show him what it is like if he was caught stealing and how long he will be jailed.<br><br>b) Bring him to courts hearing and show him how the law handles case like his.<br><br>You can only show him the rules and the results if he is caught breaking the rules but you cannot chose his path.<br><br>If he wishes to go on this road no once can stop him. You have warned him enough since he is 18 let him decide his life. As his brother you can only show him the good path, if he does not want to take this path is up to him.<br><br>stop blaming yourself.</div>
