They will take longer to patch up oso, there seems to be so much pride and ego that neither of them wants to give in and compromise. But they will patch up within a week and then the cycle will repeat again...<br><br>So how's urs like? And is it normal for couples to argue every other day and to hurt each other so much constantly? Or you just kinda get used to the bickering?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
