              <p>The main issue of concern for the guy now is to not hurt the girl any further. Hence, he should avoid doing things that could cause the girl any unhappiness. That includes doing things which the girl dislikes in particular.</p>
              <p>It is a good idea to ask the girl's friends on more advice as to what things to avoid doing, they will be likely to help the guy out if they do not find him a dis-likable person. At the same time, ask them if she has any particular interests, and what things do she like ( food, accessories...etc. )</p>

Patience is needed as she will be scared of being hurt again so you will have to find ways to let her trust you.<span>  </span>If she haven’t get over the previous bf , you can help her . Don’t worry if she rebounds or what because if you love her then respect her decision. But if you manage to win her over I think you will have a strong and long relationship with her just like me n my gf. </span></p></div>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>then I believe it is time for the guy to do something about it. As she has said, she will consider this guy, but she did not mention anything about accepting him. If he truly likes her, he will have to start seriously chasing after her, though not to the point where she finds him to be annoying.</p>
