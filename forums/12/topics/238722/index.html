            <div class='col-md body'>Yesterday when I was on mrt, 2 guys were talking about this too.

I also<br>a) Alone most of the time (Even at work place, no colleagues to be friends with, or rather I choose not to tok to those weirdos)<br><br>b) Non existent career<br><br>c) Not much friends, at least I had colleagues in my previous jobs to have fun with<br><br>d) Poor memory leading to slow learning<br><br>Just writing a-d) makes me slightly sad. So stop thinking about it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">Think about your positives....or just aim to be a nice and sincere person?<br><br>Just think like this, u are meant to be alive to enjoy yourself, no need to contribute to anyone or society one lah. (haha...irresponsible adult!). So just do things u like. If you hate your job, find something u like after work (afterall have the money to do so). Find an activity  / sports. Even if you are studying, u can find ECA to indulge in / find part time job to make friends ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ya agreed! ............finding a passion in life is very important. For most people, making money is passion, for others is excercise / arts. I finally had time to take up my interests recently, and life is much more lively. Being able to share tots with people of the same interests, also feels great.</div>
