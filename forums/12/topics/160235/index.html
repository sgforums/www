            <div class='col-md body'>Hi I am a 17yr old taking o levels this year. I am very afraid of not doing well in o levels and being unable to go to my poly of choice. I begin to thought of the consequences of not doing well, I go to ite get a low paying job . Being the only son in my family, I bear the responsibility of taking care of  my parents when they grow old. I want them to live in bliss, like they way they are providing for me now. I begin to think of suicide, I know it is a very coward thing to do and leave my parents in the lurch.

Sure, if you get good grades, you'll enter uni comfortably ... a 2nd up in most degrees can land you a job in MoE where your starting pay is ~3k and you have great job security, or you could get a law degree and have a starting pay of 4k. But there are countless people who get rich without much in the way of certificates, I'm sure you could name some. Or at worst, if you really can't study and aren't too good at anything you could always drive [I mean the lorry type, some fetch 3k+++] or sign on with the army. Both pay well - more than enough to survive and feed your parents definitely.<br><br>In short, grades mean very little and do not determine your worth as an individual, though I'm sure quite a few people have already said that ....<br></div>

If you know the consequences of getting a poor result for 'O' levels, WORK HARD ON IT!!<br><br>2. Expand your social circle and meet more people so that you can have more friends. Once you find friends who you feel can quite get along with, spend more time knowing each other.<br><br>3. When you study, don't just 'study for the sake of studying'. Spend time really studying the things you need to learn. Often just trying to speed through or drill information into your head won't get them to last good enough for exams.<br><br>4. Nobody can guarantee what would happen to you the day after next and so on and so forth... Suicide? Do you think things would be any better if you just leave your parents behind and let those old folks be miserably hurt by your act and left to fend for themselves when they age?</div>

I failed My Maths in O level twice.  But that did not defeat me.  I went to ITE and got top 5%, Certificate in Merit.  Then I progressed to Poly, still in poly now.<br><br>Wat's so bad about ITE?  In some industries, ITE holders are better paid, bcos they have the skills.<br><br>Juz do ur best and study hard for ur O Level.  Dun give urself too much pressure, coz it will not do u any good.<br><br>There are far more failures in life awaiting you.. or should I say.. failing in exams is not that serious or as bad as other failures in life.

            <div class='col-md body'>a bit late to cry about not having to put in enough efforts right?<br><br>Just focus on what you have now and give your best shot. Make or break it, leave it aside.<br><br>Regardless of ITE, Poly, JC or even private commercial school, it's still a learning place right? It's all in your head, if you want to look down on yourself and feel ashamed because you might be going ITE, then i guess you dun expect others to look up to you. There are still many successful working individuals that graduated from ITE wat! Again, it's how you look at it.<br><br>Os are just part of the growing up "stress" tats all, dun do well, can always try again right? Consider you are already doing not bad (never retain before right?) so most spend one more year to retake lor! No big deal wat...<br><br>Success goes to those who never gives up. I remember having a friend who dun even have N level leh, only PSLE nia... but still haven't die, maybe not well paid but still surviving lor.<br><br>Dun stress, it's all part and parcel of life, just calm ur thoughts and look at it from a different perspective and you will see the difference. Broading over it won't help.<br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No need to over rate the important of school. So many things in this world is not only depend on ur studies.. Im sure u are good in something.. like when i read what u have written, u are emotionally smart.. U know what are ur weakness and im sure u r trying to do something about it.. Failure in something (like ur studies) doesnt mean over.. think like this "Failure is just a way to get u learn in a hard way" Some ppl get good grades in school, gets into top university in the world, but after enters the working world.. only in mid range..  While lots of bosses didnt really do very well in school (like da big boss in microsoft, Billgates... He quits Harvard Univ half way, doesnt have ANY DEGREE, and now the richest)...<br><br>Try to always be positive... Now u r having lots of problems.... ALL people do, but this way u learn more and without u realise... u r learning in a hardway...u are getting mature earlier than others... Im sure u will be success some day.. Just keep up with what u do ok... About ur studies.. u can work hard first now then next time taking part time courses and get good qualification.. Good Luck</div>

(will post links for u to read)<br><br>N tis is becos depression will affect certain chemicals in ur brain that affects e way u think (sumthing both u &amp; I  of us cant help ), and therefore depression must be cured b4 anything else.<br><br>I am currently taking a medication for my depression (BIPOLAR) and it works ! Medication n cognitive talking therapy produces excellent results..<br><br>U just need e rite doc to seek treament from..so dun ever sink deeper..n SUICIDE is definitely not a solution..makes things worse.<br><br>I also hate my depression periods cos it makes me feel isolated, lost of pleasure in activities i used to enjoy, n procrastinate alot but realli cant help it...cos it this mental condition dat affects e way n way I behave..<br>Dun give up so easily...ur parents would be heart broken if anything happens to u..be brave n overcome this period..DEPRESSION IS CURABLE<br><br>And, u said u dun hv frens....me neither...but there's a organisation that might hv pple that u n I can relate to...u can PM me if u need further details (i can tell u ways to get professional help)<br><br>Dun stress out urself... im sure u hav goals set for the future...dun worry unnecessarily.
