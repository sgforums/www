            <div class='col-md body'>If you want to confess to her, you should at least confess to her in a unique way. Don't try to be like those channel 8 drama shows where they just confess right in the face but it's so boring. Confessing on email or msn might just show you do not have the courage to tell her in the face. Which one has more effect when saying I love you: In sms, on a phone or in the face? It's easier saying it in sms, but it has the shortest effect, compared to a "in the face", where the effect will be there.<br><br>Of course, i'm not saying you should just rush up to her and confess to her. Take her out on a date again, and confess to her then. Think of those unique ways, like this video here. It's from the movie Love Actually, and i haven't got a chance to watch it though  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA8q2iTTj14<br><br>It's good that you are prepared to be rejected, but why raise the white flag so early? You never know whether you will suceed.<br><br>To me, confessing one's love is not only to let the opposing party know your feelings for them, but to make an lasting impression.<br><br>My, i seem to be in a frenzy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

To me, this does not really sound like due to her heavy workload, but rather, due to a variety of other factors.<br><br>1. Testing your patience<br>2. Making sure you are really true<br>3. She is unsure herself and needs time to decide. This answer gives her some time to reflect upon this matter.<br>4. Making sure that you are not having just a short-term crush.<br>5. Worst case scenario: don't know how or don't have the heart to reject you<br><br>I may be wrong, but those are what I can come up with at the moment. I dun think 5 mths is a short time. The importance of dating, to me, is to get to know each other better. She may be right that you do not know her well enough, but isn't it better to learn more about each other when u r together?<br><br>My advice: don't stop, yet do not be desperate. Send her suggestive smses, but not too much to the point of irritation; she has not accepted u yet. Plan more outings/dates, and let it be for the moment.</div>
