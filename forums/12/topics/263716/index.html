OK, i don't even know i like her in the first place... maybe i just want to have an experience dating girls. The idea of dating her also just suddenly pop out from my head. lol... i feel like i am fantasizing again..

If u and her ain't even that close in the first place, and is the seldom contact type, what makes u think she likes u? Furthermore, You urself admit she is the out-going type, so I guess at this stage, u 2 are just friends.<br><br>Also, u urself ain't even sure that u have feelings for her in the first place.
