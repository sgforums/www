              <p>Hi..I'm 28 this year. I've been through many past relationships but never had once, fell in love so deeply before. She'd said I was the one she loved and wanted to marry, and I believed her.</p>
              <p>However, she left me a month ago, ending a three year relationship. She’s more than just a great girl, someone whom I wish to spend my lifetime with. Naturally, I became rather crazy and started texting, emailing, and calling her repeatedly, to the extent I even went to her place, with hopes I can meet her. I began glorifying the relationship, desperately promising to change and ignoring the real problems that led to the break up. After a long struggle resulting in more hurt, I decided to let go. I’m determined to piece my life back together.</p>
              <p>One week after the breakup, she told me that she's seeing someone else. I was devastated but there's nothing I can do. It may be because of this guy that we broke up, and I can't stop thinking about her every minute. I tried to concentrate on my work and kept myself busy but it doesn't seem to alleviate the hurt.</p>
              <p>I did what most suggested, to go out more and know new people, spend time with family and friends etc. but at this age, my social circle is shrinking and at times, I still felt lonely among friends. I've considered dating someone else to forget the past but it'd be unfair to her as I still can't forget my ex. Inside me, I felt that there's still a chance for both of us to get back together. What should I do?</p>

              <p>Welcome to the club. Experiencing a break up is very personal and intense one, *pats*</p>
              <p>Just make up your mind about her and roll with it.</p>
              <p>Either get over her or win her back, sounds like you want her back (very risky but what the hell) so here goes:</p>
              <p>Chances are, it wasn't easy for her to walk away from this relationship.</p>
              <p>It has only been a month so just take it easy for now, enjoy your singlehood, savour the change in pace. Very easy to stay friends with women after break up de, especially if they initiated (feel guilty for dumping the man) the break. </p>
              <p>Tell her you want to be mates with her, keep it light and simple. Tell her to intro you any hot women she knows. Then rebuild your own social life, let her know that you are still a man in demand.</p>
              <p>4 months later, by the time you realise you're still in demand and you still want her back, try getting back with her again.</p>

              <p>True, getting dumped is painful and more often than not, dumpee is probably better off doing without dumper.</p>
              <p>But since IR believes<em> (very powerful word hor)</em> there is chance for reconciliation, then it's not something I will debunk and argue about. There are ways to win an ex back so why not give it a shot? When you've got nothing, there's nothing to lose mah.</p>
              <p>When you've invested emotions and time into a relationship and it ends, things are never easy. Save for false bravado.</p>

              <p>I agree, 3 years is a long time. I was with her since 24. We had plenty of happy times together..talking about our future, going on overseas vacations at least twice a year. Perhaps, I got too comfortable in the relationship that I took her for granted at times. She's a good girl, and I never suspected that she'd see someone else behind my back.</p>
              <p>I once told her I just want her to be happy in the relationship. That's the reason she'd used to break up, that she's no longer happy with me. I cannot bring myself to hate her, but I can't understand how she can be indifferent to me suddenly, forgetting about all our past, our promises.</p>
              <p>I've exhausted all efforts to get her back, tried plenty of suggestions from those relationship sites..and it doesn't seem to work. I hope that is still a chance for us to get back together, and hope is all I have.</p>

              <p>woah! im shocked by the points system, so unfair!</p>
              <p>so i shall say its not true! if i do a big thing for her, she appreciates it very much and award higher points too. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>I agree, 3 years is a long time. I was with her since 24. We had plenty of happy times together..talking about our future, going on overseas vacations at least twice a year. Perhaps, I got too comfortable in the relationship that I took her for granted at times. She's a good girl, and I never suspected that she'd see someone else behind my back.</p>
              <p>I once told her I just want her to be happy in the relationship. That's the reason she'd used to break up, that she's no longer happy with me. I cannot bring myself to hate her, but I can't understand how she can be indifferent to me suddenly, forgetting about all our past, our promises.</p>
              <p>I've exhausted all efforts to get her back, tried plenty of suggestions from those relationship sites..and it doesn't seem to work. I hope that is still a chance for us to get back together, and hope is all I have.</p>

              <p>He did not remove and did not want to remove all our photos from his friendster when we first break off too. He was even still carrying my photo in his wallet and hanging our photo keychain on his key when he was already with the gal. The reason was that is his only memories left of us. Sounds rubbish huh. He even claim that the gal doesnt mind at all. Well tell me which gal or guy wouldn't mind? I just don understand.</p>
              <p>As months move on understand my request, he have removed everything. I do not like the fact of him loaded the gals photos with him and still keep mine.</p>

              <p>I read an article the other day, stating how guys and girls
              award points to each other in a relationship. It is true for me, so
              I thought I could share this.</p>
              <p>For a girl, anything positive a guy does, regardless of how
              big or small, is awarded +1 point. (Hugging her and saying "I love
              you" = +1 pt, buying her a new iPod for her birthday = +1pt)</p>
              <p>On the other hand, for guys, big things that she does is
              normally awarded more points, whereas smaller things are awarded
              less. (E.g. buying a PSP for him = +5 pts, whereas calling him and
              say "I miss you" = +1 pt.)</p>
              <p>So in the end, the guy might think that he has done a lot for
              her but never knew he did not accumulate that many points. While
              the girl felt that she wasn't appreciated because he isn't very
