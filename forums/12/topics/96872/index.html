I am not yet ready for a relationship.. You are very lucky that you got respond from her.. Some girls, when you tell her that, the next thing you know, she may be suck up by the Bermuda's Triangle.. She will literally disappear from sight...<br><br>You are quite young are you not? Msging her good night msg and asking where she is with the intention of asking her out his ok.. But don't do it at an amt of over possessiveness.. In fact, both of you are literally not ready for any relationship..<br><br>Its also kinda obvious that she is keeping a distance from you.. Maybe you should not make it so obvious now.. Take things slow and see how it progress from there ya?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
