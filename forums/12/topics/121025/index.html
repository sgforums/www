My Relatives started to call to enquire about my results.<br>My Mum answered their calls in a manner that left me speechless and betrayed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> Firstly she ranted on and on on my inability to score, after that she rub sulphur in my wound by cricticising me badly. Not once did she put an unbias word about me to my relatives. When I heard the conversation...I was stunned. I never imagined that she could say such things. Its really unbelievable yet it is something that I expected. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Suddenly my doubts are back to haunt me...My relationship with my mum has now taken a steep dive.<br>I used to be able to chat so merrily with her. Now, she doesnt even want to talk to me and I feel that I have nothing to say to her also....oh well..all good things must come to an end. Now, Im starting to believe that Im accursed <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> Nowadays I just stay out late with my friends...I feel much better when hanging out with them at least I dun have to bother about what my mum has to say about me. I recall the times when my mum would be happy to sit and listen to me talk...but its not gonna happen anymore <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Im now quite an introverted person.

And you must have an objective of what you want to do or achieve in life, otherwise you are no better off than just a dead person.

In fact my mom is still harping on me not being able to do well here, and the words she used was so harsh it feels like they are cutting into my heart at times. I keep feeling like they dun understand me, as if they just treat me as a studying machine and nothing more. I even have to resort to counselling because of this...<br><br>But I am still surviving.<br><br>I guess what I am trying to say is, to believe in yourself that one day, you will make it. Once you have that belief in you, once you are sure of what you want in life, nothing that others said to you will matter...<br><br>In the end, it is still your life you are talking about, not your parents. They are just worried about you right now I guess, and once you show them that you are capable of handling your own life, they will be rest assured...<br><br>You will face many people who will say things you do not like to hear in this world. They won't just come from your parents. So I guess what you need to do is to learn how to listen to your own thoughts and be sure of what you want. The rest can give opinions and criticism, but your life is still your own to manage in the end.<br><br>i.c.y</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Shade343,<br><br>I was in the same situation as u, &amp; @ tt time, I felt as u did.  Yrs later, this is wat I've learnt:<br><br>1.  Ur mum expected u to do well, cosh she believed in u.  She can't help being disappointed in ur results, cosh she was looking fwd to telling her frens abt ur results.<br><br>2.  My mum did the same thg.  Yrs later, she realised how I broke under pressure from her.  I really went haywire <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  She's now more supportive of Bro, &amp; even when she's disappointed, she does her best to support him.<br><br>Moral of the story:<br>Parents do make mistakes, juz as we children do.  Yrs later, when ur mum sits down &amp; has a tok wif u, explain to her how u felt.  That was wat I did.  Tell her u miss those days when u were able to speak to her freely.  Understand her disappointment, &amp; assure her u'll work harder, &amp; do it.<br><br>These r thgs u'll need to face for awhile, perhaps yrs.  I noe I did.  My dad was horrible in those yrs <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  But now we haf a gd r'ship, &amp; he's finally proud of me : )<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by shade343:</div><div class="quote_body">As I expected one day this will happen.

            <div class='col-md body'>I know it's easier said than done, but the best idea is to ignore what your mother said.<br><br>My father has always looked down on me because I never could do as well as my elder siblings. While my siblings got 251 and 268 respectively for their PSLE, I could 'only' get 226. In addition, I often got bullied and picked on by bullies.... all this gave him the impression that I'm weak, useless, and a good-for-nothing.<br><br>Once when I was 12, he shouted at me, 'What's wrong with you? Why can't you be like everyone else?!?!?!'<br><br>Translation: 'I'm ashamed of who you are.... It's wrong to be the person you are.'<br><br>That was 10 years ago. I'll be 22 this coming June. I still found that comment really hurtful.<br><br>I grew up thinking that my father was right all along and that I was indeed slow and weak. Maybe I am indeed too slow to figure out that he was wrong.<br><br>Anyway, I ended up thrashing both my siblings at both the GCE O and A Levels. Perhaps that'll give him some food for thought.<br><br>I just hope that I can have the strength to forgive my father for what he said on that day in 1995. I pray that someday, I can be forgiven too for thinking badly of my father.<br><br>Don't listen to your mother and end up like me....</div>
