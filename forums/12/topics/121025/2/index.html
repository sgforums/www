HAPPIER than ever.... HAPPIER than e days when i got As and stuff in school!<br><br>why? because i now truly know what i want to acheive in life at this age of 21.... and i am glad i am able to define my dreams at a age where people around me are JUST preparing to get into the proverbial rat race. it also helps that i found a girl whom i truly want to marry.<br><br>the next step... get out from NTU and flesh out my dreams. be one whom i TRULY want to be. why let society dictate who we truly are? why let society dictate what we truly want to acheive<br><br>life is stranger than fiction. get out of the mindset of conforming and achieve what you truly want today. yes today! start planning. start dreaming. Dreams truly are what symbolises the successful and happy people of today. And with happiness and success, you acheive something that transcends even the assets of the truly wealthy, the fame of the superstars and the power of the truly powerful.... something never temporal, something you can take to your deathbed.... HONESTY.<br><br>HONESTY to yourself that you have ACHEIVED your DREAMs by your EFFORTs. And even better doing all these beside your LOVED ONES.<br><br>Why conform? Dream.<br><br>Just my 2 cents. I am serious. Its time we found our meaning in life. Not stick to an education system created and refined for creating automatons. If you feel you are meant for a life of academia, do it. If you feel you are meant to soar up the corporate ladder, do it. If you feel you are meant to own the corporate ladder (warning, no illusions of granduer what u'll be the next Bill Gates!!!), do it.<br><br>Dream. But DON'T delude. DON'T lie to yourself. DON'T conform. DON'T do something you arent meant to.<br><br>education is just to provide us with some knowledge. its just a journey. not the end. i never believed it should be a system anyway.<br><br>keep your chin up ok!? everyone seems to be jia-ing you. do remember that the successful AND happy people.... they had diverse backgrounds... some had poly, some had O Levels, some had PhDs.... but they have something in common... dreams. and the boldness not to conform.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We all go thru phases in life that we felt we failed somehow.<br><br>I took my O levels twice because during my time it was hard to get in polytechnic with 29 points. Waste one year. After a year in my polytechnic I got expelled because I was kinda slow and they din give me 2nd chance.<br><br>During NS, I took up night classes, but sadly the school closed down halfway. After NS, I took a fulltime job and studied night-time at a local polytechnic.<br><br>I got retrenched a year into my job. So I went to work part-time odd jobs and study my diploma at night. Then I decided to take on another diploma full-time (one year) while continue my night class. With certain kind of luck, I completed the fulltime diploma and now with only 4 more months before i finish my part-time diploma.<br><br>So you see, things happen for a reason.<br><br>Cheer up, you are DEFINITELY a worthy person.</div>
