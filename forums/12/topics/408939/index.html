              <p>In the first place, why are you still in touch with that married man you had an affair with?</p>
              <p>That is a VERY big no-no.</p>
              <p>My suggestion is to sever all ties with that married man, platonic or not. You are being very unfair to your boyfriend by still keeping in touch with that fella.</p>

              I kinda agreed with Gunner77 
              
              Something are better left unknown_ why worry so much move on with this new single man and be happy why worry so much, end of the day who don't want to be happy? 
              
              Once bitten twice shy u can't risk your happiness over your past - but my two cents worth of another advice _ end the relationship with the married man lar!!

              <p>It is up to you. </p>
              <p>But let me ask do you tell your mom and dad everything? If you don't, what more about your current bf? Being together does not meant that you have to tell him what you do exactly everyday since 3 years old. There is a limited degree of privacy. Unless he ask then you answer him tactfully.</p>

              <p>Your past is the past. There is no need to let him know too much detail.</p>
              <p>All he needs to know is that you were in a on- and- off relationship with another partner.And you are no longer in contact with the past.</p>
              <p>Your past partner is married or not, it is not an issue and he shouldn't make it one.</p>
              <p>Everyone has a past, his ain't that perfect either. And what good will digging the past do for anyone ? None so far.</p>

              <p>From your post I think it's obvious you feel strongly about this issue and that you actually feel you must tell him one way or another. Am I right to say that?</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>Sound like there are 2 seperate issue here...</p>
              <p>first is your guilt level that you need to address....certainly no point in holding your guilt till you get sick. or develop some mental or terminal illness.</p>
              <p>Even if it is not this guy another guy comes along you still have to face the delimma. Its going to be with you for life. So i suggest you somehow reconcil with your sense of guilt. Accept the past as "misguided emotion" or get some spiritual help to move on</p>
              <p>2nd</p>
              <p>Will telling the past relationship hurt the new relationship....sometime especially during argument may hurt alot more.</p>
              <p>I would suggest you so call stop or delay turning this relationship into a "steady" or get into physical intimate but start engaging into a much deeper conversation and really get to know him and get connected at the emotional level first.</p>
              <p>"If you have to tell"  you want to tell him when both of you are at a mature level where you are emotionally connected and safe not at SEX level.</p>
              <p>Look at it this way maybe you have to learn relationship does not necessary start with physical intimacy and "commitment" takes effort and works.</p>

              <div>i am puzzle and vex for i am not sure if i should
              confess my past relationship to my boyfriend-to-be. (Meaning we
              could be together anytime)</div>
              <div>i am worry sick of disclosing my past relationship to
              him as i am worry he might think otherwise.<br> I am involve with a married man years ago (got into this shit cause
              i was pretty young then and didn't know he was married after
              knowing and talk things out as he wasn't able to get a divorce so
              we actually broke off but keeping each other as companion
              all these years (6yrs). </div>
              <div><br> I am not sure if i should tell him. He has been telling me not all
              man can take the truth but he would prefer his gf to tell him
              rather then him find out bits by bits.</div>
              <div><br> For me i am pressured, coz in my previous relationship i met with
              the same issue. and confession till us to quarrel, jealousy and
              broke off. My Ex BF could handle the stress of my past.<br> What should i do ? Humhh</div>

              <p>Below are some of the options which you may consider"</p>
              <p>1) Tell the truth to your bf and face the music/reality</p>
              <p>2) Keep the secret to yourself &amp; risk the day he either find out the hard way via catching you red handed or you both catch each other red handed</p>
              <p>Why #1: It will help you determine if your bf is a worthy guy for you to accept your past, if he does, its time for you to have a clean break with your ex-bf immediately</p>
              <p>Why #2: Keeping secrets will keep the status quo as it is right now, but it is based on a weak/false impression &amp; foundation in the air with no trust..and you don't want this to be spread among the guys/group you both hang around in..(singapore is way to small not to have common 1st to 2nd degree friends)..you can choose to live in the secret and have the best of both worlds, but you know it's not a solid relationship..</p>
              <p>My advice: Speak nothing but the truth, short-term is better than long-term hurt from a failed relationship, you need to take responsibility for your own actions..</p>
              <p>Word of wisdom &gt;&gt; Your past actions determines the results you are having now and whatever you do now in present tense will affect your way of life in the future..</p>
              <p>Question: Ask yourself what kind of future do you want to live in? Happiness (with a partner who will accept your past and embrace you) or Misery (having to hide, conceal a secret forever which is a self-torture in a way)</p>

              <p>either you be honest, tell him..he can't accept your past..then he is not worth it..what past has past, tell him is because you wanna be clean and not hide anything from him</p>
              <p>you don't tell him, one day he finds out while the relationship is running deep and he wanna break off with u...both will be hurt..and he will never trust you ever again..</p>

              <p>Dear TS,</p>
              <p>To keep things simple, as a rule of thumb, I would suggest that if a close associate or someone who you are willing to reveal your private matters, ask you a direct question regarding your past relationships or anything for that matter, just answer truthfully and hopefully, this chap takes your reply positively. </p>
              <p>On the other hand, if he chose not to ask, I don't see a need for you to reveal your past. </p>
              <p>You cannot change the past, but you can definately look forward to your future. Whenever you are in doubt, remember the rule of thumb.</p>
              <p>Before I end this, I would like to remind you that no matter whose advice you take, it is ultimately YOUR decision. None of us are going to be any better or worse off by the decision you choose to take. </p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>

              <p>i think most of you who think the solution is to "tell all" must understand she will continue to have remorse after the next person and the next and the next.</p>
              <p>The key is how to get over the remorse and guilt within herself.</p>
              <p>If she can't get over her past her own relationship she won't get past any man that comes into her life.</p>
