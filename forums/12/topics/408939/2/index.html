              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> The processing of your guilt does not diminish even with the act of 
              confessing to your current beau about your past. The act of forgiveness 
              and embracement of your past starts with yourself and it is not 
              something that somebody can give to you.</p>
              <p>What I am hearing is that your decision of keeping each other as a
               companion is probably akin to lead a non-committed relationship for six
               years. This unwise decision, although you have probably rationalized 
              that you are free to date whoever you want, in reality, has actually 
              shackle you in some sense. It is indeed a paradox when it appears that 
              you seem to have freedom, but subconsciously, you are still somewhat 
              tied on a deeper spiritual sense (likely a Saturn-influence relationship
               fueling a karmic relationship), therefore, how you brand this 
              relationship is not exactly important (companion, best friend, FB, etc).</p>
              <p>Perhaps you are tired in your arrangement with this married man -
               merely drifting, with no exact destination to land. Your experience has
               taught you that revealing your past will likely to bring about adverse 
              consequence to your current relationship with minimal benefits. Hence, I
               do not see a point for you to go about relating what has happened in 
              the past when you ought to be focusing on building a new future with 
              your new beau.</p>
              <p>The reason why you failed in your previous 
              relationship is not so much about you having to share your past with 
              your ex-bf; but rather, it's about your unnecessary inclusion of him 
              into the picture of your not-so-glorious past, where there is nothing 
              you or he could do to alter them. Failing to invest in the present and 
              look forward will inevitably force you to turn your shoulder over and 
              quarrel about an illusionary past that produce illusionary premises for 
              quarrels. And when the false premises are regarded as real, the death of
               the relationship will also real - even if it could be the most 
              promising relationship ever.</p>
              <p>You can't have the best of both 
              worlds. If you want to walk about from your past, you have to sever 
              bonds with that married man (something which you ought to have done six 
              years ago). If you feel that you need a companionship to serve as a 
              backup, then you will always run into the problem of being haunted by 
              issues of the past.</p>
              <p>Start afresh comes with determination and 
              wisdom to steer in the right direction. To drive faster in the wrong 
              direction will only make you crash faster... in more fatal manner. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>My personal point of view is that there is not a need to tell your present bf unless you guys talk about it openly and share your own experiences or if your current bf is the kind of guy who are magnanimous and understanding. Some guys can be quite a**l and petty when it comes to relationship, even if it's already your past. And when quarrels happen, they might use this against you and put you down.</p>
              <p>But you gota do your part too even if your bf is the understanding kind. Please do not contact the married man anymore because he gives me the impression that he is manipulating you or you are easily manipulated (either ways). There are really many nice men out there who might just be your partner for life, you just gotta cast your net out there.</p>
              <p>Love yourself and be fair to your bf. And ultimately, YOU are the one who knows who you love. If it's the married man, please, it is a forbidden one and you are better off with that. I was in your shoes b4 in my teens and I always believe in karma what comes around goes around. If you ever find someone at later that you really love, you wouldn't want the same scenario happening to you. Bless you girl.</p>

              <p>Hmm.... in this matter I'll agree with Jojo (I think quite rare).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyone has his/her secrets and it is not a neccessity to reveal it to partner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whatever relationship you start is a new chapter and if he judges you on your past it is him who has the problem and he should learn to let go of the past. Which wasn't his concern to begin with since you did not know him. Vice versa.</p>

              <p>It makes no difference whether u confess or not cos; it is anguish and guilt that is unsettling u now. It is self-created by you and till u reconcile to it will never go away and moreover it is going to color/cloud your present .... be it a relationship be it relating. Your so-called boyfriend does not have to know, it is none of his business. however, u seem to want to have someone to ''vomit' on and at the same time feel absolved for this moral conundrum that is so very emotionally delibitating and hence ur vacillating stance.</p>
