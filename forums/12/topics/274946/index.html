He did not on his hp. although he got reply to me once saying his hp is spoil but when he off his hp again i find the resaon wierd because he can easily get a new hp. My friend think that mayb he is unhappy about the stuffs he saw at my place but cant ask because we are not offical and he is in no position to ask.

If he really like you, i don't think he will really care whether you have had your ex-bf stuffs. On the other hand, perhaps you can ask him why he didn't get a hp causally.<br><br></div>

I mean, if your goin out with some1, y still keep it? yea, its not wrong like what some ppl might say,, but.. just imagine what would u think if your goin-to-b-gf still keep her ex pic and also CLOTHES...<br><br>sory man, i coudlnt accept it.. how can i know if shes still liking that ex? sometimes , u know u can trust.. but u cant just ignore what'd u saw.. Seeing is believing.. even if she said its nothing.. but somehow i will feel something..<br>Its more to respect anyway, i would have just throw away my ex's pic. Presents still can keep.. but pics.. its already over.. if im with new gal, i don expect her to see my ex pic.. cuz now im with her.. the past shud be thrown away.. not to delay or lazy..<br><br>I dont know man, im not that open-minded if the gal i like still keep their ex's pic... sometimes u never know if a gal you like or trust telling you lies.. i believe some of us were being foolish to trust the gal they like and ended up they didnt even love u at the 1st place..<br><br>You can only understand someone if you understand their lies...</div>

You have yourself to blame as you went along with this so-called n/s attached relationship right from the start. Because you are afraid of losing him even from the beginning that is why you refuse to voice out. Have you sounded out right from the beginning you wouldn't have to be in your present dilemma. Zhi zao fan nao.<br><br>So, now there is no way to go about your situation but brave the storm and face the 'dong dong chiang'. Ask him!!! If he don't want well, nothing more to lose liao since you oredi lose so much. Start a fresh with someone new and don't be so dumb as not to state your intention right from the start this time.</div>

It lasted well till a few days back when i brought him to my place. At my place i think he saw clothes and photos of my ex which i have not thrown away.. He never say anything but after that he went m.i.a. He did not on his hp. although he got reply to me once saying his hp is spoil but when he off his hp again i find the resaon wierd because he can easily get a new hp. My friend think that mayb he is unhappy about the stuffs he saw at my place but cant ask because we are not offical and he is in no position to ask. If he ask i may ask him for status and if he did not want to committ then i will be like slapping himself on the face. I dunno if my friend is right? I am starting to worry wat happen to him.. Any advice?<br></div></blockquote>Go reflect yourself on the mirror, usually a guy dun call back or m.i.a is that he dun like your face, not pretty and also your character suck. So, start to change ya.</div>
