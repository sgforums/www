I mean, if your goin out with some1, y still keep it? yea, its not wrong like what some ppl might say,, but.. just imagine what would u think if your goin-to-b-gf still keep her ex pic and also CLOTHES...<br><br>sory man, i coudlnt accept it.. how can i know if shes still liking that ex? sometimes , u know u can trust.. but u cant just ignore what'd u saw.. Seeing is believing.. even if she said its nothing.. but somehow i will feel something..<br>Its more to respect anyway, i would have just throw away my ex's pic. Presents still can keep.. but pics.. its already over.. if im with new gal, i don expect her to see my ex pic.. cuz now im with her.. the past shud be thrown away.. not to delay or lazy..<br><br>I dont know man, im not that open-minded if the gal i like still keep their ex's pic... sometimes u never know if a gal you like or trust telling you lies.. i believe some of us were being foolish to trust the gal they like and ended up they didnt even love u at the 1st place..<br><br>You can only understand someone if you understand their lies...</div></blockquote>It is more like you think too much, keeping the pics can mean absolutely nothing. It might mean that she doesnt have time to clean it out, doesn't mean she is still attracted to the ex...<br><br>A guy who is confident and secure in the rs will not be affected by a small thing like this, or at least would talk it out with the gf before going MIA  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

He knows how much i like him and the is he who dont wan to commit. All the time we been in a no string attach r/s e also never mention that he wan us to be official. It not i want a no string attach r/s actually im also hurting badly inside but im afraid if i force him to make a decision i may scared him away. I cant bear to lose him. Some of you may say i broke the rules of the game and yes i did cos i really fell for him. </div></blockquote>I reckon this MIA thingy is just an excuse to terminate the R/S. (Sorry no pun intended but this is just a fact of life )<br><br>In my opinion, a guy who never wants upfrontal commitment in the 1st place would never want to commit eventually. Relax though, this is just my own subjective view, being a guy who is non-commital as well.<br><br>Remember, words are cheap...
