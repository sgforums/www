            <div class='col-md body'>to me, i felt that the girl is more in the wrong. Even though im a girl but still i felt that she is juz being UNREASONABLe... she ask bf go rest, bf go rest dan she kpkb...<br><br>but on the other side, some girls like to act " considerate". So by asking u "dear u tired ma, if u tired dan u rest lor" there is 2 ways to explain it..<br>1. she wan u to feel that she is a awesome girlfriend who spare a tot for u OR<br>2. something similar happen before and u claims u are tired. So tis time round, she PURPOSELY ask u tired ma??<br><br>either wae, deep down her heart, she wan u to company her de. If u sae u are tired but yet insist on going wif her, she will be laffing hard in her heart..<br><br>If the above is not true, dan the ONLY reason is she is finding fault wif u...<br><br>Afterall there is no rite or wrong in life lah.. its all seperated by a thin line. If u think u are rite dan juz heck her nonsense lor but if u think u realli love her and u cant live w/o her, dan juz be henpeck and gib in bah.. no choice de its all about gib n take...<br><br>Morale of all relationship.. there is always 'UP' and NO down. all girls need honey to keep them nourish n going....<br><br>good luck bro!</div>

A bit immature thinking..I can understand that cuz my ex is a bit childish and hunger for my company too. Once i left apartment without telling her cuz she was sleeping but i put a note beside her bed.. she got pissed off with me haha.. but i know at least waht she wants... she just dun like for me to put things like that.. she prefer me to tell her even though shes still sleeping.. yea bit unreasonable.. but she will feel shes not important if i only make a note. hahaa<br><br>but all a gal wants is a company. Mayb she's not happy bout something or watever,<br><br>Hmmm..<br><br>For TS:<br><br>a) Be more strict of your decision and dont say something like "But you asked me to take rest". Why dont you say you're tired today cuz of yesterday's midnite outing and will meet her again the nex day or so?<br><br>b) U have to prove and give more effort to plan outings with her and must not break your promise.<br><br>For the gal:<br><br>a) should have understand the situation and dont have to start argue bout this simple thing..She needs TS company but just dont know hwo to tell it directly to TS. Some gals just afraid or dont know how to tell what they are thinking..<br><br>Just some understanding would be enough and do not flame or bring past incident to make the flame hotter..<br><br>Dont know you both la.. but i can see at least she wants your company and wanted to be wit you.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes, I don't understand my girlfriend. When she asked me whether I want to go out, I answered I want to go out. Then she ask me whether I'm sure I want to go out and said if you are tired then nvm. I already said I wanted to go out and she still ask me whether I'm sure. I know I may be indecisive sometimes but I don't like her to keep asking.<br><br>She said I can rest if I want to when I haven't even tell her I'm tired. So i replied I wanted to rest. Is it wrong to listen to her? Since she said nvm, then I rest. I'm a simple and straightforward minded person. I think that is my weakness. Now this is a hard lesson for me and I can't take a girl's word at face value. She say something and yet mean another thing. Another point, when I give her present, she say its too expensive and I wasted money. When I don't give her present, she complained why I never give her present. I believe that the gift that I wanted to give her is from the heart, so the cost of it doesn't matter. I guessed her thinking is too complicated.<br><br>She haven't give me an answer whether to patch back again. I kept asking her for forgiveness and she ignored me. All I wish now that she will come back to me. I have prepared myself for a break up. Sometimes I felt she is trying to make my life difficult.</div>
