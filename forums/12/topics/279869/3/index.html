When she asked me whether I want to go out, I answered I want to go out. Then she ask me whether I'm sure I want to go out and said if you are tired then nvm. I already said I wanted to go out and she still ask me whether I'm sure. I know I may be indecisive sometimes but I don't like her to keep asking.<br><br>She said I can rest if I want to when I haven't even tell her I'm tired. So i replied I wanted to rest. Is it wrong to listen to her? Since she said nvm, then I rest. I'm a simple and straightforward minded person. I think that is my weakness. Now this is a hard lesson for me and I can't take a girl's word at face value. She say something and yet mean another thing. Another point, when I give her present, she say its too expensive and I wasted money. When I don't give her present, she complained why I never give her present. I believe that the gift that I wanted to give her is from the heart, so the cost of it doesn't matter. I guessed her thinking is too complicated.<br><br>She haven't give me an answer whether to patch back again. I kept asking her for forgiveness and she ignored me. All I wish now that she will come back to me. I have prepared myself for a break up. Sometimes I felt she is trying to make my life difficult. </div></blockquote>That is why the answers are alwasy depend on you.. if you really wan to go, then go for it, even she ask u to rest.

U should also admit your weakness and seek to her that u will change it but you must keep that promise..<br><br>"All I wish now that she will come back to me."<br><br>Tell that to her..What a gal needs is someone who can understand them and be there for them... she doesnt actually making your life difficult but instead shes actually showing you what is your weakness.. sometimes normal friend wont even bother to tell your weakness<br><br>YOu got a good gf, my fren.. she might b a little pampered gal but will you even like her if shes being too serious ?<br><br>Best of luck</div>

HOw many times you call her a day just to check if shes alrite?\\<br><br>I think she's scared of your commitment in this r/s. She might have doubts that you dont really love her. She might think you make no effort for this r/s. And that she think she's already getting a bit tired for all this..<br><br>I thk you can still save it.. But you really need to prove how much you love her..She needs to know it from your heart. You can go to her house , kneeling to her if you really love her.. i wont mind doing that if i really love a gal.. it is not how ppl think bout you kneeling.. its bout how u wan to prove how much u willing to do that just for her.. but if u cant ignore what ppl think of u kneeling, then i think you should know that you dont really love her at all...<br><br>I just wan to advice one thing..<br><br>YOu can do anything you want to do,,<br><br>but hopefully you will have no regret doing it..<br><br>Never try to think of the outcome, cuz watever it will be, will be.

"Love ya~"<br><br>U think it might b friend - to -friend situation now but i thk by the way she still go out with you , that means not a normal friend to friend.. she never initiated to hold your hands, why dont u hold her hand first .. wei, u still need to wait for her to hold your hand arr?<br><br>u dun have to ask,, just hold her hand and walk like nothing happened..<br><br>or mayb u can try this.. when shes explaining something, just listen watever she wan to say, then watch her face.. then u touch her face gently and just simply say you never think how cute you are previously.. then just say, you cant smile without having her around you cuz its her that make you feel happy and alive.. say that straight into her eyes !<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actualy no one can teach u anything,, it really depends on you to be alert and be understanding of what your gf really wanted..<br><br>Most of the time, gal just wan the guy to only listen... sometimes u dun have to try to solve her prob.. let her talk out all her probs , u just listen.. enough. She will appreciate it. Your gf really is a good one ok,, sometimes gal dun like to plan or try to think where to go out dating.. at least your gf plan to go somewhere for dating together.. she spend her time to be with you, you should really appreciate this gal or you will regret one day... She did her part ,, how bout you ? Try put more  effort to be together if possible.<br><br>Having a gf means u need to study how ur gf thinks.. its not bcuz you both love each other and thats it ended up being a couple<br><br>After be couple, then you have to maintain it, at this level , u need to be understanding and tolerance and patience is needed.. but of course.. you sometimes have to think for yourself too.. you need some personal space alone so does she<br><br></div>
