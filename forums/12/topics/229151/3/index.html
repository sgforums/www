Usually, it connotes some kind of delusions from the victim him/herself because a 'wait' is not a promise - it's by choice. And when he/she sees it as a promise, it's probably more narcissistic than coming from genuine love itself.<br><br>You may ask: how do we differentiate delusional wait from non-delusional ones?<br><br>I supposed the judging comes from the circumstances creating the option for waiting.<br><br>But I must accentuate that waiting does not denote faithfulness or loyalty. Many people believe that waiting signifies dedication in love, but I can blatantly tell you it isn't. Not a cent.<br><br>I will reiterate my earlier point: waiting is by choice.<br><br>CloUdiSm states: '...Once in awhile, right in the middle of an ordinary life, love gives us a beautiful fairy tale. And people that weren't granted the fairy tale will recreate their own chapters... writing in scripts of fantasy...'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dokono:</div><div class="quote_body">In any case,  he should not wait, simply because the time spent on waiting can be used to chase other chicks who could be hotter.<br><br>Also, the fact he must be made to wait speaks volumes for the amout of love the girl has for the guy....<br><br>***<br><br>....My point is, instead of waiting for that hopeless case, why don't you just go after other girls who are waiting for your love or could be better cases? Let's say you wait for 1 year and the girl still has not made her decision, aren't you wasting a lot of your time?<br><br>Instead, you could have used this one year of waiting and look for other partners. Don't let the girl make you wait like a fool while she is also looking at other handsome dudes. If she could make you wait, it only proves her respect for you is not much, let alone love.<br><br>doko</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I will share something - not to refute, but to provide one interesting view:<br><br>YouÂ’re the guy of opportunity cost<br><br>So much so that ultimately, you are the one you love the most.<br><br>You sure loved your woman; but that portion of love will never be more than what you have given to yourself.<br><br>Your love for self is so much that you cannot afford to put yourself at a compromised/disadvantageous position because you are always thinking of opportunity cost.<br><br>From here, how much do you think your love weighs on your side... without always having to mention the love on the other side of the scale first?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I am saying this because I am also somebody with concentrated dosage of self love and a good friend pointed this out and saying those words to me.

But she has earned it. I think you are reading too much into it. I could tell from your last paragraph.<br><br>Im not some heartless person who can turn on and off as I wish haha.
