Both party needs to stay really focus, be really independent and be prepared to make loads of sacrifices.</div>

But, are'nt you having a LDR if she's away and you're in SG?<br><br>I can point out the problems you will face,<br>1) Age, she is older<br>2) Religion<br>3) Family - Yours and hers<br>4) Marriage, if so who wants to?<br><br>But why face all these problems if you or her are'nt thinking about marriage. This is more of a relationship problem.</div>

(just go to this website <a href="http://www.lawrencegoetz.com/programs/ipinfo/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lawrencegoetz.com/programs/ipinfo/ </a>)<br>3) Get a headphone and speakers for your computer (Best to get a headphone set with a speaker in front, like one of those telephone operators)<br>3) One setups the server, the other just connects.<br>4) Viola, you can chat for free with your internet connection for hours and hours! The reception is very clear and cripsy, no distruptions, no fuzzy sound like some phonecards!!!<br>5) You can have a chat party, invite more of your good friends into your server and you can all chat about whats going on in your lives.<br><br>Combine it with Netmeeting, and you can see your love on your computer screen while chatting to them at the same time.<br>1) Get a good Computer Cam<br>2) Viola, you can kiss him on screen!
