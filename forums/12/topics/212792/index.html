            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, the best advice that can be given here has nothing to do if you can have a 2nd chance. Rather, the advice is to sit down and do some careful self-searching.<br><br>Ask yourself is it sensitive and understanding to try to hook up with that poor girl that just broke up. Ask yourself how selfish your motives are and how you displayed yourself to the girl. If I'm the girl, I'll avoid such a selfish fella in future. In fact, I will tell my girlfriends what an insensitive guy you are.<br><br>Next time, think twice.. nay, consider thrice before you shoot yourself in the foot. Reputation takes years to build but can be shot down in faster than you can say 'loser'.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In Short : Remain as friends for now. BUT ask her out and spend most of yr time with her. Slowly build up the relationship, get to know her more and also let her feel that you're truly worthful guy.<br><br>When both get to know each other very well, find a chance to hold her hand and cross the road and dun let go. Find a spot and tell her how you feel and ask her if she's ready to be yr GF. Make sure look into her eyes when u telling her yr feelings. THis method maybe old BUT every good to use one.
