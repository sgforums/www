              <p>hello guys,</p>
              <p>      i have a elder brother who has some problems in life. he is overweight and do not have a girlfriend. Although i would like to help him, i myself and him has some friction and we quarrel also and we usually do not chit chat like friends also.</p>
              <p>    He seems to be unable to solve his life problem , and he is trapped in his current way of life, of working and free time. Apparently he is unable to solve his problem effectively.  My family do try to help him and give advice but as you know, sometimes easier is said than done. It is also not easy to really change a person.</p>
              <p>    Our relationship has improved slightly recently due to some events and so this is the first good news. I hope to be really communicating well with him from now onwards successfully to prevent making things worst.</p>
              <p>I hope i can receive some more advices from fellow forumers. Thanks a million.</p>

              <p>Hi january,</p>
              <p>Firstly, do your brother feels that being overweight and not having a girlfriend is a problem for him? If he does not think so, you could possibly upset him by bringing these points up, as he may feel that they are insults.</p>
              <p>If he does acknowledges that they are problems for him, the best way for you to build up your relationship with him while tackling his first problem is to plan weekly exercises where you have workouts together with him. If he has more time, you can make it twice or thrice a week instead.</p>
              <p>As for getting a girlfriend, you can have him participate in group-dating sessions, so as to increase his chance of getting another half.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>You should try to "fit in" with his current way of life, while slowing adjusting him. Be mindful that changes in lifestyle cannot happen overnight; it is a slow and gradual process.</p>
              <p>And I am curious - what is his age? If he is an adult, he should be able to make decisions for himself..</p>
              <p>On a more personal note, if I were you, I would not try to force him into a relationship. If the relationship fails, who is to blame? The desire for companionship is self initiated, attempting to hasten the process might just backfire.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents.</p>

              <p>To truly change a person's physical appearance is easy.</p>
              <p>1) Look at the diet habits of the home.  Change that, and your brother can later be more appreciative when he sees himself healthier and losing weight.</p>
              <p>2) What is the showering, bathing habits, sleeping habits and types of activities in the house? Change that around by setting a good example yourself and following a disciplined sleep, time management pattern, and you can eventually show how it can be done and achieve your goals, and motivate others to achieve theirs.</p>
              <p>3) Clothing and how to manage them.  Maybe some presents like a few nice shirts or accompany your brother for shopping for clothes, tailored pants or maintaining nice shine/polish to each other shoes, will go a long way to make everyone looks nice.</p>
              <p>Fat is not a crime.  Lack of proper hygeine and proper grooming/style however, turns people off.</p>

              <p>Hi january,</p>
              <p>Is there anyone else in your family who is closer to him? You can have him/her help to actually force your brother to take up a exercise routine, and motivate him at the same time. </p>
              <p>There is nothing he can do about saving more money, unless he is willing to come up with a financial savings plan himself and keep to it. As for getting a girlfriend, as some of us have suggested, he may want to consider going to a dating session. </p>

              <p>good idea, but TS probably advised his/her bro to do so already since he/she said that the bro is not avid learner thus will avoid anything beside work play relax routine</p>
              <p>just like trueheart said, get someone with the power to pummel his/her bro into doing something first, since asking him nicely won't work</p>

              <p>No doubt everyone here has given many good advices, but I have the feeling that TrueHeart is the only one who has partially spotted the main problem. </p>
              <p>The main problem is how to make january's brother actually listen to the advices given. Asking him to go for dating sessions, to try slimming services, to better groom himself, to join outdoor activities club are all definitely kind and good advices, but they will not work if january's brother is not going to do anything about them.</p>
              <p>As TrueHeart mentioned, someone who is close to january's brother can act as a push factor for him to take some action. Be it slimming center, exercise routine, or outdoor activities, all are possible slimming methods which will work only if we can get january's brother to start moviong on his feet.</p>
              <p>I will also like to add on, since TS's brother is of the more lazy and unwilling to do anything out of his "standard" life person, TS can help to make a schedule and have him stick to it, along with the help of that someone who is close to him. In addiction to TrueHeart's suggestion of having TS to join his or her brother for exercises, this will also be another opportunity for them to bond. </p>

              <p>How does one define happiness, from a 3rd person's perspective?</p>
              <p>How does one define happiness, even from a 1st person perspective?</p>
              <p>You may presume that he would become happy if 1) he found a girlfriend. 2) lost his weight to manageable healthy levels. 3) have some savings.</p>
              <p>Thing is, even if he achieves it all, which is not impossible, will he be happy? I know of many who achieve much more than what he and you desires, and are yet NOT happy.</p>
              <p>My point is, perhaps a bit more complex and at a consciousness level many may not have attained yet,( I will admit not even myself there yet), what is happiness to him. True happiness can only be attained by oneself, knows his own limitations, and find peace with oneself to be contented.</p>
              <p>Otherwise he will need to break those bonds of self imposed limitations for change. Thing is, your bro doesnt seem to want to break those bonds holding him back. Thus he will have to find contentment within himself, and come to terms with his limitations, and live the life he chosed.</p>
              <p>Fatalistic perhaps, but change can only happen by one's hand, seldom from another or hate will only grow from perceived enforcement, or he takes a leap of faith in religion, belief in a power that is mightier than himself and with that belief, a divine power to assist his change.</p>
              <p>Sorry if it sound deep, i'm trying my best to be as simple as possible! :-P</p>

              <p>hello guys,</p>
              <p>      i have a elder brother who has some problems in life. he is overweight and do not have a girlfriend. Although i would like to help him, i myself and him has some friction and we quarrel also and we usually do not chit chat like friends also.</p>
              <p>    He seems to be unable to solve his life problem , and he is trapped in his current way of life, of working and free time. Apparently he is unable to solve his problem effectively.  My family do try to help him and give advice but as you know, sometimes easier is said than done. It is also not easy to really change a person.</p>
              <p>    Our relationship has improved slightly recently due to some events and so this is the first good news. I hope to be really communicating well with him from now onwards successfully to prevent making things worst.</p>
              <p>I hope i can receive some more advices from fellow forumers. Thanks a million.</p>

              <p>Honestly, no one would rather be fat and single over being slim and attached/married. If given a choice, everyone wants to grow old together with a partner. Those who don't miss out on the chance, and came to force themselves to settle for that.</p>
