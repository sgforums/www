F*CKER, YOU ARE A JERK!<br><br>Like you, i had this girl whom i liked and she likes me too. Like you, i think that im unable to commit fully to the relationship and thus initiate to end the relationship. What you are going thru now, i been there before. Like you, im  a jerk too.<br><br>There are some questions, are you the one who initiate this relationship?<br>Did you went steady with her before telling her that you cant commit?<br>Do you keep in contact with her still?<br><br>After i told her that, i didnt keep in contact with her. I thought it would be the better for both since im not able to commit or watever. Its only when years later that i chanced upon the sadness i bought to her and regretted. Its only thru a friend that i realised how much pain i bought to her due to my selfishness. I did feel hurt making that initial decision, but i believe i recovered shortly after.<br>While im living normally soon after, she is suffering. While i feel i am justified in making that decision, she is suffering from the pain i caused her. While all these happened a long time ago, i do feel guilty sometimes and keep minimal contact with her.<br><br>mel, as i read your post it just reminds me of my past.<br>[quote]Originally posted by me|:<br><strong><br>i believed i made the gal totally devasted.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>apparently she's still able to take it quite ok, perhaps its just a strong front that she put up to make me feel better...<br>[quote] </strong><br><br>Does she really feels ok?<br>Have you talk to her since then? I hoped so, if not you are just a fu*cker (as i am).<br><br>Giving up the relationship because you fear that you cant commit to, it is foolish. That is, did you ever try trying at all? For you to say (me to say) is easy, but hav you thought of the girl's feeling. Put yourself in her shoes, how would you feel? A girl that you love so much say suddenly she have to break off just because she cant commit, can you take it easily? If not, how would you expect her too?<br><br>Came across in a website before and find it meaningful.<br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Love is not about finding the perfect woman. Instead love is learning to see an imperfect woman to be perfect. </span></strong><br><br>There is nothing in this world such as perfect woman (maybe except mother). Nobody is perfect including me and you (and her).<br>Take time to think about this. It may takes you minutes or days to come out with that decision, but it may takes her years to forget you. Don't let your decision take the joy off someone else. Its just isnt fair to her (and my her too). At the very least, be there by her side and knows what she is going thru now. If not, making a decision and leaving her alone will not be the most responsible thing to do in the world.<br><br>Maybe you are right (like most of the people here), or maybe you are not so right. Maybe you should not even start at all.  I may be wrong but maybe there is just something more for the both of you. Maybe you just shouldnt give up so early. Maybe, well just maybe...<br><br>That is all i want to say. Please don't let another girl suffer silently in pain (again).<br><br>Good luck for you (and for her).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
