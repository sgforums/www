              <p>Hi, I have been troubled by someone in my class ever since last year but
                yesterday was quite a terrible day, so I am going to explain why later
               on. At first, he is the same class as me in last year's N level maths 
              class. He sit beside me on the first day after he arrive and look at me.
               I did not look at him or even bother him. When weeks goes by, he asked 
              me something about the class break then I reply him. Later at around 
              June, I talk to him and said there might be no class today as I am not 
              sure the teacher said that there is a break and people still come to 
              class. When time goes, he start to talk to me about my self personality 
              matter such as he asked me, do I have a job and I say no, I am currently
               concentrating on my N level first then he keep on asking why don't I 
              find one, now job is difficult to find then I was like don't want to 
              talk to him about this matter because it is regarding about self 
              personality matter and I am only concentrating on passing my exam to get
               my N and O level cert. I did reply him and say I concentrate on my 
              study first, then later he did not bother me anymore. From June onward, 
              he did not come to class for the whole year which I think that he 
              doesn't not want to study anymore. <br> <br> Yesterday was my first O level A-maths class and in the middle of the 
              lesson, a challenger approach and guess who, that guy again. I was like 
              oh god not him again and he is the only guy who is the same class as me 
              last year. He saw me and we smile to each other. During break, he came 
              to talk to me about how is last year's class, how have I been doing and 
              so on. We chat a little about last year's class as I ask him how did he 
              get to O level class and I thought he did not study anymore since last 
              year he did not come to class or I am not sure if he had taken his N 
              level exam. He told me that he actually have the certs for a very long 
              time ago and come to attend lesson to refresh his memory. <br> <br> Later, he start to talk about my self-personality matter again which 
              pissed me off like did I have a job, I say no and he say why not, I said
               I am concentrating on my O level first then he say hiya why do you 
              think you can study like that all day? what have you been doing at home,
               study all day? oh god you really think you can study all day at home? 
              so I told him I did take some break in between days and so on. So I tell
               him, of course I can study like that, why not aren't it normal then he 
              shake his head which anger me. I was wondering what is wrong with this 
              guy? He is older than me 10 years or so. He just come here to refresh 
              his maths skills and I come here to take my O level cert and now he is 
              talking to me these nonsense like trying to corrupt me not to study. I 
              do not know how to  handle such person so I came here to ask for advice 
              what I should do. <br> <br> I think of a few ways to avoid this troublesome busybody guy like trying
               to change my class but this is the only A-maths class that is 
              available, ignoring him would be offending him as well as get angry at 
              him. So I do not have any ideal what I should do, anyone please advice 
              me what I should do?</p>
