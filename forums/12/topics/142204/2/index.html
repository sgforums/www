That'd be ideal. Suppose you didn't get to see "that person value that opportunity", would you stop giving love selflessly? Would you put an end to your gift of "True Love"?<br><br>If being selfless does not imply not to expect anything in return, then being selfless <span style="font-style: italic;">can</span> imply to expect something in return, right? Wouldn't you say that to be truly "self-less" in every sense of the word, expecting recognition of the "self" or rather, the concept of the "self" is inconsequential?<br><br>It is of course a bonus when one receives a reward, tangible or otherwise, for one's efforts, but when one deems the reward (eg. return of love, recognition, appreciation) as the objective of one's labour of love, when one gives love only for the reward, could that kind of love be self-less?<br><br>This is probably all empty talk anyway *shrug*...

Leaves a scar on your life if your sex-partner does not become your spouse, depending on how the girl takes it though. I don't know about guys.<br><br>Getting married itself is also a risk since it might end in divorce but a smaller risk. In a marriage, there is proof of willingness to commit to build a relationship. If premarital sex is justified by love then why not love enough to make a sacrifice? Love and continuously loving is to build a stronger relationship and that often takes sacrifices as both parties might be different or very similar in character but when arguments arises, sacrifices for personal space, time and respect has to be made to build the relationship into a deeper meaning. So let pre-marital sex be just a small sacrifice to provide the girl a sense of security. Too expensive a gift? Let this guy pass and call the other in the line (if any).<br><br>Once you start having sex, reasoning might be marred by desires. There's also a higher risk of contracting STDs. Sex can also lead to cervix cancer in women, oral cancer in both genders though it is not the only cause.<br><br>There's a difference between humans and animals and that is stronger self-control. So its up to individuals to choose. Take the gamble and have fun expressing love physically (you might be lucky not to rot with some illness) before marriage or make the gift of a sacrifice. </div></blockquote>Lets think it this way, if you have sex ONLY after marriage and you found that your spouse cant satisfy you, what will you do?<br><br>I have heard too many cases whereby husband find mistress, file divorce because of not enuff sex.<br><br>I will say i stand of sex before marriage. At least you know whether if your marriage will last anot. Of course, only have sex with your partner.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Love and lust to me can never be absolutely defined with words. With love, there will always be a little lust because you want to be physically intimate with your partner. The only wholeful determination of lust are FLINGS, unless they develop into something more, which is highly unlikely in most cases.<br>Lust can either be the spice to the relationship, dominated by love, or in more unfortunate cases, vice versa. In any case, you'll never really know until a situation occurs that tests the strength of the relationship.<br><br></div>
