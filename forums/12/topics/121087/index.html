Well.. do remember you love her just the way she is.. You have to accpet her who she is.. If you cant take it.. Then why in the first place you both were together?<br><br>You jolly-well know that she's taking you for granted.. Does she ever consider or treated you as her bf?? SOmeone who is close and can talk to?? During these two years.. do you both communicate well? Has both actually open up to each other.. that you can talked anything under the sun..?? Or jus me is me.. and she is she.. Now she would rather talked and share things with her friends than you.. Be it a guy or a girl..<br><br>I know that you tried to talk to her.. and all she answered back was either one word.. or she couldn't be bothered.. Since now all communications between you both has broken down.. Do you still think that this relationship will last further?? Sometimes love need not have to say it out loud.. actions are more important..<br><br>You have to learn to let go.. YOu are the only one who is holding on to it.. and tryin g to revive this relationship.. Is not easy.. Move on.. There's no turning back.. only to walk straight ahead.. YOu don't need anyone to tell you wat to do.. You already decided.. and have the answer to yourself.. Just do what's right for you.. Is all about what you think..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>don jump the gun. it could be ur gf char that she likes to socialise alot. some guys have that char also. (like me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ) My wife and I both have our share of friends from the opposite sex. and u have to learn to accept that though she may love u, she will still want to have her friends. (else wedding dinner all ur frens and she don have frens very sianz)<br><br>Being together means to be able to accept her as she is and she doing the same to u. changing each other wil not work cos we don come from a factory that manufacture people according to customer's specs.<br><br>if u are the insecure type and she is the sociable type, i would be tough for u to accept her behavior. you may still be young and as u grow, ur char will change too. it may be for the better or worse, depending on how u shape urself. U may need more time to accept her.<br><br>last resort if u don wanna go crazy over ur wild imagination is to leave her.but let her know the real reason.</div>
