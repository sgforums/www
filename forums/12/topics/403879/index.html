              <p>How much is the difference in your last drawn vs the offered pay ?</p>
              <p>The job is still open for a reason.. because no one else is taking up the job at that kind of pay.</p>
              <p>If you are desperate for the job.. then just be thick skinned and ask for it. But they'll know you are desperate to come back and be less negotiable from now on.</p>
              <p>I'd wait, if I were you.. but there may be others who are better qualified to fill that job when they start to offer a higher pay ...so.. don't hold your breath for this one .. just keep your eyes open for other options.</p>

              <p>well, there are people who left a company and went back... 
                  it's not uncommon.</p>
              <p>job is like a love affair.  the feeling must be right too,
                  otherwise one won't stay long. </p>
              <p>now, i'm kinda hoping they would not accept my
                  counter-offer...  haahaa  complicated feelings...  i
                  know.  the heart and mind are not in the same place, that's
                  why i had trouble deciding in the first place</p>
              <p>if they accept my higher asking pay, does it mean it's a done

              <p>Yes you can say no.. but that'll look really bad on you. After all you can't keep asking for more and more to no end. Very unprofessional to say the least.</p>
              <p>Don't forget your work history and contacts may be researched by your future company if they consider to hire you.</p>
              <p>Don't put too much emotional attachment into your job.</p>
              <p>Remember.. a job is just another business transaction. If they have to sack you or hire you.. <strong>it is never an emotional decision on their part.</strong></p>
              <p>If they match your asking pay and you like the company.. by all means accept the offer.n You've got nothing to lose right now.</p>

              <p>I think you should just wait and see.</p>
              <p>If you have better offers while you wait for their response.. they can't blame you for rejecting their offer anyway.</p>
              <p>But you do come across as a person who is flaky.. that's not a good trait in any employee.</p>
              <p>I suggest you don't join the company purely because of the people. because people come and go, this human factor is highly variable. Today you may not like the new management , few years later.. the people may turnover and a new group will replace the old.</p>
              <p>What are important, are you happy with the work you do, the remunerations must be equitable and do you see a potential for a long term career in this company.</p>

              <p>thank you for the responses.</p>
              <p>i hv decided not to continue with this company.  fm recent experiences, i feel that the culture has changed since new management took over.  they hv become cheap and fake.  that's probably why many ex-colleagues changed ship. </p>
              <p>the people are the only few pull factors which made me stay for so long last time.  maybe i m nostalgic and had the perception that the "good old place" is still good.  this perception no longer stands. </p>
              <p>the only reason i turned back is for my family..  personally, it's not aligned with my heart to do it. </p>
              <p>due to confidentiality, i will delete my earlier posts.  thanks again.  cheers.</p>
