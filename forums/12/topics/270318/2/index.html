After all, this issue does not compromise or jeopardise the interests of anyone bar the two of them.<br><br>I mean, you don't even know the genuine reason behind their arrangements and are merely speculating the basis for such a deal.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, if the bf is really in love with his gf, both will be together. But the gf should tell his bf that she will help him pay his sch fees and he still needs to pay it back as an assurance. Base on your little info, think the bf only using gf to pay for his fees. After that, work, then got money and got new gf, find old gf not up to his standard and  finally, bye bye to old gf. But every outcome still lies on the bf whether he has decided and make up his mind that he will marry gf for the things she has done for him.</div>
