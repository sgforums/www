Or did she recently get a job?<br><br>I know you feel tired. She's leaving you hanging. However, she may be too tired with work to feel/think about Love.<br><br>Perhaps you should meet her up one day for tea, and ask her if the two of you can still be together, would she give you a chance to know her well. A bit straightforward, but that's what i would do. (Though success is quite limited). This would answer your own question.<br><br>But it does seem like she's losing her feelings for you. Perhaps if its possible, fetch her home from work? Or just meet her up once or twice a week for a chat, since she seems to be unresponsive to Smses. Meeting up is a much better idea than smsing anyways.<br><br>Hope you do well...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if she broke off with her previous bf jus to be with u, den perhaps she is having some huge questions in her mind. perhaps she's feeling gulity that she let her ex down and if she continues with u, she may be deemed unfaithful to others. ( which i agrees)<br><br>so i guess the best way forward now would be for u and her to cool down and let her decides wat she wants. no point fighting when the war has alreadi ended without u knowing it.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by yunyun:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmm...

            <div class='col-md body'>seems to me like she's purposely avoiding you. Maybe that's her answer to you. Anyways judging by her respone on short reply to yr smses or never reply at all, i guess she is already decided that she doesn't want to carry on this relationship. If she was really serious about giving you all a second chance, i feel that she's not putting in enough effort. SMSing only takes at most 1 minute and i'm sure she could afford tt time no matter what she's doing. especially with the state of yr relationship. My advice is move on bro. I'm sure you'll find the right one someday. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From my female perspective, let me tell u what I think -- MOVE ON! she is obviously not interested in u anymore!<br><br>That's how i behaved to my ex, when i wanted to break off with him, but scared that he would be angry/sad/exasperated. I avoided him. Tell him all sort of excuses like i am very busy working, or scared that he slept liao (exactly what she said to u). When finally he came to confront me, i told him that we need a break. it was more difficult for me then bcos we were together for 2 yrs. But when feelings change, it is that harsh.<br><br>it takes two to clap. come on, be a man. maybe she will respect u more.</div>
