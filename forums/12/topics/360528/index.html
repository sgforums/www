              <p>Hi guys n girls,</p>
              <p>Hai, feeling damn confused and sad. Recently, things had not been right for me these days.</p>
              <p>My wife is pregnant at the wrong time. You see, i had not had a full time job for a while, i am a freelance diver and at the same time, i do some freelance consultancy works too. The money is not that great but i love what i am doing. On the other hand, my wife and my parents kept saying what i am doing is worng and i had no money to support the family. I refuse to give in and continue to do what i love to do. No CPF, no medical benefits and inability to buy a flat is all they can say.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, i feel shitty and sad. I do not realised, the reason why i gave up my full time job is to pursue my interest, which is diving works. I gave a lot to it and had been committed to my interest. So lucky to those whom have parents and spouse to support those doing their interest for a living though it pays shit.</p>
              <p>Everyday, everyday they have been telling me the same things over and over again. It makes me very frustrated but i kept my cool. I do not argue or fight back, i just stare at them blankly. But deep down in my heart, i feel so useless as i dare not to give up my interests.</p>
              <p>These few years have been shit for me. I lost my first wife and my beautiful daughter due to my mistakes and bo chap attitude, i lost my driving liscense class 3 to class 5. I lost my favourite pet turtles. I lost my regular status in the army and had to pay liquidation damages close to 60K. I had nothing now. No savings and practically useless in all aspects of life. My freelance works get lesser and lesser.</p>
              <p>As stated earlier on, my girlfriend is pregnant, we got married. I felt that i could not give her the best of life. I felt so useless. Nobody support whatever i am doing. I try to jump but i just sat on the ledge thinking how would i look if i jump. I don't even have any balls to jump. :(</p>
              <p>Its been me and myslelf only. I brought nothing good to my family. Theres no one i can tell my feeling to except typing out to cyber mates.</p>
              <p>I wana cry.</p>

              <p>let me summarise ur post.</p>
              <p>"i wan to do what i like, but the pay is shit and i know very well i cannot support my wife and my kid. i should be getting a job that pays better, but i simply did nothing despite naggings from my wife and her family. hell, why arent they supporting me?  T.T</p>
              <p>however i feel very sad that i cannot provide her with a better life."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>u know what is shooting yourself in the foot?</p>
              <p>on one hand u refuse to go out and get a proper paying job, on the other hand u are sad that u "could not give her the best of life", "felt so useless". wtf is this?</p>
              <p>and where is the responsibility?</p>
              <p>how the hell are u going to support her and the kid when u have no money?</p>
              <p>it is ok to do what u want IF u have no responsibility.</p>
              <p>two words for u: å¦ˆçš„.</p>

              <p>Sigh!</p>
              <p>What are u going to do to sort it out?   Perhaps after going thru this you will be wise in your planning.    unless yours is an interest that allows u to earn lots of $ otherwise you are in for worry, concern.   </p>

              <p>Nothing wrong with pursuing interest.</p>
              <p>But at the same time you mustn't forget the responsibilities you have on hand.</p>
              <p>Otherwise you'll just turn out to be selfish.</p>
              <p>Jumping down the ledge and handing over your problems, as well as creating even more problems for your family? That's even worse than being selfish, frankly speaking.</p>
              <p>You cannot expect your family to support you in your interest, when you can't even support them in the first place.</p>
              <p>Rather than complaining down here about how your life sucks, why not do something more practical, such as looking for a more stable job?</p>

              <p>I would <span style="text-decoration: underline;">suggest</span> that u pursue what works for u - money is always relative, how much is good enough - also relative, as long as you are able to fulfil the basics - i feel that is alrite, as for your parents n ....  they are asking you to conform and submit to what they think - which is their projection - of what is a family or good 'husband' or  ... utter crap!</p>

              <p>ts, forget about the diving and concentrate on getting a fulltime job. you might not enjoy it but you are a husband and soon to be a father. for the second time somemore. you have responsibilities. for the sake of your family, please don't screw up. when things are stable, maybe you can dive once every couple of months or so, as a hobby.</p>

              <p>DUDE! you need RESPONSIBILITY~ do not know if i spelt it right but you understand yea.</p>
              <p>Its nice to pursue what you like but everything goes for a price and the price your paying to not give up outweighs what your giving in. Your lucky your gf is still by you right now but she won't if you continue this way much longer. Sometimes you just have to grind your teeth bite your tongue and move on. You have a child in her right now. You lost your first wife then cherish this second! make it up to yourself! BE A REAL MAN! Take Responsibility. Without it, you will be alone and no one can help you not even the big guy up there who reads his daily news of the world he create cause your not sincere and worth his time. Wake up. You should be old enough to be a man!</p>

              <p>Good to pursue your interests, but if your interests can feed you (and your family), it should just be an interest.</p>
              <p>So for you...</p>
              <p>1. Get a job... a steady, regular job... get an income.</p>
              <p>2. Look into your expense. Your expenses must be less than your income. So that you can start saving.</p>
              <p>3. Don't borrow money, unless for your house. No personal loan, no loansharks.</p>
              <p>4. Do the above for at least the next 5 years, hopefully things will be ok for you.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>Hi guys n girls,</p>
              <p>Hai, feeling damn confused and sad. Recently, things had not

              <p>My wife is pregnant at the wrong time. You see, i had not had a
              full time job for a while, i am a freelance diver and at the same
              time, i do some freelance consultancy works too. The money is not
              that great but i love what i am doing. On the other hand, my wife
              and my parents kept saying what i am doing is worng and i had no
              money to support the family. I refuse to give in and continue to do
              what i love to do. No CPF, no medical benefits and inability to buy
              a flat is all they can say.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, i feel shitty and sad. I do not realised, the reason
              why i gave up my full time job is to pursue my interest, which is
              diving works. I gave a lot to it and had been committed to my
              interest. So lucky to those whom have parents and spouse to support
              those doing their interest for a living though it pays shit.</p>
              <p>Everyday, everyday they have been telling me the same things
              over and over again. It makes me very frustrated but i kept my
              cool. I do not argue or fight back, i just stare at them blankly.
              But deep down in my heart, i feel so useless as i dare not to give
              up my interests.</p>
              <p>These few years have been shit for me. I lost my first wife and
              my beautiful daughter due to my mistakes and bo chap attitude, i
              lost my driving liscense class 3 to class 5. I lost my favourite
              pet turtles. I lost my regular status in the army and had to pay
              liquidation damages close to 60K. I had nothing now. No savings and
              practically useless in all aspects of life. My freelance works get
              lesser and lesser.</p>
              <p>As stated earlier on, my girlfriend is pregnant, we got married.
              I felt that i could not give her the best of life. I felt so
              useless. Nobody support whatever i am doing. I try to jump but i
              just sat on the ledge thinking how would i look if i jump. I don't
              even have any balls to jump. :(</p>
              <p>Its been me and myslelf only. I brought nothing good to my
              family. Theres no one i can tell my feeling to except typing out to

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000;">Hai, feeling damn
              confused and sad. Recently, things had not been right for me these
              days.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ans:
              Life are confusing at times, if things are not right for u, then
              take some time to rearrange them into the correct
              order.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000;">My wife is pregnant
              at the wrong time. You see, i had not had a full time job for a
              while, i am a freelance diver and at the same time, i do some
              freelance consultancy works too. The money is not that great but i
              love what i am doing. On the other hand, my wife and my parents
              kept saying what i am doing is wrong and i had no money to support
              the family. I refuse to give in and continue to do what i love to
              do. No CPF, no medical benefits and inability to buy a flat is all
              they can say.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ans: I
              think what they said is correct and u really have to go look for a
              full time job.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000;">Sometimes, i feel
              shitty and sad. I do not realised, the reason why i gave up my full
              time job is to pursue my interest, which is diving works. I gave a
              lot to it and had been committed to my interest. So lucky to those
              whom have parents and spouse to support those doing their interest
              for a living though it pays shit.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ans:
              Well, if your interests that u are having is not bringing in enough
              income to support u and your family then maybe u wanna make it as
              your hobby and not main your job?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000;">Everyday, everyday
              they have been telling me the same things over and over again. It
              makes me very frustrated but i kept my cool. I do not argue or
              fight back, i just stare at them blankly. But deep down in my
              heart, i feel so useless as i dare not to give up my
              interests.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ans: U
              don’t have to give up your interests just make it your secondary
              income or your hobby that all.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000;">These few years
              have been shit for me. I lost my first wife and my beautiful
              daughter due to my mistakes and bo chap attitude, i lost my driving
              liscense class 3 to class 5. I lost my favourite pet turtles. I
              lost my regular status in the army and had to pay liquidation
              damages close to 60K. I had nothing now. No savings and practically
              useless in all aspects of life. My freelance works get lesser and
              lesser.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ans:
              Forget about the milk that has already spill off from the class
              because there are all gone. Why not focus on what u want to do now
              and plan for your future?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000;">As stated earlier
              on, my girlfriend is pregnant, we got married. I felt that i could
              not give her the best of life. I felt so useless. Nobody support
              whatever i am doing. I try to jump but i just sat on the ledge
              thinking how would i look if i jump. I don't even have any balls to
              jump. :(</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ans:
              Then take some action and do sometime about it, u can work 2 jobs
              or 3 jobs and just put your interests aside at the time being. I
              believe your wife would also want to share your burdens and maybe
              she can also work and bring in some income too.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; color: #000000;">Its been me and

              can tell my feeling to except typing out to cyber mates.</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ans: So
              what u don’t wanna do something about it? Just
