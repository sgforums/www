              <p>Hi henshin,</p>
              <p>It will be hard to say in this case. One possibility will be that after what she has been through, she realise that you are really the one for her, and another possibility will be that she is taking you as a pillar of support, thus there will not be any guarantee that she will not leave you in the near future. </p>
              <p>In the first case, the feelings between the two of you will be mutual, but not so for the second case. I will not encourage you to confront her and ask her about such things though, for you may hurt her self-esteem and cause her to shun away from you.</p>
              <p>All in all, it is ultimately up to you whether you wish to give this relationship a try or not. You must understand that there is no guarantee it will work out, especially when she is only 15 years old.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi henshin,</p>
              <p>I am afraid that if you want a very truthful answer to that question, you will have to try to find it by yourself the hard way. </p>
              <p>Girls of that age are mostly still not as mature as you hope for them to be do, hence they will make mistakes at time. Thus, it is up to you whether you will wish to forgive her or not.</p>
              <p>But please do not let yourself be hurt by her repeatedly. If this relationship does not work out again, it will be highly advisable that you put a full-stop to it.  </p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>I'm going out with her some time time later, what should I do so

              <p>Hi henshin,</p>
              <p>Do you have any idea as to what topics she will be interested in? You can try talking to her using these topics. Don't worry too much, and try to be more natural.</p>
              <p>Personally, I do not think that it is a good idea to ask her such a question, but if you really want to do so, you should ask her directly instead of beating around the bush.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Before you want to ask her...you must check if you really like her....so many years have passed...you wouldn't know if you still have the chemistry that you had years ago right? You sure you still love her?</p>
              <p>I agree with the-toots, you never know what will happen in future...you never try asking you will never know...Just do it...then you will not regret when you think back...just be true to yourself...</p>
              <p>Btw don't try too hard...it will become so unnatural and then you will not be able to know how she feel also if you are so stressed...</p>
              <p>Jia you!</p>
