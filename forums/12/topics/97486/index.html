If she thinks the guy is a pain in the a** then yeah, it would bother her<br><br>2) Well, if it is those cute forwarded sms greetings, tendancy to ignore is high, if not she may respond out of courtesy.<br><br>3) No.<br><br>4) It can be anything. Some girls are friendly, some reply coz its only polite, friendship etc etc<br><br>5) This can be tricky. It may be or may not. Though tendancy is that she does like the guy to a certain extend</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I got another morning greeting sms from her again early(5am) this morning. This makes it the 50th sms I gotten from her since we start exchanging sms about 1 month ago. I don't think I ever got that much sms from a single person in a month before? Granted most are gd morning, nite and day greeting with some 'miss you' sms mixed in. But is this normal? She seems to be sending me more sms than I am.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i presumed u like this gal. From my point of view, I think this gal is trying to capture your attention. She is playing hard to get!!! See, the moment you stopped sms-ing her as much, she comes back to you. Some gals are like that. If you really like her, just tell her straight in the face, go straight to the point. Don't dilly dally here and there. If she is really meant to be yours, you don't need 50 sms-es to win her heart...<br><br>P.S : Juz my 2 cents worth of opinion  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
