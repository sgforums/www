              <p>It feels shitty, because after it, you'll be pondering day in day out, if its right or wrong, why you did it, why he did it, blah blah blah, lots of questions go thru your head till it hurts.

              <p>Last time in school we used to have fight night. I have gotten into couple of brawls because I didn't want to pay protection money. What is it like?</p>
              <p>Your heartbeat beats faster and faster, you lose control of yourself, you get heated up and your heart feels like it wants to explode. Only trouble is, when you fight with somebody stronger than you, than the fear start to engulf your whole body and makes you want to surrender. If you win over somebody weaker than you, you feel remorse, regret and the fear the person may report you to the principal. That is a one to one fight.</p>
              <p>If you get into a three against you fight, that is the most scariest feeling. You could get hurt. Last time, I ran for my life. Luckily I got my own gang in school, we got parang and machete, nobody dare to disturb us.</p>

              trouble should I really get into a fight. It definitely wouldn't be
              worth it if I ended up in court just because I lost my temper.</p>
              <p>But, dumb as it may sound... sometimes I wish I actually got
              into the fight. It feels like when I go home then I think of the
              situation, I get angry again, thinking that the person who insulted
              me got away with it and "won".</p>
              <p>Sometimes it even feels like I am losing in life just cause I am
              doing the sensible and right thing.</p>
              <p>So yup, I am really just wondering, what is it like to get into
              a fight, to really lose yourself and explode at someone instead of
              controlling. I would love to hear anyone's opinions and experience,
              whether you actually got into a fight before or not.</p>
              <p>Thanks</p>

              <p>or ppl punch u hit the correct spot in ur eye? and leave u blind in one eye or maybe two? u can't see u parents ur kids grand children? u want?</p>
              <p>or u punch that person? he got in to a coma? u get guilty for rest of ur life? u regretted what u have done? can't go on with ur life? live ur life on alcohol and drugs? is that what u want?</p>
              <p>Or like that slashing case?? u DID NOT KNOW u would kill some one? and spent months in prison waiting for death row? is that what u want??</p>
              <p>stop being foolish and stop watch all those kung fu,chan hoe nam movies. all fake. gangster?? all fake! if really following a gang can survive in singapore? all those lau pui lang no need to work already.</p>
