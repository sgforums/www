            <div class='col-md body'>Well technically to avoid is the best way to relieve the situation.  I did the same thing too but you must be sure that she may be offended in due course coz that's what happened to me.<br><br>Now she's gone for good coz i missed her calls &amp; not replying to sms for too many times &amp; not stating the reason.  They will want to know the reason for your avoidance later on but are you planning to reveal?  If not, prepare for this friendship/relationship/attraction to end.</div>

Stay away from her since you know you might fall for her. Whatsmore, she going thru divorce herself. Are you in a r/s or married or single?<br><br>Be cordial, friendly... Can offer some simple advice small talk. But don't get too personal. You might really want to stay off the msn talk... Be more on away mode.. reply to her less.. slower, less words<br><br>Only when this mess is over and she is more stable.. you might want to resume your warm friendship with her.<br><br>I tell u man, when women go thru breakup/divorce... any other guy is like Brad Pitt compared to her present one. It's nice to be treated so well, that women are willing to talk to us deeply n share so much, but SO fast. It's called on the rebound.<br><br>A divorce is sure messy, no point making it any messier by getting involved.<br><br>=)</div>
