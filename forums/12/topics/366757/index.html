              just joined this big company on 24-June. My department however has only a few people, M &amp; S &amp; W. Btw, on same day another lady,K, also joined. Her position was senior Executive. Mine was Executive. We were actually quite excited to rebuild the department which was in chaos and crumbling. Messy, no system and no goverment.
              
              MXXXX (HR assistant)
              --
              from 1st day of work,K and i had been told to get rid of this woman. I was abit uneasy as i could not understand why at first. So, i suggested to K to give M more time. Maybe she would work better with us as a new team. Plus, she was 52 and married with mother to support. BUT by this week i already understood why management wanted her out so much.
              1) extremely rude to everyone
              2) Lazy (important documents and work from 2008 was found in her drawer, undone and unfiled. Before,whenever asked for this documents she would say she dunno.
              3) Cannot handle the simplest tasks. Does work halfway. The other half she does definately mess up.
              4)M.C queen
              5)dresses like she goes to market.
              6) Creates unrest by spreading rumours
              7) Has excuses for every every every single thing. Ask her why she did not do something she will say its cause of S,X, 123 or whoever she can think of. Ask her why she did not pack the uniforms, she says its the delivery guys fault! Caught sending resume to other company she says W ask her to!
              8) Does not understand a single thing about HR and got the job due to W, her friend.
              
              ********** We fired M yesterday. No choice, she had not a single good point that we can think of.
              
              W (Senior HR Exe)
              --
              She was leaving, thus K was hired to replace her. She left on 25-June. From the way her work was done, she seems to be a horrible employee too. Messy, unprofessional, work all also half done.
              
              S (HR Exe)
              --
              The person that i was hired to replace. From day 1 that i started work, she has refused to handover ANY work to me or teach me anything, Ask general manager but she did not speak up for me (S is her ''pet''. FINE, since S does not want to hand me anywork, i believe i can handle it when she goes. BUT now they say her last day date is unconfirmed! And both me and K have not gotten any letter of appointment despite chasing for it.
              
              K (new Senior Staff)
              --
              She is a quite nice lady. However, today i realised she has been taking credit for some work i done for her. I can sense she sees me as a threat even though her rank higher than me. But actually I am a 'may the best man win' type of person.
              
              Management
              --
              K and i have real plans and drive to tidy up the whole mess but apparently management does not share this goal. I feel very unattached to the company, like a second class citizen
              Should i resign? DO you think i was juzt hired while S or management makes the decision about her resignation? S's work also sucks, btw.

              <p>Wa, why sound like some drama synopsis de.... Or an extract from some RPG de guidebook.... haha...</p>
              <p>I think ah, just make sure you yourself are not like them can le lo. For now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>'Messy, no system and no goverment.'</strong></p>
              <p>If your co-workers really like that ah then no surprise about the state of the department le. But for all the bad points.... should be got 1 or 2 good de ba?  o.O</p>
              <p>If management not motivated, bo bian. Best you guys can do is motivate yourselves, and do your best and work under the limits of what is allowed.</p>
              <p>Example: During WW2 when the Germans were attacking west, Hitler initially did not allow his forces to go beyond a certain point of Northern France. Some generals knew this would make them lose momentum of attack, took their own initiative and negotiated, and were finally allowed 'reconnaissance in force', in which they could at least bring a significant amount of troops forward, and in practice they used that to continue their assault towards the English Channel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, stay in your job for now. <strong>Times are bad</strong>, as Mr. Charlize loves to say. Just don't do all those undesirable stuff you listed.</p>
              <p>And try to see some good points in your co-workers, as well as try see the goal of the management.  =)<br>See bad point only, will super sian de.</p>

              hmmm, M's good points? **thinks for 1 hour**
              that her complexion is good? No , seriously, she is the worst staff anyone can get and the most 'no value'one. Let me out it this way, she leaves every single task dangling and when we try to help her out she curses at us. She is used to the messy no goverment dept where she is free to drink coffee and send resume then go home at 5pm.
              She caused disharmony by spreadingf lies about everyone. Then she goes to complain that the workplace very political when actually all politics come from her alone. We pass her a simple task to do at 9am. At 3pm not done AT ALL.ask her why never do A, she says cos she busy doing B. We check B, not touched at all. Ask her why never do C, she says she busy answering masive phonecalls. Excuse me, the dept phone rings less than 5 times daily!
              Fine, we give up and her work is given to me and K, leaving her with 1 or 2 job duties only. Still not done! My goodness, luckily she has gone far far away. I think the next company who hire her most prob did the worst thing ever.
              Not Even one single thing she does well. Her busiest tasks are gossiping, drinking coffee and acting busy. SO relieved to see her gone. btw, after being sacked she sms my C.O.O a threat asking him to be careful.

                  well,i am as puzzled as u are. Problem is,the person that is drawing out my letter of appointment is the G.M herself..And since i already rushed her a few times and she does not react i have no choice. As for salary, no worries as i got mine with payslip for June.Its a big corp so they would not play play with such things. Only thing is their system is all cock up now. No Letter of appointment also good, cos if i decide to leave i can leave anytime.

              <p><br>she has been given MANY MANY chances! She was supposed to be sacked long time ago but each time she was given a chance cos she was old. Read my post carefully. YOU wanna teach ME how to be a HR? lol, go study more 1st lah. Good for you that you are soooo kind hearted wor BUT thats precisely why you won't fare well in HR. Gettit? We run a business NOT a charity home. Cannot perform, out you go. Transfer her to other dept? I had that idea at first but know what my boss says which is so true? <span style="color: #ff00ff;">Why transfer shit to elsewhere? Why transfer trouble to other dept colleagues? If even Simple things like filing, answering calls she can't handle, we are doing medical ,what if she gets transfered to frontline and dispenses WRONG medicine? Think in big picture,kid.</span> She got in this job through luck, her frn SW. Based on herself she would not have even got ONE foot in our organization. At least go get a masters in HR before you are even fit to talk to me abhout HR. Lol man.</p>
