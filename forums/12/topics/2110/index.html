To add, you're glad that you're happy with your current bf? Not to throw a wet blanket on you... But you'll never know when the next wave would hit you again in life..... Like Bear has said... Learn to let go of this one, and you'll learn to let go of the next one better... If this 'jerk' has taken up much precious time of your life and contributed much pain to your self... DON'T top up to that effect by wasting your stress hormones on him anymore... In life you LEARN... If NOT, you'll be TAUGHT AGAIN....<br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Joanne,<br><br>agreeing to wat Zizi has mention, hatred is not something that u can control, it's just like ur love for ur bf.. it's a feeling erupt from deep within. Maybe the sight of ur ex has provoke the hatred that u had for him. It's just like a volcano. once it has erupted it just let out. u have controlled it deep within u since the day u left ur ex. but it was never let out. Or maybe for a long time it has never let out. It just have to blow someday. But once it's out think u will feel better, and slowly it will subside and be forgotten..<br><br>For ur bf, I think it's will be a nice time to know more abt and u and ur past also. U already mention that he doesn't understand y u start to feel this way. So it means both of u still have some differences, hence this incident can bring both of u closer...<br><br>I know that ur bf should try to understand u esp when u r in this kind fo senario, but I hope can understand ur bf as well, coz for many pple tell u not to hate him, not to be angry and being by ur side is signs to show that he cares.. Maybe wat u want is hug, but wat he gives is a shoulder. Not many will know wat to do.. He is trying his best to know u.. to understand u.. to see in and thru ur eyes... Maybe wif a little mroe hint and a little push or pull he will be able to see the same light as u... it's all part of learning to be together.<br><br>Hatred is something u cannot control... but will evolve and sub-side in due time. it means how much effort u placed... but it's all over... time did lessen the pain.. it took away some of the hurt... but I know that some things still boils inside... I can't tell u forget it, coz if u want u would have, anyone would have... but humans can't do it over-night. I would say hate him for all u care if u feel like it. he hurt u badly... but I hope u will tell urself to hate him less as each day goes by. And I hope u wun fall out wif ur bf becoz u feel that ur bf can't feel for u in this situation. Coz in this situation, one can't really think that rationally all the time. Sometimes, for few minutes, put urself in his shoes.<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)

            <div class='col-md body'>Too many people spend their lives living in the past and letting it dictate their present and future. let the past go, joanne.<br><br>Life is all about choices. When a bad situation happen, we can choose to be upset by it or choose to stay joyful in spite of it. You can't control the external circumstances but you can control yourself.<br>You can make a choice to stay strong and joyful in spite of the worst situation, that is a privilege God has given you.<br>Likewise, what he has done cannot be undone. True enough you might be hurt but is that going to determine your present and future path? you have the choice not to hate him but instead forgive him.<br><br>People hold hatred and bitterness in their hearts but they do not realise the one they are hurting the most is themselves. If you hate another person in life, everytime you see that person, you are going to get affected. As well break free of the bondage and forgive the person. Give yourself and the other party to move on in life.<br><br>Try not to let all the hurt and bitterness you had to flow into your present relationship. Give yourself a chance to be loved again.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Quarrelling is rather common among couples esp for marriage couples. The essence of it probably lies in the decision to stay together despite the differences.<br>Similiarities bring attractions and Differences makes life interesting.<br><br>Love is a servant of your will and not a victim to your emotions. In short, Love is a choice you make.<br><br>As regards to the insecurities you feel about ur bf's ex, that is nothing we can  do. It's up to you to trust him or not to.<br><br>In fact, i am wondering how come both of you got together when you two haven't got over your exs. Is this merely for emotional dependency? or to fill up the emotional vacancy the previous one have left behind?<br><br></div>
