I like things that are cold.. Like ice cream, and also iced char siew pao.. ha aha.. Yupz.. I do eat them.. he heee.. Hmm too bad can't get u to ry the apple shrudel, this time, maybe the next time I guess.. Maybe when u r back in June?? or something like that... still got plenty of chances...<br><br>Can understand lahz.. though many of us youngsters say that may not  say that we will be missing home, but in our hearts we all know that it's something of importance to us... It's like 2 different feelings. Friends gif u some sort of happiness, while family give u another sort of warmth. Both can't be mixed or replaced. Hmm... think I'll be facign the same prob in another half a yr down the road.<br><br>Wahz.. triple sci... smart ger lehz... me toopid guy.. he ehee.. Pple dun generally like?? as in attitude, it will be AC. In academic, will be SR. in principal will be SA. For subject like physics will be JJ. For not having fun will be NJ. for a trying to compete is AJ. hmm so many... but think students all the same lahz. every sch got some weird weird pple and the news gets spread ard. u lehz?? which JC??<br><br>IN my JC I think bright rm or dark rm, we still sleep... sometimes really cannot tahan the tiredness of not sleeping the night before. I sleep at 2-3 every night and had to wake up at 530 to go sch. sometimes also dun get to sleep. BUt I know of someone who travels back and forth from M'sia every day just to go sch.. I'm really impressed by her determination and perservarence.<br><br>Need not hurry to get online lahz.. settle ur things down first.. smell ur rm a little bit, see still the same or not... relax a bit first lahz. this forum will be here.. wunrun away fr u.. hee hee. and all of us will be here too... Most impt is u staudy hard for ur examz... and take good care of urself.. We will miss you... so wun run away...<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br><br>[This message has been edited by Bear (edited 07 January 2001).]</div>
