We all have different aspects in life that greatly matter to us. Some people long for imperfect-someone-but-perfect-relationship. Some people feel that their destiny in life lies in the high altitude this career could probably levitate them. Some people seek for all the knowledge in life. Some people believe that God is everything to them... and the list goes on. When you try to judge which is more important, you are like asking '<span style="font-style: italic;">...the arms or the legs, which is more important</span>?'<br><br>In fact, they are equally as important because each of these complements other aspects in your life. You could excel in either one of these aspects (say career), but terribly sucked at the other (say relationship), in the end, your fulfilment in life is so much less than one with average career and 'average'-relationship.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> What's the use of having strong arms but frail legs?<br><br>Generally speaking, sentimental signs like Cancer and Pisces would probably value relationship more than other signs. Signs like Capricorn will probably feel that career is VERY important... probably outweigh that of a relationship.<br><br>God is usually fair enough to reimburse our flaws with other talents, so when we decide to work hard on this talent, many times, we unconsciously forgo the effort to improve on our negativity. Over the years, this negativity flare up and because our confidence lies so much in our strength, our mind attempt to 'substitute' our strength onto our flaws, reassuring ourselves of our esteem and self identity. Then, we become fearful of our own flaws because we are so successful in whichever area of life our talent has brought the good harvest, that when we are brought back to reality through our weakness, we are unable to accept it consciously.<br><br>E.g.<br><br>This rich old man will never accept the fact that he has wrecked personality leading to wrecked relationship. Or a lack of family bonding, leading to family feud. He could probably own the world, yet unable to conquer the realm of relationship... of all levels. It is difficult for him to reverse this trend as it is easier for him (and his mind) to employ the superiority of his monetary richness to compensate whatever failed relationship he has with his love ones.<br><br>'You got a screwed up love life...'<br><br>'Fcuk you! I got money and you don't!'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Many lady friends of mine nowadays are strong, independent career women, &amp; don't need a guy to take care of them financially.  They take pride in the fact that they can afford the things they need.  What they expect though, is loyalty &amp; emotional/mental support from their loved ones.<br><br>Ironically, they've met guys who don't like the fact that my friends are independent, or they just haven't found the guy who'll provide the emotional/mental support.<br><br>To me, providing financial support is easy.  But believe it or Not, finding someone who'll provide the emotional/mental support is damn difficult.  People give up on relationships too easily nowadays.

On a more superficial side, it has become an emotional support for them. With the constant rise of woman getting more and more independant, the guys (or at least a portion of them) will feel threaten of their role being overpowered.<br><br>I'm speaking on some but not all. Woman, when a guy is strong, they'll say he's MCP, trying to control their lives and don't respect woman. When a guy is gentle, gives in to the gf, blah blah blah, woman will say that they are weak. Can't depend on them for emotional support and blah blah blah.<br><br>Megatron, what I'm trying to say is, in this time now when a friendship/rs don't work out it's not necessary just the guys fault. Sometimes girls don't realised what they did either.<br><br>I used to have a gf who had an affair behind my back and I found out and initiate to leave the r/s in peace and told her that I realised we aren't meant for each other but I never did tell her that I found out about her affair. The next thing I know is she slapped me right across the face and accused me of having an affair behind her back and constantly goes out to flirt with other girls. And before I can say anything, it seemed that my whole lot of friends and her friends kinda got this thinking that I've been unfaithful to her.<br><br>So tell me, was it wrong of me to use that excuse to break off with her and still considerate enough to seal her misbehaviour inside my heart where it's bleeding?<br><br>But I do have to agree that some man are simply just jerks who will think of anything just to hide their own ugly misdeed but so does woman at times.</div>
