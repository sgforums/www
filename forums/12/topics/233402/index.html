            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is a place of law and order and I am proud to boost to my China friends (PRC) whenever I am in China or else where overseas to whoever wanted to come to Singapore.<br><br>But this incident that happen upon my relative (my wife cousin) who he is working under Work Permit (WP) since last year Jun06 left me speechless and amazed.<br><br>On 301006, he was attacked by his fellow colleague (attacker) in his company provided 5room HDB flat in the west. It was a case of switching on the room light at 12midnight shortly after visiting his relatives (me) at the east side of the island. The attacker was not happy and told him to switch off the light but he could not as he was changing. The attacker dashed out of the room and took a metal rod to attack him. The attacker poked him first time in the stomach and the second time he managed to block with his right elbow and sustained a deep cut. Later he was hit several times on his body. The two room mates helped to pull the attacker away from him.<br><br>I guessed it is understandable that since the company arranged to have 4 workers to live in 1room, there could be some arguments (as all are from different parts of china). The 3 bedrooms are all having 4 workers in a room. Seem a bit too many, I guessed HDB must have some agreement with the company (I thought there is some standard for how many can go in a room?) He was badly injured; my wife and I arrived shortly at the place.<br><br>We went to NUH and a policeman approached him at the incoming, and we told the police about the incident.<br><br>Well, after the attacker has been arrested, my cousin heard that the attacker was jailed for 3 months or so and only last 2 weeks been sent back to China.<br><br>On late afternoon (2-3pm) 220107, my cousin company decided to send him back based on a Termination letter statement from the company HR comments: “You have committed gross misconduct by engaging in a fight with fellow colleague on 301006 which warrants dismissal. As such, the company has decided to terminate your service on 220107 and repatriate you back to China.” And this was his only letter and final written warning without any investigation done on the company part with him as he recalled (a decision without calling for witnesses and victim?).<br><br>He was later send to the Airport back to china by his Job Agency who actually using the excuse that he was to be relocate to another Flat. My family was puzzled why the company and Job Agency did not discuss this with him since he was the victim?<br><br>My wife and I reached the airport and asked the reason but we did not see any investigation report done by the company since they claimed he was at fault (for switching on the lights?).<br><br>We were told he was to buy his own air ticket and the Job Agency wanted him to sign the agreement so that it will be deduce from his pay later. Since company pay the accommodation, he had to sign to pay for the electrical bills also which is strange.<br><br>We told the agent as he had no money and no clothes (now China is below 0 degree), thus he must go to buy some winter clothing .We went back to my place in Tampines and my family happened to see and asked an official from Mr. Mah Boh Tan office about this sort of case. I was referred to the police station as there is a Special Permit that can be extended for a Work Permit holder who has been cancelled or else he will be consider as an illegal immigrant . Later the police in Tampines east refer us to ICA, and ICA said that they can not do the extension in the airport and we were referred to the MOM, but only next morning. He had no choice but to go back to china.<br><br>231007, arriving at MOM, we were told that the report could only be filed by the person involved and it must be done within 1month or there will be no case. The person must write and might have to come back to make his case.<br><br>All these to me seem like no one is actually taking care of WP holder rights, can anyone pls….. HELP. Sadly to say, if anyone who faced such treatment with no money and clothing and being send back, this is so easy money. As Job Agency fee charged around S$7-8k and no protection for WP pass, it is so lowly regarded by company nowadays?<br><br>Regards<br>limks</div>
