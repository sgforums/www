              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by TheMissus:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I feel extremely miserable at work. I really dislike my bosses
              and do not respect a single one of them. I generally despise the
              people in my workplace (both bosses and co-workers), except for a
              few whom I do not despise.</p>
              <p>First, some, not all of my co-workers are very good at wayang
              and deflecting arrows. Recently we are made to do more work, but
              with the same manpower capabilities. This has resulted in some
              unhappiness, because of the increased work, and some people like to
              wayang and come up with excuses not to work, leaving those who get
              arrowed feeling upset and aggrieved.</p>
              <p>Secondly, actually even before the series of 'changes', I have
              already felt unhappy. I pressed on because I thought things were
              more bearable then. And I also told myself that for the 1st time in
              my life, I want to overcome challenges I face instead of taking the
              easy way out ie to quit.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, I feel unfairly treated and hard done by. No matter how
              hard I try, I feel that the people here treat me meanly. When I do
              things right or what I think is right eg volunteering to take on
              arrow, taking on arrow even though I already have another arrow for
              the same day or voicing proactively to my superiors about areas of
              work I'm interested in, I either don't receive any appreciation or
              do not get a positive outcome from my 'feedback'. I am so sick and
              tired of striving and striving and not getting any 'rewards' or
              recognition. Instead all I get is flak, and the feedback that I am
              not good enough, or that I should be doing more more more.</p>
              <p>When I do certain things, I get unfair treatment that other
              people do not get when they do or say the same thing. i am
              generally very sick and tired of this place and have tried to tell
              my husband about how I feel.</p>
              <p>He told me that I'm just being a spoilt brat, and that if I quit
              before i find another job, I will end up regreting because I will
              lose my constant flow of income coming in every month, and will not
              have $$$ to buy stocks which I like to buy. he also said about how
              our combined income will be affected blah blah, even though I feel
              what he's earning now is enough to cover our expenses.</p>
              <p>Our finances will be tighter, compared to if I was working, but
              we certainly won't starve despite our relatively high expenses
              because he makes $120k per year including bonuses though he's under
              30 and my annual salary is only about 1/2 of his. Every mth, I only
              take home a miserable $3k+ after CPF deductions, but he said that
              if I dun work, then I won't have any incoming CPF contributions and
              my CPF contribution also goes toward paying for our home along with
              his. However I do have spare funds, and including stocks have about
              $30K that can tide us through my share of contribution to the
              family expense, while he will also continue working.</p>
              <p>I know that now that I'm a married lady I should be responsible
              and cannot just quit like this. But I really feel awful and
              miserable everyday. I think i am slinking into depression every min
              I stay in this job. I find myself whining and complaining to my
              colleagues everyday and either hating my superiors and feeling
              peeved with some of my co-workers (who wayang) or just generally
              hating my situation.</p>
              <p>In any case, judging by how things are faring, even I die die
              thick skin stay on, my career also won't progress far since my
              superiors clearly don't have a good opinion of me. And so there's
              no future for me here anyhow. I have told my hubby this before, and
              he told me why am i so lousy and asked me not to give up and said
              even if I want to stop working eventually some day when we have
              kids, I'd surely want to achieve something for myself and leave my
              mark.</p>
              <p>I am really at a loss now. I dunno what to do. I pray to God but
              it seems that God does not care about me or my pain and does not
              hear me or God does hear me but can't be bothered.</p>

              <p>Actually I tell my wife the same thing, that ladies must be self-sufficient, and should be able to carve up her own career. Not that I am not earning well (earning much more here than in SG), and not that I want to make my wife suffer, but I always feel that the moment one stops work, one tends to lose touch with trends and society, and starts to get sloppy with one's own way of living.</p>
              <p>For your case, I would recommend a change in mentality in the period you have to endure in that company. One lady pal of mine just went into switch off mode and only do what is necessary, before she jumped ship to a new job.</p>
              <p>Be patient in job hunting. It's not easy these days coz of the job market. So, most importantly is how you face off the everyday unhappiness in your current job (it's JUST work... nothing impt in life)</p>
              <p>Good luck, lady.</p>

              <p>Hi TheMissus,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I sympathise with your plight and would like to put my 2c forward.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1.     First off I feel that in a working environment it's not always who works the hardest moves the fastest. I believe it's also to do with how well you gel with your boss/colleauges. Now I'm not suggesting you change your personality to accomodate them but it is a viable option and in a working environment all too many times it is the wiser to be a hypocrite.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2.    I understand that you are trying to live up to your husbands expectations but the emotional support from him at this time would be most welcome. However put it through that you don't want to quit but it is a hard time for yourself. Emotional support at this time would be most comforting and I believe would actually help you meet the next day with renewed vigor. i.e. " I don't want to quit but my job is so stressful and taking a toll on me." Him saying you are lousy is not acceptable...."Just tell him nicely that you are trying to fight on and here you are telling me I'm lousy.... does he think you want to quit and lose the income? You are I'm guessing an ambitious woman and that would be the last thing I think you would want. Just tell him I'm trying to struggle through it and some family support would be good and not just think of the $."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3.    Once you have the emotional support from your husband ... that should balance your feelings and you should be able to clearly/sensibly address the outside issues you have at work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4.    This is actually a question ( I hope im not sexist) .... is yr boss/colleagues mostly guys? female?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Kind Regards</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>why would you assume that?</p>
              <p>anyways i'm in the private sector, not civil service.</p>
              <p>and to be honest, its shit pay really. i'm already in my late
              20s, going on to my 30s soon and my take home is only $3.3k..after
              slogging like a bull. my hubby makes more than double that. sad
              really. and its been a few wks since I applied and not a single
              company/agency has contacted me.</p>
              <p>Today I received a call on my hp which was an unlisted number
              and I was excited for awhile thinking it was a call to go for
              interview but it was a telemarketer from a bank. Irritated.</p>

              <p>Some regulars in the civil service take home a lesser pay than yours and 3.3 k is already good for current economic condition.</p>
