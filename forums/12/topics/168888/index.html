I don't even think she treats you as friend. Just that when she needed someone to console her, you are there. At that point she only need someone to console her and it just happen to be you.<br><br>It has nothing to do with you being a pest or not. I'm not trying to be mean, but then if she doesn't like you, no matter what you do it'll just annoy her more.<br><br><strong><blockquote>all i want now is for her to b happy n cheerful even at the  expense of yet another hearbreak for me</blockquote></strong><br><br>If that is what you really want for her, then leave her alone.
