You are as capable a human being as any other person here.<br><br>The problem lies with YOU.<br><br>There are only 2 roles in any hostile situation. The Aggressor and the Victim.<br><br>You choose to be the Victim.<br><br>Forumers here are posting suggestions to aid you. You kept giving reasons that they're not-workable. Think about it.<br><br>If you continue to see yourself as a Victim, no suggestions here or any in self help books can help you.<br><br>I'm sure that person don't have issues with everyone in the office, only some. I'm sure that person don't "bullies" everyone equally bad. And if you look hard enough, those who don't get bullied are people who can and will stand their ground, if their lines are crossed.<br><br>Imagine today you are the boss. Standing in front of you are two of your staff. Both did a very bad job in a project you tasked them. You are boiling with anger. Would you scold the first staff more,(who will calmly admit his mistake), OR would you scold the second staff more (who will shiver, tremble, looks very scare of you)?<br><br>If you choose to be a Victim, naturally you'll attract more "bullies", more "aggressors" in your life, unless of course you choose to be a firmer person.<br><br>I'm sure your "Victim" attitude applys not only in your work, but also in your outside life.<br><br>Do you do anything at all when the person in front of you let his friend cut into the queue? Fumed angrily inside?<br><br></div></blockquote>how to be firmer, fierce i am not used to scolding anyone or shouting, yelling bringing down the morale, they r bitches, whtat is why they can shout, yell and swear, but me, i normally don't do that, do i hv to do that? i am not ready yet, it is so shame not able to control myself. i've not reach that level yet, i do hope it will happen. i don't know why i hate that bully, each time hear her voice, make my hair stand. and is stressing me.how not to be victim of bully? is it to show dog face?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi TS, I am still not quite sure why you are being dominated by her, since both of you have equal standing in the office.<br><br>I know how you feel when people scream their heads at you. You are too kind to shout back and shouting back does not seem your kind of personality.<br>True ladies dun act like mad dogs.<br><br>Anyway, when she shout at you , wun ur colleagues look at her or no one stands up for you or smthg? That is really weird.<br><br>You dun have to listen to her actually. Just ignore .Anyway, quitting your job over this person is definately not worth it. Esp your boss also dun reali care.<br><br>Im more jialat ar. Im <strong>working and living</strong> with this girl i super cannot clique. Buay tahan.. but how? we're overseas for training and we have not been talking or comin to work together..  We are like.. bad terms until so jialat.<br>Im okie with not talking to her, but im just worried my boss will be unhappy that we are on bad terms. See.. i wan to ignore her also have my worries ar.<br><br>So as long as your boss cant be bothered , den U just start ignoring her. Treat her as INVIsible.. smile! anyway you only see her durin office hrs ma..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey alba,<br>You're not alone there.  I am in the same situation at the moment.... the worse thing is the ranking is different.  The person is my new project manager.  Ever since she came on board, we had 4 resignations.<br><br>In a way, I have been considering to resign too but hey, why should I?  I will play along until I think there's no more opportunity for me in the company.<br><br>Everywhere you go, there will always be people like that.  Don't let them make you lose a good job with good opportunity.<br><br>In your situation, since she's not your boss, just stand up for yourself.  Ignore her, let her bark like a mad dog as much as she wants.  When people start ignoring her and stop giving in to her "command", she will soon learn to shut up.<br><br>All the best there and cheer up eh!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
