I am in the same situation at the moment.... the worse thing is the ranking is different.  The person is my new project manager.  Ever since she came on board, we had 4 resignations.<br><br>In a way, I have been considering to resign too but hey, why should I?  I will play along until I think there's no more opportunity for me in the company.<br><br>Everywhere you go, there will always be people like that.  Don't let them make you lose a good job with good opportunity.<br><br>In your situation, since she's not your boss, just stand up for yourself.  Ignore her, let her bark like a mad dog as much as she wants.  When people start ignoring her and stop giving in to her "command", she will soon learn to shut up.<br><br>All the best there and cheer up eh!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>yeah she is so irritating , she disturb u, ask u to do things for her that she thinks she is the almightly one, she feel everybody is so scared and afraid of her, i just don't want to cos trouble or stir, so everybody gives alot of in to her, so she is hard headed now. she seem to get off, awaay with all her bad doing, even no one can say anything, wat am i suppose</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the reason i wish to resign is becos just can't stand the bully. if only she keep quiet and leave us alone or just don't bother it is fine, i can forget,but she is like a ....hauting every moment, and make u feel so angry by asking to do her things when u just dont want to look at her and just don't wish to hv anything to do with her, and got to do for her actually it is a help but to her it is a must.i don't understand everyone seem to give her too much face and way. that is the problem. do u undersrtnad when u work together but u just feel so stress when tat ...is nearby, u just lost your mood, focus to do your work, no peace.</div>
