            <div class='col-md body'>Well... I certainly cannot disagree with those who answered you and strongly recommend you to break up with him, but I rather not tell you what to do. You decide what you do.<br><br>What I can tell you... or rather, ASK you is: What is your reason for being with him initially? Do you still hold to that same reason now?<br><br>Did you know him to be 'not so devoted' before you decided to date with him? If you cannot bring yourself to trust him, how about trusting yourself? Trust your own decisions?<br><br>Supposedly you 'break up' with him. How can you make sure that in the future, the person you date with will not do this to you?<br><br>Will you instead hang on to this relationship and 'guide' him back to be 100% devoted to you?<br><br>How about your friends? Your parents? Someone you know pretty well? Does anyone of them encountered this? Why not consult them and ask for their opinions too?</div>

In r/s both must put in effort. Yes is not good to advise for a break out, end of the day anybody have r/s can only decide themself whether to continue or not. But doesn't mean those who suggest break off never gone through all this. In the end wasting their youth in the jerk is what u wanna to see on TS or whoever in this situation? Base on case to case, IQ and EQ do play apart in r/s, but if TS is smart enough she should know what to do. Then she no need yr help liao.</div>
