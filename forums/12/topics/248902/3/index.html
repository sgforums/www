Then again it could be a personality thing. Some of us are just a tad more careless with these things.<br><br>That isn't the real issue here. Try not to forgive betrayal even if it's biological (for men to enjoy sexual pleasures without emotions) because in this case, when your man sleeps with another behind your back (repeatedly) this means he thinks you, as a woman, is willing to put up with shit.<br><br>And when you put up with shit, you can forget about him ever respecting you as a woman.<br><br>Having said that, you probably dig him too much for your own good. The way I see it, there are 3 ways out of this solution:<br><br>Make him pay you for the sex and tell him to find someone else for the affection and loving you have been showering him with.<br><br>(Please don't begin moralizing strongly against this idea, this is just my opinion because she needs 3 things, gifts, sex and affection and with his limited resources, endlessSorrow might as well get away with just 2 and be pleasantly surprised at how well reverse psychology works on jerks like him)<br><br>Sit him down and let him know your thoughts as a woman. Like any other female on earth, you can only be in a relationship with him and get physical knowing it is monogamous. Think about how much risk he is putting you in. Emotional, physical and mental. If he refuses, leave him. If he pays you lip service (no pun intended) but your gut tells you other wise, leave him.<br><br>If I were you, I would tell him that I need some space to think it over. Go traveling with my girlfriends, hook up a beautiful vacation fling. Come back feeling life is very beautiful and then leave him. There will always be another guy around the corner.<br><br>What's important is your level of comfort as a woman. Knowing what you want and being unafraid of wanting what is only fair. Some men cannot be changed. If it is in his nature to sleep around, don't sit it out hoping he will stop because he never will and it ain't your problem. The most relationship anyone must firstly have is the one with themselves. Cheer up.<br><br></div>
