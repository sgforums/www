I still love you.<br><br>So in this case, TS, I can understand why you are so adament about letting go of the relationship. Because you believe your man still loves you, therefore he did not leave you.<br><br>But will a man who truly loves his partner do such hurtful things and expect to be forgiven with the word "fling" and a big present  ??? I see it purely as manipulation. And some women LIKES being manipulated.<br><br>So TS, ..perhaps you are not good enough for your bf, that's why he is seeking pleasure else where.<br><br>My suggestion to many people is , find a partner that is COMPATIBLE.<br><br>Do you think you and your partner is compatible ???<br><br></div>
