But my best fren did talk to me and counsel me, the other fren does not know about tis but will try to spend more time with her.<br><br>4. spend more money shopping, to relieve my boredom,  i shop out of frustration but always spend within my limits'<br><br>5. try to call my husband more often but often the conversation wld turn to me saying "so when u want to come back" and we wld end up arguing (sigh...)<br><br>hope to hear more of your valued opinions, really appreciate everyone here</span></div>

He doesn't represent a man who can substitute your current one and you know it, instead, <strong>he deeply reflects on what you are missing</strong>; the voids in your life which you could not fill through money, your current marriage and life.

Like mentioned before, loneliness drives you on. There are no rules in the game of love - even if you are married, it doesn't matter. I urge you to come clean with yourself, understand the loopholes in your emotions and acknowledge them. Find ways to repair what you didn't knew that was damaged previously, even if it could mean some form of sacrifice on your part. You know yourself best - time change, people change.

Will anyone be willing to fight and uphold the marriage?<br><br>***<br><br>C|oUdiSm states that a woman with successful career drains her much more than a man in the same position. Why? Because this woman used much of her masculine energy in the day, having to command her workers, decision to make and all the other thingy that requires the intense output from her to keep her 'there'. When the day pass and night falls, the drained woman comes home and automatically, feminine energy revert and she would definitely desire much love, attention and everything else that a woman deserve in a relationship for security, protection and comfort.<br><br>But does she gets it? No... because kids are a problem and other aspects of life are generating additional burden. This woman is unable to recharge the feminine energy and is forced to maintain the masculine energy she had in the day for the night. As time goes on, this creates a deep emotional rift and creates a common scenario like yours above.<br><br>P.S: Handle each worries one at a time and discover what's truely important to you at this stage and what you are looking for now. You may realize you could have the solution to ease this weight for there are thingy we don't actually have to spare much focus on. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Learn to release your own tension and save yourself first.</strong></span><br><br>Cheers</div>

He doesn't represent a man who can substitute your current one and you know it, instead, <strong>he deeply reflects on what you are missing</strong>; the voids in your life which you could not fill through money, your current marriage and life. He could probably provide the elements that is missing in your husband - the romance, the touch, the everything else. This is the complementary effect.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Even my mum knows him  as he lives above but she does not know wat happened lah and had warned me not to get too close to him, but i really cannot stop it, we share the same job nature, can discuss so many things together after work, we email each other (although now stopped already after this incident ) and also sms each other plus we used to even run into each other in the gym, how to avoid being closer to this person<br><br>i even have some colleagues who got to know him when they were in the same company and they hinted that he got a divorce when the wife got a third party (dun know real or not) but tis colleague told me that since then, he had changed a lot of gfs<br><br>wonder why he is attractive when he is not say very rich, not say good looking, by all means, my hsb has everything he does not have but maybe physically my hsb is not here and my hsb is the type who wants to earn more money, very ambitious type and he also not romantic type<br><br>maybe wat i am lacking is company and a shoulder to cry on and nothing else</span><br><br>Much older, divorcee and still playing the field, etc - a clear sign of someone who is on poor ground for committed relationship. Do not be clouded by your emotional vulnerability and think that this man <span style="font-style: italic;">MAY </span>be someone you could consider - you will probably invite unwanted hurts that could leave burning scars that never heals.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>In your case, forget about reading too much into the intimacy you had with him. Like mentioned before, loneliness drives you on. There are no rules in the game of love - even if you are married, it doesn't matter. I urge you to come clean with yourself, understand the loopholes in your emotions and acknowledge them. Find ways to repair what you didn't knew that was damaged previously, even if it could mean some form of sacrifice on your part. You know yourself best - time change, people change. Our needs change when life continues to walk.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You may find that the sparks in missing in your marriage - have anyone truely done anything to reverse it? Will anyone be willing to fight and uphold the marriage?<br><br>***<br><br>C|oUdiSm states that a woman with successful career drains her much more than a man in the same position. Why? Because this woman used much of her masculine energy in the day, having to command her workers, decision to make and all the other thingy that requires the intense output from her to keep her 'there'. When the day pass and night falls, the drained woman comes home and automatically, feminine energy revert and she would definitely desire much love, attention and everything else that a woman deserve in a relationship for security, protection and comfort.<br><br>But does she gets it? No... because kids are a problem and other aspects of life are generating additional burden. This woman is unable to recharge the feminine energy and is forced to maintain the masculine energy she had in the day for the night. As time goes on, this creates a deep emotional rift and creates a common scenario like yours above.<br><br>P.S: Handle each worries one at a time and discover what's truely important to you at this stage and what you are looking for now. You may realize you could have the solution to ease this weight for there are thingy we don't actually have to spare much focus on. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Learn to release your own tension and save yourself first.</strong></span><br><br>Cheers[/b]</blockquote></div>

Whatever it is, don't repeat the same mistake.  Pretend nothing had really happened since both of you are drank.<br><br>Just to point out.  Boredom is a REAL killer... Pick up a hobby and make more friends.. If it is due to sexual tension, well, get a device or something.  So long you don't end up being unfaithful.. nothing really matters.</div></blockquote></span><br><br>Maybe you are right that some men like to score with married women, they feel that they are superior to the married woman's husband even though it may not actually be true<br><br>the problem is after that incident which happened about three wks ago, i didnt see him anymore although he did sms me about two wks ago (just a normal forwarding of those chinese sms- not personal sms)<br><br>when i came back to work, i saw that he had called me on the monday when i was overseas, maybe he wanted to give me a lift home. I didnt return call to him when i was back and din have any contact with him and have not seen him face to face also although i did see him playing tennis when i was upstairs looking down at the tennis court. but other than that, i didnt talk to him face to face....dun noe how things will end up now...</div>
