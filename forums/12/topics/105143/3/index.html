Why can't you think in another way that that old man is actually sorry for what he had did?<br><br>Just play cool and treat it as a social kiss. I guess you'll feel better that way. But of coz we can't deny the fact that the old man has the intention of bedding you. All you need is a companion. Why don't you spend more time with your kids, and try to do something to rekindle the flame of your relationship with your hubby?<br><br>Don't brood over that incident anymore...
