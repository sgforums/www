            <div class='col-md body'>Hello there, and welcome to Sgforums.<br><br>From your post, i see a lonely wife, with no outlet to vent her frustrations, release her emotions, and no source of comfort to seek in.<br><br>It is very easy, and dare i say normal? for a lonely housewife to succumb to hugging and kissing a 'stranger'.<br><br>But beware. I feel that this guy Knows what he is doing, and has seek upon you as prey.<br><br>You are feeling confused, and that's very normal. But settle your thoughts.<br><br>All you had was a kiss and a hug. Nothing much more. And you stopped after you became sober.<br><br>It would be wise, not to keep in contact with him, or to stay a bit further away from him, lest he has the chance to do more things with you the next time.<br><br>Perhaps you could talk to your husband, and work out something, so that you can meet up with him for a few days? Just to enjoy his company~<br><br>Do not be too bothered by this, and try to live life as normal if you can~</div>

Glad to be of help.<br><br>V gal is right. You are a great woman who is very independant, a great mother who loves your children, a great wife who adores her husband.<br><br>How long was it since you and your husband last met each other, and had a hugging/intimate session?<br><br>You are a woman, and as independant and as much as you love your husband, you are still easily susceptable to the most normal woman urges. Woman are to be hugged and loved. And you have not had both for some time am i right?<br><br>Independant women may look strong, but sometimes you too have your moments of weaknesses. You don't show it, until it eventually overwhelms you, and sometimes you do something silly.<br><br>In this case, i'm glad that you did not engage in any sexual activity, for that would have made it much worse.<br><br>Looking it at objectively, an outsider can tell you that you haven't done anything much. Its just a hug and a kiss(albeit a french one). He's playing an emotional game with you. But don't ... i repeat.<br><br>Don't let it bother you.<br><br>Its over. Don't think about it any more.<br><br>You said you don't want to avoid him altogether. Then continue treating him as a friend, just let him know your stand that you are Married, and that you will be faithful to your husband.<br><br>Once again, i suggest meeting up with your husband, to take a  short holiday or something. Seeing as you both earn such exorbitant salaries, I donÂ’t see why you canÂ’t take a no-pay leave of 1-2 weeks to enjoy and renew your marriage.<br><br>Trust me, it'll be good for you, for both of you.</div>

If your marriage is so important to you, the choice is simply to  treat this neighbour only as a friend. Note that he may come-on to you again seeing that he has gain a foothold into your emotions. If you do not wish to complicate things further, just do the hi and bye thing. Otherwise, explain to him your stand and be adament about it. Note also that at this point, he may try to dissuade and erode you arguments. So you have to be mentally prepared for his emotional assault.<br>The issue with your hubby may be even more difficult. If you are one who can keep secrets, than that's fine. If not, you may have an emotional need to come clean with him, of course the danger here is that he may react negatively.<br>A secondary issue that you have to be concern about if it remains a secret is that your new "friend" may use the incident as a emotional blackmail on your hubby.<br><br>BTW, I am a 42 year old married man with children. I know the pitfalls of temptations and many times, I am just short of committing a sin.<br></div>

Looks like your marriage is coming to some difficulties... Perhaps it would be wise at this point to ask yourself a direct question.

If she asks me to take a short vacation to renew our marriage... i would too.<br><br>Remember that all we seek in life is Love and Happiness. Money can buy things that makes us happy, but not happiness. Money can buy things for our loved ones, but not love itself.</span><br><br>i also dare not say anything to my neighbour as i am afraid that he wld say "i also dun like you, you talk so much for wat"<br><br>the worse thing is we stay in the same block and hopefully i dun run into him anymore than normal and luckily he is staying in a rented unit and hopefully he moves out soon<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Perhaps this is the least of your problems for now...</span><br><br>i think i need just a shoulder to cry on and comfort me, i hv been thru alot this year, a miscarriage, ups and downs in my personal life and working life<br><br>its very stressful to have a high flying job (I dun get such a high pay for doing nothing), have to take care of my kid, have to cope with my parents breathing down my neck and berating me for all kinds of things)<br><br><span style="color: blue;">I know. You're tired. That's one of the cons of having being Both Independent, and having a high paying job at the same time.

            <div class='col-md body'>hi armygirl<br><br>The issue of whether a man "can resist the charm" of other women or not is not an easy question. It all depends on the man.<br><br>Like it or not, we are all governed by a creed, whether it is a religious, moralistic or just personal conviction is totally immaterial.<br><br>I know of many men who travel overseas on a regular basis and remain faithful to their wives. Myself being one of them. Here, I like to clarify that it is not that I did not meet charming women at work, it is that I did not become unfaithful in the process. This is a question that my wife has to constantly deal with, with her colleagues. Her answer to her colleagues is that marriage is based on trust.<br><br>I also know of many married men who visit local KTV joint and get serviced. So in reality, it does not matter where one is to be tempted or charmed.<br><br>It also depends on where you go to. Some countries are more notorious than others for charming ladies. Therefore in such countries, it is more likely for a man with weaker principles to succumbed to temptations.<br><br>At the end of the day, it would go back to the man in question. There are really two issues at hand. The first being whether the man will stray after being bombarded by such comely ladies. The second, which is more important, what is the level of his love to his wife. It is entirely possible that a man remain faithful from the standpoint that he did not have another woman in his life, but at the same time, lost the love for his wife due an extended period of absence. Meaning, they have grown apart as there is very little communication and interaction.<br><br>I do not know how long your husband has been away and how long more he will be away. My advice is, if the remaining commitment for him is long, quit your job and be with him in that country.<br><br>You have to decide what is more important in your life, your marriage or your job. He too must play a part in allowing you to go to him in his country of work and recognise your needs and concerns.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Armygirl,<br><br>What you experience is common amoung people whose spouse work overseas for long duration at at time.  It is called Loneliness.<br><br>The first thing that you need to do is to forgive yourself for that incident which you recognised yourself as a mistake.  As you said YOu are confused in that you dont know why you did it and yet you feel kinda happy that you were kissed.  part of the reason is down to being lonely. when you were slightly high, you let down your guard and you got slightly carried away. There are other reasons such as the amount of stress that you went through and so on but for now it is important that you forgive yourself since nothing else happened.<br><br>though it is not a nice thing that happened but the fact is its over and you are waking up to this fact that you do have needs and have a vulnerable side.  You are not a robot you do recognised that you are flesh and blood.  So You can forgive yourself and be strong in the knowledge that it will not happen in the future bec you are clear about who you are and what it is that you DONT WANT.<br><br>Both of you seems to get along pretty well.  That may not be surprising since  apart from probably sharing an easy personality that allows both of you to get along, both of you also have in common work (a big part of our lives revolves around it) and similar social circles(??).  Further there is something else you have in common with him, he is divorced and without a wife and you are lonely without your husband.<br><br>Many affairs start that way, when a man/woman starts confiding in another who hapens to be in a similar situation.  Bec they share several things in common at that point in time, they are able to feel more actuely what the other person is going through and as such an intimate bond is created which may, if the parties are not careful, lead to physical stuff which is not what you want.<br><br>It is great to hear that you have your other area of life going for you that can keep you occupied and meet your emotional needs like hanging out with friends etc but you do need to  make some sort of arrangement with your husband that will work for you... sometimes it means one party leaving the job for the sake of the other or one leave the country to follow the other!<br><br>You mentioned other issues in your postings that you need to take a closer look into.  You have been through a lot and not having your spouse there makes it harder.  As to the lack of spark between you and your spouse, it is common when a person is away for a long period.  It takes time to build up.  First you miss that person like crazy when he goes away but over time you learn to cope without him and that is why the spark is lacking somewhat.<br><br>As to your neighbour, since you dont work with him, if it makes you comfortable, avoid him.  But you dont really need to talk or explain anything to him at this point.<br><br>Anyway, take care.</div>
