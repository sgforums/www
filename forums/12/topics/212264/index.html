            <div class='col-md body'>well you guys were close friends for a year so he probably thinks he know you quite well, and making the relationship official is only a formality.  but if you dont think you're ready to think of marrying him then thats another story.  i guess theres no fast or slow.  a friend of mine got to know this guy for a few months and got marreid to him.</div>
