One has merely considered how high (or low) the probability could be. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>This may sound anal, but it really depends on how you define the term "friendship".  You never know, even what's thought of as friendship to some could also be considered as acquaintanceship to others. The concept of "friendship" varies according to different people of different age groups and marital statuses, and this naturally leads to different answers.<br><br>For the sake of discussion however, to make sure we are on the same page as to the definition, let us go back to the question posted in an earlier reply:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Do you see wives or husbands still chatting with their opposite-sex-best-friends after marriage through the wee hours of the night like they used to do when they were young?"</span><br><br>Would <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span> still want to chat with your opposite-sex-best-friends after marriage through the wee hours of the night, assuming you used to do it when you were young?
