Why would you spend so much time on lady friends who are no longer available? And why would these lady friends choose to go out with you alone instead of with their partners? Do you like shopping and giving fashion and beauty tips to these lady friends of yours?<br><br>I know of a guy who felt perfectly secure with his wife going out with another man alone, too. But the other man was something like a "sister" to his wife, so this guy I know had no qualms about letting them go out on shopping sprees and high teas. Is your case something like that, too?</div>
