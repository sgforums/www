Love on the other hand has a deeper meaning and is more bound by the soul. you will know it when u wish you were the one suffering in his/ her place in his/ her shoes.....when u will wan 2 spend your life and share yr deepest feelings and thoughts with him/ her...u will sacrifice yourself and expect nothing in return for him/ her...that is Love <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"></div>

I've only been in sgforums for less than three months, and the threads are already getting repetitive. But this is an Aunt Agony forum -- we don't stop people from posting their problems as long as they are sincere and genuine -- and the problems facing people living in the same society aren't likely to be very much different, so to me it is just a matter of getting used to.<br><br>And when I <span style="font-style: italic;">do</span> occasionally get sick of hearing the same problem in different posts, I'll just avoid those posts. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
