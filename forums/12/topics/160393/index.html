So i didn't really make a "wrong anaylsis" rite? i always tod perhaps i choose to focus on the wrong topics in the 1st plc. But now it seems like it's only a matter of luck... i know only losers blame luck but i rely put in a lot of effort &amp; feel demoralized by setbacks after setbacks...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I used to have the same problem as you when it comes to memorising for subjects like history. But econs was easy for me, maybe you can try having a good understanding of the theory and various economic models instead of just memorising the facts. Econs has a fair amount of logic built into the models/theory and once you undertsand that, you can easily answer any new questions. This approach actually requires minimal memory work.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>aiyo, dont doubt urself juz bcoz ur grades in certain modules don't meet ur expectations. academic ability does not equate to work or future life surviving ability.<br><br>at least, u know &amp; u have been willing to work hard &amp; put in the extra effort for ur studies.<br><br>as for ur content or theoretical papers, not sure if this wld help but a tip for u...<br><br>try to cover all the major topics next time. even if it's juz briefly going thru &amp; understanding the concepts. don't spot questions.<br><br>with ur language ability, u shld find it easier to express in words and at least write enough to pass the paper. use examples and elaborations to "lengthen" your essay questions. lecturers look for effort and will not fail you if you write something.<br><br>hope this helps.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
