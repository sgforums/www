            <div class='col-md body'>It very stress,at 1st my mindset on SIM was that u pay $$$ to buy a degree.But after finishing one yr,i change my mindset totally,it was not easy compare to poly where poly u basically just memorize things from notes,tutorial ,etc.But now no matter how hard i memorize everything,if u don't understand the concept,u might not even understand the qns in the exams.However for me to adapt back from NS to studying was quite easy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm i think i explain a little bit more then.I am currently taking part time in accounting and finance in UOL,was from accounting too in sp and manage to get a direct entry into yr 2 after passing their bridging course .l think time management is one problem as usually i have to rush for classes after work and i can only find time to study durning weekend.<br>But one difficult point  in UOL i faced was that u really have to understand very well on what have being taught if not u will never even able to understand what was the exams qns asking about at all!!I cannot use the same old tactics in poly whereby focusing on the tutorials,past yr paper and notes for exams.Although i understand totally on the lectures taught by the local lecturers but as the exams was set by the UK examiners some qns i encounter in the exams was totally not taught durning the local classes.It was only being revise durning two lessons when some of the uk lecturer came to SG to conduct revision workshops.<br>But since u are considering studying in Unisim i think u will not face this problem as the exams was set by local examiners.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To clear any misconceptions, UniSim is only offering PART-TIME degress, and the degree is conferred by them. on the other hand, SIM is offering full-time degree courses from other foreign universities such as RMIT, UOL and University of Buffalo. UniSim is just an extension of SIM. So its all up to u really. If you want full-time studies, then its SIM.<br><br>I was an ex-student of SIM. I studied for a overseas degree there but due to personal reasons, had 2 drop out after only 1 sememster. However, the 4-5 months there was probably 1 of the best times of my life. Now, I am studying in another institution, but it really cannot compare with the time at SIM. Then somemore, SIM got offer snacks during tea-break, and their canteens are much much better than the pathetic 4-5 stalls I see in my current school's canteen. I guess its the friends I made at SIM, as well as the entire environment there that makes it special. During exams, its not hard 2 see the study benches, library and study rooms fully occupied. The students there are much more motivated than other places.<br><br>So, if u plan to go UniSim or SIM, my advice would be to go for it! It will be a memorable 2-3 years of your life.</div>
