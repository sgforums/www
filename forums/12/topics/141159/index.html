            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I still remember what my poly director told us:  "...... there is several signs that there is lonely trees in a forest......". These people prefers to do everything on their own and even for group projects, they want the project effort to be splitted up accordingly so that they can do it on their own. Basically, these people are quite poor thing cos in project grouping, they are forced to form a grp cos no one will ever wants them to be in their team.<br><br>I am a working adult now, my advice to you is that dont think too much when making friends cos I believe genuine friends will want to see your true self and not someone putting on a mask creating a favorable position to be accepted by the clique. In times to come, you will see yourself mixing with the unique clique of friends in your JC.<br><br>Remember, when you enter the working world, you will naturally lost contacts with several friends and only good ones will maintain contacts with you.<br><br>Cheer up</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know is hard for you to open up.  Just try whatever it takes. Maybe by reading aloud when you read story books or even. Talk to one of your friends about the poroblem yo are having now. I'm sure they will listen and give you good advie.  The other thing you can do is to get a outdoor sales job. Or ask people to give you interview, remember DON'T ask in one or two word, Try for five words first, then ten and so on...</div>

What so afraid and hard to talk more to them. Am I a chicken by being afraid and uneasy talking to them?") Try to create more courage,confident and a bit cocky but not overdone.(U see cocky people talk with confident!) Quickly yr body will get into that state and start talking more and with ease...</div>
