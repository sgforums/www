Her depression. Is it self-proclaimed or doctor diagnosed her to have depression? 2 different things, 2 different treaments. If she self-proclaimed that she has depression, she might be trying to escape from reality or she enjoys being sad, moody, in all those negative emotions or simply, she likes to indulge in self-pity.<br><br>I had a gal-friend. Fun-loving, friendly and mild-tempered. She hardly had any mood-swing and was very out-door type of girl. 2 years ago, she jumped down from her 8th-storey apartment.<br><br>Her parents, friends and even boyfriend told her she is suffering from depression. Even the doctor said so but she was not even aware she was suffering from depression. Not only that, she was relectant to get treated. She felt she would be Ok but she was wrong.<br><br>She had constant feelings of sadness and tension. Her symptoms were constant, not mood-swings like your gf's. She was no longer out-door type, she lost interest in her usual activities/hobbies, she was constantly complaining of tiredness, her sleeping pattern changed as well as her appetite (she lost alot of weight). She felt hopeless and the last straw, her suicidal thoughts claimed her life. At age 23, she died. She lived in Jurong East.<br><br>From my experience, I felt your gf is acting or enjoys to be 'depressed' OR she has severe personality disorder. (I won't say she is possessed) A truly depressed person will not treat u so nice &amp; loving suddenly and then tried to break up with u 7 times(unless u treated her badly and yet, refused to let her go).<br><br>There are plenty of such people around. They are so self-centered and closed-up that it's very difficult to get them to listen to change. It could be due to their upbringing or their surroundings. They might have been pampered by their parents that they became self-centered. Or they might have some bad experiences that caused them to shut themselves out from outside.<br>In either cases, they can only help themselves by growing up.<br><br>I advise you to leave her.<br><br>Cheers!</span></div>

We broke up eventually.  I've went through her mood swing, and rediculous accusations.

I tried to get her to see a psychiatrist, but failed.<br><br>What I can offer was to try to get her to see a psychiatrist, if you love her and sincerely wants to help her.

It  may just be leading to suicide eventually.<br><br>She needs to have a list of willing people whom she can trust, so that she can go to them when she feels depressed. What these people need to do is simply to provide a pair of listening ears. No advice, no suggestions, no asking her to brace up, no asking her to 'wake up' - All these only accentuate her self-belief that she's worthless and hopeless and reinforce the depression.<br><br>I suggest a <strong>list</strong> of people, because honestly it can be tiring and frustrating for any one person if she goes to only him or her (like your situation).<br><br>I like the way alfagal offered help - she simply offered you a link to a list of helplines that you can call. Do encourage her to give one of the helplines a call. These helplines are manned by professionals.<br><br>As for others, please refrain from advising Wolfwoof to abandon his gf. If Wolfwoof is truly sure that it's petty tantrums, that's fine.. he should leave her and he would, if he does not love her anymore, and could no longer tolerate her nonsense. <strong>BUT</strong> we never know if it's true depression, because if it is, it can eventually mean eventual death through suicide if she feels the ultimate hopelessness.<br><br>Like what one of these guys say, Wolfwoof, you are really a great guy to have been through with your gf all this time. However, you need your breaks and private moments as well, so do make sure you have them.<br><br>Sounds like a broken record, but please.. do give one of the helplines a try.<br><br></div>
