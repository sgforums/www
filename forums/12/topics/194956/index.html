If you think  that you are not; then you are not!<br><br>Your perception is the reality.<br><br>If your gf doesn't mind talking to him, then it is none of your business. You can try to stop it or you can just control your own thoughts.<br><br>If you try to control your own thoughts, nothing happens and life goes on. If you try to stop him or or gf; your relationship might sour.<br><br>I prefer that you control your own thoughts. BTW how old are you 3?<br><br>I am not trying to be kaypoh, it is important because if you are very young and not thinking about getting married any time soon... wth, enjoy life while you can and stop getting worked up for nothing.</div>

Loving unconditionally often doesn't mean you love blindly...?<br><br>I think FadeToBlack has got his own point to deliver... COMMUNICATION which is an important aspect of a relationship not to be overlooked.. You are right in a way that he shouldn't oversensitive (applicable to most cases), but that doesn't make he should tone down on his own communication with his gf and building on a proper foundation as well..</div>
