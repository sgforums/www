            <div class='col-md body'>Little bluey, don't be sad... Maybe I cannot say I understand every single tinge of sadness you are experiencing but I do know how much it hurts to lose the one you love, especially when it was so beautiful and perfect. When you look back on the memories, just remember how happy you were and Thank God at least you have truly loved before. Some people search all their lives for that TINGLe, that "In love" feeling and can never seem to find it...they get into relationship and get out fast because they cannot "FEEL" the love... Just hold the memories close your heart and remember if you truly love that person, as long he/she is happy, you will feel happy as well  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Care to share something?? We'll be there for u...<br><br>but I'm glad that u got over it more or less. Once I too got very sick and tired of life... Felt that life is very meaningless. just live and live aimlessly. Ask me to study, so that I will get good results and get into a good sch and wun have to earn my living physically. At that time, I was thinking, get a management job so wat... Get a job and suffer more? Work so hard to get more sufferings when u work. Earn so much $$$ in the end still have give them up... I was asking myself wat for.<br><br>Dunno when or how... Maybe I look in the sky for too long, maybe I stared in dark for hours. Maybe I tok to the stars and moon till they got tired. Somehow I begin to look into a new way of life.. Something that gave me fulfilment and satisfaction in life.. And begin to look at life from a different angle.<br><br>Well... to u t|rEd and to everyone out there... This is wat pple always say, but I'll repeat again. Whenever there is a door shut behind u, There will always be another door which is open. Just like when u missed a bus, there will always be another bus coming to take u to ur destination.<br><br>I'll be for u guys...<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

Just bear with it and soon you will be back to yr normal self.<br><br>Maybe u had put a lot of stress on yrself recently without u yrself realising it. Esp when u r in sch like VJC, i am sure the stress is over-whelming. Dunnoe if i am correct but sometime u will think something like: life is short, what for study so hard? Or what am i studying so hard for?<br><br>Maybe on top all these u still have other problems which only you yrself know. Every person, or even family had their own problems. Only you yrself know best. If u feel like sharing, i am sure many pple in here will be glad to hear or lend u a listening ears. If dun feel like, well just try not to think of it lor, okie?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Actually at a tender age of 16, think u r still too young to handle a lot of things such as stress and problems properly. U may not agreed lor but just like when i was 16, i thought that i could do wonders and settle many problems myself. Now old liao, think of it, realise that my thinking was quite naive then,   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So my advice is at yr teenage yrs now, try to relax and enjoy life, of cos not forgetting yr school work. If you wanna get troubled, wait for a few more yrs lor  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Don't worry u will have yr chance 1 cos when u r older, even if u wanna escape any problems also cannot, just like me now.<br><br>And guess what, JC and Uni life is quite interesting, will become part of yr sweet memories in a few yrs time so enjoy it!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Not every1 got a chance to go JC or Uni. Errmmm fyi, me for instances didn't have the chance.<br><br>So just take care of yrself and all the best for you in yr new school.</div>

Juz like a common cough, it may seem harmless juz to cough and live wif it. But behind it, it can be the symtoms of TB or it can cause asthma. not that I'm cursing all the pple who are coughing, but prolong coughing can be serious. 1 mth of coughing can get u asthma, so dun think coughing is juz coughing. And I dun see a tiny problem as a tiny problem. I see it as a way to understand u and the way u think as well.<br><br>but, t|rEd, I know U would rather keep the problem inside u.
