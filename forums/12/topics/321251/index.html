              <p><br>it is like economic, supply and demand, once upon a time, in singapore there was no foreigner gals, so sg gals can raise their status and feel proud, cos sg guys got no other choice, then came the thai gals, then the philipinos gals, but those are not in high demand, not so good qualities. So, sg gals still in high demand, then finally china open up, damn, all PRC gals come here, overly supplied, and these PRC gals can be 10x more sweet and nice than sg gals, and finally sg gals meet their challenger. So, the supply out rate the demand and that lead to those normal to ugly sg gals or even beautiful ones searching for a solution which never come.</p>

              <p>Calling all sg gals, it time to change, if you cannot beat the PRC gals, join them. Last time, i walk without looking at sg guys, very proud, but today i changed, i look around for handsome sg guys, but no one look at me leh?? why huh?? damn PRC gals, very hard to beat them. They can go bed sg guy anytime of the day and nite, and we still virgin waiting for a marriage that may not come. Sigh!!!</p>

              <p>Just bump into this forum, maybe I am too old to comment.  I known a fair share of foreigner and interaical marriage, thus dun really agree on most of the comment of foreigner gals/guys.  I agree that there are overseas gals that hookup with local guys for $$$ or PR, as well as foreigner guys that pickup local gals just to pass their time when they are here.  However I do come across many happy interracial marriage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think all in all it depend on personal character, some might find local gals/guys match them better, some might prefer foreigner.</p>

              <p>Not sure what is u dealing with foreigner gals and local guys  to think that all of them behave this way, I known couple of them that are well educated and can stand on their own feet.  My x which is a foreigner lady can speak 6 common worldwide languages, it more of the behavior that count, else I won't treated her as friend even when our relationship dun workout.  Plus I had nvr find a foreigner gals that I can lord over before. </p>
