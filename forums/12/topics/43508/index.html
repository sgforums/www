            <div class='col-md body'>right.. u stay on in a reln becos of a "motto"?<br><br>well that's wat it implies anyway.<br><br>the cliche says "ai qing shi bu ke yi mian qiang de" (sorree hor my cheena very bad dunno correct anot) and it's true isn't it?<br><br>i do agree with cherishing wat u have now, but i find that statement rather irrelevant here lor. i mean it seems he is treating her in a less than satisfactory way, and she is still to cherish him? wat if he starts beating her up? is she still to cherish him?<br><br>the problem here isn't really about cherishing or not cherishing one another. it's about (from the little info given) someone (the guy) just losing interest over time. he slowly stopped loving her (if IN FACT he ever loved her in the first place). i think wat needs to be done is to trash things out, and talk about it. cheesy is obviously upset that he's ignoring her, and taking the "soft route" to his attention, not wanting to upset him. i reckon she should take her stand and voice out to him, call him up and say u wanna meet and talk and be firm and assertive.<br><br>if he's avoiding her constantly then wat kind of bf is he? of course u could choose to swallow it and wait for his timing, or u could just be a strong woman and do wat u have to do.<br><br>i dun believe in staying on in a reln where one person doesn't love the other (anymore). sometimes it may be VERY hard to end it becos of all kinds of reasons, been together for very long, timing not right (to end it), family and friends all know each other etc etc, but when there's no love, the others mean jack sh[/i]it.<br><br>so cheesy, hope u can talk to him to determine how he feels about u now. not to cherish blindly and not knowing wat the hell is going on in his head.</div>

Is it jus becos after this huge conflicts you both had.. and suddenly he jus hack care everything?? That's why you feel being taken for granted? And after this 1 year plus of relationship.. now then you come to realise this...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Well, I dunno what's the topic you guys quarrelling about.. cos you never state.. What is the main issue that lead to such a HUGE arguement?? Yes of cos he will be confused.. and for now.. he doesn't know what is the thing that is confusing him.. He couldn't find an answer to it..neither do you.. Right now.. i think you should give him more time to do some thinking for himself.. and this relation... You ask him such  a question now.. And the quarrel matter is still lingering in his mind.. Which til now he still doesn't know what to do.. And then of cos.. Such reply from him will come out from his mouth..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Let him have a few days of his own.. And sort out his thoughts.. Meanwhile you can do some soul-searching..and see what's wrong with this relation... After maybe another 2-3 days or so.. Call him out and have a nice talk with him..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Unsolve the problem that comes between you and him.. And see what he got to say.. I'm sure there will be still a chance for you both to revive this 1 year plus relation... Unless things turn out to be very bad than expected.. But no matter what.. This has to be solved.. He cant leave you alone jus like that.. No explanation given.. Whether to continue a not.......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Anyway.. I dun think he doesn't care about you anymore.. Jus like that.. After a quarrel, always need time to cool down and calm down the feelings.. You can expect straight after a quarrel everythin will be back to the same again.. as if nothing had happened... Maybe he still QI TAO SHANG..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If he really don't bother about you.. One thing might be.. the feelings and chemistry for you is gone.. And he couldn't find a way or a reason to break up with you.. Cos he's scared that he might hurt you or.. he don't wan to be a so-called "bad guy" here... Jus so coincident.. both had a quarrel.. and this could be a reason for him to get away... This is jus an assumption!!!! Dun take it so seriously.. Cos I have no idea on what's the arguement about...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>But then, i think that it isn't that major afterall.. No problems can be solved.. Is see whether you wanna find a solution to it.. or jus like it rot!! Give him more time ok?? then maybe after you guys can have a talk again.. when both parties are emotionally stable.. After that then see how it goes.. Try not to qaurrel ok?? Jus talk and have a chat.. Don't blow your temper up so easily.. It'll jus spoils everything...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Don't pressurised yourself too much.. Even if things doesn;t work out as what you want.. Life still goes on.. You need to move on and start a new fresh ahead alright..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Take care pal!! I hope you'll be doing fine!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

Anyway, a period of 6 years (and initial parent objection) - come on... I am sure you would grow and mature alot from this relationship.

And see what he got to say.. I'm sure there will be still a chance for you both to revive this 1 year plus relation... Unless things turn out to be very bad than expected.. But no matter what.. This has to be solved.. He cant leave you alone jus like that.. No explanation given.. Whether to continue a not.......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Anyway.. I dun think he doesn't care about you anymore.. Jus like that.. After a quarrel, always need time to cool down and calm down the feelings.. You can expect straight after a quarrel everythin will be back to the same again.. as if nothing had happened... Maybe he still QI TAO SHANG..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If he really don't bother about you.. One thing might be.. the feelings and chemistry for you is gone.. And he couldn't find a way or a reason to break up with you.. Cos he's scared that he might hurt you or.. he don't wan to be a so-called "bad guy" here... Jus so coincident.. both had a quarrel.. and this could be a reason for him to get away... This is jus an assumption!!!! Dun take it so seriously.. Cos I have no idea on what's the arguement about...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>But then, i think that it isn't that major afterall.. No problems can be solved.. Is see whether you wanna find a solution to it.. or jus like it rot!! Give him more time ok?? then maybe after you guys can have a talk again.. when both parties are emotionally stable.. After that then see how it goes.. Try not to qaurrel ok?? Jus talk and have a chat.. Don't blow your temper up so easily.. It'll jus spoils everything...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Don't pressurised yourself too much.. Even if things doesn;t work out as what you want.. Life still goes on.. You need to move on and start a new fresh ahead alright..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Take care pal!! I hope you'll be doing fine!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div></blockquote>Wow.. ok lar.. reply for me liao.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
