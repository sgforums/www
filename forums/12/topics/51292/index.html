It is difficult to know that you have lost the one you have feelings for. It's also not easy for you to know that he has feelings for someone else.<br><br>Your pain is understandable. I know you want to express it out. Can i request that you do not cut yourself? It pains to know that you are doing that to yourself. Your loved ones will feel even more painful to know you are doing that. Perhaps you could write it all out or call a close friend whenever you feel down. you are not alone and do not have to face it by yourself. The pain you feel now will be less intense with time.<br><br>For now, you need to make a decision about the relationship. If you want to ask him for another chance, go ahead. Be prepared also that he may not accept it (if he still has strong feelings for ger). Even if he does not accept you, it does not mean that you are not good enough. It just says that he is looking for something else.<br><br>It's not easy but i know you can do it.</div>
