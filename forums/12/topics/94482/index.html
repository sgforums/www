Marriage bears alot of responsibilites and commitment.. You not only think of yourself only.. but also your wife.. and your family.. Living togther under one roof.. is not simple as you think it is.. Being together is easy.. When you live together you have to accept everything.. Habits.. and blah blah..<br><br>Cheers..</div>

Sorry to hear abt your problem.. Firstly.. marriage is a commitment.. You never really state whats the reason for your seperation and such.. How long were you 2 together before you were married? Things should be "settled" by the time you 2 get married.. Certain things that ought to be compromised SHOULD be compromised.. It takes 2 hands to clap.. If u don give in and vice versa.. things will definately go sour..<br><br>I am not sure how are things going on now for you.. But all i can say is i hope you have learn a painful lesson by this marriage seperation.. Its a hard fact that you got to accept..<br><br>Smile..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

However, you may need to put aside your emotions now &amp; self-reflect.<br><br>Ask yourself, what does marriage means to you? From what you mentioned, about u deciding to marry ur girl out of guilt, that is not going solve the problem. Because marriage is never a tool for problem-solving. It is another level of commitment; another phase of life; a deeper relationship. How long and how much have u known the girl before u take her as ur wife? Ask urself this, is she qualified? Is she understanding enough to be able to relate to u? Is she prudent? Does she love u to the point of sacrificing her time, space, effort, money... etc..? If she doesn't have what it takes to be a wife, forget about the relationship. Break-up from there. It's a respectable and admirable action to take.<br><br>I hope you learn from this painful experience and try never to repeat it again. Never EVER marry anyone without first making wise decisions. Well, if the both of u are still together now, I would suggest that the both of you seek marrital counselling right away. It will not work out right if it continues like this.</div>

However, it's too late. You are already married. Thus, it's always very important to think a thousand times before marrying anybody, because it is a big decision in one's life.<br><br>Anyway, from what I noticed, you mentioned that your wife kept shouting and you turned on the radio to maximum volume. Now that's a grave mistake. You should have calmed down and listen to what she has to say. In marriage there must be communication. It's not just one person doing the talk all the time. It's both party talking and listening respectively to each other, one at a time.<br><br>I'm sorry but I need to be blunt with you that you are absolutely not there yet if you talk about being a husband. Not only u alone, but ur wife is just not there too. Since both ur marriage is now on the rocks, I suggest STILL - please, go for Marriage Counselling. Seek help! In this way, only then it will work out. Don't try to work things out among urselves already, at this stage, it's best to seek help ASAP!<br><br>Good Luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi sorry to hear about your plight<br>marriage is essentially a commitment between 2 person to devote their rest<br>of their lifes to each other and to do so, there is a great emphasis on both<br>parties to communicate with each other actively and learn how to come<br>compromise, forgive and forget and to cherish each other.<br><br>I think that constantly giving in is not going to help in a relationship in anyway<br>and being quiet would only make your spouse think that you are not concerned with her. However, I do believe that the resultant rift between you and your spouse is not due solely to this. Try to voice out your concerns with her and seek to understand and come to a compromise. Do not give in all the time as it would only worsen her attitude in handling issues with you.<br>Stay firm and show your will but not your weakness in handling the situation when you come face to face to talk to her.<br>It is important to let her know how you feel or else u'd just end up feeling miserable keeping all the feelings inside.<br>remember marriage is about support and trust and you must not give up on yourself or your partner without giving it all to salvage it. Both of you cherished the relationship you once had and it's only right that both of you learn to commit to the vow made on your wedding day.<br>Marriage counselling is advised and I hope that both of you would be able to<br>iron out your differences and learn more about each other, but more importantly, learn to handle your relationship with your spouse as how it is supposed to be.</div>

There are solutions to most relationship, but it is often the unwillingness of one party that make even the best solutions meaningless.<br><br>Your marriage shows alot of lessons, in which I will highlight to you: The ultimate flaw you made is NOT the beginning of your BGR relationship with her, rather, <strong>it began when you married her for the wrong reasons</strong>. You can have the longest, strongest, or whatsoever imagined relationship, but when you enter your marriage vow with the wrong kind of mindsets and reasons - marriage can be difficult. Love is something very unique and nothing can substitute. You can marry for any other reasons: but you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">will not</span> achieve spiritual/emotional fulfillment, contentment and happiness.<br><br>Your initial relationship didn't achieve what you should learn and you leap hastily into marriage. First missing: Understanding. Second quality missing: too much emphasize on individualism. (Astrologically speaking, Uranus is a selfish planet and could produce alot of individualism component in one's life, hindering one's primary relationship) Where are these essential qualities? Again, as we could see here, its roots trace back to my above paragraph - married for wrong reasons.<br><br><strong>Like when you are forced to consume an unripe fruit - you will induce stomach-ache</strong>; likewise, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your relationship is far too raw</span>.<br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Let me explain the part on individualism in a relationship:<br><br>Breaking up the word 'Relationship' is the words 'Relation' (bonds) and 'Ship' (Direction/choice). Logically speaking, we can't have relationship with ourselves, there must be another person where we could exercise this bonds with to greater heights. And because of this fact, 'mutual', 'compromise', 'cooperation', and thousands of other adjectives used to describe the <strong>two </strong>is needed to foster a reasonable balance relationship.<br><br>Individualism is self explainatory. One that has too much emphasize on Self, will find 'Cooperation' difficult, for relationship emphasize on Others and empathy is greatly needed. Thus as we can see here: there is a terrible lack of understanding and this love equations contains: 'You and I' instead of 'We'<br><br>From the above theory, you will understand the following:<br><br>I) Mum sick, experienced neglect and yet she mind<br><br>II) Demand company, without consideration of situations<br><br>III) Reluctance to financial assistance to family<br><br>You ought to learn a good lesson from this: You take marriage lightly, marriage play a fool with you. There are reasons why:<br><br>Friends &gt; BGR &gt; Marriage<br><br>You can't enter a BGR with someone you hate ya? And you have to think twice about marriage when the man/woman you are getting is not suitable. It flows naturally this way. If you handle each level poorly, you will end up trying to untangle everything later on and people usually die trying.
