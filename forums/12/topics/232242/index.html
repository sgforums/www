            <div class='col-md body'>Hiya, once you attached, you hope you are single again (most of the time).<br><br>My brother was retained when he was in Normal Stream in Sec 4. Now he is in University. Just because you had a bad patch doesn't mean it will follow you for life. You either change things or accept it the way it is.</div>
