              <p>Well is my 1st post here and I am trying to look for some solutions to some retard neighbour making noise at night.</p>
              <p>My neighbour that stay above me basically make noises every single night from 11pm to 2-3am even during chinese new year. They will play marbles, bang on floor, i dont know how else they created the noise. It happens for like 2 months but normally i will just ignore them hoping they will stop if we dont give them any attention. But recently their 'balls' got bigger, the noise created was really too much. Last night, i can only imagine how big the marble is. The noise was thunderous and i can even feet the vibration. I got pissed and shouted thru the window for them to try again and i will get them. I Was hoping for another way to solve this. I thought of recording it but then audio recording cant be use as prove rite?</p>
              <p>Any proper channel i can go thru to stop those idiotic neighbours?</p>
              <p>Thx</p>

              <p>i used to have a lot of such problems with my neighbours directly one floor up.  i confronted them a few times but they insisted they werent making any noise.</p>
              <p>i even went to the extent of asking my sister and another neighbour to listen to the noise to prove i wasnt hallucinating. </p>

              <p>well, was talking with a friend, and he shared that it could be those steel pipes that are used in the concrete for strength that are expanding/contracting and hence the sound.. also, he said that there are ball bearings used too and hence we hear the "marbles".. but unsure whether it is true/not..</p>
              <p>maybe we need mythbusters..</p>

              <p>The first proper channel that you should approach is to pick up your phone and telephoned the POLICE and complain against the excessive noise emitting from your neighbour flat above you.</p>
              <p>As long as it is a disturbance complaint, the police will need to investigate. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Is your neighbour doing some form of renovation? You should faster pick up your slippers and take a walk upstairs and find out what's going on first before you go and complain against a bunch of bangalah workers who doesn't understand that they are disturbing you.</p>
              <p>But since they're from bangalah, who cares if you lodged a complaint anyway right?</p>
              <p>What if the real owner of the unit is a chiobu and you have already lodged a complaint against her.......then you will have no chance with her in the future...soooo...</p>

              <p>Hi...have u considered the possibility that the noises come from the building itself..?</p>
              <p>Yes, there are alot of such topics like yours....but the noise actually come from the internal building...not from someone actively making noise.</p>
              <p>Especially since u said it happens rather regularly between 11-2, and there is some marble-like sound.</p>
              <p>People always mistaken marble sounds as kids or persons playing on the floor above, but actually not.</p>
              <p>So I hope next time when you hear these sounds, go up quickly and try to walk near to their unit and try to listen. If you dont hear anything, that means it is confirmed it is not their actions.</p>
