              <p><strong>Reverse psychology</strong> is a technique involving the advocacy of a 
              belief or behavior that is opposite to the one desired, with the 
              expectation that this approach will encourage the subject of the 
              persuasion to do what actually <em>is</em> desired: the opposite of what is suggested. This technique relies on the psychological phenomenon of <a title="Reactance (psychology)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_%28psychology%29">reactance</a>,
               in which a person has a negative emotional reaction to being persuaded,
               and thus chooses the option which is being advocated against.</p>

              you may be weak in maths but you are strong in other areas, so don't be discouraged by her comments.  she will get her just retribution one day when her children go to school.
              
              same for people who bully people at work....worry when your children go to work one day.

              <p>To do well in Mathematics, you need a strong foundation ( which you are lacking).</p>
              <p>You will need to start from the basic and train yourself up to secondary level.</p>
              <p>What that teacher did was deplorable.. she is ashamed of her own failure, thus is trying to push the blame on you.</p>
              <p>A good teacher helps a poor student learn better... Punishing and shaming is irresponsible and cannot help better a student. She needs to go back to teaching school for more training herself.</p>
              <p>Do not be discouraged by bad teachers, a good education starts from your personal motivation and inner strength. Teachers are just there to guide you, you need to keep yourself focus on your personal goal and strive towards it.</p>
              <p>Go and pick up some primary school text books and workbooks, work through the books and see which area you are weak in. If you can seek tutorship or a mentor who can help you.</p>

              <p>Using stress as an excuse for bad teaching habit is unacceptable. </p>
              <p>If that teacher can't handle her job, then she is in the wrong profession.<span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="line-height: normal;"> Just quit.</span></span></p>

Not bad already for a na student. Bottomline is , PSLE is just a USELESS cert. some kids really mature faster some are late bloomers. Heck care your 167 score. Go and get a tuition teacher. Srously my math improved tremendously. My motto is always the underdog. People judge u, look down on you. But you must be resilient and fight back. Prove it to them. Trust me PSLE is nothing.

              <p><strong>Reverse psychology</strong> is a technique involving the advocacy of a belief or behavior that is opposite to the one desired, with the expectation that this approach will encourage the subject of the persuasion to do what actually <em>is</em> desired: the opposite of what is suggested. This technique relies on the psychological phenomenon of <a title="Reactance (psychology)" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_%28psychology%29">reactance</a>, in which a person has a negative emotional reaction to being persuaded, and thus chooses the option which is being advocated against.</p>
