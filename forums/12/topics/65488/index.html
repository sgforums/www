Maybe it's just fated that you are not supposed to be wif him or him wif you. I too still miss my ex for the past 6 years but I'm glad that we broke off cause she's now happily married with 2 kids. Sometime it's better to let go than trying to hold it forever.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
