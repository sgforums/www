              poor guys do not have the material conditions to get material gals...thats for sure and applies to modern singapore.....
              
              joining dating agencies provide slightly better chance if and only if he is not choosy over the gals...most of them may not look good and pretty old as well...vice versa for gals who join dating agencies to look for rich man...but most turn out to be either too ugly beyond acceptable limits or too old
              
              aside, even if u found one at the least acceptable and wouldn't mind your poverty...divorce is still likely and to the utmost liability against men...poor + legal maintenance....= jail....
              
              so it ends up with the rise of singles....
              
              so, outward sourcing for foreign brides become the norm....but take care to control her such that she does not adopt "singapore materialistic gals" mentality...and treasure her for being loyal to you....

              <p><br>I think $500/month, you can get a very pretty foreign bride. They don't ask for much. That's also why Singaporean guys stray easily.</p>

              <p>For your info, marry Singaporeans girls also have to support, last time my gf took $1k/month from me for many months... very tiring for me... until today i haven't really met an independent singaporean girl, maybe i am unlucky but given that i met so many sg girls, i think maybe the probability is just that. or maybe because i not handsome so met the girls always take money from me, lol.</p>

              yes thats true...but partially....so its better to fly over to source than here in singapore which most of them have been badly influenced and used to the singapore materialistic life style...
              
              another difficulty is supporting the family,,,,,thats for sure....but mostly the allowances are usually manageable comparing third world countries economy to ours....S$300 would make the family so happy for a long while...the expenses are unlike ours.....
              
              foreign brides are still the best alternative if and only if u are diligent and committed to find a good one over there..but not city gals......poor village/ rural gals are the alternative...and if u r lucky, u may find a pretty and obedient wife....
              
              once set and fly over, do remember to treat her well as a woman and wife...but control is necessary against negative singapore effects...

              <p>so the pretty foreign bride marry you and cannot work in singapore and only get $500 a month from you.</p>
              <p>What will she do during her free time? Everyday do housework and stay at home also very sian mah. Than if want to go out 1 month only $500 not much places can go out too.</p>
              <p>Plus, foreigners nowadays marry singaporeans also very hard to get PR. Than they have to go back to their country and can only come back to singapore on social visit pass to find you.</p>
              <p>You don't even know whether they got affair with another guy in their home country anot and give you green hat to wear.</p>
              <p>Its not easy to marry foreigners too!</p>
