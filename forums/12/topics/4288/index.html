            <div class='col-md body'>Alamakz... I wun agree wif the idea of going back to him. FOr every relationship that u haf u will definitely haf soem momeries.. Take it as memories so that u can tell ur children... But for going back to him, I think it's just that u suddenly felt very lonely and a loss... That's y u haf such feelings.. moreover, it's hasn't been a long time since that thing happened, so u will tend to miss him... U just need someone to care fo u and love u again... it's something amiss that's all... I do haf such feelings myself too.. I too haf sudden urge at such times. Just gif urself time. Now just do things that u wanted to do all along, but was unable to do.. go out wif frens.. Slowly as time passes by, the idea will slip out too.<br><br>I would haf recommend u to go back to him, IF u r the one who is a fault. And it's just a minor error.. But not this... If u return u will only make him complacent. He will start thinking of using u as a spare again, if his r/s wif his current gf is not going too well.. most guys are like that, we are never satisfied wif just A GIRL by our side.<br><br>I doubt there's nothing wrong if a guy doesn't know u very well.. I mean maybe it's just that u need to know more guys, maybe for a longer period of time. U will get to know each other. As time goes by, I dun think it will stop a guy from knowing u well enuff..<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I dun think u should go back to him. That is my personal opinion of coz. Try and understand y the 2 of u broke off in the first place. This must be a reason. Anyway, it will be unfair for his present gf and ur present bf. But if u really feel miserable, I think u should not have got into a relationship that is full of problems, worries and sceptical thoughts.<br><br>Hope u will find ur true love!!</div>

Okie.. we like to haf fun, but we do get pretty serious too.. Maybe not all guyz.. For instance, I'm sure there are quite a number of guys here  in this forum, who are serious in replying ur post, doesn't it show our serious side too?? I'm not saying that u must choose from pple here, but it's just a sign for u to see that we guys can be serious pple too.. In fact all guys haf a serious side. U really haf to be close to them then u can see their less playful view.<br><br>I'm not arrowing at u..., maybe I'm too harsh here, but it's just to tell u to be more open to guyz. coz u never know wat u gonna get...
