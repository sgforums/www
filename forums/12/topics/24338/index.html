            <div class='col-md body'>Found this interesting article on a dtaing site members homepage just wonder is online relationships worth seeking?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If I have not gone to a German site I never knew a German can be so romantic and funny at time. Chatting with you over the chat room there had bring so much fun and meaning to my life. You have teach me how to survive in this lonely world, the German way of course. You bring laughter to pain, you bring sunshine to rain. You are there just when I needed you most.<br><br>I still remembers how I laugh whenever I saw and read those cute e-card that you had make specially for me. And those lovely German love song that you recorded just for me. When I send you my photo you even managed to add me into your photo with your computer skill. Making it into another photo that look like have meet somehow in your army camp. And the best part is that you even make it the CD cover of these lover song, too bad I canÂ’t really understand those sexy German voice of yours. But my dear, I will treasure it, just like I treasure our online long distance friendships.<br><br>I remember loving you, from the first time I see your ID on the chat room. Maybe it sound more like a English gentlemen than a German soldier. You were holding on there, waiting for someone to hit on you. When we started to chat, the way you describe yourself make me laugh and laugh. Then suddenly when you disappear through the crowd, I remember the emptiness that I felt, when you were gone.<br><br>Wanting to hook back with you, I went to the site almost every night, waiting desperately for you. But never see you again. It keep me awake in the night, wishing you were here again. When others try to chat with me all I told them is that I am waiting for a friend.<br><br>Then one night I remembers when I login I saw you just below my ID in the WHOÂ’s ON list. The happiness I felt when I found that I was so close to you again. I jump in to the chat room and when the chat box open up, what a feeling I had inside when you click and say HELLO. That night we must have spend the whole night chatting and exchanging our secrets over the internet.<br><br>The only thing I miss is that I didnÂ’t ask for your e-mail, and get a reply from you what happen that night when we first meet. But two days later when my mail box was full of beautiful roses and lovely wordings on e-cards send directly from the dating site, I know you are real, I feel you are desperately wanting to get close with me. That have make me feel so wanted and you have touch my heart. Now after almost 2 months your roses had fully decorated and colored my mailbox.<br><br>The night before you join your team for some offshore army training, you told me to wait for you. My dear, I still desperately waiting online, wanting you near me. But when I never see you again for almost 2 months I wonder are you for real? I will be there every night just to make sure you tell me why, am I just another long distance friendships that you started so strongly with your roses and let them die desperately waiting for your return.<br><br>I canÂ’t stay for long, IÂ’ve look high and low. If there a short cut I had found it, I will hit it so that you will appear again, but there is no easy way around it. Cause you donÂ’t bring me flower anymore.......<br><br><a href="http://home4lura.tripod.com/casa2.html" rel="nofollow">BY ===  Lura Casafino </a><br><br>Have anyone ever have a long diistance online relationships that work?
