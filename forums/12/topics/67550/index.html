Now comes the next stage of your relationship which will test the endurance as well as faithfulness of both parties.<br><br>I think in a relationship, most of the time one party will tend to "give" more affection while the other just "sit" and receive. In your case, you seem to be the one who is the "giving" side.<br><br>But to maintain a relationship, both party have to put in some effort. I suggest that you don't have to bother too much about who's giving and who's receiving. This would most probably put more strain into your relationship. Give your partner a very positive outlook in your relationship, i.e. don't always brood over things, argue etc.<br><br>Don't let your doubts ruin this relationship you have created with your loved one. Believe that your relationship will work, if you don't believe, how will it ever work out. Be positive always.</div>
