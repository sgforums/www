Anyway this is not the issue I wish to address.<br><br>As I travelled, a book appeared, teaching me stuff which I should learn. This book has lifted my <br>spirit and brought me back to my feet. For the singles who are feeling down, do ponder over the points<br>a little, cheer up and bring yourself back on your feet.<br><br>There are several chapters, but I will just summarise.<br><br>1) Assessing yourself<br>You are better than you think!<br>Recognise your capabilities<br>Don't be afraid to change<br>Don't be afraid to try<br><br>2) Facing Reality<br>Don't Regress<br>Stop the Pity Party<br>Don't try to impress peope with Make-believe<br>Adapt to the present<br>Let our expectations be real<br><br>3) Self Esteem<br>Do not think you are the loser<br>Think positive<br>Never See yourself as inadequate<br><br>4) Love and Friendship<br>Do Something about that Lonely feeling.<br>Make yourself Visible<br>Don't Precipitate Rejection<br>Just be yourSelf<br>Accept What Cannot be Changed<br>Stick with the Winners<br><br>I will just keep it short for now.<br><br>Perhaps some will flame me and question me about the points above. They are just <br>merely lifted from a book, and I say it does help me alot. Might not be able to <br>answer any questions regarding the points, but I will try defending.<br><br>It's pretty hard for people to get over a couple's day alone. I had went through this<br>and I know that feeling. For those who are single, cheer up. Life will get better, ok?<br><br>: )<br><br>Have a good week everyone!<br></p></div>

              <p>Hi Alfa and jo</p>
              <p>We are mere mortals, with given lifespan, subjected to conditions given by nature and environment.<br>Since we are just humans, we should life ourselves up as quickly as possible. Limited lifespan leh!</p>
              <p>When I made the firm decision, I was worried with lots of things. Will I be old and lonely when I <br>touch 40? But hey, don't worry about the future things that is not going to happen yet. It just makes <br>you unhappy. Think present and plan future, not worry for both. Take a step at a time man.</p>
              <p><br>Anyway puppy, I am not talking about self esteem of loud mouth muther fukers, I am talking bout<br>those who wish to be kept alone on side, and preferably invisible to others.</p>
              <p>Honestly, those loud mouth people might also be suffering from low self esteem too. They are<br>just covering up their low self with fake confidence and make believes!</p>
              <p>Take Charlie Brown and Lucy. Imagine.....</p>
