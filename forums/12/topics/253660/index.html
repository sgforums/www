Contact some of you and the girl's mutual friends and discuss how to convince her that this guy is a bastard.  It is more convincing to let her listen to the opinions of those she believes to be neutral parties than yourself who has an interest in the girl.<br><br>2.  If convincing her does not work, obtain concrete proof of the old guy's activities.  e.g photo of him kissing another girl etc...<br><br>3.  If she still stubbornly refuses to listen to reason, then show whatever photos/info you have obtained to her parents.  All parents love their children and will usually take the necessary action to put and end to this.<br></div>

Recently she just went out with the 30+ year old guy. This 30+ year old guy, is <span style="color: red;"> <span class="large">attached with another girl.</span> </span> But yet, this guy always drove his car all the way to find this girl and to offer to bring her out to eat and drink water and have a ride. but most sickening thing is here, the guy kissed my fren for a few times but my fren turned away from yet, also there are a few times both of them nearly did something wrong.<br><br>So people please advice me what i can do to save this girl i really dun wan to see her get hurt cause she will defitnetly be in the losing end, her friends and I had came out with a plan of finding her and advice to her properly but i really fear its useless! forumers please advice me what to do to prevent the guy to keep finding her?<br></div></blockquote>Knowing the man has a gf already and she still goes out with him? That shows what kind of character she is. Itchy and greedy. Itchy because waiting to get laid. Greedy because the man driving a car and giving her treats.<br><br>So, your friend tells you about their outing eh? Even to the point of telling you the guy been kissing her and also to the point they almost do 'that' thing? If you two are that close do you really need help in telling her that 30 year old man was a pervert? And what is so pervasive with the behavior of the man when your friend literally asked for it.<br><br>Honestly, if she kena 'jiak' by the man, she deserved it. I don't have any pity for this type of girl who 'tam jiak tam lim'. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>she already knows that shes going out with a perpetual attached man, so she knows what shes getting into . it's her fault that she just ignores the end outcome of this relationship. so if something happens to her. you are not inclined to help, because you tried to help her and she blatantly disregards it.</div>
