              <p>Hello. Found this site =D. pls go easy on me cos this is my first post.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>kk, last time my siblings ain't like this the last time. Me and my sister were really bonded at that time. She often jio me out to her friends and sometimes just her alone. But i always preferf to go with her alone, her friends are ok but i still to be with her alone as in just two of us walk here and there. She is like my best friend. I really love it when she called me out to go with her to shop or whatever. But ever since i keep on sleep in her room and like do some stuff in her room. She looks kind of irritated. And that time i sit next to her during dinner, she would switch seats even when sitting on couch watching tv.</p>
              <p>She would close her door even. I dont get it. Why a sudden change of mood. I really love her but this is not i wanted. And the most embarrassing part is when i touch her as in hold her hands or accidentaly touch her, she would totally jerk off and like clean swipe off her hand. omg. what was that all about?</p>
              <p>Now is my heart getting more and more darker or something like that. She is getting away to uni in about a month or so. And she can't wait to get out, thats what she said. I was so hurt. I really going to miss her but what the hell is wrong with her</p>
              <p>Does your siblings sometime change mood? </p>

              <p>It's like that. When both of you were younger, it's natural to be closer to each other, but when grown up, things start to change more or less. Moreover, you are a guy, and I believe she doesn't feel comfortable having a guy (regardless of whether you are her brother or not) to get touchy or too close with her.</p>
              <p>To me, you sound like you love her more like a lover rather than a sibling's love. I dunno, maybe she feels the same way too, that's why she's now reacting this way. Give her some space and a bit of respect for her privacy.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">At this age you shouldn't be sleeping in her room and doing your stuff there already - it is her private space.  </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Instead of being clingy, you should give her some personal space.</p>

              <p>Face the fact that humans do grow up and have other pirioties. She is gonna have a boyfriend, you are gonna have your own wife. Utimately sibilings relationship is gonna be affected. Its all part of growing up.</p>
              <p>If you treat her as family, just let her go. She has a brain of her own and old enough to think. Rashly talking to her or confronting her will only worsen your relationship. Till then send her a sms once in a while maybe to come back for dinner or something. Your are still family after all. Chat about how are you doing and stuff.</p>
              <p>Not doing chlidish things like hold her hand etc..... Please.....</p>
              <p>However if the love is not family love and its the type of romantic love. Please ignore the above.</p>

              <p>when you are still children, you dun have concept of
              selfishness, greedy, jealousy, envy etc. when you grow up as an
              adult, you have all these selfish feelings and thoughts. that is
              why a lot of adults are not close to their family, as they are
              always quarrelling over a small issue, not to mention money
              matters, ownership of house/flat and inheritance.</p>
