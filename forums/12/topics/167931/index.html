Makes everyone unhappy.<br><br>Just go with the flow i guess. Everyone behaves differently when in a relationship. It's not wrong to want to spend time with gf, honeymoon period or beyond, coz hey, she's the girlfren, right. Bound to hold a special place. This relationship cannot be compared with relationship with frens, and see which one stronger. There's a chance it would not last, yes, but that's not the point.<br><br>As brothers, we just need to be there for one another lar. If for some reason, your friend comes running to you for advice or consolation coz of relationship problems, try not to tekan him lar. If he doesn't think of you as brother, he wouldn't have come to you also. And a brudder in need is a brudder indeed.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm....<br>-pat pat- It is a horrible feeling. When I was younger, my friends (girls) used to complain that about me too.<br><br>I felt very resentful cos... at that time, I was studying overseas, and carrying on a long distance relationship and the little bit of time I had in Sg I felt I needed to treasure with my bf then, and I could not understand why they didn't understand - afterall, its like our friendship was here to STAY right? I didn't realise then I was taking my friends for granted.<br><br>But as time passes by, and bfs come and go, I realise its my friends that have become a permanent fixture in my life. And when I was single, they (the attached ones) actually put in the effort to make me go out with them, so I won't feel lonely. and even though I was the 'lightbulb', they never made me feel this way.<br><br>I think unfortunately this is a learning curve for your friend. Don't give up on him right now, cos I think what he is assuming is that the friendship in the group will take care of itself without him putting in the effort. A silly way to think no doubt.<br><br>Perhaps you can attempt to talk to him honestly MAN-to-MAN about it. Say you are concerned about his work, and you know, while you feel happy that he have found a girl he can settle down with, it is healthy to have friends outside of a relationship. Ask him to bring the girls along. Ask them if the girls got friends you can ALL hang out with. -patpat- dont give up on ur friends just yet ba.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the comments and advice but for now i'll just keep away from him. He's making up to many excuses which IMHO are really lame. To think i helped him out with so many things; not that i ask anything tangible or intangible in return.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by nullifi3d:</div><div class="quote_body">Long story short; 4 of us were pretty close and we were given a name for the group whcih i won't reveal (not that its any significanct). So recently 2 of the members got attached, and i really mean attached with their only free times being spent with their gfs.<br>First few months were understandable cos its termed as the honeymoon period. Now its just a little bit tiresome. The other single member and myself are usually the ones at the group meetings. Everytime we call them out be it the weekday or weekend its always the same thing "I'm meeting my gal". If this goes on i'll be the one saying "Look we wun call u, but u call us if u wanna go out, and then we'll decide if we're free".  I know it sounds a little unfair but both their gfs are in the same school. One of them skips lecture but still goes to sch to meet the gf; eventually asking me to take notes and collect the lecture notes. I'm a human so naturally i feel like shit. The other single guy and myself both feel the same way.<br>Guys for one thing always say this "No matter what, even if i'm attached i'll still find time for the mates". How wrong can they be.<br>Maybe a few comments or advice. Erm, we're mostly adults right? So i might be able to take a few levels of bashing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div></blockquote>If he has decided to spend more time with you guys and not his gf, I suppose you won't be the one writing in here but his gf...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> "</div>
