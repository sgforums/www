At first i thought your parents is going to take your money from your wallet, but instead they see no money they give you some. You should feel happy that your parents is still worried about you not having enough money for your own self, thus giving you money. Other people dont have such privileges liao. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>But anyway, i also suffer the same prob, scared no money to support GF (look at my post and you will know. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) Hmm, like some people had said, those girls who only see you got money then go to you, see you no money kick you until dunno where, these girls dun wan oso good. They dont love you, they love your $$$. But those girls who see you no money but still stick to you, buy super glue and glue her to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are serving the stupid NS,hence living off your parents should not be too much since NS is LL have to serve one loh,not your fault.<br>As for whether u have enough money or not,i think it common sense for girls to understand that NSF are lowly pay,if they really think in that way then it better off to be single,on the other hand if u met an understanding girl,then it should mean that this girl might be the one whom can be together for long,in a way it help u to test whether this woman is the right one or not.</div>
