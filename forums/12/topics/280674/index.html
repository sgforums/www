I had to seek medical help to ensure its not heart disease as women's symptoms are different from men. I was prescribed relaxant. It took a couple of months to get back to normal and I had visited my doctor a number of times as it does recurr. Besides that, even though its been about 1+ months maybe 2, I had a small relaspe and immediately I had to calm myself down, take deep breaths and not think about the issues. Relax totally. Then the chest tightness slowly went away</div>

I really think it's about time you stopped searching for alternative answers from a group of people who can only guess and worrying yourself, it's clearly having a big effect on your life so SEE A DOCTOR. please.</div>

Even if doctors and medical advice may seem impersonal or inappropriate these people are trained, following hundreds of years of research to provide you with the best advice they possibly can, there is no substitute for someone who knows what they're talking about. Tell a doctor everything you've told us and they won't just turn you away, they may just give you advice, they may give you medication, they may refer you to a psychologist or other specialist but the important thing is they do know what they're talking about and it's real, beneficial advice, not 'life experience' and thus it is based around YOU not other people.<br>Making theories about your problem and listening to other peoples theories can only worry you further, and whether it's panic attacks or not that is never beneficial to you. You really have to stop avoiding real advice from someone who's trained to give it. Don't be scared of what they might say, you've got the rest of your life to live - don't let something that can be treated and helped get in the way of that.</div>
