She asks why I can't go out to her living room and watch TV with her mum or do something else. She dun understand why I have to visit sgforums everyday. She even ask me whether I have cyber bf/gf on sgforums. Who else have this problem?</div></blockquote>i had that problem too...<br><br>not that we surf net,,, but that my ex would disappear into my room when he reached my place and i will be torned between going to spend time with him or stay with my mum outside...<br><br>laoda99, u have to remember this. no gal's parents will be ok with their daughter and her bf spending all their time in a room alone!<br><br>besides, to get the parents to like you, u have to make effort. so stay in the living room, make friends with her parents...<br><br>the thing abt cyber gf, she is feeling neglected. so if u treasure this relationship, u will have to make sacrifices.<br><br>my first ex used to do this too... i'll go over to his place to spend time with him, but he'll end up spending time with his games and i ended up with the tv!!! its very irritating and feels somewhat less important compared to a game!!</div>

To be rather extreme, is she insecure about something and perhaps just wants some form of affirmation or something?<br><br>Or maybe she's hoping you spend some time or oppurtunity to talk to her mom or something? Interact with her or her family members instead of strangers online?<br><br>To you maybe sgforums, to her it may seem like something else because she doesn't understand or see it the way you do.</div>
