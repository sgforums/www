While u r relief from ur problems, ur love ones will be crying away for u, thinking of u, praying for u...<br>U shldn't avoid the problems u face, suicide is a coward act that only foolish pple think of. Everyone have the right to live, and shld live the fullest. Ur mother give birth to u hoping u can be a useful person, but I are going to take ur precious life away from her and the rest.<br>STOP THAT THINKING, FACE YOUR PROBLEMS BRAVELY.<br>Remember "things will straighten when the boat reach the jetty."<br><br>------------------<br>--Appreciate what you have now and not what you don't--</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dont be such a loser to think of committing suicide just to run away from yr problems.<br><br>to put things in perspective, there are only 2 really important events in your life; the 1st being yr birth and the 2nd being yr death; everything else is secondary: wealth, success and even marriage, are secondary.<br><br>it is pathetic of u to seek death just because of secondary problems and yr actions are an insult to those struggling to live on. i look down on those who end their own lives after their bfs/gfs dump them, as well as those who kill themselves over monetary problems.<br><br>if u follow their footsteps u are weaker than an insect, cos even an insect knows better than to deliberately take its own life.<br><br>wake up yr idea loser. dont spend yr time feeling sorry for yrself. get yr dad to give u a tight slap if u need it.<br><br>I can provide 2 absolute and extreme solutions to yr problem.<br><br>1. if its about money: declare yrself bankrupt and work from there.<br><br>2. if its abt relationships(which ever kind): become a monk/nun and detach yrself from the tiring world.<br><br>seek these possible alternatives before u try anything else.<br><br>[This message has been edited by userid (edited 10 May 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by userid (edited 10 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey man, I believe sucidal thoughts do occur in a lot of people's mind. Be it just a flash of thought or a reckless decision... but it all boils down to one big question. Do you dare do it? Of course, a lot of other problems will come along once you leave this world. It is just that you are no longer there to face it or see it. Escaping? Yes, definitely.<br><br>I agree that it is hard to face your problems one by one when you have already given up on yourself... not to mention people around you. You have no one to turn to and no one is trustworthy anymore. Well... I won't ask for your age but I can reveal mine. Still 19, I guess it's kinda early to part from this place I call Earth.<br><br>Let's just diverse yourself in other things first. Occupy your mind and let your problems subside on their own. When they come back vaguely to you someday, you know that you have already gotten them over.<br><br>Of course... it may sound simple and easy than to do it. Well, give it a shot. Just try. Before you give others a chance, give yourself one.<br><br>------------------<br>As long as I know how to love, I know I'll be alive. I've got all my life to live... I've got all my love to give... I will survive. I will survive!<br><br>I can't forgive; can't forget; can't give in... What Went Wrong? Cause you said this was right... You fucked up my life!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Paperdoll,<br><br>Though I have never posted in this thread, I have been following this on a everyday basis. I Dunno if you're still looking at it, but heyz.. look around you.. Look at the people around you.. Even on this forum.. Open your eyes and see that there are so many people who actually care about you. So many people that you don't know. So many people waiting for you to know them to share a part of your life with them. They are all there for you... Your family will be there for you too.. Your grandmother, your mother... all of them.. Even I will be here for you too even if you do not know me.<br><br>Isn't there warmth and happiness to know so many people out there who care for you?? why would people want to spend their time to read and get to know who you feel?? For fun?? no way manz. I believe for 95% of them, they want you to feel better.. They want to be there for you. To show you that there are things in this world worth living for. To show you that this is not a cruel world like you expect it to be... all it just take is a little opening up to us or even just one of us... it will make you life a lot lighter and make you days a lot brighter.<br><br>We offer our hands... We want to help.. We love to make you feel better.. and we love you. But if you don't even reply to us we will never know how are you feeling.. We don't even know you in person, we have to know something before we can start working in it. There are some trained counsellors in here. Even for me, I'm currently a learning psychologist. We care for you and we love you. We will be here for you.. and it's just for you to stretch out your hand for us to make a rainbow together, after the little black cloud has poured over you... We'll be here and I'll be here...<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)
