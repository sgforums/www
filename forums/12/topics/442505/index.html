                  ITS LEGAL TO PARK!!! BEWARE PARKING OUTSIDE 43 EDEN GROVE!!!</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Dear all,</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I have a really traumatizing incident that just occurred to
                  share with all drivers, would-be drivers, or anyone that is interested.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Just now at about 9.30pm, I went to the curry house along
                  Sunshine Terrace with my friends for a dinner after work. As there are no
                  parking sites around the area, so I took a turn to behind the private estates
                  at Eden Grove. I drove on and found a nice spot with a single white line drawn
                  over (legal parking after 7pm). It does have a rubbish bin placed at the spot,
                  but very near to the edge of the road, which I thought is fine and could fit my
                  vehicle in that space. Thus I just parked at that spot.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">After ensuring that my vehicle was parked correctly, not
                  obstructing the traffic flow or the gates of the occupants in the house, I left
                  my vehicle and went for my dinner.<span>  </span>At
                  about 11.20pm, I came and retrieve my vehicle. From far, I saw the house that I
                  parked my car in front of was brightly lit. Thus I know that I might be ticked
                  off for parking the vehicle outside their house, which they might not like.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I went over and I saw this lady in her 40’s, reading a
                  newspaper. I called out to her, telling her that I am sorry for taking up the
                  space, apologized to her. She immediately stared me in the eye and gave me a
                  very unhappy look. I get into the car and immediately drove off.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">After driving about 2-3 mins, I feel the steering is always
                  steering to the left. I tried to position it back, but it still give the same
                  problem. Then I heard a “thup thup thup” sound. I stopped my car at a bus stop
                  to check.<span>  </span>To my dismay, MY PASSENGER
                  SIDE FRONT AND REAR TYRES WERE PUNCTURED!!! THERE ARE DIRT STUFFED UP IN MY EXHAUST
                  PIPES!!!</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">As I have no 2 spare tyres in my car, I tried my best to
                  drive my car to the nearby City Tyres to examined the tyres. As I am driving on
                  punctured tyres, the tyres were damaged easily due to the abrasions. After the
                  mechanic pumped up the tyres, they found that, there are no punctured holes and
                  there are no leaks.<span>  </span>But the two air caps
                  are gone. Someone have open the caps and let off the air. The mechanic says
                  that the tyres looks to be damaged, and it cost $350 to change each one. As I
                  dun really have that amount of cash, I asked if I use back the two tyres, is
                  that ok? They say no guarantee. No money to change, means safety at risk, I use
                  back the tyres.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I am really pissed off, and feel that it is really ugly,
                  ungracious for whoever is doing that. They could have just told me off, scold
                  me, or leave a note. Why do they have to put my life at risk. Punctured tyres
                  could have gotten me killed on the road.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">As my car was only parking outside one family’s house (again
                  I want to stress, I did not obstruct the traffic or gates), I went back to that
                  house to confront the lady whom I suspect could be the culprit, but its just a
                  suspection, not an accusation (I do not want to be sued).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">When I arrived, press the doorbell, first thing she told me
                  is my vehicle was parking in front of her house, obstructing traffic. I say,
                  no, I am sure its not! Which driver in the right mind would want to park
                  directly in front of their house gates? She said she had called LTA and have
                  taken the photos. I say ok, show me the photos. She gladly showed me the photos
                  she took from all angles of my vehicle. One of the photos she is so proud of
                  taking from inside her gates, showing boot lid of less than 20-30cm obstructing
                  her gates. She said that she will put the photos of my vehicle plate no. on
                  YouTube, STOMP, etc.<span>  </span>I ask her husband
                  to take a look at the photos to see tif there is anything wrong, he keep quiet,
                  I am sure if she put it online, you all can see there is totally nothing wrong
                  with my parking in the photos, so I am fine about that.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">She also mention that she has placed the rubbish bins there
                  to chop the place for her third car coming back to park (2 cars were inside her
                  pouch already). I told her that I will only be having my dinner which would
                  finish in an hour or two. She then relate say that last time there are cars
                  parking down there overnight, who knows what time I will be coming back.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">But I told her that she don’t own the road and I am not in
                  fault in the eyes of law to park there. Then she kept showing me the picture
                  showing my boot lid obstructing her gates. Then her husband said that there are
                  devoted religious people, and would not do such a thing and kept denying it. I
                  somehow believe the husband, but not the lady. Really in doubts. The lady was so
                  prepared for my return to confront her, the camera, the threatening of calling
                  LTA, and kept arguing that I am at fault.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Without any concrete evidence, except the obvious tell tales
                  signs… I left… an angry and disappointed man.<span>  </span>I don’t know whether its obvious or not, but I don’t expect that the
                  occupants from the far end corner would play a prank on my vehicle lah. What do
                  you people think? If you were in my shoes, who will you suspect? Could it be a
                  dog passing by, thought its nipples on my car wheels, get horny and bite them
                  away and suck all the air out?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I have since reported police and they treat the case as
                  mischief. Once they do more investigations around that area, they will get back
                  to me. But I think it will end up being an unsolved case.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I have tried to do a search online to see whether there are
                  similar cases in Singapore. To my surprise, there are many, like a scratch on
                  the car, rubbish bins chopping the place, rubbish bins placed at the driver
                  door by the owners, industrial glues on the wind screens of the cars with the
                  notes, etc. So many.<span>  </span>To think, I will
                  never be the first, and never the last, but just the unlucky one.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Having said all these, I do understand the frustrations and
                  agony that the house owners have when there is no parking space for their
                  vehicles when they lived there. But they should not prank on the safety of the
                  drivers. We also have our families to feed on. What if we really passed on in
                  the accidents due to these unforgiven pranks, what would become of our families?
                  I am really traumatized by this behavior.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I am looking forward to inform the authorities including the
                  newspapers and TV programmes about this. Hope that through this incident, it
                  could allow people to realized that it is indeed wrong, very wrong to do that.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

              <p>Car owner at fault lah.</p>
              <p>1.He park his car so close to the property driveway entrance and exit already wrong.  Car need turing aisle to safely get out and in without using opposite lane . At least must allow sufficient turning space lah.</p>
              <p>Eden grove lane is so narrow, of cors people get pissed off lah.</p>
              <p>Next time cannot find parking, then go somewhere else to eat. Singapore only one stall selling your dinner meh ?</p>
              <p>Actually not just for 43 Eden grove... anywhere else also same de.</p>
              <p>If it's really just for a short period of time.. have the courtesy to tell the property owner if it's ok you park there.</p>
              <p>If you nice to people , they will be nice to you back. If they not happy , you can demand you have the right because it's legal.. in the end you still have to pay for the intrusion via street justice. It's not paid parking some more.</p>

              <p>You did the correct thing in making a police report. That would be one mark against that house. Lets hope the next victim also make a police report, and build up a case against that house occupants.</p>

              <p>BEWARE WHEN PARKING ALONG ROADS IN PRIVATE ESTATES EVEN
              IF ITS LEGAL TO PARK!!! BEWARE PARKING OUTSIDE 43 EDEN GROVE!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dear all,</p>
              <p>I have a really traumatizing incident that just
              occurred to share with all drivers, would-be drivers, or anyone
              that is interested.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just now at about 9.30pm, I went to the curry house
              along Sunshine Terrace with my friends for a dinner after work. As
              there are no parking sites around the area, so I took a turn to
              behind the private estates at Eden Grove. I drove on and found a
              nice spot with a single white line drawn over (legal parking after
              7pm). It does have a rubbish bin placed at the spot, but very near
              to the edge of the road, which I thought is fine and could fit my
              vehicle in that space. Thus I just parked at that spot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After ensuring that my vehicle was parked correctly,
              not obstructing the traffic flow or the gates of the occupants in
              the house, I left my vehicle and went for my
              dinner.<span> </span> At about 11.20pm, I came and retrieve my
              vehicle. From far, I saw the house that I parked my car in front of
              was brightly lit. Thus I know that I might be ticked off for
              parking the vehicle outside their house, which they might not
              like.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I went over and I saw this lady in her 40’s, reading a
              newspaper. I called out to her, telling her that I am sorry for
              taking up the space, apologized to her. She immediately stared me
              in the eye and gave me a very unhappy look. I get into the car and
              immediately drove off.</p>
              <p>After driving about 2-3 mins, I feel the steering is
              always steering to the left. I tried to position it back, but it
              still give the same problem. Then I heard a “thup thup thup” sound.
              I stopped my car at a bus stop to check.<span> </span> To my
              dismay, MY PASSENGER SIDE FRONT AND REAR TYRES WERE PUNCTURED!!!
              THERE ARE DIRT STUFFED UP IN MY EXHAUST PIPES!!!</p>
              <p>As I have no 2 spare tyres in my car, I tried my best
              to drive my car to the nearby City Tyres to examined the tyres. As
              I am driving on punctured tyres, the tyres were damaged easily due
              to the abrasions. After the mechanic pumped up the tyres, they
              found that, there are no punctured holes and there are no
              leaks.<span> </span> But the two air caps are gone. Someone
              have open the caps and let off the air. The mechanic says that the
              tyres looks to be damaged, and it cost $350 to change each one. As
              I dun really have that amount of cash, I asked if I use back the
              two tyres, is that ok? They say no guarantee. No money to change,
              means safety at risk, I use back the tyres.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am really pissed off, and feel that it is really
              ugly, ungracious for whoever is doing that. They could have just
              told me off, scold me, or leave a note. Why do they have to put my
              life at risk. Punctured tyres could have gotten me killed on the
              road.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As my car was only parking outside one family’s house
              (again I want to stress, I did not obstruct the traffic or gates),
              I went back to that house to confront the lady whom I suspect could
              be the culprit, but its just a suspection, not an accusation (I do
              not want to be sued).</p>
              <p>When I arrived, press the doorbell, first thing she
              told me is my vehicle was parking in front of her house,
              obstructing traffic. I say, no, I am sure its not! Which driver in
              the right mind would want to park directly in front of their house
              gates? She said she had called LTA and have taken the photos. I say
              ok, show me the photos. She gladly showed me the photos she took
              from all angles of my vehicle. One of the photos she is so proud of
              taking from inside her gates, showing boot lid of less than 20-30cm
              obstructing her gates. She said that she will put the photos of my
              vehicle plate no. on YouTube, STOMP, etc.<span> </span> I ask
              her husband to take a look at the photos to see tif there is
              anything wrong, he keep quiet, I am sure if she put it online, you
              all can see there is totally nothing wrong with my parking in the
              photos, so I am fine about that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She also mention that she has placed the rubbish bins
              there to chop the place for her third car coming back to park (2
              cars were inside her pouch already). I told her that I will only be
              having my dinner which would finish in an hour or two. She then
              relate say that last time there are cars parking down there
              overnight, who knows what time I will be coming back.</p>
              <p>But I told her that she don’t own the road and I am not
              in fault in the eyes of law to park there. Then she kept showing me
              the picture showing my boot lid obstructing her gates. Then her
              husband said that there are devoted religious people, and would not
              do such a thing and kept denying it. I somehow believe the husband,
              but not the lady. Really in doubts. The lady was so prepared for my
              return to confront her, the camera, the threatening of calling LTA,
              and kept arguing that I am at fault.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Without any concrete evidence, except the obvious tell
              tales signs… I left… an angry and disappointed
              man.<span> </span> I don’t know whether its obvious or not,
              but I don’t expect that the occupants from the far end corner would
              play a prank on my vehicle lah. What do you people think? If you
              were in my shoes, who will you suspect? Could it be a dog passing
              by, thought its nipples on my car wheels, get horny and bite them
              away and suck all the air out?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have since reported police and they treat the case as
              mischief. Once they do more investigations around that area, they
              will get back to me. But I think it will end up being an unsolved
              case.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have tried to do a search online to see whether there
              are similar cases in Singapore. To my surprise, there are many,
              like a scratch on the car, rubbish bins chopping the place, rubbish
              bins placed at the driver door by the owners, industrial glues on
              the wind screens of the cars with the notes, etc. So
              many.<span> </span> To think, I will never be the first, and
              never the last, but just the unlucky one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Having said all these, I do understand the frustrations
              and agony that the house owners have when there is no parking space
              for their vehicles when they lived there. But they should not prank
              on the safety of the drivers. We also have our families to feed on.
              What if we really passed on in the accidents due to these
              unforgiven pranks, what would become of our families? I am really
              traumatized by this behavior.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am looking forward to inform the authorities
              including the newspapers and TV programmes about this. Hope that
              through this incident, it could allow people to realized that it is
              indeed wrong, very wrong to do that.</p>
              <p> </p>
