I must say that eventually, both of you exhibited the same set of vulnerabilities and cracks, in which the negative trait attracted one another on higher subconscious level and coupled with haste, it brought about such huge drastic changes to your love relationship.<br><br>It's like making bold decision/s that would probably shock the entire world, but you seemed to know what you are doing.<br><br>We attract the qualities we exude - CloUdiSm.<br><br>Chances are, there are dissatisfaction in both relationship, creating a suppressed desire to liberalize your current status quo, probably the result of the then-nature of both now-defunct relationship. I can't say that this feeling you are having will withstand the test of time because it's still too early to stamp promise. (Of course if this is largely Uranus-influenced, it will probably not sustain).<br><br>If her appearance in your life could easily destroy your then-relationship, it probably revealed that the relationship, in the first place, doesn't hold much value. Looking from higher altitude - I would say that her appearance in your life is likely a reflection of your then-inane-relationship, suggesting to you - not because she is The One - but because your then-relationship is probably is already journey in trouble waters to Hades, in which why you two would readily accept each other, despite being attached to different partners separately.<br><br>Her presence acts as a catalysis to show you the discontentment and dissatisfaction you had in your then-relationship.<br><br>If I put one spoilt orange with another that is decaying - in comparison, the spoilt orange may appear a better choice to you, but not necessarily a better choice when you consumed it.<br><br>Think about it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
