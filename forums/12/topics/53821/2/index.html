It's all about perception and attitude. We may have different adjectives and use of language but ultimately it boils down to the same simple essence of choice. Beauty ( or rather destitution in this case) is in the eyes of the beholder.<br><br>Although I did say it takes guts to kill oneself, it does require guts to continue striving through obstacles. If one can master enough courage to end it all, one would have enough to face life lessons as well. Unless..we are talking about a person who can't master courage to do either. In that case, I would advise: Sit it out... you'll find your direction in good time.</div>
