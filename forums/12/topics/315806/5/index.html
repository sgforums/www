              <p><br>NOTHING will ever justify adultery.If it can be justified,it will not qualify in a court of law to be used as grounds for divorce in the first place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Both parents have an obligation to the children,especially when they have not reach the age of maturity.In my view,the needs of the child should be placed above their own.People always praise motherhood,why?Because of that selfless protection of their children which naturally comes with motherhood.You seldom hear fatherhood being glorified...with man tending to place their own needs above others,it isn't surprising that they view their wife's TLC towards the children as being selfish and biased.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If the father is truly jealous about his OWN children receiving more attention than him from his wife,then I seriously question his ability and preparedness to raise one child,much less two.It takes patience and devotion to raise a child.If he fails to see that common goal that he should be sharing with his wife and uses it as a reason to accuse his wife of one-sided attention,then what could be said of his marriage vows?An inconvenience for him?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>His answer?</p>

              <p><br>So when your wife devotes her life to raise your child. You show your gratitude by sleeping with another woman ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, we all know pregnant woman can still have sex.</p>
              <p>But have you considered that perhaps it's not very enjoyable for HER to be having sex with a big belly ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you want your wife to just open her legs for you , just so you can enjoy yourself ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tsk tsk.. selfish men and their selfish ego.</p>

              <p>ya agree with the 2 people above!</p>
              <p>some people blame their mischief on their partner, not gentle enough, not caring enough etc. crap. it's already unethical enough to have affairs outside, still have the face to blame others for his own mischief!</p>

              <p><br>I must say my posting is not made only to console or encourage the victim. It is all done in good faith and I hope that some sincere words will find its way into her head. As quoted by you, we do not really know what is happening or who is at fault. I chose to believe what she had painted in the way I would believe a friend. Nobody would know for sure what is right or wrong. Ultimately she would have to face her own music. Lets just pray for her to be able to make her own decision and to live with it without regrets. Whatever it is, I would give her my support, however silent it may be, all the way.  ELIM, give it your best and don't look back......</p>
