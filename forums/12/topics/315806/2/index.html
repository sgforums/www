              <p>Its really sad and hurting...</p>
              <p>The lawyer says most likely I will get custody of the kids,
              but i also worry about the outcome. Some of my friends have been
              telling me they will give 1 kid to each parent. I really
              worry....</p>
              <p>Now the lawyer is giving me time to get the proof. But I really
              don't know how to go  about it. Getting PI is far too ex. And
              there is no guarantee that they will get the evidence. And also i
              will need the $$ for my bb...</p>
              <p>Why must he do this to me??? All this years of being together, I
              have never ask him to buy me any thing, not even branded stuff. But
              he himself is wearing branded!</p>
              <p>He will spurge on things he likes, but never buys for me and the
              kid. I stick to him even thou I know he has no $. Going thru so
              much with him and yet he do this to me!</p>

              <p>Sigh....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok...here's a coupel of tips.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) get a decent lawyer. You need, just pm me for my number and I will speak to you and advise you who can take you on.  You need PI, I also have, though its not necessary to get a PI, you are afterall not challenging a divorce settlement that is in the millions of $$$.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) I dont need to know your full story.  But kindly do not lie to the lawyers &amp; the PI or you may find yoruself in deeper shit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) You just need to take note of the following.  You are Singaporean, he is Singaporean, both your kids are Singaporean and all of you are not Muslim.  The date and time you have conversations with your hub and your understanding of that conversation, preferably with few choice quotes of him regarding those conversations that convey his intentions.  Jot down those dates and times and quotes as much as possible and bring them to the Lawyer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Receipts, who pay for what and when.  Preferably some of his credit card statements to indicate when and how he was infidel are crucial to establish his infidelity of this marriage.  Dont even need evidence of them in bed.  (thats all hype by the drama series.)</p>

              <p>Obviously, you have never read the book "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus" by John Gray.</p>
              <p>Your answer lies in the story "The Knight In Shining Armor".</p>
              <p>It seems you have ceased to be the princess in distress, and he has found the woman who lives in the village.</p>
              <p>" Remembering that within every man is a knight in shining armor.... Although a man may appreciate caring and assistance sometimes, too much of it will lessen his confidence or turn him off."</p>
              <p>I am not saying it is your fault, if fundamentally a man is unfaithful, he will commit unfaithful acts no matter what you do.</p>

              <p>Dear Elim20.</p>
              <p>I'm sorry to hear of the developments in your life.</p>
              <p>As pointed out by jojo, save for negative factors that you may not have revealed, I would not worry too much about custody issues.</p>
              <p>Further, as mentioned by viciouskitty, there is NO requirement that you show evidence of him making out with the girl <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in bed</span>. I have not encountered a single case (of the few I had been engaged with) where proof of sexual activities as they occured were ever presented before the court. I am confident that photos of them being intimate in public, or entering-exiting a motel is sufficient. Fact is, if your claim is not rebutted in the AEIC (although I would suspect that a competent defendant and/or his counsel would would you to the burden of proof), such may be more than sufficient.</p>
              <p>By virtue that you are represented by counsel, I would not give heed to any of my above legal comments nor would I bother with those provided by others. I would, however, be very cautious of what I post on the forum if I were in your position.</p>

              <p>Thanks for all your advises. I really appreciate it.</p>
              <p>It'ts really touching to know there are people who cares... :)</p>
              <p>I trusted him a lot. Maybe I was too naive and stupid. Thinking that he will change for the better for me and the kid. Before marriage, he wasn't like that. Or maybe its due to that time he did not have $, so he could not do anything funny. But now the situation is different. He is loaded with $$$!! Do all man fool around when they have $$$?</p>
              <p>Yes, I have the support from my family. But none of my friends know what I am going thru now. I find it shameful to tell them, altough it was my husband who did me wrong first.</p>
              <p>I really want a divorce now. But having diffculty gathering evidence.</p>
              <p>My lawyer says she will fight for monthly maintenance of 2k for me and the kid. For the housing, most likely i will get 70%. I going to make him pay more! Since he told me $ is of no issue to him!</p>
              <p>Now i have to find out more about the PI and custody of my kids. I hope the judge won't separate us!!!</p>

              <p><br>Greetings, Xavier1979.</p>
              <p>Pursuant to your claim that "The main reason for a divorce is<strong> </strong>often <strong>irreconcilable differences" </strong>[emphasis, yours], it has to be mentioned that in Sinapore, there is only ONE Ground for divorce - <strong>Irretrievable breakdown of marriage.  </strong>And for which, any of the following 5 factors may be used to support the ground / reason for divorce:</p>
              <dl>
              <p> </p>
              (a) that the defendant has committed adultery and the plaintiff finds it intolerable to live with the defendant;</dl><dl>
              <p> </p>
              (b) that the defendant has behaved in such a way that the plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to live with the defendant;</dl><dl>
              <p> </p>
              (c) that the defendant has deserted the plaintiff for a continuous period of at least 2 years immediately preceding the filing of the writ;</dl><dl>
              <p> </p>
              (d) that the parties to the marriage have lived apart for a continuous period of at least 3 years immediately preceding the filing of the writ and the defendant consents to a judgment being granted;</dl><dl>
              <p> </p>
              (e) that the parties to the marriage have lived apart for a continuous period of at least 4 years immediately preceding the filing of the writ.</dl>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope the above helps.</p>

              you will almost certainly have the kids.....sg law is like that...a case last year had this judge saying to a man "your ex-wife is for sure a lousy wife, given her adultery but that doesn't mean she's a bad mother..." the kids went to the mother because she's been the primary care giver..... 
              
              so long as you can show that you are the one taking care of the kids more than your husband, then you will keep them...women's charter very powerful, sometimes too powerful.....
              
              i don't believe in reincarnation, don't think that you owe him or whatever, look forward, especially since you still have an unborn child....when this is done and settled, maybe you can create a blog to shame him...that'll be the pay back....
