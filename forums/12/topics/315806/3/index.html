              <p>Why bother looking for evidence? Adultery is just 1 means for Divorce. Why not file for unreasonable behaviour? Talk to your lawyer again, I am sure she would be in a better position to advise you. As for custody, the court will normally grant it to the woman if she can show proof that she is capable of looking after the children and providing for them in a reasonable way. Moreover both are of a tender age, and children this young would normally require a loving mother figure around to care for them compared to that of a male. Check and discuss it with your legal advisor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for that jerk, just leave him alone. Let him atone for his own sins. If he thinks that he is doing great now, so be it. He will get his due returns. I have a strong belief in KARMA, and if you have done your best to hold this marriage together, tell yourself that it is his loss, not yours!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me share something with you. Your postings were shown to me by my son. He felt sad that this had to happen to someone and he wanted me to reply. He probably felt the pain cos I am also a divorcee with 2 kids. I had no money when I left my matrimonial home. I had to borrow from siblings and friends to hire a lawyer. Luckily she was kind and allowed me to pay in installments. I fought and was granted custody for both kids. My lawyer stood by me and told me that she will never respect a woman who does not want her own child. It was a hard time for both the children and myself. We had to adapt to many new things which we used to take for granted. Luckily during that time, I had trust in my religion and it really saw me through all those bad patches. Its been a couple of years since my divorce. I am glad to say that I am happy as I am now, having the children by my side. Life ain't a bed of roses, neither is it a bed of thorns.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So please renew your faith in yourself and forge on. You will succeed, and you will find new happiness ... </p>

              <p>Dear Benzer. </p>
              <p>Adultry falls under the broader umbrealla of Unreasonable Behavior.</p>
              <p>Unreasonable Behavior being the basis for claim and Adultry being the facts supporting the claim.</p>
              <p>And in spite of all the support expressed herein, I will be VERY WARY of providing comfort or support to the affected party here by simple virtue that we do not know the full facts of the matter. It is amazing how certain untold details find their way into court only to stun representing counsel.</p>

              <p>Not that i dont feel bad for you...i do, but are you sure you're old
              enough to be married? If a man and a woman travel together they must be
              sleeping together too? That sounds kind of childish. So does "China woman are vicious"..really? They're all exactly the same? Sorry, I dont want to be mean but it just pissed me off.</p>

              <p>Well, for now, i suggest a few solutions.</p>
              <p>1. Dont arouse the attention of your hubby. Act normal. If he finds that something fishy is going on. most probably he will stop visiting her that often/ exercise more caution</p>
              <p>2. After you get the evidence. Have 2 copies. One to the lawyer. Keep the other with a close family member (back ups). Do not confront him with the evidence.</p>
              <p>3.Get the lawyer to file an divorce letter. you can state how much you sacrificed over the past years where he was jobless. Also get him to pay the legal costs.</p>
              <p>4.Apply for personal protection under the family court. -- should he get revenge (if he's that sort of person).</p>

              <p>Well i doubt they had sex at their home, but thats really not the point. I'm just surprised a grown woman would say something like that (that a man and woman if theyre not married spend time together just to have sex). I didnt say i dont think he's cheating...but so far theres really no proof. He's just being a d*ick.</p>

              <p>Its really sad and hurting...</p>
              <p>The lawyer says most likely I will get custody of the kids,
              but i also worry about the outcome. Some of my friends have been
              telling me they will give 1 kid to each parent. I really
              worry....</p>
              <p>Now the lawyer is giving me time to get the proof. But I really
              don't know how to go  about it. Getting PI is far too ex. And
              there is no guarantee that they will get the evidence. And also i
              will need the $$ for my bb...</p>
              <p>Why must he do this to me??? All this years of being together, I
              have never ask him to buy me any thing, not even branded stuff. But
              he himself is wearing branded!</p>
              <p>He will spurge on things he likes, but never buys for me and the
              kid. I stick to him even thou I know he has no $. Going thru so
              much with him and yet he do this to me!</p>
