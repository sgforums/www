              <p>After i gave birth to our 1st child, we hardly go out on a date.
              Firstly, is cos he was jobless that time. And I have been paying
              his debts all the while. So we dun really have the extra $ to go
              out and enjoy.</p>
              <p>He just dun want to share the burden. Even when our girl was
              having high fever, he still goes out clubbing. I even have
              to tell him to go and see her. But he refused. Giving me
              excuses. Like very far, very tired! So you see, has he been a
              good father? I thot he will change for the better, but i think its
              getting worse now.</p>
              <p>Sometimes i ask him to take care of her while i bath, but he
              only know how to make her cry. He likes to pull her ear and scold
              her for nothing. How can i ask him to take care?? I have to worry,
              if he will beat her or not. So i am always there to look after

              <p>Elim, think of ur happiness before making decision. Are you still able to trust him aft this round? If not, it doesn't make sense for ur kids to grow up in tat type of family environment.</p>
              <p>Not sure how old r u, but don't think u v old la. Since u should be still young, ur journey of life still v v long. Think how r u going to live your life in future with ur kids.</p>
              <p>Some wife v forgivable while others can't trust a person if tat person misuse their trust.</p>
              <p>You should start working after delivery &amp; lead a better life. When women got $$$, we won't scare getting bully by men.</p>

              <p>I am 32 this year. He is 2 years old then me.</p>
              <p>Maybe at that moment, i was so scared of losing him. So i
                  forgave him. And I thot of our kid. I can't be that selfish. I
                  don't want my girl to grow up in a broken family. Furthermore, I
                  have already tolerated him for so many years. I thot i can
                  just forgive and forget. </p>
              <p>Then for the period, he was very good. Coming back on time,
                  bringing us out. So I thot he has make an effort to change. So when
                  he told me to try for another one, i agreed. I also wanted our
                  daughter to have another sibling.</p>
              <p>But lately i found out he has been lying to me again. I was too
                  soft-hearted to forgive him. He knows my weak points. Or maybe he
                  thinks now with another bb, I wont leave him. So he wants the best
                  of both worlds.</p>
              <p>That's why thinking of abortion, but don't have the courage to
                  do it. Since god gave it to me, I have to take good care of it. I
                  know some couples have tried very hard for a baby. But they still
                  dun have. I think it is fated...</p>
              <p>Honestly, I don't have any trust in him now. At times when he
                  tells me things, I don't know to believe or not. I don't know is he
                  telling me the truth, or lying??</p>
              <p>I dun noe how hard life is going to be, maybe I will just get
                  another part time job. Can still survive without him.</p>

              <p>Elim20,</p>
              <p>Start planning for your own future.</p>
              <p>If he doesn't want to change.. there is nothing you can do.</p>
              <p>Yes, some people stay in the marriage, because they see no difference if they get a divorce.</p>
              <p>They stay in the loveless marriage for the convenience. Since the mother has no intention of marrying another man, and the husband has a good reason not to commit into another lifetime agreement with a new woman. It's a win win deal.</p>
              <p>I can tell you are a very devoted mother, and your children are the center of your life. So, channel your energy into raising your children.</p>
              <p>If you don't love him anymore, and since he is still paying and keeping you and your children comfy, what have you got to lose ?</p>
              <p>Don't let your anger get the betta of you.</p>
              <p>If you let him go, he can happily go marry the other woman and that's what she wants isn't it ?</p>
              <p>If you know how to play your cards right, the world can be yours to play with.</p>

              <p>How will you and your children suffer ? What difference will it make if you divorce him ?</p>
              <p>The most is you don't see his LJ face anymore.</p>
              <p>If you live your life and shut him outa your own life.. but live under the same roof , what's the difference ?</p>
              <p>Letting him go emotionally .. and letting him go physically. What's the difference ?</p>
              <p>He'll just be a room mate who is paying the bills. And best yet.. you don;t need to service him anymore.. let the other woman do the job.</p>
              <p>If I am you, I'd just wait till he ask for the divorce himself.</p>
              <p>At the mean time... I continue my life with my children while enjoying his new found $$$$.. my happiness is my own doing.</p>
