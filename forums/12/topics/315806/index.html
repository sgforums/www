              <p>Not very sure. But I think you can complain to the immigration and perhaps she may get deported.</p>
              <p>But this is will not solve your problem.</p>
              <p>The problem lies with your hubby. Sit down and talk it through.. then seek marriage counseling.</p>
              <p>Go for STD checkup. You and your child may be at risk.</p>
              <p>If all else fails, I suggest you go talk to a divorce lawyer and see what are your recourse.</p>

              <p>Why are you letting this happen in your matrimonial home? You should get a PI and lawyers  advice and then with the evidence decide if you want a divorce or talk it over with your cheating man.</p>

              <p>I have actually got a lawyer. But she needs the evidence to
              proof his adultery. Gettting a PI is expensive. Need at least 4K.
              Lawyer says have to catch them on bed. Dinning together is not

              <p>I have had a talk with him last 2 weeks. He says he wants
              custody of the 2 children. But he does not even have the
              responsibility to look after them. Y he still wants the children?!!
              And he already has a woman. Will he take good care of them? Will my
              kids get bullied by the woman? China woman are vicious!</p>

              <p>And ya, he told me last month he has a bit of blood coming out

              <p>Elim20,</p>
              <p>Just because he earns more than you, doesn't mean he will have a higher chance of getting custody of the children. Your lawyer shoulda told you this.</p>
              <p>If you have had always been a good mom and never a criminal, the custody will most likely go to you.</p>
              <p>I know now is a very difficult time for you, but the most important thing right now is to keep your head clear, and consider ALL your options.</p>
              <p>I don't know what you are hoping to get out of a divorce. You must understand that a divorce need not always be ugly.</p>
              <p>Try to handle it in a civilised manner.</p>
              <p>Remind him and yourself not to use the innocent children as weapons against each other.</p>
              <p>I suggest you go check your health first. It may be highly possible that he is infected.</p>

              <p>He did not admit about his affair. He still denying. They have
              went for trips overseas without my knowledge. But I found the
              itinerary and hotel receipt. He still denies they slept in the same
              room. He very cunning and good in twisting words.</p>
              <p>I can't proof anything cos there is nothing on the hotel
              receipt. But when a man and woman travel, what can they do
              except S**????</p>
              <p>He never even brings me for holidays. I have to save every
              single cent I have to pay off his debts which we have incurred over
              the years. And he still don't appreciate it! He used to be jobless
              for a few years,  then finally found a job last year.
              This job pays him quite well, so now he has the $$$ to fool
              around!</p>
              <p>I have been wanting to divorce him since last year, cos of his
              attitude. He has a attitude problem. Very unreasonable guy. Always
              thinks he is right. Never care for our daughter. Even though when
              she is sick, he never bothers to go and see her. Then comes back
              late at night. I have been tolerating him cos of the kid.</p>
              <p>But this time, he too much! He brings the woman back home! I
              suppose it has been going on for more than 1 year!</p>
              <p>That's why i had a talk with him. I told him i want to divorce
              him, but I want my 2 kids. He will never admit to his affair. Even
              his family are telling me to close 1 eye. How to????</p>

              <p>His family will ofcors tell you to close one eye to his misdeeds. Because they are HIS family, and that's what a family do for each other. So, don't let what his family says affect you.</p>
              <p>What is most important now, is YOUR own family. You need support from YOUR own family, not his.</p>
              <p>No doubt he has dissapointed you. And no doubt his doings is unfair. It is time you decide what is best for you and your children. Take it that you owe him during your previous life, and now you have repaid your debt.</p>
              <p>Divorce is not a means of punishments for his misdeeds, it is a last resort to your own exit from your unhappy marriage to this man.</p>
              <p>Remember, it is not wise to poison the children with your hatred for this man.</p>
              <p>What is his intention after your confrontation ? Is he still keen on making the marriage work ?</p>
              <p>Some times... when a man denies his affairs, he is afraid that if he confesses , he will lose his love ones.</p>

              <p>Its really sad and hurting...</p>
              <p>The lawyer says most likely I will get custody of the kids, but i also worry about the outcome. Some of my friends have been telling me they will give 1 kid to each parent. I really worry....</p>
              <p>Now the lawyer is giving me time to get the proof. But I really don't know how to go  about it. Getting PI is far too ex. And there is no guarantee that they will get the evidence. And also i will need the $$ for my bb...</p>
              <p>Why must he do this to me??? All this years of being together, I have never ask him to buy me any thing, not even branded stuff. But he himself is wearing branded!</p>
              <p>He will spurge on things he likes, but never buys for me and the kid. I stick to him even thou I know he has no $. Going thru so much with him and yet he do this to me!</p>

              <p><br>Don't believe what friends say, thats not true, the judges usually will not seperate the siblings.  Like your lawyer said, chances are you will get custody of the kids since you are the mother, even if you cannot prove he has committed adultery.  According to the latest review of the law, you can also apply to stay in your current matrimonial home untill you give up.  Check with your lawyer on this.</p>
