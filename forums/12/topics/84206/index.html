Remember, if you love the person, trust him/her wholeheartedly. I know its hard to put it into action, but if you don't trust him/her, this relationship is a no-no right from the start. On the other hand, the problem might not lie in you. It might be that your partner has a alot of friends of the opposite sex. Get his/her assurance and again, trust him. Unless you see it with your own eyes, don't doubt him/her as that will definately strain the relationship. TRUST is the word, good luck to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Some people simply can't push it out of their system... And suppressing it might not really be such a wise choice neither.... Afterall, it's a feeling...<br><br>What you can do instead is to avoid turning your jealousy into nasty actions, outburst of emotions or harsh wildful exchange of words.... Just remember. What done CANNOT be undone.<br><br>Regarding insecurity in love... It's really quite a vast topic which would probably not be so simply covered in here. It would depends on the kinda relationship and situation you're in. The mentality of both parties and maybe even close ones around you...<br><br>Some have suggested low confidence in yourself... Well.. It could very well be one of them? Seek around and hear more on this topic... See if they fit into your own picture... This problem would usually take such a fair amount of experience and maturity in thinking... Do lots of reviews and soul-search... Try to involve the other party (not in a demanding and forceful way) if possible...<br><br>Hope things shall get better for you in time to come?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
