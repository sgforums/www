Where got rules say the moment a man ask the woman out that means he is chasing after her and must immediately make her his special?

            <div class='col-md body'>Well thanks for all the concerns and attention from all of you.<br><br>I didnÂ’t manage to meet him on Sunday, because he sprained his ankle and had to rest at home. However I managed to lunch with him alone yesterday and asked him the question. He said hand holding is just a gesture, when couples hold hands, it does not mean they are truly together. He said there have been many young couples holding hands in the streets, but that does not mean they will really end up together either. He said at this age (i.e. 33), he prefers to go slow; he didnÂ’t say he loves me but he just said he likes me. Then he wondered why I have started to ask him these questions, he asked if I am seeing someone else. I replied no, and that ended our discussion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> There wasn't much time to discuss further after lunch.<br><br>Not sure what to think, looks like there will be a period of slow moving before we hold hands.<br></div>

Even couples who have sex don't mean anything, let alone holding hands. Why do you want to rush him into a relationship when he's still coming to terms with himself?<br><br>He still goes out with you alone. It's not as if he's trying to avoid you. What more do you want? If you are in a rush to get a boyfriend, then a husband, I suggest you look for other options available.<br><br>So at least you have sort of thrashed things out. Sooner or later you will have the answer as to whether the relationship is confirmed.<br><br>doko</div>
