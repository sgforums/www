However I managed to lunch with him alone yesterday and asked him the question. He said hand holding is just a gesture, when couples hold hands, it does not mean they are truly together. He said there have been many young couples holding hands in the streets, but that does not mean they will really end up together either. He said at this age <span style="color: red;">(i.e. 33)</span>, he prefers to go slow; he didnÂ’t say he loves me but he just said he likes me. Then he wondered why I have started to ask him these questions, he asked if I am seeing someone else. I replied no, and that ended our discussion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> There wasn't much time to discuss further after lunch.<br><br>Not sure what to think, looks like there will be a period of slow moving before we hold hands.<br></div></blockquote>i thought i remembered u saying u both were in ur twenties?<br>Exactly how old are both of u guys......if he's 33 &amp; ur nearing ur tailend of twenties.....better u move on.....not unless u have no desire to settle down.<br>my 2cents worth <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I think the guy have never seen her as gf material but a friend material. It's basically World Peace having  a 'shiok sendiri' feelings mah. As someone mention a male can go out with a female merely for companionship. There is nothing wrong in that. So, why ditch the guy? Why like putting the blame on the man? I don't see the man has any fault. and he don't need to clarify anything to her when all he wanted was a friend.<br><br>And now TS really break her waterface liao by asking direct. It will put a strain on the friendship. Whether the man was being diplomatic or being an ass - depend on which angle you look at him lah - he has make it clear he is not interested in TS as a gf. Come onlah think about it, a man in his early thirties is already the man of the world and mature enough to know what he wants or not. He is not those youngster who changes relationship like they changes their underwear.<br><br>Hmm, and I also smell something fishy. TS did say they were <strong>both</strong> in their twenties.

At 27 I understand most ordinary women wants to feel belong and someone of their own to hold and to love and even to settle down. So, I won't fault you on that.<br><br>Let papa here advice you: Continue to be his friend but PLEASE go out with other guys as well. And if anyone tease you anymore about you and him just say nicely without any hint of resentment or malice that the two of you aren't an item but just good friends . That way you are not cutting off other guys around you who secretly hold a candle to you.<br><br>Don't put your hopes on this guy anymore thinking he may someday make you his real personal gf. And, please don't act desperate or clingy. You are neither that old that nobody wants.<br><br>Just remember, when going out with the opposite sex, do not immediately target them or view them as potential boyfriend. Though you may not speak it out loud but your body language will show and instead of encouraging the other party to go out more with you, you will frighten them off. Men hate being view as potential bf or worse potential hubby - I used to be one of those men. Always let the men do the chasing. True, we may be living in the modern era but some qualities don't change. Let the men make the first move.<br><br>So, good luck in your next endeavor or adventure and don't immediately claim the other party is your bf if you did not get a confirmation. If the man likes you more than just a friend after a few outing they will sound out. Trust me on that young lady. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>

U cant judge a person's love by yr opinion or society's opinion. U have to judge a person's love by his own opinion.

            <div class='col-md body'>my opinion is that he like you as a friend, and didnt like you as a girlfriend, however hes probably single, and dont see a reason why he should object to having a girl to date meanwhile.  it might be that hes lonely and appreciate your company, but all along he doesnt feel that you'll be his girlfriend.<br><br>as for taking things slow.....if he really see someone he likes trust me he'll just suddenly court her, leaving you more amazed.  if hes going that slow, going out with a girl for one year and not making any moves, hes not interested.<br><br>i know that from personal experience.<br><br>this is a colleague of mine, who asked me out and we got along pretty well.  We hang out like almost everyday and colleagues are speculating that we're an item...it got me uncomfortable because no where did he mention that hes courting me, so I'm leave with the assumption that we're just hanging out (and not dating) but people started to tease and he even played along, so as not to feel too out i played along too, but given that there's no confirmation i reckon I'm free to date other people.

All I noted was that there were no intimacy involved, we're close,  but no matter how near he leans he never once tried to hold my hand, which I'm taking to understand that its not quite a courtship ~ So far I'm used to more direct guys.  SO yep, if he didnt try anything, for whatever reason he has, it just means he isn't considering you as gf material, just like my friend.  ~ whether we like each other or not is not quite an issue but thats how it is.  He made no moves, hes not seeing you as a gf.<br><br>We're still very good friends now, and though we dont hang out as often as we used to, we still keep in touch quite frequently.  ^_^<br><br>So TS should really not wait around hoping he changes his mind.  If he does, well good, but if you wait around, you might miss your chance to be with someone who truly appreciates you for who you are.</div>

All along it's TS reading too deep into the situation and I don't see anywhere he's making use of her.

Also, the other mistake she made was considering only that guy as an only option. Diversify your options like in stocks. If one fail, at least you have a backup.<br><br>doko</div>

He said there have been many young couples holding hands in the streets, but that does not mean they will really end up together either. He said at this age (i.e. 33), he prefers to go slow; he didnÂ’t say he loves me but he just said he likes me. Then he wondered why I have started to ask him these questions, he asked if I am seeing someone else.

Do not see him as your bf, coz from wad u related, I feel you guys are more of activity partners den in a relationship.<br><br>But let him feel that you are not as easily available and always there for him , and see what he does? If he loves you, he will do something about it right? Like a confession or do/say something to assure that your love for him is reciprocated and worth your time. You seriously cannot be waiting endlessly for this guy to "wake up " his idea.<br><br>Try to see him as a good friend. It will help you in times of crisis.</div>
