He is a financial trader while I am the admin officer. I see him frequently because I supports him with the administration work.<br><br>After a while we started to lunch together regularly (sometimes with other colleagues and sometimes only us). And we began to exchange xmas/ny/birthday cards &amp; presents. We celebrated most big festives together.<br><br>There was a period when he was very sick, I visited him frequently at the hospital. After that we began to meet regularly on weekends. But our meetings were mostly shopping, movies, dinner, occassional pub, nothing romantic. This has gone on for about a year.<br><br>When he goes overseas, I will be sending him off and meet him at the airport when he returns. He will always give me a present like a bag or perfume at the airport. I wasn't very keen on bags or perfumes, but accepted them anyway.<br><br>His father is staying with him, I met the father once when I visited his house to pass him something that I helped him buy. The father was not very well then, and there was no formal introduction.<br><br>At the office, everyone knows or assumed we are an item, we got teased quite a fair bit. At annual events, we were arranged to sit at the same table even though we are from different section. We were also arranged to go on outward bound course together.<br><br>Although there are some colleagues who advised me to confront him about our r/s, I am still finding the opportunity to do that. On one hand, I am concerned the confrontation may affect my work (i like my work), on the other hand I am also eager to find out my status in his life.<br><br>To satisfy the curious, we are both average people, he has better looks then me (I think), while I am not too bad when compared with my other colleagues.<br><br>And I cannot confirm if he is a gay, I probed his friends, but no conculsion.<br><br>Finally, when I am done with him, I will pass him on to whoever fancy him.<br><br>Thanks to all for the listening ear, and the willingness to share, I benefited alot from all your posts.<br></span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
