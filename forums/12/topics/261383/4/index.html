They came, they saw, they conquer. No such thing as holding back. What TS is experiencing is nothing more than a platonic relationship and TS has mistaken the guy's affections. I can't very well say the guy is leading her on as it is TS's duty to find out directly from the guy if he wants to have a man/woman relationship in the beginning. She should have ask in a joking manner if the guy was asking her out on a date when the guy ask her to go for movies or dinner.<br><br>Really, just because going to visit someone in the hospitable when one is sick or even cooking porridge for one another doesn't really say much about the 'said' relationship.<br><br>There are platonic relationship between two different sexes. There needn't be any special emotional feelings involve. Hate to  say this to TS but I think TS is reading into too much of this relationship. As I've stated before unless the man asked her outrightly and straightforward for her to be his special otherwise this is only a one-sided affair on TS part.<br><br></div>

He is a financial trader while I am the admin officer. I see him frequently because I supports him with the administration work.<br><br>After a while we started to lunch together regularly (sometimes with other colleagues and sometimes only us). And we began to exchange xmas/ny/birthday cards &amp; presents. We celebrated most big festives together.<br><br>There was a period when he was very sick, I visited him frequently at the hospital. After that we began to meet regularly on weekends. But our meetings were mostly shopping, movies, dinner, occassional pub, nothing romantic. This has gone on for about a year.<br><br>When he goes overseas, I will be sending him off and meet him at the airport when he returns. He will always give me a present like a bag or perfume at the airport. I wasn't very keen on bags or perfumes, but accepted them anyway.<br><br>His father is staying with him, I met the father once when I visited his house to pass him something that I helped him buy. The father was not very well then, and there was no formal introduction.<br><br>At the office, everyone knows or assumed we are an item, we got teased quite a fair bit. At annual events, we were arranged to sit at the same table even though we are from different section. We were also arranged to go on outward bound course together.<br><br>Although there are some colleagues who advised me to confront him about our r/s, I am still finding the opportunity to do that.
