            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Saint,<br><br>I presume you're quite young, judging from the way you're talking about school.  At this age, your "falling for attached girls" seems to be part of the experimentation that happens when you're in your teens.  My guess is that eventually, you'll outgrow it after you've built up your determination Not to break up relationships.  Some don't grow out of it, but I hope you do.<br><br>Right now, I would suggest since you have a major exam coming up, to avoid courting her.  I know what this entails, you risk losing out to another guy if he courts her during this period &amp; manages to win her heart.  However, at this age, most are experimenting, &amp; lasting relationships at this age, are an exception rather than the rule.<br><br>There's plenty of time for you to find the person you want to spend the rest of your life with.  You should concentrate on what's important right now.<br><br>Notwithstanding what I've said above, the choice is ultimately yours.  The older ones amongst us will tell you to concentrate on your studies for now.  Those who're closer to your age will advise you to go for it, or to listen to your heart.
