            <div class='col-md body'>Every male or female has a limit of patient and tolerance, once they reached that limit... they would either snapped or just explode. That is when they can do things to hurt you without feeling bad about it but who knows maybe later they will. In any case, be it men or women, some don't know how to cherish someone who is nice and caring towards them. Not everyone is heartless, its when something good happens to them, they tend to take it forgranted but once its lost or something happen then they regret it.

            <div class='col-md body'>I may be wrong on the following, it's just what I feel, basically it's gotta do with the mentality when one gets into a r/s.<br><br>a) Some girls are in a r/s coz they want attention, love, care from the bf. Meaning, bf gives more than gf then gf is in cloud nine. Bf gets busy from other committment, gf finds bf shortchanging her, comparing from previous 'honeymoon period' where bf gives all gf wants, thus the argument about not being sensitive and craps.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Everyone needs to recharge themselves, girls and guys alike. They recharged differently. Guys go back to their 'cave', girls sink to the 'well'. Guys want time off, so that he can come back stronger and better, girls sink so that they can rise to the occassion and be loving again.<br><br>b) Some are in love head over heels over this guy, (infatuation perhaps, I dont know..) it's a challenge to them if they can possess him, after the catch is in the net, it's no longer a thrill to have him. thus r/s cooled down, guy thinks gal is not interested anymore, which can be the fact. (it can happen on a guy to a gal as well)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> dont get into a r/s just bcoz of superficial qualities one possess. If one can like you for looks, then surely there will be a better catch out there, one who possess better outlook than you. When one is madly in love, flaws r nuts to them. When one loses interests, the mere sight of him/her yawning can be detestful.<br><br>c) Some gals are 'post it pads' - ever sticky to their bfs. (Possessive? I am not sure abt it, but their beliefs will be that of, I want to be where he is seen, want to be around for him, etc etc.) Guys hang out with friends, friends tease him for having a superglue. If he dont turn up for their meetings, then he'll be accused of 'Got gf, dont want friends'. Now r/s becomes rocky bcoz gf now finds bf not spending time with her, which to the bf is he wants time off to mix with his friends to prevent his ego from being pricked/teasing/misunderstandings/etc etc etc.<br><br>d) There's this grp of other gals, who r in a r/s bcoz of the qualitative characteristics of their partner. Wants bf to set his priorities, feel/think for the bf. Doesnt need much of companion - independant type. Have the mindset that even though in the r/s, both are still individuals with goals in mind. Talks about spending quality time, not quantity time together. So even if bf doesnt give alot of attention on her, she knows she can trust that he'll be around for her when she needs it. Gives bf freedom/trust/respect/etc to do the things he wants to do.<br><br>Realise there's a trend on the behaviours of the gals, depending on their maturity level. Of coz, maturity level does not equate to age all the time.<br><br>Which grp of girls you have gotten yourself for, depends on what you can provide for them. Ultimately, no two peas are alike. You cannot find 2 people with the same characteristics/mentality.<br><br>I may be wrong on the above, just my 2 cents anyway. Take it with a pinch of salt yeah?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

It happens to you, me and everybody because it is very psychological in nature. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>Things that are gotten easy without challenge are things you wouldn't treasure much</strong>. Lets talk about simple things like the toys you love when you were young - those bought by your parents every now and then during your constant pestering of '-I-am-going-to-cry-and-create-a-scene-and-make-you-super-pai seh' kind of tactics, comparing to those Lego set which you took pains and means to save during recess over a long period of time to purchase....<br><br>Which do you think you would treasure more? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Not to deviate too much: In matters of the heart: It is stated (in CloUdiSm) that the stronger the attraction for a person, the stronger the karmic relation with him/her. Strong karmic relationship are challenging and if you realise - <strong>true love will never be gotten easily</strong>. Therefore under Variables of True love (CloUdIsm Remix III) - guys/girls who are tailored-made to you are less treasured and appreciated.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> This CAN be altered and the only way is - IF you understand what you are seeking.<br><br>I always asked my friends and people around me: The partner you are seeking, what are you really finding? A majority wouldn't go anywhere further than what I called the 'Common sense preference.' This applies to both mental, emotional and physical aspect. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Nice, Understanding, caring, decent looking no need too good looking, must spend time with me......<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Probably you can find thousands of such qualities anywhere.<br><br>You mentioned why girls can't settle with guys that deserve them. Two reasons<br><br>I) Love cosmic lesson - nobody can run away from the love cosmic lesson you ought to learn this lifetime. People fall for the wrong people, the right-but-not-suitable person, or simply an affair-before-marriage kind. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) Good guys often employ wrong tactics to get the person they want and a majority of them suffered passive curse. Let me say something here - good guys ain't always boring. I have seen 'good guys' being quite sporting, however the passive side, probably the not-so-confident in chasing &amp; other external/internal factors that contributes to their fate.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Love is about learning and enlightening, without lessons and experience to guide, how can you break through your original conventional thoughts, see the real world and understand what is the thing you truely seek? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
