              <p>Hi, I'm a student waiting to collect my O-Level results this month, and I been working as a sales promoter at BHG Bugis supposedly till the end of January, and I really dun like working at all, because I have no friends there that I can interact with. Besides that, I really want to visit all the open houses provided by the polys and JCs but my working dates clash with the open houses' dates, as I can only have 1-2 days off per week and each day I have to work 9 hours. I also can;t hang out with my friends or go for chalets too...</p>
              <p>I actually didn't wanted to work but its my mum who forced me to as she wanted me to get some job experience... So should I continue working or quit my job? Thanks</p>

              I think poly and jc open houses are more important because your poly/jc choice affects your future.
              How about communicating with your mum about this?

              <p>is right and wrong at the same time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My suggestion would be for u to take on a more flexible job where u can work around 3-4 days a week.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That way you wont sacrifice your social life and can still reap the benefits of working. </p>

              <p>I used to work alot after JC (I liked waitressing) but I fucked up my Uni application cause I had no time to look out for scholarships etc (I got stellar grades, but didnt apply for any scholarship - lame).</p>

              <p>To be honest, all those talking about getting job experience is bad reasoning, for a simple fact that whatever you do in company A may have absolutely nothing to do with company B, and whatever you learn in company A is unlikely to be applicable in company B, plus the fact how your job experience is like depends on the people in the company, and they are going to be different.</p>
              <p>You want experience, it's much better you learn it yourself and not be forced upon you. When I was in school, I suck at studies. Primary school and secondary school nearly destroyed my love for learning. It's only after I came out that I realize what I learnt in secondary was wrong, yep, things like atoms is the smallest thing etc, it's wrong. It took me to get out of schools to have a real education, simply because the passion for learning is there. I learn almost nothing in school, but after I came out, I learnt about medical science, quantum mechanics, cosmology, programming, etc.</p>
              <p>If you're forced to do something, obviously you can get it done, but your effort put in maybe come out results only 10%. If you like something, the effort you put in, the efficiency and results will be greater.</p>
              <p>If someone force you to work and say things like get job experience, you can almost be sure that they want you to earn the money so you won't keep taking from them. They won't tell you the truth because it's so hard and it doesn't sound nice.</p>

              <p>i disagree. when we tok about experience, although company A is different from company B, but if tthey are in the sae industry, then you are one way or another exposed to very similar job scopes. say if you are inretails as sales assistant in a boutique outlet, next time you apply for anotehr job in anoterh retail store it will help in your resume.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but for TS is he only work a feww months before o-level results, so it will only help so in his job after his studies and mayb NS. if he got chance to study full time polytechnic, or Uni, they have final year attachment programmes where they are posed to work for companies. there they can learn and accumulate the experience, which is crucial on paper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i do have one ex-colleague, he had no luck in his past working experince and work overseas in china, he tok like coc - a real tok big liar salesmen, later he change to quality, and apply his tok cock kingfu, as associate engineer to senior engineer and assistant manger. all that becasue he suppresses all his  likely competitors, copy people's words and they way they do things, and supports an immediate superior who is by far weaker than hhim in both experience and qualification. so he is like a parasite leeching on an old cdying cow. that's survival.</p>

              <p>Thanks everyone for the reply and concern, and I already talked to my Mum about it, and she says its up to me since I'm old enough to decide myself, but I can somewhat feel that she's a bit dissapointed.</p>
              <p>So, I have asked the manager to work only on weekends till the end of January, so that I can spend the weekdays with friends or just chilling. Hope she allows me to do that! </p>
