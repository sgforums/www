Its not matter of breaking promise because in the first place, its silly if he were to believe you. Not saying that you don't keep to what you had promise him, but <strong>in life, nothing is absolute - so is love</strong>.<br><br>From our experience, we gain the neccessary wisdom about our personal love with a partner. Practical? Half correct - the right word is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Discovery</span>. In our early relationship, we knew NOTHING about relationship at all. The guy/girl we picked and chose to be our bf/gf - there is simply too little comparison between him/her and others. We knew nothing because we only listen to what the heart speaks.<br><br>As we mature in love - our vision widens and we discover that to make a relationship successful, we have to see a whole picture instead of plain I-love-you-you-love-me concept.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You are being put-off not by him, but by a decision you made ages ago because now if someone similar like him were to appear, you would outrageously reject him because this isn't the kind of guy you are looking for now. Time change, people change, money talk. Your changes are normal.<br><br>P.S: Remember the time when we used to think that we looked cool in a hairstyle/clothing/etc? We took a photo and five years down the road, we look back and we feel that we looked so stupid. This is exactly what is happening. Our preception, thinking and taste changed. It's part of 'growing up' - in love.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>People often makes mistakes in life. . . Nothing big deal even if he went to jail before. you should be glad that at least he gave you happy memories before. Not everyone can keep promises also. i believe your x-bf is a nice guy. . . coz if he really wants you to wait for him, he would write to you when he's inside. he don't want to be a burden to you also. Maybe he has a gf nw leh? Carry on well with your current bf lor. . .  the past might be hurting but there's still good memories. . .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
