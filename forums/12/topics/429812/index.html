            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>
              </p><div style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 100%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #ffffff; padding-top: 0.3em; padding-right: 0.6em; padding-bottom: 0.3em; padding-left: 0.6em; font: normal normal normal 13px/1.231 arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I am sure I am definately not the only one facing such problem.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I am 16, taking my Os this year and quite frankly, my academically used to be quite okay, I am taking the Triple Science stream (pure) and well my results in the past, at least I will secure 5As(except my languages) but recently this has not been the case.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">You see, I am a very lazy fellow. Even as this year being my O level year, I have not been studying. My daily routine will be, once liberated from the school, I will head home, give myself a shower and take a rest, usually refers to sleeping. Then, I will wake up at 8 in the evening and surf the net or being entertained until maybe 2am. Only then do I sleep. Clearly, I do not complete my assignments or do any revision.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">If I have a important assignment which requires mandatory completion, I will eventually do but not before 2am in the wee morning as I will just keep procrastinating. This seriously worries me.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">If there is a important test, I will only start studying in the wee hours of the morning, until maybe 4am, then I catch up with my sleep. I know, it is such a bad form of habit.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">But I just find myself not being able to adjust to the time where my friends usually does at 10. I just keep turning, rolling on the bed. I just cannot get any sleep. This vicious cycle just keep continuing and continuing.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Recently, the effects are surfacing. My results are not as favourable as I will like it to be. And being a triple pure science student, I am suppose to be maintaining a consistant level of result, or even exceed the school's target for me. At a dangerous grade of 17/30 for my very recent biology test, I am very devastated. Other subjects too are falling, my A1s are not maintained, all my sciences are now a C5. A drastic drop of 4 grades compared to SA1 last year.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Seeing these, I feel scared. I know what I am supposed to do, I even have plans but I just cannot find myself a way to execute these plans that will ensures that my results will be better. I just do not have the will to start studying!</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">At least when I was in Secondary 3, I will at least spare some time of my entertainment doing some revision but now I simply don't! It is very worrying. Teachers are concerned such that they my parents will soon be involved if my SA1 does not prove my ability. Not just the teachers, the principal of my school too is also concerned about me.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">But somehow I will, well find my way out to escape the problems, such as placing my parent's handphone on call divert, silencing the phone without them knowing things like these. Very funny, I know. But it is true. I always find ways to escape from a problem. So I think even though they try to help me, beacause I know of the sudden lost in faith from my parent will occur should these comes to my parent's attention, hence I will try my hardest to evade these problems.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I am very worried about my Os, yet I find myself not doing anything despite knowing this will eventually be detrimental to my personal well being and my future.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Is there any word of advice you could share?</p>

You clearly demonstrate a lack of that. What advise could we give? You're smart enough to know what is the right thing to do. No more excuses.. It's very easy to be lazy, everyone can do that. But no greatness has even been achieved from being lazy.. </span></h1>

              <p>Lol. Just like jojobeach says, if u don't want to become singapore trash then you better work hard. You must scare yourself everyday, when you wake up and before you sleep, u think of consequence of being a road sweeper or toilet cleaner with low pay. Somemore must compete with china and indian workers, so lose face.</p>
              <p>Since you cannot change your sleep habit so easily, then don't care it first. You must just start studying. Have you heard of tony buzan's mindmaps? It is very helpful, it help me jump from failing prelim (econs and history both U score to A and C in A levels).</p>
              <p>Plus, if you really need help, you must find your school counsellor or teacher. If you don't do anything and just complain you will surely die one. If within the next week you still don't do something, you can prepare to sweep road le.</p>

              <p>It's not very polite to use the word 'trash' on a fellow Singaporean. It's fascinating how some among us think that they're superior than the less educated counterparts.. and their motivation for an education is solely driven by that. Road sweepers, be in local or foreigners, are humans too, and they deserve to be treated with equal respect. shame on you.</p>
