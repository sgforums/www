              <p>Hi Angelica,</p>
              <p>Your friend may wish to consider having a talk with her boyfriend to clear all doubts once and for all. The most important thing which she needs to know now are his true feelings, and whether he said all these to chase her away or he truly has no feelings for her.</p>
              <p>The settling part with have to wait, their relationship is far from stable yet from what I can see. If her boyfriend truly just treats her as another woman in his life, please do kindly advice her to leave him, with support from the rest of her friends.</p>
              <p>In such a worst case scenario, you and her other friends will have to be prepared to be by her side, for it will be heartbreaking for a woman to leave a relationship which she has put in so much into.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>The answer and solution is so obvious and right before her.</p>
              <p>But I guess she prefers not to see it, not to know it, not to hear about, and just wanna continue on, living on a hope that his attitude and love will change. But it wont. She had been treated only as a companion, nothing more, with no strings attached. The guy lost nothing.</p>
              <p>She, sadly, had been like a moth attracted to light, unaware that it had been a fatal attraction. She had lost her youth, and most probably her mind, finding comfort in the delusions of an unreciprocated distorted perception of presumed 'love'.</p>
              <p>As she is already matured, not some teenage kid, it is her choice to make. You can advise, but it may not necessarily be heard or want to be heard by her.</p>
              <p>If you treasure this friendship with her,  then be her shoulder to cry on, and to be her safety net when she falls, on the eventual awakening and realisation that she had been used all along,as she surely will one day.....</p>

              <p>your story sounds familiar to mine.  using the storyline, i'm the guy, there is the girl and her best friend.</p>
              <p>the girl and i were getting along when the "best friend" pops out from nowhere after living in a nunnery for few months repenting for her sins in her last failed relationship. </p>
              <p>when the girl and i were about to "seal" the relationship, the best friend started acting very strangely.  she is supposed to be best friend, but she send love messages to the girl...  she spreads rumours and half-truths about me.  she calls and sms me, trying all ways to talk me out of the relationship.  i have an online dating account.  she would message me as a fake imposter, chat me up and persuade me to break with the girl.  lately, she sent me another fake profile with blog accounts of her and my girl's "rendezous", how they love each other, etc....  i wonder what's happening. </p>
              <p>my girl said that she tried to contact me many times but i never respond.  fact is, i don't want to fall into that best friend's trap again.  i don't trust messages from any tom, dick or harry.  blame your best friend if you want for creating smoke.</p>
              <p>to the girl - you might think you have a counsel in your best friend, but i suggest you look again.  you might have a wolf in sheep clothing amidst you.  choose your friends wisely.  why did you abet your best friend ?  why were you playing with your best friend's feelings ?  did you think you were a smart ass playing us against each other for your selfish purpose ?  don't toy with people's feelings like this.  you are partly to blame for this situation.</p>
              <p>to the best friend - you don't know me.  if you spread rumours and half-truths about me again, you better watch out.  don't go too far.  i'm warning you.  mind your own F*king business.  stop sending me the stupid hearts and trying to smoke people.  if you are sincere in what you seek, do it well when you were with her.  not be a loser and snatch it through the backdoor with low-class tricks like some stray dog after leftover bone. </p>

              <p>sure i hv let go.  but didn't u wanna know why ?</p>
              <p>how to have love when u r always fleeting fm one thought to another ? add to that all the complications.  honesty and sincerity are the basis foundation which should be adhered to at every stage.  if any girl/boy friend is worth the salt, he/she would be able to deal with the truth and even go the extent of helping the other half deal with whatever issues he/she is having. </p>
              <p>perhaps you should have had this trust instead of pondering so much and thinking up ways to "protect" this and that. </p>
              <p>honestly till today i still don't know your true character and intentions, and i think neither do you know mine.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png">gikiwiki...u felt cheated huh??in most cases people will go out there and try to explain themself and even worst try to hurt each other...to be honest, u dont have to cos anyway dont intend to go back to her and further more u dont trust her.so,why bother so much??walk away and move on with your life.treat it as this is just another bad day for you.with this type of girl??sometime ignorance is a blessing.</p>
              <p>BUT for my friend case is diff..we were once working at the same company and she was my senior.as a new staff i actually dont have any friend and dont knw much about my job.But when she found out that im actually struggling to cope, she was patiently offer helping hand until finally i able to work on my own and thats how the best friend started.</p>
              <p>We went trough on and off relationship of our own untill she met her current bf and i met mine.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">He</span><span style="color: #000000;">(her bf) is not that bad however to me he is a guy that full of ego...we all went out in few occasion and co-incidently we was at the topic that why we should tell someone that we love them.My bf was telling him that girl would love to be told sometime that we love them and bla bla bla but to him,there's no need to tell that someone u love her as long as u treat her nicely,thats good enough.</span></p>
              <p>In some point i do agree with him but maybe as the gf she dosent feel appreciated and rejected.i wanted to do something before she lost her faith in this relationship and give up... .Maybe he do love her but it just he dont know how to express his feeling.Lot of time when we asked him out to join for dinner or any gathering he will try to avoid it and willl make it clear that he will not get angry that his gf went out w/o him..However when she get home he start to ask why is it take so long for her to get home, how many ppl was there (basicly how many guy are there) and bla bla bla..</p>
              <p>At one point, my bf think that he doesnt feel secure with the relationship...</p>
              <p>But haiz,im just a friend.....i hope that i can do more but at the same time afraid that i might get involve too much so..thats about it.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png">gikiwiki...u felt cheated huh??in most cases people
              will go out there and try to explain themself and even worst try to
              hurt each other...to be honest, u dont have to cos anyway dont
              intend to go back to her and further more u dont trust her.so,why
              bother so much??walk away and move on with your life.treat it as
              this is just another bad day for you.with this type of
              girl??sometime ignorance is a blessing.</p>
              <p>BUT for my friend case is diff..we were once working at the same
              company and she was my senior.as a new staff i actually dont have
              any friend and dont knw much about my job.But when she found out
              that im actually struggling to cope, she was patiently offer
              helping hand until finally i able to work on my own and thats how
              the best friend started.</p>
              <p>We went trough on and off relationship of our own untill she met
              her current bf and i met mine.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff6600;">He</span><span style="color: #000000;">(her bf) is not that bad however to me he is a
              guy that full of ego...we all went out in few occasion
              and co-incidently we was at the topic that why we should tell
              someone that we love them.My bf was telling him that girl would
              love to be told sometime that we love them and bla bla bla but to
              him,there's no need to tell that someone u love her as long as u
              treat her nicely,thats good enough.</span></p>
              <p>In some point i do agree with him but maybe as the gf she dosent
              feel appreciated and rejected.i wanted to do something
              before she lost her faith in this relationship and give
              up... .Maybe he do love her but it just he dont know how to
              express his feeling.Lot of time when we asked him out to join for
              dinner or any gathering he will try to avoid it and willl make it
              clear that he will not get angry that his gf went out w/o
              him..However when she get home he start to ask why is it take so
              long for her to get home, how many ppl was there (basicly how many
              guy are there) and bla bla bla..</p>
              <p>At one point, my bf think that he doesnt feel secure with
              the relationship...</p>
              <p>But haiz,im just a friend.....i hope that i can do more but at
              the same time afraid that i might get involve too much so..thats
              about it.</p>

              <p>Hi Angelica,</p>
              <p>Egoism could easily destroy relationships, be they friendships, kinships, or partnerships. Perhaps he truly feels insecure about the relationship, but his pride is getting in the way. </p>
              <p>If left to their own, your friend's relationship is likely to end on a sour note, even if the two of them do get married. I will strongly suggest getting someone who is more experienced in relationships, yet much more senior at the same time, to talk to your friend's boyfriend. If possible, it will be even better if you can find someone whom he will actually listen to. </p>
              <p>Cheers. </p>
