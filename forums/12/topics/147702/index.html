Finance isn't easy and besides... You're quite very comfortable with your current job? Personally... I feel that your love for finance is just rather 'surface' for now...?

In other word, flexibility...<br><br>It's common for people to take up more responsibilities than they 'should' these days... I would often have much to say in regards to this, but today I shall not touch on that side track....<br><br>In regards to promotion..? Well... If you have the mentality of BOTH 1.
