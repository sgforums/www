            <div class='col-md body'>Do lots and lots of 'background checks' first. Try to get someone who knows her well. Find out about what she's like, whether she's attached, etc, etc.<br><br>Try to engineer a situation where you will have to talk to her. For example, try to drop a pile of notes in front of her, ask her for directions, etc.... I know it sounds corny but it's a lot less unsettling for you to do so than to go up to her directly. And for goodness' sake, when you do talk to her, DON'T FREEZE.<br><br>In any case, don't rush things. Don't expect her to fall madly in love with you five minutes after talking with her. Heck, I'm not trying to sound evil, but your opinion of her may very well change after getting to know her. These things take time. Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day.<br><br>Good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
