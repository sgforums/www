Are you new to the dating world? Or just got back to the dating scene?<br><br>She is still married and you don't know if you are on the rebound. You don't know if she still likes her husband.<br><br>Do not, ever, touch her. Allow her to touch you.<br><br>Then you said "I love you" over a few days. Might as well propose to her! Control your feelings. It's anti-manly.<br><br>Yeah she found her love but only for a short while. You came on too strong. After that, she fell out of love again. You have to be patient with her and all women, for them to fall in love with you.<br><br>She can't fall in love with you yet. What does that tell you? Low feelings. Not turned on enough yet. Back off. Slowly build the r/s. If she still remains cold, it's either she can't fall in love with you anymore(40% chance) or she never dig you to begin with(60% chance).<br><br>doko<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Obviously, Mr Frank here is suffering and at a loss, hence destructive and unhelpful comments would surely be unappreciated.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Dear Mr Frank, you seem to me that you feel really lonely. And too much of it is not healthy to start a relationship. U also barely know this teacher? Take it slow pls.<br><br>It is loneliness which brings the 2 of u together and such a union normally does not last.<br><br>Get a grip on yourself and join some outdoor or indoor social activities, instead of going thru the net. One must have a healthy mindset before he/she can love another.<br><br>My $0.02 worth.</div>
