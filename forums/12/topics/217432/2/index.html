But I gave my heart to her. Even if there there is sex, my love will multiply for her tremendously. I do not want to be hurt that's all.<br>She and her husband are separated and is now considering divorce soon. They are divorcing each other on the grounds of adultery because her husband have a girlfriend before their marriage 3 yrs ago and he was always sleeping with her till today.

Just some questions.<br><br>What do you mean by you don't want to be hurt?<br><br>Why do you love her?<br><br>Until she's divorced, you are committing adultery with her and this would complicated matters for her.
