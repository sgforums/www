              <p>I got involved with a married man few months back. We are kinda
              lovely-dovey till things took a turn. We worked in the same
              company. He often send me to work and home. Lately, citing some
              excuses, he is unable to send me to and fro from work.</p>
              <p>I suspect that he thinks I am too clingy and dependant on him .
              I would like to raise the issue with him but he refused to talk
              about it. Whenever i text him, he took so long to reply. His reply
              seems to be shorter than usual. Sometimes I call him after work,
              either he cut off my line with an excuse or sms me that he will
              talk to me tomorrow. But when tomorrow comes, it is still the same
              treatment.</p>
              <p>How do I get him to open up and be interested in me once again?
              It had been one month since he treated me this way. I dare not to
              keep smsing or calling him because I fear he thinks I am
              irritating.</p>
              <p>Any married guys care to advise? I want to know what went really
              wrong.</p>

              <p>Hi Jessiexie, </p>
              <p>I understand that it is very hard and painful to end a relationship, but you will have to do it now, if you do not wish to suffer more in the future. If you continue to persist in an one-sided relationship, the one who will suffer in the end is you.</p>
              <p>It is already apparent that you are nothing more than a possession to him, something which is running at his beck and call. He will come to you when he feels like it, and snub you when he doesn't need you.</p>
              <p>Hear my plead to you once more, think about yourself and your future, and let go of this relationship.  </p>
              <p>Bien Amicalement.</p>

              <p>Am sure u know what is the right move and what you should do even before you start this thread. Denial and cling to false hope are what ppl do when face with the truth they refuse to accept. Are you hopping to seek comfort here or evidence to support your denial?</p>
              <p>I know ger aint known for being logical being compare to guys, but maybe u can channel your emo in a different direction that could free you from this episode of ur life. I duno if this is good idea, but mayb u can try anger or hate. They are rather effective ways to distance urself from this hopeless r/s. Either that or wait till the point where u finally breaks down.</p>

              <p>Advise most ppl here gave is, cut the lost and move on.</p>
              <p>Am sure u know what is the right move and what you should do
              even before you start this thread. Denial and cling to false
              hope are what ppl do when face with the truth they refuse to
              accept. Are you hopping to seek comfort here or evidence to support
              your denial?</p>
              <p>I know ger aint known for being logical being compare to guys,
              but maybe u can channel your emo in a different direction that
              could free you from this episode of ur life. I duno if this is good
              idea, but mayb u can try anger or hate. They are rather effective
              ways to distance urself from this hopeless r/s. Either that or wait
              till the point where u finally breaks down.</p>

              <p>i fully agree with jojo. Since u cant cut free on ur own, when dun u let the wife assist you in it. Who knows what might happen, he might lose his wife and come threading toward u like a wounded puppy when it all blow over.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And beside, he cheated on his wife, itis only fair he take the same share of the pain and shit u going thru on a daily basis. As for his wife, i think she has a right to know and to deal with him as she see fitting.</p>

              <p>Dude, a woman who is prepared to steal a husband away from his wife, has no concern about how the wife will feel or how innocent the children are. So don't be so naive ya ?</p>
              <p>Why a married man you ask ? The answer is very simple. Some people looks at what good stuff the other is having/enjoying and wants em for themself. A simple case of husband envy.</p>
              <p>If a good woman is willing to spend her whole life with this man.. he can't be THAT bad. A tried and tested recipe is better than one that needs time and effort to figure out.</p>

              <p>Well Earl, like most human beings, some women can be selfish, competitive and what propels a woman to continue this "hopeless" path , is hope itself.</p>
              <p>Women who are prone to affairs with married men usually wants to prove that she is BETTER than the wife. The competitive streak.</p>
              <p>And because she HOPES to get that juicy steak on her plate , instead of someone else's , she continues with the affair, hoping for the tide to turn in her favor. Much like a gambler who refuses to give up.</p>
              <p>Frankly, I don't know of any ex-mistress turned wife who is happy for long , with the man she managed to steal. Not many mistress will admit publicly she bagged a garbage.</p>
              <p>As the saying goes. "The best revenge is to let the other woman have him."</p>
