              <p>Well Earl, like most human beings, some women can be selfish,
              competitive and what propels a woman to continue this "hopeless"
              path , is hope itself.</p>
              <p>Women who are prone to affairs with married men usually wants to
              prove that she is BETTER than the wife. The competitive streak.</p>
              <p>And because she HOPES to get that juicy steak on her plate ,
              instead of someone else's , she continues with the affair, hoping
              for the tide to turn in her favor. Much like a gambler who refuses
              to give up.</p>
              <p>Frankly, I don't know of any ex-mistress turned wife who is
              happy for long , with the man she managed to steal. Not many
              mistress will admit publicly she bagged a garbage.</p>
              <p>As the saying goes. "The best revenge is to let the other woman
              have him."</p>

              <p>Despite all that had been said and helpfully written here, it is sadly fallen upon your deaf ears. Even harsh words failed to work on you.</p>
              <p>You are the kind of girl who when even abused by the one you fell for, would not leave but hope for a better day. You are addicted to him, akin to a drug addict in need for a daily fix or will suffer withdrawal symptoms, similar to you now experiencing.</p>
              <p>But you are not a drug abuser, only confused and trapped by 'love' and the solace it seems to bring to  you.</p>
              <p>The root of your problem stems from your loneliness. Your despical lover had encourage and helped you realize your deepest fantazy, and your construction of dreams became a temporary reality, for his own personal use. You had been deluded, and still are living in a delusion,</p>
              <p>No matter what others say, you will not listen or believe, for that constructed facade is a reality to you which you clinged on, due to your loneliness.</p>
              <p>So rather than to pull away the rug under you with harsh words, let us be your friends instead, to rid of your loneliness. Whenever you feel lonely, just pour out your woes to us, let us listen, in pm if you wish.</p>
              <p>I dont care if you are rich or poor, black or white, beautiful or fat and ugly. The only ugliness i know are those in the heart. You too, like everyone of us, are a precious life, a fellow human being. Never hurts to have more friends, right?</p>
              <p>In time, your dependency will wither with more friends in your social circle, the way a drug abuser will grow less on the need for abusive substances. Theirs is cold turkey way, which is a form of torture, but for yours, cold turkey would only drive you deeper into your dependency of him. Your problem is only loneliness and a need for someone to care, not drugs anyway.</p>
              <p>PS: I may not be a good friend, for i have erratic work hours and move around a lot. My suitcase is always packed and ready. Thus I may not be there for you at all times. But I am sure that if you open up yourself to others, there will be similar lonely souls who will in time become good friends to you. Any volunteers?</p>

              <p>babe....i think you will only take all the advice seriously and start to focus on your own life alone when the wife found out and start to go after you like a mad dog.she might be you know, cos the husband seem to distance himself from you but you are still there.-in your dream land</p>
              <p>i personally think that girl shouldnt do certain thing:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">1) having affair with your own best friend's bf (even if he look like david beckham)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">2) like your case:be with a marriage man</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">there's a lot of great single guys out there waitnig for you unless if you think that you dont deserve a good man.</span></p>

              <p>Take your time to forget him. Time will heal. Just relax yourself when you are free, like going to the library for some peace there. Being able to be calm and relax in any situation helps to overcome any challenges. Good Luck!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>Then get this into your head: falling madly in love with a married man <em>can</em> break up a family!</p>
              <p>The very fact that you <em>hope</em> that he is interested in you shows that you don't give a rat's ass about the potential breakup of his family should he really return to you!</p>
              <p>You suck. Seriously. All you care about are your own emotions. You really don't seem to care for the feelings of his wife and kids.</p>

              <p>Hi Jessiexie,</p>
              <p>Are you not mentally torturing yourself now? You are chasing after something which is next to impossible, and only falling deeper and deeper into the pit of despair. </p>
              <p>Indeed, it is unlikely that you will forget about him overnight, but isn't that true for all couples who have broken up? In fact, some of them never truly forget or get over their previous other half. </p>
              <p>Please do pardon me for saying so, but instead of trying to chase after him, you should just spare yourself the misery and pain, and move on with your life bit by bit. </p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>I don't think we have the right to judge. Married men who stray or women who fell in love with married ppl are all part of nature.</p>
              <p>For married men who stray, there must be some problems at home or he's just looking out for a short adventure spree. There's this chemical in the body that ignities when one falls in love, and maybe he's undulged in it.</p>
              <p>Sadly, if this carries on, there would really be no end because the guy will still choose back his wife and kids, even if both you and his wife drop into the river...</p>

              <p>Hi Jessiexie,</p>
              <p>As fudgester has sharply pointed out, a good man will not have strayed so easily. If a married man who has a happy family and also no family problems choose to stray, then the most suitable word which we can associate with his actions is foolishness. </p>
              <p>Instead of treasuring what he has, he choose to lust for other women, when he knows that his actions could lead to the eventual destruction of his happy family. This sort of men may look good on the outside, but his actions speak a lot about the colour of his heart.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
