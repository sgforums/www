I had a similar situation here once and tried to seek help by speaking to a fellow female colleague but cos everytime I speak quite sarcastically to him, he'll go complain to everyone (he's the manager) so I have to back...I always very scared and sometimes dun dare to retaliate cos I needed my job.....was havin' nightmares and stuff, cried alot and was abt to leave when he resigned cos the top management dun like him...when he left I realised tat one of my boss thot somethin' was going on btwn us cos he saw something (up till today i dunno wat in e world happened)....see my point is if I had kept all his emails and msgs &amp; instead of being a coward, go up to e management to complain, the misunderstanding may not happen....I still am working here trying put behind wat others had said or think cos i noe my conscience is clear, also when he kept calling the office, I once managed to summon my courage &amp; told him to get lost and leave me alone! (thought not veri fierce but firm enough la)<br><br>See i afriad my colleagues would side him cos he worked here longer than me and veri good at toking....if I never scared this scared tat, I won't have to go thru all these things...now I dun even know who I can trust in this office...jus be myself &amp; pretend I dun noe wat ppl had said.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
