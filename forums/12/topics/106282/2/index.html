Are you prepared for:<br><br>'...vulnerablility. It opens your chest and it opens your heart and it means someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up all these defenses.

They don't ask for it. They do something dumb one day like kiss you, or smile at you, and then your life isn't your own anymore. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so a simple phrase like 'maybe we should just be friends' or 'how very perceptive' turns into a glass splinter working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. Not just in the mind.

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think it really exits. Like some of you said earlier I used to think it did also when I was in the army. After that, the working world "woke" me up.<br><br>True love will probably be unconditional love. And to find someone who can accept you for what you are here!!?? Difficult I think to say the least.<br><br>Plus if you don't have money and a stabled or even a high flying career, your chances are even definetely worse off.</div>
