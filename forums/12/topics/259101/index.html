            <div class='col-md body'>Reaching 30 is not old lar... u are probably not even halfway into ur life. But it's very normal to feel lost at this age. I've have many colleagues at this age (include those over 30) and a lot of them feels emptiness in their lives too.<br><br>The answer you are looking for is inside u and is definitely not one we can tell u. But the advises to live for yourself seems a pretty inappropriate advise. Personally, I've never found happiness in living for myself. And loneliness is one of worst kind of pain one can feel. I've never find it happy to eat delicacies alone, I've never find watching the best show alone and not being able to relate to anyone a happy thing to do, etc.<br><br>Setting visions in life provides purpose into our lives. Vision at work, vision at family, vision with friends, vision on ourself can fill the void of a meaningless life and fill in the purpose in the major parts of our lives. Also not being able to fullfill our vision can become stress and not having vision causes the kind of feeling that u have.<br><br>I will give u an example of my some of my visions<br>- My vision for my work is to build a useful business system.<br>- My vision for my children is to be a great dad. One that they will hug me, talk to me even when they are big and be proud to say that I am their father.<br>- My vision for my parents is to not let them be lonely and not quarrel less often with each other<br>- My vision for my wife is to ...

            <div class='col-md body'>I did some talking with some friends and one of them told me this. " There is only 2 path in life, its either been happy or been unhappy. No matter how much you are prepared, you can't solve anything till the problem appears. Singapore should work smart not work hard, by the time you saved up a lot of money, your be to old to enjoy it as you you would also spend most of the money on your medical bills. How much money is consider enough ?" In the end, it all still comes to what I want in life. Ha Ha! Even thought  I know this in my heart, I still wish for a easy solution.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> I kind of like been brainless as in you just follow orders and not think.

I keep asking myself and also tried asking friends on what is their goal in their life. Most of them gave me the answer " Live   for yourself, be happy and not worry about what other people think about you. And others would say " just go with the flow, one step at a time ". Yet, I'm worry that I still need to pre-plan my future like do I have enough money save up for maybe I want to start a family or when I grow old. I'm also envy others who know what they want in their live and working towards it. I have very very low self esteem. I never happy in what I do. If only I was born with a use menu...
