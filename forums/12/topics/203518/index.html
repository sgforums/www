Realistically, how much weight can you put on from now till the end of November anyway?<br><br>Look at it another way - as a last resort, there'll be plenty of time for you to shed those extra kilos once you're done with the O's. That said, you've only got that one shot at your O's(lest you wish to tell me retaking your O's is already on the agenda). It's not hard to see which should be of more concern to you, is it?<br><br>Ideally, of course it'd be good if you could control your diet in the lead-up to the O's, but if you reckon binge eating is the only way to de-stress before your O's, then surely it isn't that hard to figure which - ie.your looks or your future - should be of greater importance?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Do one chapter at a time or a few, depending on how long it is. After this, read something light like comics or walk around your neighbourhood to freshen up yourself.

Don't know ask your friends, your cousins or someone whom you are comfortable with.<br><br>As for slimming down, try exercising regularly. Set aside some time to exercise everyday. If your school starts in the morning, exercise in the evening, say 5pm. Jog around the neighbourhood or park. Rest for a while then bathe. After that, start your revision again. Eat healthy snacks like fruits. Once in a while munch some biscuits is all right, nobody likes eating fruits everyday.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>If you are religious, try reading the Bible or do some chanting to relax yourself.

Do one chapter at a time or a few, depending on how long it is. After this, read something light like comics or walk around your neighbourhood to freshen up yourself. After that, come back to revise your work again. Do this for a few subjects per day as time permits, don't burn midnight oil.<br><br>For Maths, it's practice, practice and more practice. Don't know ask your friends, your cousins or someone whom you are comfortable with.<br><br>As for slimming down, try exercising regularly. Set aside some time to exercise everyday. If your school starts in the morning, exercise in the evening, say 5pm. Jog around the neighbourhood or park. Rest for a while then bathe. After that, start your revision again. Eat healthy snacks like fruits. Once in a while munch some biscuits is all right, nobody likes eating fruits everyday.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>If you are religious, try reading the Bible or do some chanting to relax yourself. It can be any time, whether before you start revising, during revising or after revising.<br><br>Relax yourself, and you can control your weight.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>Binge eating maybe a subconcious reaction to stress, so it may not be easily controlled.</div>

So that you have no money for food.<br><br><strong>Study Problem</strong><br>I do forget everything during my study days. So I never stopped revising until exams are over. Plan a good time table and keep to it. When you forget, revise again. For me I read even 5 minutes before entering the exam. Actually if you keep repeating the same thing over and over, you won't forget. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
