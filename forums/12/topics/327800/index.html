              <p>This time i'm sure, i'm a jinx.</p>
              <p>I want to share my story to vent my frustration.</p>
              <p>I was born 22 years ago, and since young, i dont know what my father's name is, how he looks like and how was he as a person. I only had my mother and my ah ma.</p>
              <p>I still remember staying with my grandmother, sleeping with my mother in a room. The room only had a study table and two matress for me and my mother.</p>
              <p>Mummy worked two jobs, as a cashier at the Yohan SC and as a factory worker at night. Still remembered how i worked her up at 12 PM, to get her to send me to school, when she barely slept after night shift.</p>
              <p>Then in primary three, after a 1 month holiday, my mother was killed, while opening the letterbox at the void deck by a robber. She was stabbed.</p>
              <p>I was left with my grandmother and my small uncle. My grandmother would bring me to school, pushing her trolley along, before she goes to work at the market. Everyday's dinner would be porridge or rice with leftovers from the night before. </p>
              <p>2 years later, she died.</p>
              <p>I then lived with my uncle, but he was almost never home.</p>
              <p>When i was secondary 1, i started working everyday after sch, distributing flyers everyday, that year, my uncle got married and moved out, i lived alone since them. Well, at least he would provide me with 200 dollars per month and settle the bills.</p>
              <p>So i started working and schooling, and yes, i did it, i entered poly, after retaking my o levels once.</p>
              <p>After entrance into poly, i managed to get a job which pays 15 dollars per hour, which is pretty good for me. Life was better and easier. Then i bought my first loyal companion! She was a jack russell!!!</p>
              <p>She was so beautiful, training her was hard, but she eventually became a good and obedient dog despite the fact that i was out early and came home late everyday.</p>
              <p>Then i met a girl in year 2 in one of the module. We became very close and within months, we were madly in love. I thought, i was a lucky person, i had somebody who loved me so much.</p>
              <p>We shared everyday together, had so much fun with her when we bring prego out for walks. She was a movie maniac, i remembered watching movies till we had no movies to catch at the cinemas!!</p>
              <p>When prego was 3 years old, she went missing, i was very worried and pasted posters all around for her. but idiots went around destroying my posters, tearing them one by one, also tearing my chance of finding my beloved.</p>
              <p>She was never found, but the security at hougang mall told me a dog was run down by a car, the description sounded like prego, but i never wanted to confirm.</p>
              <p>I went for my NS, and ORD-ed this year. I was immediately applied for a full time job at the previous company i was working for during my poly days, as a field rep. The money was good, enough for my bills and for entertainment and savings. My girlfriend was working in a jewellery shop too, we were finally financially stable..</p>
              <p>3 weeks ago, she died. some fucking bastard hit her around lorong chuan and fled the scene. She died on the spot. With that news, my pillar of support crumbled too.</p>
              <p>Now, right here in this room, where my mother, grandmother, prego and my beloved shared so much memories with me, has only me. Everything and everyone that i loved would meet with a bad ending, but not me. Life had made me strong enough to fend for myself, strong enough to always look on the positive side, and strong enough for me to suffer the agony of losing everything i have one by one.</p>
              <p>Please treasure whatever you have, before its too late.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to futher echo what karma88 had stated in his reply. There is no such thing as you being the jinx, all is purely coincidences. Don't believe too much in superstition stuff. Take life with a pinch of salt. Stop blaming yourself. It is always good to be internal locus of control however life and death, or fate you call it is beyond your control. Your destiny lies in your hand whereas theirs lies in theirs'. It does not lie in yours to begin with. Cheer up and be optimistic about the future. Don't let setbacks hinder you. Obstacles are there to stop the less preseverance and do not let yourself belong to that category.</div>

              telling you those are coincidences is like consoling you. telling you that you are jinxed doesnt sound quite right cuz that is considered superstition. why not just see it as challenges in life. 
              
              for me, i always thought that life has been kind to me. with no matter what setbacks i may get. maybe stronger people like you and i bear more responsiblities, and all these get you prepared. 
              
              look on the brighter side and move one with live. im sure it will make your loved ones proud.

              <p>This time i'm sure, i'm a jinx.</p>
              <p>I want to share my story to vent my frustration.</p>
              <p>I was born 22 years ago, and since young, i dont know what my father's name is, how he looks like and how was he as a person. I only had my mother and my ah ma.</p>
              <p>I still remember staying with my grandmother, sleeping with my mother in a room. The room only had a study table and two matress for me and my mother.</p>
              <p>Mummy worked two jobs, as a cashier at the Yohan SC and as a factory worker at night. Still remembered how i worked her up at 12 PM, to get her to send me to school, when she barely slept after night shift.</p>
              <p>Then in primary three, after a 1 month holiday, my mother was killed, while opening the letterbox at the void deck by a robber. She was stabbed.</p>
              <p>I was left with my grandmother and my small uncle. My grandmother would bring me to school, pushing her trolley along, before she goes to work at the market. Everyday's dinner would be porridge or rice with leftovers from the night before. </p>
              <p>2 years later, she died.</p>
              <p>I then lived with my uncle, but he was almost never home.</p>
              <p>When i was secondary 1, i started working everyday after sch, distributing flyers everyday, that year, my uncle got married and moved out, i lived alone since them. Well, at least he would provide me with 200 dollars per month and settle the bills.</p>
              <p>So i started working and schooling, and yes, i did it, i entered poly, after retaking my o levels once.</p>
              <p>After entrance into poly, i managed to get a job which pays 15 dollars per hour, which is pretty good for me. Life was better and easier. Then i bought my first loyal companion! She was a jack russell!!!</p>
              <p>She was so beautiful, training her was hard, but she eventually became a good and obedient dog despite the fact that i was out early and came home late everyday.</p>
              <p>Then i met a girl in year 2 in one of the module. We became very close and within months, we were madly in love. I thought, i was a lucky person, i had somebody who loved me so much.</p>
              <p>We shared everyday together, had so much fun with her when we bring prego out for walks. She was a movie maniac, i remembered watching movies till we had no movies to catch at the cinemas!!</p>
              <p>When prego was 3 years old, she went missing, i was very worried and pasted posters all around for her. but idiots went around destroying my posters, tearing them one by one, also tearing my chance of finding my beloved.</p>
              <p>She was never found, but the security at hougang mall told me a dog was run down by a car, the description sounded like prego, but i never wanted to confirm.</p>
              <p>I went for my NS, and ORD-ed this year. I was immediately applied for a full time job at the previous company i was working for during my poly days, as a field rep. The money was good, enough for my bills and for entertainment and savings. My girlfriend was working in a jewellery shop too, we were finally financially stable..</p>
              <p>3 weeks ago, she died. some fucking bastard hit her around lorong chuan and fled the scene. She died on the spot. With that news, my pillar of support crumbled too.</p>
              <p>Now, right here in this room, where my mother, grandmother, prego and my beloved shared so much memories with me, has only me. Everything and everyone that i loved would meet with a bad ending, but not me. Life had made me strong enough to fend for myself, strong enough to always look on the positive side, and strong enough for me to suffer the agony of losing everything i have one by one.</p>
              <p>Please treasure whatever you have, before its too late.</p>
