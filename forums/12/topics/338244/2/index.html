              <p><br>think of it this way.</p>
              <p>would you prefer him to find a hooker or someone else ( other than you alone) to satisfy his sexual urges, or masturbating to pornographic materials?</p>
              <p>which is more dangerous and traitorous?</p>
              <p>everyone has varying degree of sexual needs.... and usually, men have higher amount of those than their female counterparts.</p>
              <p>as long as your bf does not betray you in real life, there's little wrong with him masturbating to himself. pornography is probably just an external stimuli employed to enhance his sexual fantasies/pleasure.</p>
              <p>please look at him as a whole, and not just pick on his "bad" points. i'm sure overall, he's a nice guy, or you wouldn't have been with him.</p>
              <p>overlook his little shortcomings. embrace his greater goodness. then your life will be happier.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>He is "hungry". Are you willing to give it to him whenever he needs it? No right? coz you'll tell him you are too tired, no mood, etc... If thats so, what is he going to do with his urge? Recite buddha scriptures ah? Of coz the easiest way is to wank it out lor.</p>

              <p>hi jess,</p>
              <p>I understand that u are hurt. Every women wants their bf &amp; hubby to be devoted to them. Catching him doing this kind of stuff makes u feel that he is not 100% in love/devoted to u. . He can be doing it &amp; fantasing of someone else does not make him more prone to cheat on u. Fantasing is healthy. Every one does that. One day u  will too. I'm sure  he is still v much in love with u, and finds u very attractive.</p>
              <p>So don't feel hurt. Even u are  Miss world , etc, u will still catch him musturbating !</p>

              <p><br>There's actually no right or wrong in this kind of scenario.</p>
              <p>It all depends on you actually. If you really mind and felt uncomfortable about your bf's masturbation, then please let your bf know and your bf should respect you and stop this kind of activities at once if he really cared about your feelings.</p>
              <p>Some girls mind, while others tried to act like open-minded and doesn't mind. But this is a subjective issue and the right answer for your scenario lies within what you felt when you caught him masturbating.</p>
              <p>It's as easy as you don't like him to have piercings in his body and it's as easy as he doesn't like you to wear super revealing top.</p>
              <p>Just let him know...and don't listen to all those masturbation supporters cos they are probably masturbaters themselves. And don't listen to those open-minded aunties cos they are not YOU and will never understand how comfortable you are feeling and experience what you are going through.</p>
              <p>Decide for yourself and let your bf know about your uneasiness regarding his masturbation.</p>
              <p>But let us know the outcome ok? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I agree with some replies. Its better he masturbate rather than having sex with other girls. If lets say he need sex twice per day, are u willing to give it to him? If you don't, where u expect him to 'release' ? Or maybe you're too 'holy'? From what i know, After marriage, Wife doesnt give husband enough sex and thats where geylang comes along with broken families.(NOT blaming women. Man also at fault sometimes.) So cant entirely blame him. You need a pair of hands to clap. Sit and talk with him. You could have missed out something important of his needs. Or maybe he warming up waiting for you to come home only? lol</p></div>
