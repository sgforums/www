            <div class='col-md body'>to a guy career is usually important since it directly translates into finanical clout which will in turn determine how well he can care for his loved ones, in this case being you.<br><br>does he still has feelings for you or not? I not sure if there is a typo. assuming there is still love betwen you 2, what you need to do now is to show him support. do not depend on him for emotional support which you need desperately now. instead give him yours. understand his situation. Leave him alone but let him know that if he needs you, you will be there instantly. Dont let him worry by saying that you are worried that he dun love you, care for you etc etc. It only makes him more sian. Keep yourself occupied so that he doesnt feel guilty for *leaving* you alone. since you guys meet o9nly 3/4 hrs a week, it may also mean that that's the only time he has to rest, give him that time to rest. you guys can just talk on the phone in the meantime. let him recharge.<br><br>i am assuming both of you are of a mature age. are there any definite plans for marraige?</div>

Especially if a guy can tell you that he've no longer got that 'passion' and 'feeling' for the relationship.... Perhaps he's just not the tactful sort of guy who knows how to put it in words.... It's still too early for me to tell.....<br><br>Chances are, he's either REALLY no longer interested in the relationship... Or he's PLAIN confused... The career getting in between thing is probably just to ANSWER... To both you and himself.....<br><br>Realise that DANGEROUS move he's making despite the FACT that he understands the relationship is on the rock and he still pins his career as PRIORITY.... Does he have other important financial commitments to make in his Life...? That might explain things especially now that it's recession period....<br><br>Alternatively, he could be too busy with work that he don't have time to attend to the problem in between the 2 of you.... Or he might be confused himself as I'd mentioned above that he choose to bury himself in his work.... Anyway, whatever's the reason... Having the relationship running for long on this mode would most probably be a rather bad thing.... But PUSHING him for a resolvement might not be such a good idea neither... (have to take into consideration of his plight if he's really facing one...)<br><br>Does he have a life of his own...? Hobbies...? Things he like to do...?<br><br>Don't mind telling me what are both of your star signs...? What do you people do together when you meet up for that short hours...? How did you 1st got into the relationship with him...? He was doing NS back then...?<br><br>What are you working as...?<br><br>Regards....</div>

Talk about the time spend together, the things you people do together. Its is reduced to very routine and its unseen draining of the relation. Most people feel that by going a long period of time = a very safe relation because both party must have love each other very much and stuff, but reality, this is not very true. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>1 week meet 3-4 hours is definitely not enough, you don't have to meet everyday, but that is far too few in terms of ability to mantain or upkeep the relation. Think about this - Am I right to say his good friends even spend more than that YOU, being his girl friend? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Feelings can find back, but it is difficult because unless he really wants to be with you and take the EXTRA mile to work on the relation, if not it is like clapping with one hand - zero result. Career is an excuse... because if he organise and plan his time well, he can still find time - time is there for people to plan, not plan by time. Issue is whether he wants anot. The easiest way out is just to mention that he is so busy cannot spare time - and avoid all responsiblities and still expect the relation to go on like usual - relation never works in this way and never will. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Both of you have already reach the peak of the relation and PROPER communication is needed to ensure the continuing of the relationship. You have to speak to him about all the points regarding this issue. Then - that is the first and essential step to solve the problem. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
