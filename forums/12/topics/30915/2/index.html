            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>i think i'm facing the similar problem as Love_him.  Last night, me and my bf had an agrument.  He said that he thinks that i'm taking up too much of his time, $ and energy.  He is working and doing a part-time course.  I'm looking for a job so that i can help him financially.  He said he has been thinking of a break-up for quite a while but sometimes, we are still discussing abt the future and seems so happily together.  Currently, we have been meeting once on a weekday after his work and the other on a weekend.  Actually, i think he doesnt have good time mgt becoz most of his free time is spent watching tv and playing games and yet he complained to me that he has no time left for himself.  We have been together for 1 and a half yrs.  I also start to feel that he is rather self-centred and sometimes he juz dont listent to what i have to say.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  Should I cut the meeting time so as to give him more time for himself or any other better advise??

Talk about the time spend together, the things you people do together. Its is reduced to very routine and its unseen draining of the relation. Most people feel that by going a long period of time = a very safe relation because both party must have love each other very much and stuff, but reality, this is not very true. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>1 week meet 3-4 hours is definitely not enough, you don't have to meet everyday, but that is far too few in terms of ability to mantain or upkeep the relation. Think about this - Am I right to say his good friends even spend more than that YOU, being his girl friend? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Feelings can find back, but it is difficult because unless he really wants to be with you and take the EXTRA mile to work on the relation, if not it is like clapping with one hand - zero result. Career is an excuse... because if he organise and plan his time well, he can still find time - time is there for people to plan, not plan by time. Issue is whether he wants anot. The easiest way out is just to mention that he is so busy cannot spare time - and avoid all responsiblities and still expect the relation to go on like usual - relation never works in this way and never will. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Both of you have already reach the peak of the relation and PROPER communication is needed to ensure the continuing of the relationship. You have to speak to him about all the points regarding this issue. Then - that is the first and essential step to solve the problem. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div></blockquote>......

If you've decided that this relationship is yours to keep, it'll better to go <span style="font-style: italic;">mild</span>.... Time with him would be short for now... Cultivate more on the sensitive and refined side of you when you're with him.... (that doesn't mean you cannot have fun with him... He can be as fun-loving as you are...) This would help stabilise your relationship with him, help him save energy to concentrate on his work, help synchronise BOTH of your pace and mentality for better maintainence and understanding in relationship.... (think you've mentioned that you're already doing something like that in your earlier post...?) Direct your energies into your own Life (I'm sure there're lots of things which interest you in Life...) and with your friends... But to prevent your relationship with him to wear off on a monotonous mode, try to plan some things or activities which would spark up for both of you once in a while....? (duration which you deem fit...)<br><br>Could be a pretty good man you're holding onto here you know..? At least I don't think I would wanna give him up just like that if I'm in your shoes...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  And what would become of him in the future.... REMEMBER, you would most probably be able to play a MAJOR part....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">~good day!</span></div>
