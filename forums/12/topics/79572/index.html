Where did you get your stats? Do not implicate others for your personal perception for this is definitely incorrect.<br><br>Let me ask you one simple question: Can a virgin bride/gf guarantees a fulfilling relationship?<br><br>ItÂ’s your mindset that limits your growth in maturity and attitude towards Love itself; I am not saying you are wrong, but why squeeze into the left lane and jammed the entire route when you could go straight?  Narrow mindedness can only go so far Â– you donÂ’t see love in relationship; you calculate worth and value through the measurement of your own yardstick.<br><br>I cannot say itÂ’s wrong to want a virgin gf/bride if thatÂ’s your desire Â– but what if you donÂ’t have one? Are you going to kill the relationship just because your mind clogs your heart and you see nothing but a piece of membrane?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You are at risk to sacrifice a potentially good relationship for you own self-absorb thinking.<br><br>I have so many friends, who are exactly like you Â– in the end even with virgin gf, I seriously donÂ’t see their relationship as fulfilling and evergreen. In fact, because of the mindset, like mind maps Â– <strong>it spider-webbed the effect of their afflicted core and sprout many different conflicts and tension while running the relationship.</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> In simple, it brings other form of problems because you are taught to see things you own way - not love's way.<br><br>P.S: Learn to open your mind and see your gf as herself. The more you mind, the more disappointment you get. Love is about compromising Â– are you willing to adapt and change your mindset if I am telling you that it will be good for you?<br><br>Cheers</div>

No teeth! Must have good suction!<br>3) How to do a quickie!<br>4) How to scream and shout!<br>5) Know the various positions!<br>6) Fondle and caress you properly...<br><br>Hey all these takes experience okay, so unless you know how to teach her all these techniques(If you're a Virgin, you would'nt have a clue)!!! Will at least take you a good 6mths to 2yrs and if you have no prior experience whatsoever you will never learn all the techniques!<br><br>Very few girls are natural at BJs but with most you have to teach them how to do it, takes lots of practice. With an experienced trained one, she would know exactly what to do to make you cum in less than a min!<br><br>Then, comes sex, sex with a virgin which is usually in a missionary position for the 1st few times, usually she will be a dead fish... ie not move much as she would have to tong the pain. So, embedded in her mind is this dead fish position and not move further and since the two of you are V, you will both think that this position is the ONLY position. As if you tried any other position when she is a virgin, chances are pentration will be quite hard.<br><br>But, sex with an experienced girl, she will know how to ride, saddle you and scream you to heaven! Plus other things...<br><br>Then, comes other thoughts in her mind, would sex with another man be better? She will have these wild thoughts when she is going thru a menopause usually around late 30s and 40s. She might have the curosity to try it out with other guys!<br><br>With an experienced and trained one, she would have been there and done that! And she would know what she wants and can easily satisfy your every desire!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

Will at least take you a good 6mths to 2yrs and if you have no prior experience whatsoever you will never learn all the techniques!<br><br>Very few girls are natural at BJs but with most you have to teach them how to do it, takes lots of practice. With an experienced trained one, she would know exactly what to do to make you cum in less than a min!<br><br>Then, comes sex, sex with a virgin which is usually in a missionary position for the 1st few times, usually she will be a dead fish... ie not move much as she would have to tong the pain. So, embedded in her mind is this dead fish position and not move further and since the two of you are V, you will both think that this position is the ONLY position. As if you tried any other position when she is a virgin, chances are pentration will be quite hard.<br><br>But, sex with an experienced girl, she will know how to ride, saddle you and scream you to heaven! Plus other things...<br><br>Then, comes other thoughts in her mind, would sex with another man be better? She will have these wild thoughts when she is going thru a menopause usually around late 30s and 40s. She might have the curosity to try it out with other guys!<br><br>With an experienced and trained one, she would have been there and done that! And she would know what she wants and can easily satisfy your every desire!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Nice thoughts.<br></div>
