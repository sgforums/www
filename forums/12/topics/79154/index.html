            <div class='col-md body'>hi im 15 yr old boyand i think im gay. there is this boy in my class i really fancy and i was best mates with him just under a year ago and one night at a friend's sleepover we were sleeping on the same futon and we had sex. after that he ignored me and our friendship was ruined. eventually we made up but he refused to talk about it, our friendship carried on but we were no longer best friends. then about six months after that night (which is about 3 months ago) we went to see a film with other friends and we were sitting next to each other and we started rubbing legs together and touching each other but then the film ended and he went home. we never mentioned it again after that and haven't got in the same close position. i really love him and have done for ages but i don't think he feels the same way because he acted so oddly after our sex as though he never wanted to do it again but in the cinema he was really up for it. i can't talk to him about how i feel beacuse i am to nervous and would never pluck up the courage so that is out of the question. i was considering getting my friend to have another sleepover and invite the boy i love and see how it goes but i am all that friendly with him at the moment so it would look suspicious inviting him. what else could i do? (no-one else knows i'm gay so i cant talk to anyone else about my problems)<br><br>Please help me. Thank you</div>
