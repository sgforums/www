Just don't put too much pressure and start restricting her freedom... once in a while create a personal problem and asked her advice.  These kind of questions are really good instead of the normal MCQs or "True/False" questions.  For eg.  I'm facing problems with my who and who because so and so said something bad about who and who to me so that I don't know to be good to so and so or who and who?  What do you think about this affair?  In this way, you can get to know more about her.  How she thinks and level of maturity.  Good?  Urmm... i shouldn't be letting out these trade secrets, you know.  :p<br><br>One more thing you have to be careful when chasing girls in the same class.  Make pals with her friends first because if anyone one of them doesn't like you.  Your chances are cut by half.  If all of them don't like you, you're a gone case.<br><br>The other thing, make sure the other guys in class don't tease you.  That's the surest way to end a good courtship, because she will ignore you, avoid you at all costs just to be normal.  Other than that, go full steam ahead.  Good luck!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>

The thing is that to her, u have to take more initiative to approach her.<br><br>many a times a girl will do this to a guy she initially have no interest or feelings, sometimes is test u... see if u perservere, but there are those who really have no interest in u. but look at urself. all these reaction from her has already discourage u so much. how are u going to chase her. how are u going to have to will to push urself on to get her affection??<br><br>Besides u mentioned that when u tok to her, u feel that kind of uneasiness is becoz u took her as ur target, and hence from there u always watch ur words when u are wif her. this makes u feel very uneasy wif her. And to her she will feel very superficial. And wat's more, u will display the most positive side of u. but as someone who wants to accept u as who u are, ur flaws will actually do a better job instead. that's part of accepting. and I think the girl will feel that it's incomplete if she just know ur strengths or weakness alone... it's just have to balance...<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)
