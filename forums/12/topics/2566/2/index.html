            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, i agree with Klac on the point about "don't be a christian for the wrong reason" ... The bible quotes that not because non-christians are not good enough for christians but because there might be a clash in thinking between believers and non-believers which may result in broken relationships that God definitely won't want to see   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>It's good to know that there are guys out there who are this serious about relationships and love issues ( like Chokobo ) ...he's not making a big fuss out of a small issue ~    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I see hope ~~~~ *dreamily*<br><br>------------------------------<br>There are so many stars in the sky, but only some are radiant enough to be noticed...

            <div class='col-md body'>well, all i wanted to say has been said by retrac, klac n luvofmine......haiizzzz...you gen wo qiang shen yi......nvm, me wun qi nei one! =)<br><br>basically, do consider wat they r saying lo. =)) it's like, ask urself properly, wat do u rreally hope n wish to get from her lo......do u actually really wan her to reciprocrate ur love? or i dunno....i mean wat's da main reason behind u going after her..........=) oh n, ya, look at things from her point of view tooz (like i've said b4). i realised tt u may not know much abt christianity, but from wat has been given to u here (which is rather a lil' more than enuff), put urself in her shoes, and think of wat U would haf doen if u were her.....<br>bear in mind the major things here.......1) christianity, 2) her shyness. mebbe there's more la, but i tink u noe la hor? no need me to quote everything down rite? hee~<br><br>oya, n 1 very very important thing to stress on.............i'm encouraging u to go to church, but rem, do not become a christian for anyone else but God Himself.......okiez???<br><br>and also, i think u could n should try going to church with the mindset tt u wanna learn more abt christianity, and about God, coz thru' God, u'll also be able to know more abt her. realise tt there's a huge difference between going to the church to learn more abt God, and going to church just to c her.....or even just to get closer to her......=) CheeriOz!!</div>
