I'd choose: having one and making him/her The One.

Think again and again and again. After Five to ten yrs down the road, think again of what you've claimed those days.<br>Maybe the One standing before you on the Aisle and wearing tuxedo saying wedding vows to you is your eighth or tenth! Haha.<br><br>Who knows.....<br><br>I'll end here and leave the rest for your thoughts. Don't be too sure of what you think. Don't take everything too seriously, yet do not fool around with things you cherish. Learning to Learn thru experiences is a gift in life.<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>

After Five to ten yrs down the road, think again of what you've claimed those days.<br>Maybe the One standing before you on the Aisle and wearing tuxedo saying wedding vows to you is your eighth or tenth! Haha.<br><br>Who knows.....<br><br>I'll end here and leave the rest for your thoughts. Don't be too sure of what you think. Don't take everything too seriously, yet do not fool around with things you cherish. Learning to Learn thru experiences is a gift in life.<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

My best fren decided long ago, tt his 2nd ex was The One, &amp; he'd wait for her, even after going out wif his 3rd gf (which he later broke up wif).

We'll just wait and see lor.<br>As like i've said. A relationship is not complete just by seeing couple happy. I have seen cases of a couple(both my close friends but the guy is a player converted by this girl into a good bf) satisfying one another in many aspects and they looked really blissful. I've had chances to ask each of them personally how they've felt being in their relationship, and they were happy.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Lucky guy and girl....until one fine day, they broke up and he called me up crying away. He didn't understand a single thing he did wrong.<br><br>Something i found out from her. She had a quiet desire for a adventurous and playful guy. My friend is too 'NICE' to her and she agreed being happy with him cos he did all she wanted a guy to. But he lacks something. So she left.<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;Too too many of such cases, ASk YUnnie and Dev about it.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> He believes in that she had completed him, does it apply the same to her? How would anyone know other then herself?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Foundation of relationship, duration of being together, personality traits, character compatibility, being most important when looking into a more secured relationship. Social circle and external factors comes next.<br><br>Like in my fourth point, i have already stood on my point.<br>We can do our best, however we cannot control another party of emotions and depth of love unless AOS is applied.<br><br>And like your friend have said. He believed in 'Some believes in searching for The One (Active)'<br>Half of me will bless him, but the other half denies his point.<br>His decision in years down the road might become a pattern or broken relationship might lead him to evolve for better or worse.<br>Eg. 2nd gf - the One then changed to the present gf(the One)<br>Then present gf broke up, 4th gf became the one...he chnged his mind many times.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Yunhaier:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]The One DOESN'T promise final journey - it promise lessons that NOBODY else could give you. </span><br>[/b][/quote]<br><br>I like this quote below.
