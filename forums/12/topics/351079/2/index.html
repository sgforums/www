              you said you're determined to get into a university and yet you
              chose to drop out of poly - when you know that's one of the routes

              <p>Depends, if you are confident you can score in your O lvls, I will recommend you to go retake it. Then score it.</p>
              <p>Then u can decide if you wanna go to JC or to Poly. JC im not sure if theres a maximum age, but theres still poly! Get into your favoured course then you score again. By then, NUS, NTU is not far away from your grasp.</p>

              <p>n u're a cock. dropout means fool meh? ts, if u wanna do smth about it, u really have to set your heart to it and really get down to it man. since you've already dropped out, it's best to come to a decision really quick. enlist first maybe a better option since u are not clear of yr route. u can buy the 2 years worth of time in ns to really think about what you want and plan out yr route. and yeah, university admission, really isn't easy, good o level results doesnt equate to an admission position.</p>

              <p>TS, I was a PHD too. (Poly Halfway Dropout)</p>
              <p>What was your reason for quitting sch? Fot me, I quit becos I
              did not like Engineering and I quit during my 2nd year. I knew
              this course was not the one I like and I wont work in this
              industry if I graduate.</p>
              <p>I knew I wanted other thing.</p>
              <p>So I served my NS first and after I ORD, I went back to poly and
              this time round, I take up a course I liked and subsequently, I
              graduated.</p>
              <p>I agree in SG u need paper qualifications to stand a higher
              chance to get hired, but with the right attitude and maybe
              entreprenuership from u, I believe u can make it too.</p>
              <p>Maybe u can consider to be like me too, get back to study at a
              poly again. Becos I think poly is a good route for u to consider
              and those 5 polys are recognised institutes in SG and after 3
              years, u can go on to work or study at university to get your
              degree.</p>
              <p>If I were u, I really will go back to poly. Good luck.</p>

              <p>maybe ts is sick of the usual books and education</p>
              <p>yeah, maybe a change in environment like NS can refresh him again</p>

              <p>n u're a cock. dropout means fool meh? ts, if u wanna do smth
              about it, u really have to set your heart to it and really get down
              to it man. since you've already dropped out, it's best to come to a
              decision really quick. enlist first maybe a better option since u
              are not clear of yr route. u can buy the 2 years worth of time in
              ns to really think about what you want and plan out yr route.
              and yeah, university admission, really isn't easy, good o level
              results doesnt equate to an admission position.</p>

              <p>I also think quite a good idea to buy 2 years worth of time by going NS</p>
              <p>Can save up a bit of cash somemore while "buying" the 2 years.</p>
