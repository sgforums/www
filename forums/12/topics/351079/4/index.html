              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by M the name:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Dear "whattodo" , of course I am giving important advise and not
              "negative" words, I will further explain why I choose to recommend
              an online degree from America instead of NUS, or any other UK or
              Australia universities. Firstly as mention they will accept
              "O"(Since you can enter Poly, your "O" level shouldn't be too bad,
              right?)Second as long as you choose universities under the 7 US
              regional government, you should be VERY safe.Beside, since it
              online, you can choose your own pace and schedule to study.You can
              even work full-time if you want.</p>
              <p>You should also forget about choosing Local University Like NUS
              or UK,Australia University because their degree has an negative
              "ranking" brand which is the 1st Class Honour, 2rd Class Honour and
              3nd Class Honour.For your info, it just like our primary school
              system : Em1 ,EM2 AND EM3, if even finally you can study in NUS, if
              your grade fall under 1st or 2nd class honour, you are still safe,
              however if you are under 3nd Class honour, hopely you will not only
              be embrassed but angered that why you wasted your time to suffer
              more humiliation just because you think that going to NUS is
              better.<br> <br> For USA education, no "ranking or honour class" will reflect on
              their degree certificate, however you need to score at least an GPA
              point of 4.5 and above in order to graduate from their university.
              In fact after graduated, you can still be recognised as "an
              scholar" and you can join their "gang" society like National
              Scholars Honour Society of USA, their link :
              http://www.collegeHonors.org. Can our education system help you to
              achieve that? Especially when they label you so obivously into
              "honour class"? When your boss see your name-card and degree, he
              will said this "So you are an 3rd Honour degree, do you know how to
              make coffee for us ?"(Watch too much "å°�å­©ä¸�ç¬¨ Liao.") Think of whether
              what I argued is something you SHOULD considered if you REALLY want
              to go to NUS so much, or maybe some UK, Australia University from
              local Commerical school that branded you as above.You should know
              what is good for yourself.<br> <br> Finally don't argued we should be "realistic" that an degree which
              accepted "O" level is useless.If an "foreigner talent"/ "Hot"
              European in Singapore with an "established, accepted "O' level,
              accredited but "not heard" of degree and you with an NUS degree
              went for an job interview, who do you think got the higher change
              of getting the job? I will leave your people 's option open and
              since this topic is not related to "foreign talent" which is
              sensitive and also not related to your answer. I am just provide
              you with an "Win-Win" option which is to help you achieve an
              Bachelor with HONOUR.  Yeah !</p>

              <p>I'm twenty now, and i don't want to go back to Poly!!! Ahhh, very vexed! Can't let my parents know,  think have to buy a fake certificate to lie to them temporarily. Think maybe go work first but i'm not really sure.Went to the career fair last week, need like 5-6 years to get my bachelor degree, so almost like going back to poly - diploma, advanced diploma, bachelor. Ask them if can go NUS with advanced diploma but they say not likely possible. I also don't want to go JC. Maybe i think i retake my o levels? If obtain good grades can try entry with NUS or not? Or maybe is it possible to take a levels as private candidate??</p>

              <p>I would say an online degree is certainly an option for the TS, but wouldn't go so far as to say it's better than a local uni? I mean, to be perfectly honest about it, isn't local university the cheaper and more prestigious option? I don't think it's fair to discredit the local uni in favour of an online degree. And also, the stigma attached to an online degree is still there.</p>

              <p>Regarding M's post, i can only say that most of the reputable online degrees are for Post Graduate studies which is irrelevant for TS anyway.</p>
              <p>I do agree that Stanford and Columbia University are top-ranked unis but how many of us can actually get in?</p>
              <p>btw, i have looked at the link you had given for the Columbia university and i noticed that there are a few degrees for engineering?Can you explain to me how can a person obtain an engineering degree by learning through online without the practical lessons?You mean you believe the employers would employ someone who are only good in theories?</p>
              <p>Singaporean parents are well-known for being kaisu, if online degrees are really that great most of them would have already enrolled their children in it and not the normal jc/poly route.</p>
              <p>And just to let you know EDB attract foreign institutions to set up campus in Singapore is because we aimed to be an Education Hub.Majority of private institutions are flooded by foreigners and not Singaporeans anyway.</p>
              <p>Local Unis are still the preferred choice for most Singaporeans, this can be seen by the record number of applicants every year.</p>
