              <p>I'm twenty now, and i don't want to go back to Poly!!! Ahhh, very vexed! Can't let my parents know,  think have to buy a fake certificate to lie to them temporarily. Think maybe go work first but i'm not really sure.Went to the career fair last week, need like 5-6 years to get my bachelor degree, so almost like going back to poly - diploma, advanced diploma, bachelor. Ask them if can go NUS with advanced diploma but they say not likely possible. I also don't want to go JC. Maybe i think i retake my o levels? If obtain good grades can try entry with NUS or not? Or maybe is it possible to take a levels as private candidate??</p>

              <p>TS, I was a PHD too. (Poly Halfway Dropout)</p>
              <p>What was your reason for quitting sch? Fot me, I quit becos I did not like Engineering and I quit during my 2nd year. I knew this course was not the one I like and I wont work in this industry if I graduate.</p>
              <p>I knew I wanted other thing.</p>
              <p>So I served my NS first and after I ORD, I went back to poly and this time round, I take up a course I liked and subsequently, I graduated.</p>
              <p>I agree in SG u need paper qualifications to stand a higher chance to get hired, but with the right attitude and maybe entreprenuership from u, I believe u can make it too.</p>
              <p>Maybe u can consider to be like me too, get back to study at a poly again. Becos I think poly is a good route for u to consider and those 5 polys are recognised institutes in SG and after 3 years, u can go on to work or study at university to get your degree.</p>
              <p>If I were u, I really will go back to poly. Good luck.</p>

              <p>Hi, have you thought going to SIM University from Singapore which is partner with  University of Buffalo to study.These UB degree are popular because they accept "O" level result and if you scored "good enough" grade you should be able to get in.</p>
              <p>Another option, have you thought of pursue an America online/distance learning Bachelor degree from Accredited Universities.They must be "recognised" by these accredited or regional governement department, the 7 reliable bodies are:</p>
              <p>1. Middle State Association of colleges and Schools <br> 2. New England Association of Schools and Colleges <br> 3. North Central Association of Schools and Colleges <br> 4. Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges <br> 5. Southern Association of Colleges and Schools <br> 6. Western Association of Schools and Colleges <br> 7. Distance Education and Training Council (for Universities that only offers distance learning programs)</p>
              <p>You can find out more from : http://www.petersons.com/ .Or you can also go to an local USA Education development company called America Academic Alliance in Sunshine Plaza to apply for distance learning degree : http://www.americanacademicalliance.com/</p>
              <p>Correct me "Old Birds" if I am wrong that an accredited online degree cannot help you to find a better career and go for further study.Cheer !</p>

              <p>firstly, you should know why under the conventional education in polythenic that you have choosen to drop out. It would be even more difficult for you to progress if you want to choose an easy way out.</p>
              <p>Studies is not all about certificates. It's also about learning a skill and gaining extra knowledge. Face it. if you choose to run away when facing with difficulties, it will be even more difficult to take another step forward.  This is the real world. certificate do play a part when you want to move forward in future,</p>

              <p>TS, I was a PHD too. (Poly Halfway Dropout)</p>
              <p>What was your reason for quitting sch? Fot me, I quit becos I
              did not like Engineering and I quit during my 2nd year. I knew
              this course was not the one I like and I wont work in this
              industry if I graduate.</p>
              <p>I knew I wanted other thing.</p>
              <p>So I served my NS first and after I ORD, I went back to poly and
              this time round, I take up a course I liked and subsequently, I
              graduated.</p>
              <p>I agree in SG u need paper qualifications to stand a higher
              chance to get hired, but with the right attitude and maybe
              entreprenuership from u, I believe u can make it too.</p>
              <p>Maybe u can consider to be like me too, get back to study at a
              poly again. Becos I think poly is a good route for u to consider
              and those 5 polys are recognised institutes in SG and after 3
              years, u can go on to work or study at university to get your
              degree.</p>
              <p>If I were u, I really will go back to poly. Good luck.</p>

              <p>I think this guy gives good advice.</p>
              <p>Identify your problem.. if course is wrong, you can even take part-time right? Go and work, and then take part time diploma course in the one you like. And if you feel you doing well, and want to pursue a degree, then do that later.</p>
              <p>but the key is still to come straight with your family. It is better to get their support than to keep lying. Cause once you start to lie, it is downwards spiral.. you have to keep inventing lies, and it will get worse for you.</p>

              <p>It's hard-  you have to spend your energy fighting off your parents, your so called friends, and your own self doubt.</p>
              <p>Make sure you have the guts to do what you think is right for you. Be true to yourself first.</p>
              <p>TS- you had a good point. If you go back to sec school, it's possible to get better marks and get into a higher degree course. I've met about twenty people who have either sat their final year of sec school again, or did a year of science or "easy" degree, and then worked their ass off to get good grades and be able to transfer to a "higher" course, like law, dentistry or medicine.</p>
              <p>Or:</p>
              <p>If you are disciplined, you can work straight off and even with lower pay, you can save and invest your pay and by the time you are 30, you will nearly be a millionaire. This is because you will start work 3 to 5 years earlier than those who study.</p>
              <p>In Sydney, I saw an article of this lady, 29yo, who started work in McDonalds age18. Stayed and became a manager. She invested and had $3.3 million  of property, and a mortgage of $2.2 million.....she was a millionaire.</p>
              <p>So take some time to yourself, clear your head, think about what you can do, and good luck:)</p>
