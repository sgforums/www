              <p><br> Seems like you already know what you want do for yourself and
                  nothing else for you family.</p>
              <p>You have already condemned your family to Hell in your topic
                  post, why do you need us to give you further support for you to cut
                  off all your obligations towards your family?</p>
              <p>Is it because you are also aware that what you were planning to
                  do is a bad thing to do to your OWN FAMILY?</p>
              <p>Did you Mum also lashed out at you or mistreated you like you're
                  not one of her own daughters?</p>
              <p>Do you think your decision not to help your sister is something
                  that would makes your Mum happy?</p>
              <p>It's sad enough for your Mother to see one insensible daughter
                  misbehaving and lost in her own path in life. Do you really want
                  your Mother to witness the other daughter to be insensible and bear
                  hatred for her sister too?</p>
              <p>Do you really love your Mum and your family or do you really
                  just love yourself the most?</p>
              <p>Is revenge really so important for you right now?</p>
              <p>Why didn't you defend yourself and talk back at your sister when
                  you were insulted/humiliated by her?</p>
              <p>If you choose to keep quiet because you were a coward and afraid
                  because you were young or because that's not your character to talk
                  back, then so be it and let it go since it has already happened so
                  long ago.</p>
              <p>You can be the different and better daughter to your Mum, it's
                  up to you to make that decision and stick to it for the sake of
                  yourself.</p>
              <p>And when you have daughters of your own in the future, you will
                  probably laugh over them inside your hearts for what had happened
                  to you in your past between you and your sister.</p>
              <p>Be graceful and gracious, and I don't mind if you are twisted
                  and angry at the retarded people in this forums once in a while.
                  But be graceful and gracious in your real world and be KIND to
                  yourself.</p>
              <p>There are greater pain waiting for you in the future
                  if you choose not to let this pain go.</p>

              <p>hmmm well you got valid point too.  nevertheless, we must remember that the world is made up of all sorts of people, and that includes family.  if family is so ideal, then we won't see court cases and family tragedy stories liao.  this is the sad fact of life.  some people have deep-seated beliefs.  no matter how hard you try to explain, the other person just can't see your point of view. </p>
              <p>we always assume that parents do the best for the kids.  however, best intention doesn't mean best results.  it may even backfire.  what we (and parents themselves) want to believe in may be different from the facts and reality i.e. how things actually turn out.  even parents live in denial that they made mistake.  parents n older siblings are not saints.  like many of us, they may not have a clue what they are doing but just faking it due to their ego and wanting to appear correct.</p>

              <p>Regarding your question: I don't agree with parnie. Becoz if i go by parn's advice, not only I allow my own life to be messed up and also i will further set a wrong view to my family that their doings are acceptable.</p>
              <p>Anyway, like what you said i will work out a plan myself. What is useful to me i will heed. Thanks again. Obviously when i post this, i am also kinda seeking for some support. Thanks for your support.</p>

              <p>The problem is there, is not whether i accept or not. And i am resolving this. About being Gracious, i think is redundant for u to say that becoz you r not me or even in the situation.</p>
