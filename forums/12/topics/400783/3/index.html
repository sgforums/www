              <p>In the 1st place, there is no encouragement of hatred and
              negative feelings. Some advice from other users are quite

              <p>The problem is there, is not whether i accept or not. And i am
              resolving this. About being Gracious, i think is redundant for u to
              say that becoz you r not me or even in the situation.</p>
              <p>And lastly, there is no competition, so what do you mean by i am
              the winner??? This is abt being clear in what is to be applied to
              my circumstances. Its not abt fighting.</p>

              <p>Regarding your question: I don't agree with parnie. Becoz if i
                  go by parn's advice, not only I allow my own life to be messed up
                  and also i will further set a wrong view to my family that their

              <p>Anyway, like what you said i will work out a plan myself. What

              <p>Hey girl.. parnie is probably another big sister who bullies her own younger siblings.</p>
              <p>Family is for loving and sharing.. not for bullying and to take advantage of.</p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong with you helping out your sis and mother. You do it because you wanted to share your time and efforts and love with them.</p>
              <p>But there should be gratitude, not insults and endless expectations and demands from them.</p>
              <p>Family will always be family no doubt.. when in need, you don't demand, you can only hope they will be there to help you too.</p>
              <p>When they do, you are grateful. Not think that it's your god given rights.</p>
              <p>Family don't bully family. That's a very simple, universal rule of thumb. When they do, they are no longer family in your heart.</p>

              <p>There is nothing wrong with you helping out your sis and mother. You do it because you wanted to share your time and efforts and love with them.</p>
              <p>But there should be gratitude, not insults and endless expectations and demands from them.</p>
              <p>Family will always be family no doubt.. when in need, you don't demand, you can only hope they will be there to help you too.</p>
              <p>When they do, you are grateful. Not think that it's your god given rights.</p>
              <p>Family don't bully family. That's a very simple, universal rule of thumb. When they do, they are no longer family in your heart.</p>

              <p>Hi all, so this is what is going on.</p>
              <p>I have a elder sis, 8 years older than me. Got married when she
              was 18 yr old with a man 8 years older than herself. so after 7
              years, they divorce due to 3rd party intrude and the man is no good
              himself. My sis gave birth to 2 kids from this marriage. 1 is now a
              primary 2 school kid and one is still 2 yr old going to 3 yr
              old.</p>
              <p>In the past, when i was still younger, from primary 5 onwards, i
              started to help out in looking after her kids. until last year when
              things turned ugly. She had always see herself as someone very
              impt, and there is nothing more impt than her. she likes to ask for
              help from her family and then after helping her out, she will turn
              her back off and return to her normal arrogant self.</p>
              <p>I was bullied by my bro and her since young, often get beatings
              for no apparent reason. I tried to kill myself when i was primary 4
              as life is very tough for me for everyday i will get beatings and
              my head banged against the wall. My mum works overseas during that
              time and my dad often not at home. I was afraid of them that time
              as they would threaten me with horrible things. I sank into
              depression and eventually everything came alight when I couldn't
              bear the stress anymore. I went for counselling. But i have
              communication problem, i was extremely quiet and was quite
              autistic. However when in front of my friends, I am no diff from
              any other kids. So,  after some time i was freed from these
              physical torturmentation.</p>
              <p>However, the mental tormentation still stayed. When her baby
              come into this world, I was not spared. I need to rush home
              everyday and help out. Until secondary school, i took care of her
              kids. As i am a fat person, i often get insults from her whenever
              she feels that i am not doing a good job. i was stupid that time. i
              had zero appreciation from her.</p>
              <p>Last year, during her divorcing she moved her whole family into
              our flat. But she herself stayed on in her own flat. she gave
              excuses like she needs a person to watch over her family. But i was
              having my O level examination, so my after discussion she n my mum
              decided to get a maid. But it turned out it was a bad choice becoz
              the maid was lazy and even threaten to jump off building when i
              scolded her. She caused alot of wounds n bruises on my niece and i
              flared up. But instead, i got scoldings from my sis. She blamed me
              for everything, all her misery, i was part of it. and her true
              thoughts abt me came off shooting from her mouth.</p>
              <p>She lashed at me saying: Not only you looked like a pig but you
              act like one too. And she carry on commenting abt my looks and my
              life, saying i have no life and little friends. And she would like
              to see how i can survive when i am out in the society. i was
              insulted n ridiculed. My mum was present that day, but she kept
              quiet. I felt very indignant for myself.</p>
              <p>I had always been low self esteem until recent years where i
              begin to mature and know more abt life. I may be fat and not much
              of a looker, but do i deserve that from my own family?  Many
              times i wanted to question my mum, why? I had no life becoz of
              their ridiculous doings. do i derserve that???  but i know its
              not gonna solve the prob bcoz my elder sis will use her kids as
              trump card to get everything her way.</p>
              <p>I now have to retake my O level exams as private candidate becoz
              i couldn't study well last year. I wasted so much of my youthful
              years to help her out, but in the end i get nothing in return
              except insults and zero appreciation. </p>
              <p>When it comes to kids, old people can do anything for their
              sake. I now decided not to be stupid and further add to my own
              misery. But, my mum was so smart. Knowing it was Vesak day, a day
              where my mood is good. she implemented a task on me, it is to help
              my sis again. I refused, knowing it was never ending and it would
              again affect my studies and personal improvement. I gave her a
              black face. She told me æ²¡æœ‰åŠžæ³•...etc... I didn't speak.</p>
              <p>Why the heck should i help her? there is a limit to helping
              people. anyway its her kids, not mine. How the hell is it my fault
              if she cannot manage her time well and juggle her household? she
              choose this path herself and i see no reason to suffer with
              her.</p>
              <p>I hate people like her, who uses kids as trump cards. (I am not
              against the kids)</p>
              <p>It doesn't mean you are older, you are more matured in your
              thinking. Some people just never grow up. Single parenting is not
              an excuse to be unreasonable. moreover you choose to be one
              yourself. </p>
