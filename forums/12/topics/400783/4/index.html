              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hi all, so this is what is going on.</p>
              <p>I have a elder sis, 8 years older than me. Got married when she
              was 18 yr old with a man 8 years older than herself. so after 7
              years, they divorce due to 3rd party intrude and the man is no good
              himself. My sis gave birth to 2 kids from this marriage. 1 is now a
              primary 2 school kid and one is still 2 yr old going to 3 yr
              old.</p>
              <p>In the past, when i was still younger, from primary 5 onwards, i
              started to help out in looking after her kids. until last year when
              things turned ugly. She had always see herself as someone very
              impt, and there is nothing more impt than her. she likes to ask for
              help from her family and then after helping her out, she will turn
              her back off and return to her normal arrogant self.</p>
              <p>I was bullied by my bro and her since young, often get beatings
              for no apparent reason. I tried to kill myself when i was primary 4
              as life is very tough for me for everyday i will get beatings and
              my head banged against the wall. My mum works overseas during that
              time and my dad often not at home. I was afraid of them that time
              as they would threaten me with horrible things. I sank into
              depression and eventually everything came alight when I couldn't
              bear the stress anymore. I went for counselling. But i have
              communication problem, i was extremely quiet and was quite
              autistic. However when in front of my friends, I am no diff from
              any other kids. So,  after some time i was freed from these
              physical torturmentation.</p>
              <p>However, the mental tormentation still stayed. When her baby
              come into this world, I was not spared. I need to rush home
              everyday and help out. Until secondary school, i took care of her
              kids. As i am a fat person, i often get insults from her whenever
              she feels that i am not doing a good job. i was stupid that time. i
              had zero appreciation from her.</p>
              <p>Last year, during her divorcing she moved her whole family into
              our flat. But she herself stayed on in her own flat. she gave
              excuses like she needs a person to watch over her family. But i was
              having my O level examination, so my after discussion she n my mum
              decided to get a maid. But it turned out it was a bad choice becoz
              the maid was lazy and even threaten to jump off building when i
              scolded her. She caused alot of wounds n bruises on my niece and i
              flared up. But instead, i got scoldings from my sis. She blamed me
              for everything, all her misery, i was part of it. and her true
              thoughts abt me came off shooting from her mouth.</p>
              <p>She lashed at me saying: Not only you looked like a pig but you
              act like one too. And she carry on commenting abt my looks and my
              life, saying i have no life and little friends. And she would like
              to see how i can survive when i am out in the society. i was
              insulted n ridiculed. My mum was present that day, but she kept
              quiet. I felt very indignant for myself.</p>
              <p>I had always been low self esteem until recent years where i
              begin to mature and know more abt life. I may be fat and not much
              of a looker, but do i deserve that from my own family?  Many
              times i wanted to question my mum, why? I had no life becoz of
              their ridiculous doings. do i derserve that???  but i know its
              not gonna solve the prob bcoz my elder sis will use her kids as
              trump card to get everything her way.</p>
              <p>I now have to retake my O level exams as private candidate becoz
              i couldn't study well last year. I wasted so much of my youthful
              years to help her out, but in the end i get nothing in return
              except insults and zero appreciation. </p>
              <p>When it comes to kids, old people can do anything for their
              sake. I now decided not to be stupid and further add to my own
              misery. But, my mum was so smart. Knowing it was Vesak day, a day
              where my mood is good. she implemented a task on me, it is to help
              my sis again. I refused, knowing it was never ending and it would
              again affect my studies and personal improvement. I gave her a
              black face. She told me æ²¡æœ‰åŠžæ³•...etc... I didn't speak.</p>
              <p>Why the heck should i help her? there is a limit to helping
              people. anyway its her kids, not mine. How the hell is it my fault
              if she cannot manage her time well and juggle her household? she
              choose this path herself and i see no reason to suffer with
              her.</p>
              <p>I hate people like her, who uses kids as trump cards. (I am not
              against the kids)</p>
              <p>It doesn't mean you are older, you are more matured in your
              thinking. Some people just never grow up. Single parenting is not
              an excuse to be unreasonable. moreover you choose to be one
              yourself. </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p> </p>
              <p>reading TS's original post, i think yr sis is probably frustrated herself with her life.  being married at 18 years, getting divorce, kids, single parent.  she never really had the chance to "grow up" gradually.  she had to "mature" quickly and step into the shoes of a mother and wife at a young tender age of 18.  how old is she now ?  she's probably still learning to cope ?? </p>
              <p>nevertheless it's not right for her and yr mum to impose their misery onto you.  you also should not let them affect your well-being and yr chances of succeeding in life, although i understand it is difficult not to be affected when you live together. </p>
              <p>the way to help them is to do well yourself.  get out of the karmic trap of your family instead of being sucked into the collective karma of the family.  family members, if they are not so wise, will drag other family members down with them when they are entrenched in their own problems.  at the end of the day, the boat sink together and no one is any better. this could be resistance that you are facing as you desire a better life
               for yourself. </p>
              <p>so keep a cool head.  help when you can.  look at yr sis with compassionate eyes (to reduce the feeling of resentment and anger towards her).  meantime, keep working on doing well yourself  :)  remember you can bring greater benefit when you are a success and doing well.</p>

              <p>reply to TS: just do what you want to do and what you supposed to do at the moment... for yr sister, it is her own life... if people can say oh at that time she is married at 18 blah blah, i do not understand why people cannot understand how you feel at your age that time... it must be confusing and frustrating at the same time...</p>
              <p>you are the only one who really know what should be done as all of us are not in your situation at all... we cannot imagine or understand fully no matter how similiar our situation might be... so just do well in your O level... Jia you!</p>

              <p>I like this part about you, it shows that you have matured.</p>
              <p>Your sis should take care of the children herself, she should be the one that should bear the responsibility.</p>
              <p>You have your future to take care of, it being selfish, but it is something you owe to  yourself. Don't forget your sis and your mum are also being selfish of themselves and expect you to make the sacrifices.</p>
              <p>You cannot blow  your future away. They will not rescue you if you do. If you are not working now, you are dependent on you mum. Its tough, you are between the devil and the dark blue sea. This situation cannot persist for long, you have to be independent, and in Singapore that is getting your 'O' levels which is the minimum for starting out on a decent paying job.</p>
              <p>Your challenge is studying for your self improvement against their needs which is hampering your study.</p>
              <p>At 18, you can escape by getting a job that will take you out of the house and be somewhat independedt, and pursue your studies.</p>

              <p>Truth itself in this case holds zero value. Something of value might be your mum's name in that flat, or even a IOU reciept of that guy lending money. In this case even if you sue, chances are you will lose.</p>

              <p>Truth itself in this case holds zero value. Something of value
                  might be your mum's name in that flat, or even a IOU reciept of
                  that guy lending money. In this case even if you sue, chances are
                  you will lose.</p>
              <p>But whats over is over, treat is as a lesson learnt.</p>
              <p>lastly, trolls do exist like i said on the first page, but good
                  advices exist as well. Judge for yourself.</p>
