              <p>hellooo</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>im looking for a job. and i went online. and applied for the available positions. i didnt know it was through an employment agency. so when the agents called me up, i panicked. because i realised that i applied for multiple jobs. which is normal right? just in case i dont get the job, i have others to fall back on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>each agent sounded very sure that i would get the job, which i wasnt so confident about. is it polite to reject the rest after i go for the interviews and get the jobs? is it ok to apply for other jobs while i have a pending interview? i dont know all these stuff because this is my first time going out to work. and my parents are overseas. i feel really alone</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>im really scared because i have an interview later. ive never done this before. and im just afraid that ill make a fool out of myself and ruin what little reputation and dignity i have. i think this should be normal when we step out into the working world, no? like going for interviews and stuff. its my first time! arghhhh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i dont want to let the agency think that im making a fool out of myself, or think that im just an ignorant fool who doesnt know protocol. :( haiiiii. i finally know what its like to be out there in the world, not shielded or guided by the education system, like in school. im really on my own now!</p>

              <p>Even every step that u fall is a learning experience. Just relax...breathe normally. Don't ans every question with quick haste. It's ok to take 2-3 secs thinking first before u ans. Always be cool, collected and unrattled.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck. It's nt the end of the world if this one fails. It's a just an enhancement of your experience to handle the next one better. Cheers and gd luck.</p>

              <p>Ai yo... never work part time before in your life ah? Interview is nothing. Even if they offer to employ you, you can still reject. If you like the job and work in it, just reject the rest lor.</p>
              <p>But bear in mind, if you got employed through an agency, you would need to fulfill a certain period of employment so as to allow the agency earn from your employment. Termination before that, you would need to compensate the agency. Thus, I do not like to get jobs through agencies.</p>

              <p>best is to wait for them to call u up for interview (unless is those temp part time retail shops as sales)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>since the companies can have the option to choose which candidate they prefer, then, why can't the candidates (us) choose which employer we want to work for? =)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>go for a few more interviews &amp; see which company offers you the best salary &amp; remuneration package (+ of course which job scope you are interested in)..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>good luck for the interview ^^ &amp; remember your dress attire..</p>

              <p><br>Buy Straits Times, look in recruitment section of classified and you would find a variety of openings.</p>
              <p>Anyway if you get employed through an agency, the coy pay X to your agency while the agency pay you only Z... Thus X-Z is their commission.</p>

But the most impt point is this, an interview is not to scare u. Its conducted to see if you are suited for the job. that's all. Even if you cant answer, there is always the next interview to look forward to. Take a deep breath before u enter... Have confidence k!!!</div>

              <p>Your parents divorced already and can still go overseas together? How nice! Such friendliness attitude towards each other. Oh wait! Maybe your father divorced your stepmum who was a PRC woman and now your dad and mum patched up and remarried? Lucky you! Then you shouldn't be working since your dad so rich can drive Merc<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>u did the right thing to apply for multiple positions. job interview is one thing. getting the job is another thing.</p>
              <p>you can attend hundreds of interviews and still not get a job.</p>
              <p>and fyi, don't get your hopes high up. even though those job agents sounds very confident of their ability to get you a job, you must understand that there are many more out there like you waiting to get a job. in the end, you may not get a job you want.</p>
              <p>so unless you really did get a job, don't stop applying for interviews.</p>
