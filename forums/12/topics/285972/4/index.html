            <div class='col-md body'>You can't sign this silly agreement, because you may not be the only one to have access to her hp during that time period when her hp was supposedly lost. The taxi driver has had access to it as well. Maybe his family, passengers; etc.<br><br>If you sign it, and her SMSes are somehow leaked out, she can have you thrown into jail. In kangaroo courts, an accused is "deemed guilty until proven innocent", especially when there are circumstantial evidence pointing to your guilt.<br><br>Also, it's very possible that other people could have had access to her hp prior to it being misplaced. So if they revealed any of her info to others, then you'll be the only one implicated, as you've already signed the contract and are the only one to have done so.<br><br>Tell your "friend" that you will not sign her agreement due to various loopholes. If she continues harassing you, file a complaint at your neighbourhood police post, and visit a psychiatrist asap. Complain of duress and anxiety and get a memo from your doctor. Keep it with you. Fight her in court.</div>
