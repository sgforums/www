            <div class='col-md body'>Actually if you look at information and leave it as it is, you are not stealing it. Even if you remember every bit of it.<br><br>You can steal a piece of paper, but not the information on it.<br>Therefore if you look at a piece of paper, remember the info on it, and return the paper. You cannot be charged for theft of information. For the info is returned together with the paper.<br><br>Same goes for the handphone.<br><br>The handphone can be classified as a electronic storage device, i.e. a computer. But the law is concerned about the misuse of the computer. So if you use you MP3 for illegal purposes, you can still be charged for misuse of the computer.<br>But the handphone will be viewed like a paper diary, i.e. the item found, contents look at, the item returned.<br>Therefore no theft.<br><br>What about legal restrains?<br>Firstly what legal relationship do you have with the girl?<br>You do not have a employer/employee relationship for her to impose on you.<br>You also do not have a contractual relationship. There is no contract between the both of you. You did not give her any assurances.<br>What you have is a social contract, which is not legally binding.<br>She have nothing on you. Just her accusations, and possibilities.<br>So don't sign anything. Also henceforth don't admit to anything, or even apologise.<br>As for the use of her handphone by you, put it as the ordinary cause of events pertaining the recovery of the handphone, and don't say much.<br>Don't be frightened by her.<br>If anything, it is she who should apply to the courts for a restraining order on you. Which I think will make the judge angry, at the lawyer.<br>You need not do anything.</div>

To some, it could mean a skirt being pulled up on the sly and being peeped at.<br><br>As a bystander, I find it extremely difficult to fault the girl as you were the one who pulled the trigger in the first place.<br><br>You peeped at her sms-es and scrolled through her contacts directory.
