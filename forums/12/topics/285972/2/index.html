            <div class='col-md body'>u may ve been wrong in invading her privacy but on what grounds does she have to make u sign tt piece of crap? so that she can threaten u to do shit if she get into trouble!<br><br>think about this in another way. frens ard the world always take their fren's handphone and see see or play pranks rite? is that called invading of privacy then frens have to sue each other to death meh? i doubt she has a case. she will only tarnish her own reputation or shes trying to say that she is going to be a tie mian wu si lawyer next time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First thing, do not sign the thing or admit anything when any one is around. if thats the way she wants it. note that if you sign it, it will be admission of guilt, and she has not said or in any way guranteed she won't.<br><br>btw this type of friend better you get rid of her; small things want pple to sign legal agreement and threaten to go to court.</div>
