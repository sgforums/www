            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously.. how the hell this kind of small matter can get urself fuked.<br><br>Because u invaded her 'privacy' by obtaining 'private' informations between A and B , and you went to converse with B using the information u obtained 'illegally' from A.<br><br>N A is fuked up , imagine this kind of thing and she wants to have u admit ur misdeed , and maybe in the future use it to screw you real bad. Example , signing the paper to have to no divulge anything inside. I dont know if u got see ALL her messages or not , for her to go to that extreme maybe she got some little secrets she dont want u to spread it out. N if its out .. u sign it.. u are fuked.<br><br>Well , she can try to bring your case to the civil court n thats all she can do.<br><br>Trust me , i doubt she can do much. Because she has alraedy agreed for you to obtain the cellphone on her behalf , u may act out of good will and all that , but the only issue will be that u invade her privacy. And in the court of law , there are many ways around it. Especially over such a trivial matter. Wasting the courts time , if she fails to charge you , i think there is a way u can get her back for wasting your time and money for this bullsh|t.<br><br>I cant imagine what kind of woman she is gonna turn out to be.  She is gonna be one mean b|tch in the future... but not a very smart one.</div>
