After awhile, she managed to get hold of the taxi operator, while I sent an sms to her hp, "Anyone who found this phone, please call ".<br><br>The taxi operator called up the taxi, and the taxi driver picked up the phone. I was calling her handphone at that time, so he picked it up and i thanked the taxi driver, and promptly asked how should i arrange to meet him.<br><br>He told me that he was currently at changi airport, so I told him, he could send the handphone over to my friend who lived at pasir ris, which was nearer la than coming over to my place in the north.<br><br>But the taxi driver said that he wanted to pick up a passenger first, he'll call me when he dropped off the passenger.<br><br>So I told A that like that might as well, if the taxi driver was nearer to her, pass to her, nearer to me, pass to me and I'll pass it to her tomorrow. I thought it would help save her money. She agreed and thanked me. I even made a post in the taxi forum in sgforum after that asking for help<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=284755" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=284755</a><br><br>then after awhile, around 12:15am, the taxi driver called me, and said he was at orchard, which was nearer to my place than pasir ris, so i arranged to meet the taxi driver outside my place and he arrived at 12:30am and charged me $20 for petrol fees.<br><br>so i was feeling really good about myself la, then i got cheeky, and i called A's backup handphone with her hand phone, just to hint to her that her handphone recovered already. She was elated.<br><br>So upon reaching home, her handphone went flat, so I thought it would be nice if i charge for her, so went to my neighbour's place to borrow charger for her handphone model.<br><br>and i saw my sms, so went to delete it, no need liao mah. So I saw she got like hundreds of smses, and was quite wowed about it, so scrolled around, and i saw my friend's ( B ) sms. I was still feeling playful, then decided to give B a call with the handphone and confuse her.<br><br>B picked up and was confused, but finally guessed it was me la, then I felt bad and told B to call my handphone la, then chat there, don't use A's handphone, after her bill expensive.<br><br>Then cause I opened B's sms and in the sms, she said she kept puking recently, so we talked about that lor on my handphone.<br><br>And I returned the handphone to A the next day. On that day, her handphone rang twice in my class, once was a guy calling, and once was her mum calling. I picked it up la, thought maybe important, can take a message for her and sms her if important. Her mum was just checking if her handphone has been recovered, and the guy who called her said its ok, not important.<br><br>Then I travelled all the way from Clementi to City hall, just to pass the handphone to her before going back home, when I could take direct bus home from Clementi.<br><br>And then the day after, A called me after class, and fu<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>cked me for picking up her phone, for calling B, and for reading her sms. She said I invaded her privacy and raised hell at me. So of course I apologised about it. And I thought it was the end of the matter.<br><br>The next day, she called me up again, and said she was still feeling pissed, and she wants to protect herself, and want me to sign a contract stating my misdeed, she quoted some computer misuse act law and said I broke it (she's a law graduate from TP), and if i divulge any information, she will take criminal action against me. If I don't sign the contract, she will go to the police, or magistrate court and I will have everything to lose. She won't even need to pay a single cent for lawyer fees etc.<br><br>I was very angry la, firstly I don't know what information she talking about, and secondly, she just attacked someone who helped her. And not just helped, took alot of trouble and went out of his way to help.<br><br>So how?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>My friends adviced me not to sign it, its stupid and I should ignore the ingrate.</div></blockquote>Don't worry about it. If she has a case against you, she wouldn't need you to sign anything to state that you did something wrong. Ignore her and that's it.<br><br>If she harasses or threatens you further in any way, you lodge a police report. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
