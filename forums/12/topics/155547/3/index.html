            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;">The following is an email that was written by <strong>Azrael</strong>.<br><br>In a way, it shows why some B guys actually get fedup so much so that they stop being nice guys.</span><br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>Death of a Nice Guy<br>By: Azrael<br>Women are always saying how they want a nice guyÂ…someone who will open up to them, spend time with them, do nice things for them, in general, be there for them.<br><br>Bullshit.<br><br>Next time I hear that from a woman, I will say exactly that. Bullshit. Because you don't want the nice guys. Sure, you can say you do all you want, and maybe you can trick yourself into believing it too. But the truth is - you want the jerks. You want the guys who show an interest in you, then back off for no apparent reason. You want the guys who don't call you for two weeks, and when they do they swear up and down they're committed to you. You want the ones who don't talk to you, don't open up at all (and you want to change them to boot!) If you do find a nice guy, you make sure he's unattainable. He has a girlfriend, or he's gay, or he doesn't want a relationship at all. Basically, you want what you can't have.<br><br>You know how I know this? I used to be a nice guy. Yeah, I'm the one you always come running to when the jerks screw you over. I listen to your problems, I offer advice. Like all nice guys before me, and the countless ones after, I'm always there to back you up. I tell you how pretty you are. I tell you how fun it is to spend time with you, how cool you are, how you deserve great things. You say thanks, briefly, and then continue to rant about Jerk #2873.<br><br>I tell you over and over that you deserve a better guy, and there's always that "butÂ…". Then you call me up at 1 in the morning some night just to tell me how he finally called you after two weeks, and how happy it's made you. You make excuses for why he's been ignoring you. You make more plans to change him. "If." And, do you know what the worst part is? This is the guy you're attracted to. This is the guy you're willing to get physical with. This is the guy you're willing to lose your virginity to. You make a big deal about how you're not a slut, and you won't just kiss any guy. But you admit that you would go all the way with this guy. Or you want to. Or, you already have.<br><br>No, you don't want a nice guy. And don't give me that bullshit about "a good man is hard to find." There are millions of them out there. Probably hundreds around where you live. And I'm willing to bet you know a few. You know that guy you call at any hour at night to talk about your relationship triumphs/problems? The one who always compliments you, makes you feel better about yourself? Is always willing to drop whatever he's doing to satisfy your needs?<br><br>What about him? No, of course not him. He's not enough of a jerk for you.<br><br>And the worst part? You don't want him nowÂ…but you will. When you get older, oh, say 30, and the ticking of your biological clock gets louder and louder, and you realize you can't play these bullshit games anymore, you stop going for the jerks and find the closest nice guy you can find. Wait, I take that back, the absolute worst part is that we let you do it. We've been starved for your attention since puberty, and now we're all too happy to get it. We're nice guys too, so we accept you when you come around, instead of giving you the cold shoulder in return you've been giving us for 15 years.<br><br>I used to be a nice guy. Fuck that. I took the phone calls, I dished out the compliments, I listened, I gave so much advice, shit, I should have a doctorate in psychology conferred to me right this instant. I used to be a nice guy, and I figured that I didn't need to actively look for a girl - that if I just got to know people, some girl would get to know me and really like me and develop an interest in me. I thought that I would make for an ideal partner, I'd open up with you, and be there as much or as little as you wanted me to.<br><br>I used to be a nice guy. What did that get me? 21 years of my right hand and softcore porn on Showtime. So, fuck it. Fuck it entirely. I'm not going to try to meet women and get to know them, and to hell with the phone calls at one in the morning. Next time you start bitching to me over the fact that he hasn't called in a week, I'm just going to smile at you and say "Ok." In fact, maybe, I'll tell you to call him. Better yet, go over to his house, and drop your pants for him right this moment. Save us all some time. I feel the desire to be that good, dependable, caring friend slipping rapidly away.<br><br>And I like that.<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Do you know why some nice guys become bad??? No, they were not acting... its just that everyone take advantage of them, no one appreciates them, like I said in an earlier post, some people feel that they are <strong>MEANT TO BE USED</strong>, so these nice guys finally <strong>WAKE UP TO REALITY</strong> and the next moment, others label them as fakes, liers, actors... <strong>This </strong> is the sad reality</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by parn:</div><div class="quote_body">I'm correct cos even the most genuine Guy B will eventually side-tracked from their Guy B personality because they tries too hard to maintain their perfectness. And when guys became too agreeable with everything, they unconsciously became a wimp and loses the strong side of their personality - their ability to lead in the relationship...and it becomes boring for girls cos they don't need 'servants'.<br><br>Since the gal already know that Guy A is a flirt, then she'll be prepared for the breakups/dumping situation. On top of that, she could enjoy the romance that's in store for her if she chooses Guy A and there's a chance that Guy A will turn out to be Guy B if she's really the correct gal for him. And hence, no such emotional pain as what you've prescribed.<br><br>Guy B is static as according to glossy_matte mentioned that her bf tries hard to keep things going and she felt that the relationship is boring. If her bf is doing something but nothing have changed, that's as static as it can get...as far as I've observed.<br><br>I've given her some things to ponder upon from a girl's point of view. Have you tried being fair for once and look upon this matter from a girl's point of view? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If you're unable to do so, then you're not impartial enough to help anyone.<br></div></blockquote>Okay this is just my 2 cents. No offense intended.<br><br>Like I said earlier, you cannot speak for all the Guy Bs out there. Some Guy Bs are genuinely Guy Bs. They are not acting what so ever.<br><br>Some Guy Bs like to act all jerk like or wayang the "bad boy" image. But thats not Guy A. Guy A ,as we have already seen from the poster, sees women as a challenge, will stoop to get anything he wants and is a flirt etc.<br><br>And theres a very high chance that Guy A will really be Guy A all the way. Whats stopping him from going after a more beautiful, sexier girlfriend once hes bored of glossy_matte.<br><br>The key point here is this: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How can you be absolutely sure that Guy B is the only one at fault?</span><br><br>As many of the forumites here, both gals and guys here have earlier pointed out there is something amiss since she is now in a relationship with Guy B. Are you encouraging her to look for someone else while in another relationship?<br><br>After she got Guy A, what happens if she notice someone even better? Do you think that magical spark of infatuation will last forever? There will come a point when the relationship will start dulling out. Thats not an opinion, thats an observation of the majority of relationships.<br><br>When will it ever end if she keeps changing bfs once she finds someone better?<br><br>Like what a lot the forumites here have stated: A possible underlying reason is shes dumping Guy B right now simply because she found someone better. Guy B being boring, dull etc etc might just be an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">excuse</span>.<br><br>Anyway the long post I have written is just another way of looking at this. I do understand your point however.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u have my deepest condolences...<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Crappyz:<br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">The following is an email that was written by [b]Azrael</span></strong>.<br><br>In a way, it shows why some B guys actually get fedup so much so that they stop being nice guys.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>Death of a Nice Guy<br>By: Azrael<br>Women are always saying how they want a nice guyÂ…someone who will open up to them, spend time with them, do nice things for them, in general, be there for them.<br><br>Bullshit.<br><br>Next time I hear that from a woman, I will say exactly that. Bullshit. Because you don't want the nice guys. Sure, you can say you do all you want, and maybe you can trick yourself into believing it too. But the truth is - you want the jerks. You want the guys who show an interest in you, then back off for no apparent reason. You want the guys who don't call you for two weeks, and when they do they swear up and down they're committed to you. You want the ones who don't talk to you, don't open up at all (and you want to change them to boot!) If you do find a nice guy, you make sure he's unattainable. He has a girlfriend, or he's gay, or he doesn't want a relationship at all. Basically, you want what you can't have.<br><br>You know how I know this? I used to be a nice guy. Yeah, I'm the one you always come running to when the jerks screw you over. I listen to your problems, I offer advice. Like all nice guys before me, and the countless ones after, I'm always there to back you up. I tell you how pretty you are. I tell you how fun it is to spend time with you, how cool you are, how you deserve great things. You say thanks, briefly, and then continue to rant about Jerk #2873.<br><br>I tell you over and over that you deserve a better guy, and there's always that "butÂ…". Then you call me up at 1 in the morning some night just to tell me how he finally called you after two weeks, and how happy it's made you. You make excuses for why he's been ignoring you. You make more plans to change him. "If." And, do you know what the worst part is? This is the guy you're attracted to. This is the guy you're willing to get physical with. This is the guy you're willing to lose your virginity to. You make a big deal about how you're not a slut, and you won't just kiss any guy. But you admit that you would go all the way with this guy. Or you want to. Or, you already have.<br><br>No, you don't want a nice guy. And don't give me that bullshit about "a good man is hard to find." There are millions of them out there. Probably hundreds around where you live. And I'm willing to bet you know a few. You know that guy you call at any hour at night to talk about your relationship triumphs/problems? The one who always compliments you, makes you feel better about yourself? Is always willing to drop whatever he's doing to satisfy your needs?<br><br>What about him? No, of course not him. He's not enough of a jerk for you.<br><br>And the worst part? You don't want him nowÂ…but you will. When you get older, oh, say 30, and the ticking of your biological clock gets louder and louder, and you realize you can't play these bullshit games anymore, you stop going for the jerks and find the closest nice guy you can find. Wait, I take that back, the absolute worst part is that we let you do it. We've been starved for your attention since puberty, and now we're all too happy to get it. We're nice guys too, so we accept you when you come around, instead of giving you the cold shoulder in return you've been giving us for 15 years.<br><br>I used to be a nice guy. Fuck that. I took the phone calls, I dished out the compliments, I listened, I gave so much advice, shit, I should have a doctorate in psychology conferred to me right this instant. I used to be a nice guy, and I figured that I didn't need to actively look for a girl - that if I just got to know people, some girl would get to know me and really like me and develop an interest in me. I thought that I would make for an ideal partner, I'd open up with you, and be there as much or as little as you wanted me to.<br><br>I used to be a nice guy. What did that get me? 21 years of my right hand and softcore porn on Showtime. So, fuck it. Fuck it entirely. I'm not going to try to meet women and get to know them, and to hell with the phone calls at one in the morning. Next time you start bitching to me over the fact that he hasn't called in a week, I'm just going to smile at you and say "Ok." In fact, maybe, I'll tell you to call him. Better yet, go over to his house, and drop your pants for him right this moment. Save us all some time. I feel the desire to be that good, dependable, caring friend slipping rapidly away.<br><br>And I like that.<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Do you know why some nice guys become bad??? No, they were not acting... its just that everyone take advantage of them, no one appreciates them, like I said in an earlier post, some people feel that they are <strong>MEANT TO BE USED</strong>, so these nice guys finally <strong>WAKE UP TO REALITY</strong> and the next moment, others label them as fakes, liers, actors... <strong>This </strong> is the sad reality</span>[/b]</blockquote></div>

A is fun or looks fun coz he gotta be FUN, esp when his skills in bed sucks.. such guys normally have premature ejectulations. So for the long run... B is definitely better</div>
