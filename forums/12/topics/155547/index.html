Lots of Guy Bs around, so don't worry. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Always make sure that you're with the guy that will bring you the most happiness and not stuck to one that's as constant as gravity for life imprisonment. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would definitely choose guy B because at least he is sincere and although he can be boring most of the time , at least he is making the effort to make your time enjoyable with him but I don't think he does quite meet up to your standards yet eh?<br><br>Even if being boring may be his strongest flaw ever known to you , you should just accept him for what he really is. The very fact that he (guy B) is a very understandable guy makes him even better. True love is all about acceptance and not all about the "wants" , in your case guy B knowing how to treat a girl nicely etc....<br><br>As for guy A , I don't think he is that worth it. Even if you get into a relationship with guy A , I doubt it will last long because since you say he is rich , obviously he's gonna splurge his money on you. I don't see it as a way to be constantly flaunting one's wealth to attract a girl. You say that he treats a girl very well , yes but does he treat a girl very well WITHOUT MONEY?  So what happens when he falls for another girl? Since he has the money and is known to be a player , I'm pretty sure he can add another girl to his collection eh? You'll only gain temperory satisfaction from guy A. You can choose not to listen to me and dump guy A for guy B but when one day if your relationship with guy A fails , what are you gonna do? Regret that you were a fool to dump guy B for guy A. Seriously speaking , I think guy B is the one who really knows how to treat a girl instead of guy A. You may not see guy B's actions now cause you have fallen for guy A but in long term you will see how much guy B really loves you....<br><br>You can say he buys things for you with is money but can his true love be justified just by his wealth? Can he touch your heart without money?<br><br>I find your post very interesting in a sense it reflects a lot about me. My ex gf dumped me cause she found me boring and come November , I would be facing off with another guy of guy A's calibre in trying to court a friend of mine who is currently having her O levels now....<br><br>It would be interesting to see how this post progress as the replies increase....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>I'm sorry for my harsh attitude but I really hate guys who make use of money all the time to get a girls heart. It's like they are making use of their wealth to their advantage denying "coffeeshop" guys a shot at your heart.<br><br>I suggest if you can't choose between either one or them. Tell both guys to compete for your heart on level playing ground. No splurging of money involved this time....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you started to feel bored after A came into your life, for he could bring excitement in a way B couldn't. So you start to compare B to A, and of cos B will lose out in this aspect, because he might not be as experienced as A, who has been with many girls and also toyed with their feelings many times before.<br><br>I guess if I were you, I would not respond to A's charm because you know his history, so he might repeat it again to you. Better stick to B as he has been trying to salvage the r/s...</div>

B might be boring because he doesnt have as much experience as A, and probably spends much of his time helping others.<br>A might be a more exciting choice but a more dangerous at that<br><br>It takes two to clap, while B might be boring, you could help him to open up by finding what his interests are, you might be able to find the part of him that is passionate, interesting and spontaneous.<br><br>Sounds as though B is a very considerate and caring person, so he might restrain the way he talks in order not to offend or upset others(not joke, make fun of others).

Girls like to think with their heart and forget to use their brain. But when they use their brain they tend to multitask which will create more problem rather then solving it.
