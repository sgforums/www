Not that they're not nice enough, but they're just absolutely clueless about girls and relationships....not to mention the only sex that they have are with their right/left hands. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote><span style="color: darkblue;">Wow!!! I'm surprised... how do you know B guys are blah blah blah... either <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>you</strong></span></span> are one or that is just <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>your</strong> </span></span> own conjecture.

Don't you guys know that there's something called chemistry other than the usual physical attraction???<br></div></blockquote><span style="color: darkblue;">Ok so you are like slapping Glossy_matte over here... its like telling her that she shouldnt have asked such a stupid question... so the question should be "I am in a relationship with Guy B, and I met Guy A. I feel some chemistry when I am with XX so who should I choose?????? then why ask in the first place??? unfortunately for you, life isnt so simple... there's something more than chemistry...<br><br>and dont go about saying Don't you guys know that there's something called chemistry other than the usual physical attraction??? its like a slap to your very own face... there is no connection between physical attraction and B guys...</span><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by parn:</div><div class="quote_body">Glossy_matte is probably regretting now that she've made a wrong choice by being Guy B's girlfriend. The reason is because she's not happy cos she realised that there isn't any chemistry between Guy B and her despite the fact that Guy B tries very hard to make things work but actually doesn't at all.<br></div></blockquote><span style="color: darkblue;">If Glossy_matte did actually say that, then she is trying to justify why she is breaking up with guy B, but I dont think she did... so dont put words into her mouth</span><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by parn:</div><div class="quote_body">Instead of choosing Guy B, why don't you guys advise Glossy_matte to choose neither of them? Don't you all know that she has already complained that Guy B is not what she wants? So get some education and stop pushing the unwanted goody-nice Guy B to Glossy_matte. She've already said that she realised she doesn't love Guy B that much.<br></div></blockquote><span style="color: darkblue;">If she already complained that Guy B is not what she wants, then why ask the question in the first place... so dont put words into her mouth... anyway no one is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>pushing</strong></span></span> UNWANTED GOODY-NICE GUY B to Glossy_matte, she asked for opinions, and we gave it to her... notice we didnt say you <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>MUST</strong></span></span> choose B guy</span><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by parn:</div><div class="quote_body">Hate it when senseless people argued for the sake of argueing and end up destroying the purpose and intentions of the poster. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div></blockquote><span style="color: darkblue;">For once I actually agree with what you say</span> <span style="color: red;">senseless people argue for the sake of arguing </span> <span style="color: darkblue;">its pretty obvious... see below</span><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by parn:</div><div class="quote_body">OMG...this thread is getting from worse to worst.<br><br>Now it's degrading the post with all those nonsense threads. </div></blockquote></div>

It's up to u both to decide.<br><br>Yes u may be still young and hasn't play enuff that's y when u rec' the kind of thrill &amp; excitement from A, u cudn't resist the temptations... to fall for his charms. Alot of things are hard to say, mayb he's toying wif u or he may turn out to be the best for u! We cannot totally perceive a person's personality and characters by his cover; it's unfair.<br><br>Definitely, alot will urge u not to go for A as u might be the one suffering in the end as he's the kind of playboy as u mentioned. Nevertheless, u ve to make up ur own choice and bear the consequences should there be any.<br><br>As for Guy B.. i m sry but from my point of view, i can't help feeling tat there's insufficient room for developing a more steady r/s wif him as u already get SIAN of him cuz u r not the homely kind of girl.<br><br>Watever choice u make, remind urself not to get involve in any intimate acts in order to protect urself.
