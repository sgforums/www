I'm not saying that you can't earn big bucks doing design, I'm just saying the chances are more limited.<br><br>The chances are higher for you to become a consultant for doctors, or to make partner for lawyers or accountants than for you to make it big as a designer and ean big bucks.<br><br>IMHO, the main reason designers don't earn as much is because companies are generally unwilling to take the risk. Design is a rather unquantifiable (revenue matching wise) and subjective. It can make or break the product and ultimately the company. There have been cases whereby companies have gambled and won. Case in point, Apple v Creative. Creative came up with the concept of a HDD-based Mp3 player 1st. Apple just made it look desireable.<br><br>But, money does govern and limit businessess and so every dollar is monitored to maximize it's benefit. It's with those unquantifiables, the indeterminates that companies are a little fearful. R&amp;D, advertising and design fall into that category. Fortunately though, with Apple's success, companies tend to be more receptive to design these days. So there is still hope.</div>

Just like design is not a useless degree.<br><br>I've just finished a degree in Mathematics. I know that Mathematics, by itself, does not appear as flexible to many people than it actually is, and hence, I also took on a Finance major. This is because, although there are a lot of people doing Finance, the Mathematics major helps me stand out in the Finance field.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Likewise, doing design might be your interest, but you should try to do something else that complements your interest in a field with more opportunities, and also helps you to stand out from the crowd.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would say FOLLOW YOUR HEART!<br><br>I didnt say that you should against your father's will but at least make him understand what is really in your heart. Afterall, I believe all parents would want their children to be the happiest people alive on earth.<br><br>My advice is that you could have a detailed plan of how your life is going to be after graduation from designing course. What kind of career would you want to have and do some research about the working life and salary of these careers. Once you're done, find a real good opportunity to sit down with your dad and share with him about dreams. Some parents get agitated very easily so just make sure he hears you out first before he gives his comments. If designing is something you really want to pursue, never give it up. Keep on sharing with your dad, I believe one day he will come to realise that he's proud to have a mature child who can make your own decisions and think about life in the future. It's all about winning the trust of your parents. all the best!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

For example, you can get a part time job while pursuing your dream as a struggling fashion designer, meaning that you earn your own living and not depend on others giving the excuse that you are pursuing your dream.<br><br>Whether you become successful in life depends on how you live your life day to day and while getting the right education can definitely help, ultimately it is how you live your life after graduation that counts.</div>
