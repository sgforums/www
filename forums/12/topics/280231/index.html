            <div class='col-md body'>Trust me, interest over money.<br><br>I'll demonstrate with a real-life example:<br><br>You know Singapore's facing a shortage of lawyers right? Many people are leaving practice, that is, not migrating overseas, but quitting the legal industry in its entirety.<br><br>Alot of Si-Ginnahs take law because it's supposedly a very glam career; they enter law school, and find these huge stack of reading to do - cases, history, legal theory blah blah blah blah blah - from UK/AU even US/EU, and massive amounts of work and research to do - not particularly interesting as well (even to lawyers today). Very few people will actually step forth and say "I like law. I like doing my readings. I like being in this adversarial environment.", while meaning it. The reasons reported in our mass media is that lawyers are underpaid, and overworked. Then again, we know SG's media is never honest.<br><br>Law is one of those units, whereby Singaporeans receive no exposure in their prior education - misconceptions arise from TV/Games (... Pheonix Wright - what a load of bull****) etc. Everytime I hear someone go "law .. wow" I think to myself "mmm, another "ignorant being"".<br><br>Likewise, so is design. What makes you think designers don't earn good money? Don't let archaic thought misguide you. I did law but my sister went on to do design. Her prints have made it into magazines, websites and clothes. Sure the money is not as good, but hey for an under 30 year old girl to be able to live in her own flat, drive a small car - I think that's pretty impressive and I'm damn proud when I see her work outside - I point to my colleagues and go, see that - that's done by my sister. Now she's playing with the idea of doing architecture (which she is going to fund herself). So it's never the end of the road even if you find you're in a course you don't like.<br><br>Mind you, every career has its flaws - for law, you hold yourself out to the chance of being sued by even your own client (professional negligence), and when that happens, you might lose your entire career. Disciplinary cases don't attract the attention of the news, but it's not uncommon for lawyers to lose their licence to practice over the smallest oversight like forgetting to do this etc.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I'm not putting law down; many people I know have rewarding careers, but just as many have left to pursue their interests - I'm just drawing an analogy to your dilema. Do you really want to work 15 years before coming to the realisation "EH SHIT! This is not what I want to do - I hate this" and then start from scratch? Do you really want to be in the position whereby you go back to drawing peanuts?<br><br>If you really want a rewarding career, do medicine. I have yet to meet a single doctor who even dislikes their career. 12 of my friends went on to do medicine; you never hear them complain, or hear stories about how their colleagues complain about their careers - only the long hours; as compared to law - I'm surrounded by people moaning about their jobs and how much they hate it (in Singapore, and now overseas where I'm based).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Two ways to look at it.<br><br>One is to do what your dad wants. He's got a point, he can't provide for you forever. He wants you to be able to fend for yourself or even provide a better life for yourself and for your own kids that he could ever have. After you've made enough money, you are free to pursue your passion.<br><br>Two is to be headstrong and just plough through and prove him wrong. Here, you run the risk that he might take quite a while to warm up to that fact, but at least you can live with yourself, knowing you've done what you always wanted.<br><br>I made my decision partially based on money. My parents were supportive of my passion (medicine), but I didn't get in. I'm in law now, and yes, there is tons of reading to do, and judgments seem to go on forever and the boundaries between laws are so blurred that it's positively confusing.<br><br>But the thing is, while I did choose this course partially for the possibly lucrative career, I'm growing to enjoy it. Not the work, but the mental challenges, like trying to prove murder so that the person doesnt get away with just manslaughter.<br><br>What I'm trying to say is, you may learn to enjoy or even love this new path that wasn't entirely your choice. This path ensures that you can live on to fight another day.</div>

The only area of law that positively guarantees a steady cashflow all fall within, or at least into the shadows of corporate and commercial law. Even then, the pay is not as good as you think it is, in comparison to the amount of work you have to do; again, I'm sure you read the news, the crisis of quitting lawyers .. leaving practice, AND leaving Singapore.<br><br>Also, sounds like you're in your first year only. And also sounds like you probably haven't sat for an exam or done any research assignments.<br><br>Anyway, my blind guesses .. who cares. Enjoy law school, and your career. What you do in law school, pretty much sums up what you'll do for the rest of your life as a lawyer. No matter which practice you enter into, it's research, research, research, reading, reading, reading, and drafting. Whether or not you're looking for past precedents, or statutory amendments, or just general info. pertaining to your client. Enjoy it.<br><br>I'm currently 1 foot out the legal industry, but hell the amount of research I still have to do ... more than as a research assistant when I was still an ugrad. (which then, hinted to me at the grim pay to expect)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
