The only area of law that positively guarantees a steady cashflow all fall within, or at least into the shadows of corporate and commercial law. Even then, the pay is not as good as you think it is, in comparison to the amount of work you have to do; again, I'm sure you read the news, the crisis of quitting lawyers .. leaving practice, AND leaving Singapore.<br><br>Also, sounds like you're in your first year only. And also sounds like you probably haven't sat for an exam or done any research assignments.<br><br></blockquote>I actually have sat for exams and done research assignments and mooting. I agree, the research is hell. Whole weekends up in smoke to find that elusive case analgous to yours with a decision in your favour.<br><br>But yup, I'm still 1st year. And no, I have no aspirations to defend the innocent in a court of law nor to prosecute. Law is to me a way of paying the bills. Hopefully I won't be working as a lawyer, but if I do, I'd probably do M&amp;A or something related with negotiations thrown in. I quite dislike courtrooms and advocacy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> I don't have the flair necessary for the dramatization.<br><br>Anyway, working in Singapore has not been on my list of priorities. I'd like to have the option of working there, but whether I'll exercise it is another matter. Besides, I'm overseas and I do prefer it that way.</div>

I've seen many people who initially chose careers which paid well but not within their interests, only to end up disillusioned and quit after a couple of years to do what they really like.<br><br>On the practical side, if you really like designing, you can compile a portfolio of your work and go around asking for freelance work.

But I would also like to remind you that reality is actually harsher than you think (i.e. even if you get into the design industry and work hard, you might not do as well as if you get into a more 'profitting' job).<br><br>Take for example, one of my GP tutor in JC, who previously worked as a mime artist. It was his interest and he was pretty good at it to the extent that he is able to do coaching. However, his pay was so pathetic, he basically have to live off his savings for a few years.<br><br>And so, when his savings ran out dry, he had no chioce but to change job, thus coming to my JC to teach GP. The pay is a damn lot better, but he don't get to do what he like.<br><br>So keep this in mind...society is not as idealistic as we would like it to be.</div>

More and more companies are starting to realise that design is essential for them to earn big bucks. for eg. Yah Kun rebranded to a more young image and now, they have operations in other parts of the world too.<br>and god knows how much singapore zoo paid Satchi and satchi to do that new logo, but it definately was'nt cheap.<br><br>design does bring in money. it only depends on which design agency you are working in.<br><br>like the tp student said:<br>if u have been doing 11 years of stuff u do not like, would u wanna do another few years studying things u do not like?<br><br>design is not easy, there is no set fomula for a good design, and so this usually means sleepless nights. if your passion dies out halfway through the course, it is as good as wasting the time spent in that course. so think carefully.<br><br>sp design course cut off point is also pretty low.<br>nyp design course just made a killing at the crowbar awards.<br>school of the arts should go into operation pretty soon<br>la salle, and raffles design institute<br>and of course tp are some other choices 4 u to choose from</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I see some of you that like Law eh.<br><br>I have interests for law even before i finished secondary. But my dad told me to do engineering. Which i had 0 interest and my physics sucked. studying something u are not good at is hard.. its freaking hard. Try and party and study la.. is fuking tiam. in the end after 3 years also finish. After got cheated back , work not happy.. still feel that not enough knowledge to cope with the job scope and the speciality of some engineering works , so i took up part time dip. engineering. After obtaining it , i just cannot take it. I really decided that thats it.. i have followed through my dad's plan. Now i will follow my own plan , which may be a bit late..  but at least my mum and family of lawyers support me!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>So hopefully i will be able to take it up after all these years. I want to take it cause i am interested , and it is to me , essential for my master plan. Do i regret my other stuffs ? Not really , at least i gained significant knowledge. But i will regret for not trying to do what i wanted to do.<br><br>So to T.S i guess u dont want to waste time and money , you just go for something u are good at and very interested. Maybe they cannot see what u see because they do not fully understand . My dad also wanted my older bro to do engineering, he did Sound Engineering..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> and then left to pursue his dream. Dad cant say anything , he did do 'engineering' but now is a producer in the music industry in HK &amp; Taiwan. hahaha!! But because he is so good at it , dad also now just let him be.<br><br>Money or not , if u are good at what u do .. u WILL earn money. Its how u use your interests to your advantage.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  and earn BIG money.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i once read somewhere that a person has three oppurtunities in life. and as i grew up, i've always come up with the answer that it's not just waiting for the oppurtunity to come by, but also having the money to take advantage of that oppurtunity. if i were you, i'd pursue something that blends a mix of both in. for example, you can take the arts course, but also learn how to startup a business using management courses.</div>

I always aspire to become a graphic designer so it's natural for me to develop interest in designing.<br><br>So after my O lvl ended, I wanted to enroll in design courses but my parents discouraged me from pursuing my dream as they see it as a path which doesn't bring much success and a lot of money in the future.<br><br>It may be true that designers (I'm talking about the mediocre ones in sg) don't make as much money as accountants or other professions. but ask yourself, are you going to be happy if you follow what your parents want you to do?<br><br>I was stupid not to follow my dreams, just to please my parents. In the end, I was enrolled in IT courses and I only did ok and no matter how hard I studied, my grades are always average (because I have little interest in IT to begin with). Well, I'm starting to look on the bright side of studying IT but somehow, I wonder what would it be like if I take a different path. I knew that if I were to enrolled in design, I would be much more successful (without trying too hard).<br><br></div></blockquote>wow, that sounds like me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">   except that my parents didnt really care what i do, i guess. I didnt manage to enter the design course tho due to my results. And at that time didnt consider NAFA or sth.<br><br>Then i listened to some f.uck instead who claim that this course is so awesome or sth and then i got enrolled into the course, that i've no interest in. I was stupid at that time i think.<br><br>I wasted 3 years of my life, doin s.hit that i dislike, a hell lot (im not exactly free now actually  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> , surfin and all, i've to clear off stuffs that i dislike to do, but gotta do it)<br><br>Waste time, waste $, my BIGGEST regret in life. But what. This hell is gonna be over soon.<br><br>Also, i didnt really perform well in the course, i didnt put in effort in it (dont bother) and just aim for a better pass thats it. Sort of self-destruction.<br>Met some f.uckers, who think they are really good and give you all sort of s.hits. So i told myself, if i were in another course (that i liked), im sure i will pwn them hard, that is if they are there  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> hmm i mean im sure i could do much better i guess<br><br>Im gonna graduate soon, waitin eagerly, tho i've to clear off some s.hit first.<br>Then i will start my life afresh! Currently on the lookout of school. Raffles Design i guess, more likely, but the fees are expensive i guess i gonna work for some time.<br><br><strong>pokkagreentea: </strong> Uhmmmm are you sayin your goin to stay in the IT line?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><strong>mrcoconut: </strong> Think carefully.... okay? Im really unhappy because i've wasted time and $ and in the end gonna restart everything again. It's a painful choice but somehow i gotta accept it.
