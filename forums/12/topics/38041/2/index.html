If you wait till your arteries are about to burst then you're willing to take actions, you'll just have to face the 'music'.....<br><br>Loving her does not mean giving in to all her unreasonable demands...

Very pissed with her so i went to sleep. telling myself "bloody hell. everything also u want.watch play etc. then u ask em to go n sleep.$$%$@#" i shouted at her and went off to sleep.<br>after about 1 1/2 hours she came to my room and ask me to go play my game etc. of course i ticked her off and so piss with her so didnt talk. she kept talking but i ignore her.she say that all the while i let her do both but now why sudden change? i then told her that at my house only can play com n watch tv. both also she want to do at same time. so unreasonable! then she got angry n want to go home. sent her home and got back.<br>when i got back she sms me saying never will she touch my com again. i replied that its up to her. none of my business.<br><br>my question is " am i at fault? " i find that i tend to give in most of the time. (in my opinion). feel that she always take me for granted. yes she does do alot of things for me as well but i find that i m being taken for granted. so am i at fault? neutral views please..thanks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>Dear yahoo.com<br><br>Your situations is a small thing, yet somehow it isn't that small. Mundane because its only a TV and a Computer affair - does it really require a blow of temper? However, the not-so-small issue is not regarding the surface - its regarding the way you people are treat each other and all relating characteristic of your doing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I will definitely speak if my gf were to say something like 'all the while i let her do both but now why sudden change?' - To love someone is to her have the best - HOWEVER it time to realise that your pleasure is at my expense. So if she blurted out that statement - guess she is not very appreciative eh? It has absolutely nothing to with her computer, TV, etc - its got to do with *that* statement by itself which holds alot of meaning to her character <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>(Just for fun, she a Taurus, Virgo or a Capricorn? - accuracy not guaranteed  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> )<br><br>Regardless of what - you feel that your honeymoon is over and its time to accept each other short coming. The real thing is to achieve like a gentleman and lady YET trying to improve one another. Communication holds the key to this.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Since you people have problem when she is at home - to minimize such tendancy to quarrel over real small matter. One good solution apart from compromising and talking things out is that - Don't go your house. Shop around, do something else then send her home. A good date for both to be happy with and reducing conflicts over a computer and TV - that's will be a better alternative in the long run.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
