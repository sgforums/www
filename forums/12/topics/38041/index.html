            <div class='col-md body'>my gf always comes over to my house. i always watch soccer but when she is around, i try not to watch. even when i m watching, if she wants to watch another channel(which is always the case) i let her watch. she also is a solitaire freak and it so happens that my com is just beside the tv. most of the time i let her play her game n watch tv but today i refused to let her play and watch. todl her to choose just one. she told em to go sleep and gave me the kinda "i wanna play n watch" look. Very pissed with her so i went to sleep. telling myself "bloody hell. everything also u want.watch play etc. then u ask em to go n sleep.$$%$@#" i shouted at her and went off to sleep.<br>after about 1 1/2 hours she came to my room and ask me to go play my game etc. of course i ticked her off and so piss with her so didnt talk. she kept talking but i ignore her.she say that all the while i let her do both but now why sudden change? i then told her that at my house only can play com n watch tv. both also she want to do at same time. so unreasonable! then she got angry n want to go home. sent her home and got back.<br>when i got back she sms me saying never will she touch my com again. i replied that its up to her. none of my business.<br><br>my question is " am i at fault? " i find that i tend to give in most of the time. (in my opinion). feel that she always take me for granted. yes she does do alot of things for me as well but i find that i m being taken for granted. so am i at fault? neutral views please..thanks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

There is always a "give &amp; take" situation. U can try dis, "She can play com + watch tv, but then she have to treat U to snacks lah..." or "she can play &amp; watch, but next dae she can only play while U watch &amp; vice versa..."<br><br>Or have U ever tried to L00K at her playin com while watching TV? There maybe some funny or memoriable things abt her? Her behaviour at dat time, da wae she shift her eyes btwn Tv &amp; com, etc, etc...<br><br>Who noes? maybe U like it when she does dat, even if U cannot get to watch TV...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
