The most important thing is to be yourself. As long as ya are happy, who cares about those stuff. Just don't allow the socialty to effect ya. I have been through those problems too, but I realise that all that isn't important at all. Its just something to show off. Whats really valuable is the beauty within ya.

He may not be that good - but he must have this wanting to improve and become better. Nobody is rich without hardwork (or at least tons of luck), good looks? Too bad, he doesn't have the life. Tall? short? etc, etc - this is for him:<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Welcome to the real world.</span></strong><br><br>Why only got like one person and others like alot and the why others got so many gf, but he cannot - I think he is in <strong>serious</strong> need of attention and ego booster. I think its kinda choice that people has to make when you are discover what love is - Your cosmic lessons.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>With such definition in his life - I feel that its quite common to have conflicts and problems in your relationship isn't it?<br><br>Why do I say that?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Love isn't about doing the same thing though - its about looking at the same direction. Your boyfriend desire to have many gf or like several people, then tell him right into his face: <strong>GO HAVE LAR </strong>- why look for you and stick with you? Why? Cannot find somebody else then temporary stick with you first huh? Let me tell you, when someone else better comes along - you bf would have a crisis man.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Your boyfriend wants to play the field, but too bad you doesn't have the captial - <strong>let me issue you a word of warning</strong>: look out for him. I used to think of this before: to play the field or learn the art of being faithful. Used to think that all the 'knowledge' and my CloUdiSm could go well if I do play the field and survive - could have a string of gf, blar blar blar...<br><br>In the end... whats your point in doing that? You are still walking towards the same goal - your cosmic lesson this lifetime. The problem is how many gf/bf do you need in order to realise that one point god wants you to learn? Do you neccessary need 10 girlfriend to realise that?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Its for short term self esteem.<br><br>P.S: Your bf is a Leo ar?
