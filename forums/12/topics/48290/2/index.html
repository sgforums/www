            <div class='col-md body'>hey sweetie, I think your bf is still not mature enough. Frankly speaking, given the age now and say maybe 3-4 years later, (after he completed his NS) he'll change a great deal in his mentality. But of coz when you talk abt changes, you must be prepared for the worst and weigh the pros and cons of the actions.<br><br>Sometimes he wants attention from you, wants you to tell him how great he is, etc etc etc... so that he feels good himself. But how many times can you actually assure him on that when in the first place he's lacking a great deal of self confidence and esteem?<br><br>He asked questions which I felt kinda silly in answering. Pardon me for that. But it's a fact. I suggest you have a talk with him and tell him what you're feeling when he puts you to that. Probably you should move on, not that I'm suggesting that you do anything drastic to this r/s. But seriously speaking, he'll be sure to dump you for another when he meets someone new or better, I don't know.<br><br>Take heart girl.. You're still young... not some old spinster left on the shelf.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
