My friends assume im good with girls, having lots of relationships when i only have one girlfriend in the past. Whenever new year comes alone, and all the aunties ask me if i have a girlfriend, i would say no and they would go dont be shy, dont be so humble. What they do not know is that im actually very lonely inside, ive been spending every christmas with guy friends and its frustrating.  I have trouble finding a girlfriend.  Initially i thought that it was my character, im too confident and arrogant always so full of myself. There was once i chased a girl, and she ended up being with this really ugly guy a total loser. her friends said things like i look like a player, im a playboy, jerk and would play with her feelings.  Im not like that at all. Are girls like that, disqualifying themselves if they think that the guy is too good to be true.</div>

              <p>I'm quite sure you didn't lose out in terms of looks if you self-proclaimed to be good-looking, so you must have lost terribly in terms of your attitude, behaviour, and mentality.</p>
              <p>Arrogant is a terrible character-traits to own, nobody will enjoy the company of an arrogant person.</p>
              <p>Oh yah....one last thing, don't trust the aunties' opinions, they are always encouraging and it's only polite for them to do so. Trust your peers' opinions.</p>

You see sometimes characteristics that maybe appreciated in an all male environment may not be appreciated by girls. So you need to be able to tune yourself to the wavelength of the people you're dealing with. Its not really your fault because I think maybe deep down you're not a bad guy, its just all the emotional baggage and stereotypes that are floating around us in modern society that make good guys have alot of BGR problems. Maybe the girl that ended up with the no good ratbag because the ratbag knows how to press her buttons. I'm not saying be a player, but be more attentive to what the girl wants in a fella. Think of it as saving the girl from her own foolishess LOL!</p></div>

              <p>Sometimes other girls are the culprits also, they tend to like to hangout with not bad-looking guys and make them look like players. The girl you like see already and get jealous= gone liao hahaha...</p>

              <p>Im 20 this year, and i only have one past relationship. My friends assume im good with girls, having lots of relationships when i only have one girlfriend in the past. Whenever new year comes alone, and all the aunties ask me if i have a girlfriend, i would say no and they would go dont be shy, dont be so humble. What they do not know is that im actually very lonely inside, ive been spending every christmas with guy friends and its frustrating. I have trouble finding a girlfriend. Initially i thought that it was my character, im too confident and arrogant always so full of myself. There was once i chased a girl, and she ended up being with this really ugly guy a total loser. her friends said things like i look like a player, im a playboy, jerk and would play with her feelings. Im not like that at all. Are girls like that, disqualifying themselves if they think that the guy is too good to be true.</p>
