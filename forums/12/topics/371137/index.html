              <p>i'm currently studying in local uni. initially i have no interest in studying in uni but this practical society force me to. so i took up bank loans. taking a 4 yrs course, 6K a yr, all in all i've gonna pay 24K++ once i grad, don't forget abt the interests.</p>
              <p>seeing my poly grad friends selling insurance, seems like they are really making it big out there. i'm not sure how much they are earning each month, but i believe they are earning big, with all the hardwork they have put in. 1 of them have bought a car, while another is planning to buy 1 soon.</p>
              <p>i'm wondering, if one can make it big without a degree, just by selling insurance etc, what's the point of studying so hard for a degree? right now they are earning so much and even have the ability to own cars while on the other hand, i'm in huge debts and once i grad i've gonna work extra hard to pay for my debts, give money to my parents etc. no money no honey, when can i get married? 10 years down the road? beats me.</p>
              <p>to be honest, i can't see my future. am i suffering from some kinda depression? or perhaps am i thinking too much? i don't know.</p>

              <p>Avoid comparing yourself with others. Not everyone selling insurance is successful. For each successful person you know, there might be many others that have failed or are barely surviving.</p>
              <p>Taking a degree just gives you more options in future. It doesn't assure you can make it big or not cause that is affected by many other factors and also abit of luck at times.</p>

              <p>Respect is earn not given. What for you want 'respect' in front of you when people are insulting and talking bad about you all the time behind you?</p>
              <p>Who ever said someone who is not rich cannot earn respect and a horrible person who has money can even earn any respect from his peers?</p>
              <p>If people around you chooses to respect only people who have money and suck up to them, disregard those who are less well off then this group of people are not worth spending time with in the first place.</p>

              <p>Note that it only <em>seems</em> that your friends are making it big. For all you know, they may struggling to meet their sales quotas.</p>
              <p>They got car, so what? What if they only got their cars through loans? Which is worse - a loan for your studies, or a loan for their car? At least you can get greater opportunities with your degree. They can only go from point A to point B with their cars.</p>
              <p>What if your friends are envying you right now? Have you ever considered that they may see themselves to be in dead-end jobs, and they in turn envy <em>you</em> for having more doors open to you in the future?</p>

              <p>Bingo. End of story.</p>
              <p>Believe me, a lot of people are in your position as well. I myself had to take $24k worth of loans to pay my way through my four years honours course.</p>
              <p>I saw my loans as a motivation to work hard and to do well, because I knew that if I screwed up, I would get a low-grade degree with low job prospects and $24k worth of debts on top of that.</p>
              <p>So now, go and work hard. If you think you screwed up your first year, then never mind, just work harder and better in the next three years. The new semester starts next week - go and do your best for it.</p>
