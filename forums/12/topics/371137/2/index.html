              <p>yes, i'm comparing myself with others. but everyone is
              doing it right? i mean when we have a choice to make, we compare
              right? i.e if a girl is looking for bf, she will compare those guys
              who are trying to win her heart right? of cus she’ll compare the
              guys based on certain criteria, like education background, looks,
              wealth etc..</p>
              <p>comparison, that's what we always do right?</p>

              <p>If comparisons helps motivate you to strive harder then it is good to compare. However, if comparisons are making you look down on yourself and demotivating, you should avoid comparing yourself with your peers.</p>
              <p>As mentioned by others, you only see the good side of your peers, the negative side and the problems they face might not be something you are able to see.</p>
              <p>So what is some might have cars? Did they really afford the car or did they get loans etc to pay for the car because they need it for their work? Do not take everything as facts base on what you see on the surface as there might be many underlying issues that you do not know of.</p>

              <p>i'm currently studying in local uni. initially i have no
              interest in studying in uni but this practical society force me to.
              so i took up bank loans. taking a 4 yrs course, 6K a yr, all in all
              i've gonna pay 24K++ once i grad, don't forget abt the
              interests.</p>
              <p>seeing my poly grad friends selling insurance, seems like they
              are really making it big out there. i'm not sure how much they are
              earning each month, but i believe they are earning big, with all
              the hardwork they have put in. 1 of them have bought a car, while
              another is planning to buy 1 soon.</p>
              <p>i'm wondering, if one can make it big without a degree, just by
              selling insurance etc, what's the point of studying so hard for a
              degree? right now they are earning so much and even have the
              ability to own cars while on the other hand, i'm in huge debts and
              once i grad i've gonna work extra hard to pay for my debts, give
              money to my parents etc. no money no honey, when can i get married?
              10 years down the road? beats me.</p>
              <p>to be honest, i can't see my future. am i suffering from some
              kinda depression? or perhaps am i thinking too much? i don't
              know.</p>

              <p>and seriously, you're smart enough to be a local undergrad, you should know better than to compare yourselves to the exceptions .... for every degree-less successes you've heard, there are countless others out there toiling their lives away for not very much .... why else do you think there are still so many people fighting for that piece of paper for ? .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>Like I keep saying, the grass is always greener on the other side.</p>
              <p>Those friends of yours with cars may have to take loans to pay for them. And what do they get out of it? Easy transport from point A to B. And they may find it easier to jio more girls at the bar by showing off their brand new cars. That's all.</p>
              <p>At the same time, though, they might be crying over all the instalments, ERP, petrol, road tax, parking, etc that they have to pay.</p>
              <p>What about your study loans? If you work hard enough, you may end up with a 2nd upper honours and a high-paying job. Your high-level salary would take care of your loans.</p>
              <p>So who gets the better deal in the end? You, or your friends?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>For my opinion, you just study hard for that degree, get a good grade. And sure there will be companies wanting to offer you more than what your friends can achieve. And do not compare to the others, as comparing always makes you regret things. Which is something like making yourself more low self-esteem. So i would suggest that you aim to have good grades, apply for scholarship, and soon there will be companies who wants your knowledge in bank loan. =D</p></div>

              <p><br>I feel sad for u friend. Whenever I see such things. It always remind me of a friend who just like u take up a massive loan from bank for U study. He has the same worry as u.</p>
              <p>While I see many China student who need not serve 2yrs NS, come to singapore free of U education. Not only that, they are given every month $800 as pocket money.</p>
              <p>Lagi best is, they are not top of the cream or any 1st class degree student. Just 2nd lower.Their english is worst than some local secondary 2 student. While local student has to go thru tough english oral and exam just to pass the O' lvl english test. On top of that, I saw some local student 2nd upper still need to get bank loan. Family scraped anything just to pay school fee and survive.</p>
              <p>I suddenly wonder what is wrong with this country system??  U are in this state is partly due to our dear goverment.</p>

              <p>actually life is like this 1. You come forum and whine and than you still continue with life after that.</p>

              <p>Like the TS after he had posted this topic, he will go back to school to study again. I am sure he won't quit school or what after this post so life remains the same. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>You better make yourself see your future, because no one is responsible for your future other than you.</p>
              <p>1. What is it that you are good at?</p>
              <p>2. What is it that you like to do?</p>
              <p>3. What do you want to become?</p>
              <p>4. What do you see yourself as in future?</p>
              <p>5. What do you want to get in this life?</p>
              <p>Think about it really serously, fixed it down in writing. Then go get it.</p>
              <p>Too many people get law degrees and then become theatre actors.</p>
              <p>Too many people get banking degrees then become F&amp;B operators.</p>
              <p>There are people who got their  MBBS, and then become poets.</p>
              <p>Go to the uni, for knowledge and an education.  Not for a degree so that you can have better chance of getting a job. </p>
              <p>Think!</p>
