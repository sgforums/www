It's not uncommon that such thoughts might pop up in some of us even in love from time to time (Depending on individuals, their relationship and what they're exposed to?). However, that does not mean that your gf would very well appreciate your FRANKNESS to her... (And very often not many would) Imagine your gf telling you one day that she's interested in another guy but just that she have not taken any action yet and still thinking about it. What would your reaction be?<br><br>Piece of information is piece of information. When you told her that its probably out of guilt and / or honesty, but she probably won't be seeing things the same way?<br><br>Whatever it is, you've just caused a minor(?) crack through your relationship.... Just that what's done cannot be undone. Just make the best use of whatever you've got left.<br><br>My personal advice for now is since you've already made such an HONEST approach. It's only idea that you remain this HONEST and make your relationship as transparent as possible. (which is definitely not an easy thing.) Cause she'll probably be watching you to a certain extent? Whatever that's left if hopefully would not be so much affected and can be salvaged, main issue would be that.<br><br>Good luck?</div>

The first thing you have to know is that being attached doesn't mean forever. The next thing you have to know is that liking someone else while in a relationship is a common scenario. Unless it's karmic or strong magnetic attraction qualities - its nothing actually. Even it could be, in the end, how you handle your situation will determine very much about <strong>HOW you see love and the level of your maturity in matters of the heart</strong>.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You may like the other party - then again, do you think that she is suitable for you? What makes you think that she will like you as well? Even if she does, can you even foresee that you could have a fulfilling relationship with her? How long do you think you can last with her when you MERELY depended and heed your liking emotions. Do you think love relationship can last on just emotions? What do you really seek? Companionship? Soul mate? Or just another teenage-test-out period flings?<br><br>Do you think you could answer all those questions, not to me, but to yourself? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>To your present gf? Is love still present? Do you think you stayed on because of liability (you can't bear to see her cry; relationship went on very long liao, etc) or because you want to be with her? he feelings you have for her... the same intense ones as you felt since the day you knew her?<br><br>P.S: Don't look at others; <strong>look at yourself</strong>. The consequences are rather simple to predict, it's the self-reflection and self-acknowledgment that makes love a difficult process. Will you humble down and be in touch with heart, mind and soul? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The key points have been covered - just a few things:<br><br>1) How long has this attraction been going on?<br><br>2) Why have you and your girlfriend stayed together since 2001?<br><br>3) What stage of life are you at now?  Are you still studying?<br><br>Despite the outcome, it may have been a good thing that you talked to your girlfriend about it.  However, as Devil noted, it needs to be phrased VERY carefully.  She needs to know that you're doing the right thing by being honest about it, and that you're maintaining trust by letting her know exactly what's going on.</div>

Maybe its an in-built mentality in their minds. I have alot of emotions on this issue due to what I had gone thru. No doubt ppl tend to take the other partner for granted as time passes, and no doubt there will always be temptations, one has to always think back on why you were with the girl/guy in the 1st place. What attracted you then? Yes, ppl change. That is a factor. What they like then may not be what they prefer now. Relationships are like a game that the-Big-O-Great guy up above designed and likes to play. Relationships become bland with time and when 2 are accustomed to each other. Like what Imperfect had said, spice up the relationship. Give surprises, celebrate monthly anniversaries, go to places both of you had never and usually would not go to before. Girls nowadays may not be acceptable to egoistic perceptions now with the higher educational levels and wider global views. But some things stay the same and that's why the 2 genders can never have equal rights  - be sensitive to feelings, be a gentleman. That's, of course, the ideal, and being ideal, will be rare.</div>
