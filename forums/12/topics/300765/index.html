Are they willing to wait?<br><br>That way if the current relationship doesn't work out, you have someone to fall back on.<br><br>Also because you have an ex waiting for you, it is proof that you are a good thing and your current bf better treat you well.<br><br>If your current bf backs off, then they didn't care for you anyway, better to learn now then later.<br><br>If current bf works out, you just punished you ex for leaving you.<br><br>You can make them both do silly things to prove they love you more and deserve you. This way you can amuse yourself.<br><br>If your ex got tired of waiting and move on, you avoided breaking your heart twice.<br><br>You get more presents.<br><br>Your gossip will be more exciting.<br><br>Your friends will be envious and think you are super cool.<br><br>This is why some people prefer to have 2 at the same time.

              <p>in reply to one of the earlier mails about the "good horse dont eat returned grass"....let me fill in the reason why:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>becuase when a horse is eating th grass, he is shitting also at the same time. and hence u get the pic that if the horse returned to eat the patch bhind him, what does he get??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so my take is: not meant to be la...let go and move on..</p>
