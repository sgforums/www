From what I have been hearing, women do, I'll use the phrase, "have fun" too.  Maybe not the late teens or early 20s but the late 20s and 30s, 40s?  A matter of who cares to admit.  Besides, how else can the men "play, play" without the women?<br><br>Anyways, I am rooting for you.  Discuss with him that it's not all about his needs, it's about yours too and how you both can come to a balance to have a satisfying relationship.....in every aspect of it.

            <div class='col-md body'>It depends on who r u dealing with.. if ur bf/gf is the trustworthy sort.. thru the years have shown u his loyalty.. why not give him more freedom n leeway. I trust my gf alot.. so i dun bar her from interacting with guys including her many suitors. She juz have to know when to draw the line.<br><br>Furthermore, would u like someone to restrict u. Prevent u from meeting pple. I dun think so. So why impose restrictions on others when u dun like it either.<br><br>That's my view n the way i conduct myself n how i treat my gf.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
