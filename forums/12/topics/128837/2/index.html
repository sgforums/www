Otherwise you may end up having to live with double standards, if not in this issue, in other issues as well.  Remember, if this is the guy for you, you have a long journey to walk with him so you really want to have a nice, fun, loving and relaxing walk.  If both feel so restricted here and there, it is going to cause gaps in the relationship and sooner or later, one is going to go.  We can't have it all in life.  Somethings got to give.  You win some, you lose some.<br><br>Cheer up.  No point getting all worked up on things that hasn't happened.  It may caused a disease in the relationship.  Have fun....have trust....in him and in yourself!!<br><br>All the very best.</div>

I've been longing for dat.. trying to have lots of faith in myself.. but from time to time mind will be notti and start to think otherwise... so haf to keep constantly reminding myself.. this is the initial phase of stepping out to haf trust in him i guess.. IT's not easy i must say..</div>
