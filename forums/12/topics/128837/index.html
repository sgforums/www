            <div class='col-md body'>Since both parties are not married to each other (yet), i dun think either party has the right to restrict who the other party interacts with lor.. Even if it is a married couple, there should be a certain level of trust between husband and wife, as long as there is no evidence of cheating whatsoever.<br><br>Anyway i feel that there is no such thing as cheating if the couple is not married. Don't think it is healthy for a relationship to be sustained merely by one party tightly controlling who the other party interacts with. Cos ultimately this leads to lots of mistrust, discontentment and unhappiness. Not everyone can tolerate their partner regulating who he interacts with.</div>
