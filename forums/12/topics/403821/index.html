              <p>if she does not initiate any text message to you it might mean that she is a conservative person and she thinks that it is inappropriate for a girl to initiate contact with a guy.</p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <p>she is just not that interested to talk to you anyway and she replies long messages to you because she sees you as a friend and she is just being polite and courteous to reply to your text messages.</p>
              <p>she does not hate you because if she does, she will not even bother replying back to you in long sentences.</p>
              <p>if you are interested in her and wish to go after her, just call her and ask her out for a specific date and time and her response will tell you whether she is interested enough to give you a chance to win her heart. don't waste your time texting her, she will not fall in love with you because of your constant texting.</p>
              <p>check out my articles at my blog, it will guide you on how to properly go after her without turning her off.</p>

              <p>It's thru talking to her face to face then u get to understand better how she feels about u what, cuz u can see her different reactions and emotions.</p>
