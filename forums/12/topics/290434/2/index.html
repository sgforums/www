We also respect and admire guys who are more open and not those teeny weeny shy type.<br><br>I believed the gal did not noticed you or thought that you were saying hi to somebody instead of her. Once a guy also approached me and say hello, i completely ignored him, because I was thinking of something that I did not noticed him. The next day, in the same bus stop, he again approached me and said hello, and asked "did you note my greeting to you yesterday", I was glad he came forward so that I have a chance to apologise to him about my ignorant. From then on, we become frens, and guess what, i introduce him to my sexy gf too and they are getting engage very soon.<br><br>Go straight and talk to her, I guarantee she will talk to you, if not, she must be a damn proud gal, no use going after her, even if you manage to get her, you will suffer.</div></blockquote>Hello!!

            <div class='col-md body'>You played the game wrong from the start - you should be the one going over, introducing yourself and starting the small talk. Instead you get your friend to help you, didn't grab the opportunity and even kept quite - allowing awkwardness to envelope the short time together.<br><br>It takes only 7 seconds to make the first impression, and you blotched it up. No worries, what's done is done - so lets move on to plan 2.<br><br>The next time you see her, muster up some courage and confidence. Walk up to her and introduce yourself, apologize for the bad impression the other day - just whipped up a "Sorry, I was somewhat nervous".... Then move on with the small talk... Play it with humor, make her laugh and comfy, ask for her contact details - be it email address or cell number...<br><br>Remember not to behave like a stalker or low self-esteem dude the next time, make it to 1st base...
