            <div class='col-md body'>Don't really know if this is an agony. Well, let me share what i have in my heart.<br>Three weeks ago, i went to the gym. While working out, i saw this girl. She somehow attracts me. Might be a crush, maybe not. We were looking at each other. I did not make the first move to talk to her.<br>So i just left the gym. The following week, the same day, Wednesday.<br>I stepped into the gym, i saw her running at the treadmill. I felt my heartbeat race faster, so i told myself "okay, since this is the second time i saw her, might as well talk so i won't miss the chance and regret."<br>I was working out, she was doing cardio. I feel like she's giving me a lot of chances to approach her. But i am shy, don't know how to approach. I don't deny the fact that i had approached girls before, i wasn't rejected and end up being friends. I told my gym buddy that the girl is cute, he told me, "want me to help you talk to her?" I said 'No, shy lah". So we left the gym.<br>I feel like hitting myself? Two chances and i don't cherish them.<br>I believe in the saying "if there's fate, we will see each other again?"<br><br>So ytd, i went to the gym again. Once i stepped in, i looked around.<br>HA! THERE SHE WAS! I am happy lah, wanna burst out smiling.<br>Okay so this is it i told myself. I start working out, when i was taking a break, cooling down. I asked my girl - friend[a sec sch schmate ] to help me approach her. she did and it was up to me to take the initiative. As usual, we were looking at each other. She was giving me signs like " come talk to me " I am not joking here, i wasn't wearing pants with zips, neither was exposing my underwear.<br>Everything was set up nicely, my friends were like, "what are you waiting for?<br>she is there waiting for you"<br>I clean up, i went to the lobby where she is. She was reading magazines with her friend. She treats me like i'm invisible. Okay, i felt like maybe she's shy too.<br>So i went out of the gym and waited for her to come out.<br><br>40 mins passed, i stood there like an idiot. She finally came out, she took a bathe. She exited, she saw me.<br>She just left with her friend. I tried to catch up. She walked even faster.<br>I got into my car, i drove to where she was, stopped right in front of her. I opened the door, i said hi. She stand there and walk off? I was like WTF?<br>I mustered my courage to say hi. I mean like if i wasted chances while in the gym, i made up outside? Why must she like just left without saying anything?<br><br>Why give me signs to go over and you just left?<br>I felt i was played man. Feeling confused.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, i didn't consider that. Thanks man. But what i feel is maybe she might be thinking that why didn't i go talk to her.

Such act of u only shows that u are thinking too much... never make yourself look stupid in front of the girl u like.<br><br>Just use my method:"hi, i am sry that i have scared u but i just wanna befriend with u. Do u mind being my friend?"<br><br>Use the words wisely, one mistake can make a world of difference. Gd luck. Stay cool and calm when approaching her.</div>

This makes you look weak.<br><br>And don't look so far as to imagine it as a BGR. As if the girl cares? Take things one step at a time. It will put pressure on him. Just enjoy the moment.<br><br>doko<br><br></div>
