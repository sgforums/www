There are lots of way to do it...<br>I am sure you can find you True friends one day if you search hard.<br><br>Or another way which is also the hardest way is to Endure...<br>Telling yourself that you won't let the thing call "loneliness" to interfere with whatever you are doing.

What's the big deal ?<br><br>Not everyone in this world will find their other partner.<br>Many remained single and remained happy.<br><br>Their happiness don't come from receiving from some one else's giving. Their happiness comes from giving to some one else who needs it.<br><br>If all you think about is how or who should make you happy, then you will forever be miserable.<br><br>A self centered/selfish person does not deserve a good partner NOR happiness. I think you falls into this category, because all you do is whine and complain. Sorry to say this, the more you moan and groan, the less likely ANYONE will want to be with you.<br><br>Even if you saved up enough to BUY yourself a overseas wife, I doubt she will be happy with you in the long run.
