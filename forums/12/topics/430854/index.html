              <p>idk why i have a lot of negative thoughts for the past few years and it is really bothering me now because i can't focus on my studies..it's because i feel lonely easily and when that happens i just can't get started but i wasted time on fb instead. ...</p>
              <p>i feel sad all the time because i hate it that im quite anti social. Introvert too i just don't have enough energy to talk to people all the time, and i hate it too when i realised that sometimes its because i jsut don't want to talk or that im shy. this....is socially unacceptable...why am i like this....i hate myself.</p>

              <p>When your thoughts are running, what are you thinking of?</p>
              <p>Of yourself, right?</p>
              <p>That is inward thinking. When thoughts go inward, it is like a blackhole, it absorbs everything, become heavy, and makes you letargic and anti-social</p>
              <p>Turn your thoughts around. Look at things and think. Focus on things or events outside of  yourself. Thats why it is important to get a hobby, or be an expert at one thing, so that your thoughts are focused on that thing and away from yourself.</p>
              <p>Try it, you will feel immediate relief. Continue until it becomes second nature.</p>
              <p>Won't change much of who you are, but will make your mind free, and you will feel better. And see how it goes.</p>

              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: Arial; color: black;">Introversion is not a sin……and
                  there is nothing wrong with it. Perceive instead as a gift that when handled
                  properly can lead to many great intellectual benefits. Indeed, an introvert has
                  the ability to think deeply due to his or her apparent loneliness. He or she
                  has the gift to carefully identify his or her environment and master that
                  invisible loneliness. Furthermore, an introvert has the possibility to better
                  know and understand himself and what his or her qualities are while most people
                  don't have that ability.</span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;">In order for
                  others to accept you as an introvert, you should accept yourself the way you
                  are. It is a difference that is comparable to any other cultural or sexual
                  differences. By recognizing and accepting that you are an introvert, you
                  automatically give yourself a chance to cure your state if so you wish or learn
                  how to deal with it if so wish.</p>

              <p>i have family problems since a long way back but it's not the main cause..yes i actually sleep more compared to my friends. Im in sports cca, so i excercise a lot yeah, i will feel good after training but the next day im back to moping around.</p>
              <p>@mancha</p>
              <p>i see, im trying to find something that i like now ...i never had a hobby or am good at anything</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>@fcukpap</p>
              <p>but i always don't have much to say to people, conversations get awkard with silence. So i don't have many friends and i  really don't like this way. actually, i think its because i thought too deeply already so i made many mistakes this year. </p>
              <p>ok, i will accept myself as an introvert, but in the real world introverts lose out to extroverts?</p>

              <p>nope....introvert is not a loser...he is just being himself...a loser can be a world winner but pretends or refuses to accept who he really is...</p>
              <p>while a happy person is one who cares for others as much as for himself, and is good at what he is capable of and contented with what he or she is without taking hard what others see or say about him ...</p>
              <p>first, learn to accept yourself</p>
