Are you really sure you want to be a sniper in the army? For one, being a sniper isn't a glamorous thing or as easy as shooting an awp in counter-strike. You lose your identity, your only friend is your rifle. your vocation would be a secret to everybody.<br><br>As for requirements, eagle eyesight and the ability to survive in the field for at least 3 days for a normal sniper and 10 days for an sof sniper.<br><br>Gdluck! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
