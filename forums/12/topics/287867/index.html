            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Crave86,<br><br>Position yourself into another person's shoe if you would want to understand that particular person. A relationship is not only about love, it is about loyalty, trust and friendship.<br><br>From what I understand, this girl does not have the above characteristic to be with you anymore. This is a typical 1 sided love case, in this case, you were the unfortunate one who contributed in many efforts and showered many emotional attachment to it.<br><br>Learn to live life alone at times.. you will along the way discovers many wonderous moments with the people around you, the natural wonders, the trees, the mountains, the animals and even the tiny creatures which many people had ignored.<br><br>My advice to you is to move on, as you are still very young, its a great journey ahead. There are many other women waiting for your love and will give you what you will deserve.<br><br>Trust me, one fine day, this present girl of yours will regret for what she had done to you and will wish to be by your side whenever she encounters a bad relationship with another guy, for what you have hurt to others, others will repay you with the same hurt. This is known as Boomerang effect. or as buddhist known as Karma (Instant or Prolonged)<br><br>Crave 86, take my advice to move on and meet more people and importantly to travel and take a break, you will definitely realised that the world is bigger than you had expected and due to culture differences whilst travelling, the people you meet are definitely worth consider as life time friend.<br><br>am writing to you from my rental house in Ban Senayao, Chiangrai, where I've been staying for the past 3 years... as I like you before. am sick of the systems, (politcal and bad leadership) and people in our homeland.<br><br>Take care and write to me whenever you need someone to chat with.<br><br>Regards<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its hard breaking up a r/s uve tiredly held on for a long time, but sometimes u knw u haf to do it. sadly, sometimes ppl onli appreciate things they lose, n if they reali dun even appreciate u aft they lose it, then its even worse to keep holding on to that kinda ppl.<br><br>everyone tries hard to make something they want to happen work, but we haf to all admit that not all things will wrk as long as we put in the effort. the girl doesnt seem to b ready for a r/s, she doesnt wan to b bound by anyone, living a life on her own free time. shes not willing to give time for a commitment like u do.<br><br>if u reali still feel that she loves u, i wun keep suggesting a breakup, but its at ur own loss. how long can u last with that pain n hurt in ur heart? deep down u understand that she isnt there for u, but its hard to face it. giving up on her will hurt more than continuing in this r/s, but at least it might end the pain that could prolong in ur heart if u continue</div>
