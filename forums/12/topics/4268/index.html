            <div class='col-md body'>All had been asked since the day everything started. As time goes by the dungeon inside myself gets dark and scary. Fear strikes whenever scenes of her flips over the mind. Y am i so useless compared to her? People beside mi seen changes in me, askin whatz happening to mi. Depression has always always my friend, accompyin the daies of misery. No one loves to be distracted in work, life n everything one do. The question is how one remedy the problem. Sometimes answers r obvious right, but one still walks right into the diablous path. She's older than mi, much more stronger; i terms of intellutent, career, mind, handlin of stuff. Ok i admit i'm a man, so what if i'm a man? Jealously is forever present inside mankind, n can i ask whoever can sit n witness his loved one being so successful while himself still struggling for survival? Route down to the final destination is far too much than just reachin out your hand n grabbin it. i dunno .. confusion is always there, surrounding mi.....<br><br>------------------<br>Agony Strikes when death advocates.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hold it there, Lord Agony!  Life can't be that bad, surely.  There was life before you saw her, and there will surely be life after her.  I was in your situation for almost two years until someone taught me a trick.  Everytime you feel that depression coming on sit quietly somewhere, close your eyes, breathe slowly, and DEEPLY, ten times, holding the air in your chest for a slow count of four, exhale and then be glad you are not a cripple, you are not so bad-looking, and then smile - yes, SMILE, and keep on smiling even if you feel silly.  You will find that you will actually laugh after that...!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In fact i'm laffin now basically *laffz. Wad a kewl trick to get one immune n start off laffin. Thkz mate fer this nice advice ya'd given. Nothing escapes from onself afterall, eventually one will get back to square one again. The obstacle inside mi is too strong to overcome, well ur a passerby from wad i read in yer post, but everyone experiences different stuff. It might sound n look da same but in fact it is not...<br><br>Greatly appreciated dat u made effort to reply my post *laffz. I log in to check if anyone knows wad da hell am i tryin to say n tot my post was exotic. Now i know i'm not illiterate afterall.<br><br>Shld fate returns n help us to be together is another thingie, initially fate lies in yer own hands on how one tries to subduce it. Yah ur correct, there is definately life before/when i met her n life still carries on. Mankind is like this, no one is totally satisfied, maybe that's the thing that i can never overcome thought. Knowing that i shld be carryin on with my work but scenes of her still flashes across unintentionally.<br><br>Escape is the thing that one always do, ain't it true *smiles<br><br>------------------<br>Agony Strikes when death advocates.

Yes it's a gift.... An invaluable gift.... Some finds it a torment, while others find it a bliss.... Very often how ya find it is just where ya look inside the 'box'.... It's BIG, it's MESSY... It's filled with loads of junks... JUNKS... Unless you're able to make sense out of it.....<br>'Escape' is the word I used to use... I used to CHOOSE.... I emphasize on the word CHOOSE because I've being given a choice to do so.... But like you've mentioned... HUMANs very often choose that word... That's why I would rather consider myself a DEVIL for now.... 'Escape' it seems.... Is NEVER really a solution.... In fact, if you're thinking of shortening your life span... 'Escape' seems one of the best options.... It SIMPLY VOID OUT that portion of your life so that a certain part of your life went missing... IN RETURN, only to reappear so that you would have to face it again... And HENCE, 'doubling' (I don't use a calculator for this term, use your OWN estimation..) the original amount of time and effort needed to deal with the thing... And much VERY OFTEN.... It's especially TRUE with human emotions.... Go THINK about it.... Not to mention that your health could be very well be affected by it... Further 'reducing' your life span...?<br>Hmm... TOTALLY AGREE with that... Accumulated problems and experiences CHANGE a young chap to an OLD FOOL....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Now that's NOT a miracle... That's just ALL that's in his mind... If he just continue to sit back that way and believe that he's an 'old fool', he can ALWAYS be one... Now that's way too easy... Bet most people can do just that...?<br>Hehheh... EASIER said than DONE..? If life just SUZ like you say...? Then why are there still people laughing and smiling away so happily..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Hmm... Like I used to do when I was a human I guess..? Human tends to look at sad people and examples when they're SAD... And HAPPY people when they're HAPPY... Don't ask me why..?? I'm no longer a human to understand their strange behaviors..?<br>The 'keys' are in your hands..? SURE it ain't easy to do.... If you even know which door you wanna unlock in the 1st place..? You THINK, you DO..... Now... If you know what you wanna do and you know truly that it's 'right' to do so, then what's stopping you..? Your own mind..? A 'block' up there...? Now... How are we suppose to remove this 'block' from our mind...? I can simply tell you YOU CAN'T.... Don't be too disappointed.... Because there's simply no 'block' on your mind.... It's just all up there in your mind.... BECAUSE you CHOSE to believe that it exist.... That's why there can NEVER be a sloution.... For a problem which don't even exist in the 1st place.... Think over...? But NOT too much...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>
