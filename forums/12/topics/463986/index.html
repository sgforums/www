              I have been feeling really depressed, I have not been able to save up enough during the month of December.
              
              I did a stock check of my finances and my spending in December and what I saw shocked me:
              
              Deposits (mainly December pay-check): 2,488
              
              Expenses: 2,251
              
              Out of the 2251, here is what the breakdown is like:
              
              500 given to my parents 
              300 for my monthly savings account
              200 for my new spectacles, this dosn't happen every month (I broke my old pair while drinking)
              130 for medical bills (reimbursed by company).
              1321: food, drinking, taxis.
              
              That means I spent nearly $1321 on other things, like food and drinks. I think I've spent too much money on drinks. and taking taxis.
              
              I am not married, have no girlfriend and have no debt but I think spending like this is crazy, my take-home pay is only 2400.
              
              I normally just spent $500 a month but it seems like the month of December, I went crazy.
              
              Now my friends keep calling me up, telling me to join them for more drinks and meals and I am becoming frustrated and turning into a hermit by ignoring them.

              <p>1) No need to be depressed, money is just for survival, you cannot bring with you when you die.</p>
              <p>2) You're such a filial son, you should be happy.</p>
              <p>3) You have set aside $300 every month as savings, so that means you've abit of money saved up, you should be happy.</p>
              <p>Now you see, it's all a matter of perspective. You're sad because you find reasons to be sad where I found reasons for you to be happy with what you have. People don't understand what they have until they lose it. Do you need to lose a limb in order to feel happy with what you have now? Do you need to live in poverty and slums in order to feel happy with what you have now? Do you really want to waste your life wallowing in sadness over simple finances?</p>
