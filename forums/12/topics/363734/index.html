              <p>I am not a Christian, but some things are pretty obvious.</p>
              <p>Does being physically or mentally handicapped make a person 'less' than a human in the spiritual sense? The answer is no. There are always things which one can do and things which one cannot do, so there is no point in fretting over it. Look at your own strengths, and the things which you can do instead.</p>
              <p>You can try to be a more sincere Christian by following the teachings of the Bible more faithfully. Many Christians nowadays are half-baked, and the same goes for followers of other religions. I have seen quite a number of Muslims eat pork, and I can tell you quite a number of Christian teenagers do not follow the path of abstinence. I know that there are a lot more other rules of Christianity which are often broken, but you could prove yourself as a devout follower by following them. Hence, you will have succeeded where many others have failed.</p>
              <p>On a side note, there are two things I will like to tell you.</p>
              <p>Firstly, next time post such stuffs here: http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1381</p>
              <p>Secondly, please do not become a fanatic just because of what I have adviced you.</p>

              <p>TS, don't worry. Many Christians cannot speak in tongues de. It's perfectly fine. And it's never a commandment of God that one must speak in tongues. (If got one tell ba, I'll also want to know. XP ) What's so bad about just joining in using English? =)</p>
              <p>If you really want it, just keep praying about it.</p>

              <p><br>The keyword to remember is "encourage". It doesn't means you MUST speak in tongues to be loved by GOD.</p>
              <p>I don't speak in tongues and I will NEVER speak in tongues for the sake of making myself look holier among my peers, because I think that kind of desire is just cult-orientated.</p>
              <p>Your religion and your faith is purely between you and GOD, and it is not a MUST in Christianity to be able to speak in tongues. Most people who speaks in tongues or tries their best to speak in tongues are merely under the false impression that they will receive true blessings from GOD.</p>
              <p>Seeking after such lavish behaviour only shows the little faith and knowledge people really knows and have in their GOD!</p>
              <p>You can do all the things that you want to fool others about your faith in GOD, but ultimately you must become the person who is after and constantly chasing after the heart of GOD.</p>
              <p>A person who is truly after the heart of GOD will truly be blessed and loved by GOD, even though you do not have a perfect memory of the Bible. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>lol. prophecy is not prediction of the future.. not in that sense.</p>
              <p>prophets are mouthpieces of God. biblical examples are Elijah, Isaiah, Daniel etc.</p>
              <p>They only know what God wants them to know about something. Seldom it's about the future la, usually it's a message, either to encourage or to rebuke.</p>
              <p>i personally don't trust the words of someone who claimed something about the future.</p>
              <p>with regards to prophet, before you believe what they tell you, look at their character.. are they Godly people etc. don't get scammed.</p>

              remember that your allegiance is to God and God alone and not the Christian brethren.  What does it matter being an alien amongst your christian brothers and sisters when you know you will never be alien amongst God. While speaking in tongues can be one way of 'being close to God', faking it really defeats the purpose isn't it - isn't that just putting your christian faith for show? That's not cutting it. There are plenty of other ways to be close to God - prayer etc. Always remember that religion is just humans' interpretation of God. Who is right and who is wrong? Who sets the standards? Only God does.

              <p>wow it really sounds like they are pressuring you!And it would be hard to recieve I think if you are feeling pressure from them.</p>
              <p>    I recieved when I was 13,</p>
              <p>but hear me out,it should be personaly relationship with Jesus and also if they are interupting your prayer with this pressure, then it would be difficult i think.</p>
              <p>       Try to ignore them and focus on Jesus,</p>
              <p>get to know him, he is there for you and always has,he will be ready to listen to you when you speak to him and he really wants I believe for you to invite him in your heart and talk to him about your life, he wants to be your best friend and just simple like that and then one day when you really feel his presence and when you feel him listen and when you feel his love and he cares for you , invite him in your heart,</p>
              <p>         and that day, when you can feel his love, you might get the Holly ghost or you might be close to that day, just keep seeking and dont let them pressure you.</p>
              <p>     </p>
              <p>           I personally had felt his presence as I spoke to him . I didnt speak in tongues the first day that I cried in his presence, i cried because I felt his love, it was months , I was even starting to speak in tongues alittle bit not even knowing that it was tongues, because was so caught up in the emotion of talking to him, this is personal but if this will help you .</p>
