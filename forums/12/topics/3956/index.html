My imagination of warmth is elusive. Walking towards a desert with no colour, I'm wishing as I'm looking into an ocean of still tears. Tinted and cracked plaster is what's left in me.<br>I hear suffocated memories and looking at forgotten voices.

            <div class='col-md body'>It really goes down to trust and maturity as mentioned by Dragonlance.<br><br>I can say most of the time when u r still in sch, u tends to like new pple who like u a lot. It's like hopping from one boat to another. It's a phase where pple are still searching for themselves, they get all confused anyway, so they can't really decide for themselves.<br>But as u get older, u tends to be able to tell urself that u haf a partner, one who has shown quite an amt of care and love for u. and then u will not tend to leave him that easily.<br>And it's a different thing that u look for in love as u grow up. It's no longer looks or another physique, or maybe just some humour, or siao-onz attitude. It's love, a feeling that u cannot describe. Just only when u realise that u think that one means nothing to u, and the very next moment, u begin to miss him/her.<br><br>I wun do anything, but trust my partner. If she really goes, then I only wish all the best to her, becoz she feels happier wif that person. And it shows that that guy is of a better quality, which I lack as a bf to my ger. Inside me, I will be hurt, but being she is the one that I love, I wish her happiness wif that guy, becoz she deserve the best.<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>
