            <div class='col-md body'>okie.....after reading i i do hav some opinions on it......<br><br>firstly, if she has a bf, i tink it is nt reallie right dat she spent her time with u coz in this way she is hinting the wrong stuff to u....dat is y u felt like this....<br><br>secondly, to chase her or not...i would advice u not to go after her coz it is not nice to break pple up....furthermore pple might pinpoint u as the third party......<br><br>thirdly, sometimes in life u hav no choice.....pple like u but u dun like pple...den u like pple but pple dun like u.......y nt try to love someone dat u dun reallie liked?.....coz at the end of the day u will find urself feeling more fortunate when u love someone who reallie loves u, rather den u love someone who doesnt reallie like u, onli together becoz of ur persistant n she is too shy to reject u, but her heart is nt with u......<br><br>fourthly, maybe u could go expand ur circle of frenz.....den u will noe dat dere are actually too many good "flowers" dere for u to choose......</div>
