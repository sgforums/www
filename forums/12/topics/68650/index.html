            <div class='col-md body'>I just came back from school overly early. Couldn't go on with the day. I am very angry and bitter. I walked in class late and my form teacher asked why i was late, i said i had a bad stomachahe, which was a lie, i want to make things sound as normal as possible. Then he said i may have to go for detention class, i flipped out and replied to him "do what you like with me". He got pissed, called me outside and reprimanded me, i was genuinely sorry for being rude, but i doubt he accepted it, but that's not why I am bitter.<br><br>I was already pissed about lots of things, as someone said to me on one rare occasion i am spoken to, I let my problems be shackles into the next day. I dont even want to think about how long my shackles are, they are most likely damn long, 5 years of... unhappiness, with touches of happiness in between that have eroded over time. I hesitate to talk to my father because he is at work, same with my mother. My classmates already think of me enough of a freak, why bother talking to them, there is no point. I just left school, cant carry on for today.<br><br>I look at my life and feel bloody ashamed, I have suffered and have loss interest in going on. I am tired of working, I am tired of being alone and I am tired of being to blame, I am tired of being me. I really am. The only help i think i can do for myself is to end my life.<br></div>

But when it happened before, I flip out by just sitting down and shutting up, or punching the wall, or crying. But now.... it takes the form of being nasty to people, the last time i flipped out this years, a month ago? Or a few weeks ago, when school reopened, i was uncivil to my classmates, refused to move a space so they could all sit together or something. Today I was rude to my teacher and i just ran away from school. Wtf.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My problems???<br>My ethnicity, which is a barrier. There is no point in life because it is so unlucky for me. There is too much to do at school, there is no one to talk to at school, or at least they dont talk to me, whenever i try i dont get much transmission back toward me. My fucken home, no one's home most of the time, i'm alone.  We dont eat together, dad's always out, mum is in more, but i have no time to like interact, got work. I hesitate to call them now, cos i fear i will, NO i WILL bother them. I feel so isolated and misunderstood. I have the symptoms mentioned above on and off  frequently. And all along I thought being negative was just my character, but i never was negative... until i went to secondary school, all the shit started. I am an abomination to people, i am not a good person, i cannot match up to people and be accepted. I AM ugly and fat. I just slog day to day with not much incentive. I am sick of this. We all have no time to fix the place, the place is always in  a mess. Booze does not help anymore.</div>

There is no point in life because it is so unlucky for me. There is too much to do at school, there is no one to talk to at school, or at least they dont talk to me, whenever i try i dont get much transmission back toward me. My fucken home, no one's home most of the time, i'm alone.  We dont eat together, dad's always out, mum is in more, but i have no time to like interact, got work. I hesitate to call them now, cos i fear i will, NO i WILL bother them. I feel so isolated and misunderstood. I have the symptoms mentioned above on and off  frequently. And all along I thought being negative was just my character, but i never was negative... until i went to secondary school, all the shit started. I am an abomination to people, i am not a good person, i cannot match up to people and be accepted. I AM ugly and fat. I just slog day to day with not much incentive. I am sick of this.
