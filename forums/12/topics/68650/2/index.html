I remember a boss, who wld scream @ somethg I'd worked damn hard on, slam files on the table, slam tables, etc.  Thgs weren't going well @ all, even tho I was a newbie.  There were backstabbing colleagues.<br><br>My r'ship wasn't doing well either, I almost got married to a guy who, I realised, din really love me.  He din stand up for me @ all &amp; only thot of himself.  Whenever thgs happened, he'd always twist it such tt it was my fault, &amp; made himself out to be wronged or a victim.  He'd always ask me, "So wat I've done is Not enuff?"  Well, it damn well wasn't.  I dowan the extras, only the basics.  So we split.<br><br>Thgs were horrible @ home.  When I split up wif my ex, my parents were giving me hell, cosh I din tell them the exact details of wat happened, &amp; I'm Not gonna start now.<br><br>So wat did I do?  Did I take my life?  I'm still here, am I Not?<br><br>Well, I took a vacation, sorted out my priorities, tokked to frens &amp; resolved to move on.  Life became so much better wif time.  Managed to win my colleagues over, dev'd a rapport wif my boss, who turned out to be q. alrite.  I enjoyed being single &amp; went out wif my girl frens or my guy frens.<br><br>Then, I fell in love wif my best fren &amp; we're happily together now.<br><br>This is so cheong hey, but I think u need help.  Tok to pple who care, even ur parents.  They love u more than u think.  Sort out ur priorities.  U can continue to wallow in self-pity, or resolve to make thgs better.<br><br>I can't guarantee ur life will take a turn for the +ve immediately, or tt it'll work out completely.  But it sure helps to adopt an optimistic view of life.  Do u wanna continue remaining a victim of circumstance?  Or do u wanna juz keep on fighting?<br><br>I'm a girl, &amp; if I can do it, surely u, a guy, can : )<br><br>RP<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by men_@_arms:</div><div class="quote_body">I just came back from school overly early. Couldn't go on with the day. I am very angry and bitter. I walked in class late and my form teacher asked why i was late, i said i had a bad stomachahe, which was a lie, i want to make things sound as normal as possible. Then he said i may have to go for detention class, i flipped out and replied to him "do what you like with me". He got pissed, called me outside and reprimanded me, i was genuinely sorry for being rude, but i doubt he accepted it, but that's not why I am bitter.<br><br>I was already pissed about lots of things, as someone said to me on one rare occasion i am spoken to, I let my problems be shackles into the next day. I dont even want to think about how long my shackles are, they are most likely damn long, 5 years of... unhappiness, with touches of happiness in between that have eroded over time. I hesitate to talk to my father because he is at work, same with my mother. My classmates already think of me enough of a freak, why bother talking to them, there is no point. I just left school, cant carry on for today.<br><br>I look at my life and feel bloody ashamed, I have suffered and have loss interest in going on.
