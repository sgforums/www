No point subjecting yourself to temptation and cheating on your wife-to-be even before your marriage...<br><br>Stay away from clubs, lounges and other sleazy places too, for that matter. There are pastimes, activities and places you can visit that are much more healthy and wholesome...<br><br>Likewise, do not overindulge in porns... play a computer game instead!<br><br>Another thing is to remind yourself of your wife... Are you able to look her in the eye and say "I love you" after cheating on her?  I came this close to 'crossing the line' during a business trip to Vietnam. In the and, it is the thought of my wife of 10 years  that kept me from doing the wrong thing.<br><br>I am glad that today I can hold my wife in my arms and tell her I love her, without my conscience nagging at me   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

This may really make you want to go for other girls. But it's your responsibility to keep your sex life with your gf, of cos she play a part too.<br><br>It's natural that you feel boring having sex with the same girl all the time, so watching porn might help a bit actually, so that you have new ideas to do different things with your gf.<br></div>

A question next to ask is how clean are they  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">. Beside you probably pay heavy for that. When you have the fantacy again, just think that having sex with stranger probably cause you AIDs and that you pay for it.</div>
