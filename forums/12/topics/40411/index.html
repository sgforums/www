There's re-sale value regarding about the house. Get the house first. Then sell it/rent it off till when it reaches five years.

Marriage doesn't have it's honour then. Marriage is a everlasting and blissful event.<br>If she has decided that she's not going to marry D. Then drop it all off.<br><br>But warn her not to get into another relationship, (i suggest a rest for a year) so to learn how to be independent. She got to learn how to love herself and her friends. Guys ain't everything in her world.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">In short - Wake Up her Idea.  </span><br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by CuTiE~~:<br><strong>if she back out now, she will have to<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  repay [b]D</strong> the $30k<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  have to face criticism from colleagues...<strong>D</strong> told her that he wun help her to cover up...if anyone asked, he will tell them the truth...

At her age and the working experience that she has. I believe she could have chances else where.<br>Secondly, she got to realise that it's not a pride/ego/face problem anymore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  There are true friends that could stand by her side. If she didn't know this at all....i believe this is the best lesson she'll have to learn.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">In short - Friends Are More Precious then You Thought. </span><br><br>Third Point: She don't love him right? Doesn't it hurt him even more to know the fact? Face it.<br><br>Fourth Point: It's nice to have people to pamper...however human has so much ability to do so much in this society. Selfish thinking this is.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  My question to her is......what does she really want in life?<br>She could have all the pamper and loving care she wants from one person, or from all her friends and loved ones around her.<br><br>Every walk in life, no one guarantees a smooth journey.<br>Trials and stromy days are days which made us stronger and better person.<br><br>That's all i have.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br><strong>To Yun and all buddies of AG: If you read this, i remember that we do not have rights to tell people what to do or even break up a r/s.<br>However i feel it's not for the good of this girl that she has to get out of this relationship. Instead it's for the good of D that he wouldn't have to suffer with the girl. It's so unfair for D. I believe in this case. </strong><br><br>Cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

She has been using C as a substitute - which shows her unstability in emotions and then D comes into the picture, it is very likely that she accepted D based on this unstability emotions which could likely be using him as a substitute too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>She loved the way D treated her because she is experiencing that postive aspect of having a relationships - being loved, etc. Paradoxically, a good relationship somehow requires equal amount of giving and receiving. An extreme on either side, would likely to sink the ship. (Based on stastics and experiences).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Another issue is that the guy is 29 and she is only 22 - 7 years difference. Yes, love knows no boundary, however obviously from this case, we can see that the kind of emotions and love that HE wants and SHE wants is entirely different. That guy wants to settle down and build a family, while this girl just need to be loved and family committment is still quite alien to her. Both of them have different emotional and spiritual needs - when a couple wants to settle down - they have to look at the <strong>same direction </strong>and not against one another.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I suspect the guy felt the need to get married (socially or personally), which gives him the urge and inclination to get house, etc. Reasons being after being with you gf for a year and he wants to marry her? Some people can be together for 4 years and they don't even understand their gf/bf, even more so for a-soon-to-be married couple. A year is far too short, this guy is making hasty decision.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Now the ultimate issue is being raised: She doesn't love him at all - it just because she enjoyed the feeling of the other partner showering her with love (Based on the fact that she was hurt very badly by B, obviously she has put in alot of effort or emotions in it) -and that is (or him personally) something NOT WHAT SHE WANTS.<br><br>I repeat my stand again: Her indecisivness will ruin her like catapult on stone walls. That guy mentioned that if she wants to back out, must fort out $30K - the question is: is it the decision made by him alone or the both of them? If it was purely his own wishful thinking decision, then BACKOUT, because nobody can force you to marry someone you have no love for.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>However, if you were to agree upon his decisions, then it would be a hardnut to crack. My suggestion would be: Arrange to have a talk with him. Tell him that 1 years is far too short for foundation of a proper marriage. Tell him that he are not willing to settle down. If he ask why you lead him on, etc - tell him the real reason - your TRUE feelings.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You don't have to break him and escape because he tries to cage you. He is a good man - just that he is far too hasty in this decisions. My advice would be, if possible, still allow him the chance be with you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: If a couple is truly in love, does it matter whether they are married or not? Afterall, marriage is only a certificate. (You could use tell him that.)<br><br>Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>your initial description of D portrays a caring family man. but threatened by the prospect of losing his bride, turned nasty. dunno whether he too afraid of losing the girl he loves then just say say only to scare her or what. if really he too afraid and desperate, maybe can forgive a bit lah hah?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  but IF he has already habored the intention of executing his threats, then me thinks dis D guy exposed some MAJOR character flaws! Reali can stick on wif dis kind of guy meh? Cheers    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
