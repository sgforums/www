            <div class='col-md body'>you know wat's sometimes annoying about AA? when u come in late, and see all the LONG replies, it's so tedious to read thru them so i don't repeat wat's already mentioned, and add in things that aren't there!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>but it's great how the few of us are generally sincere in helping. keep it up~!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>right.. i skimmed thru all of the posts and generally agree with the consensus.<br><br>MC2, about the reselling of the flat, AFAIK, the couple has to stay married for 5 years while owning the flat. So keeping the flat while not being married is out of the question. i'm not sure, i'm sure they could clarify this with HDB.<br><br>now my comments: no one touched on D, the guy that's being "unfairly treated".<br><br><blockquote><strong>if she back out now, she will have to<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  repay D the $30k<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  have to face criticism from colleagues...D told her that he wun help her to cover up...if anyone asked, he will tell them the truth... (chances are, she will be bad-mouthed)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  she brings hurt to him..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  she has to pick herself up &amp; live a life without D...no one to pamper her anymore..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  cannot face him in future cos they working in the same company.. </strong></blockquote>It seems to me that while D is a great guy, there seems to be something amiss. he may treat her well, but may not have that matured a thinking. i'm sure he knows that by forcing her to marry him for watever reason (flat, becos he loves her) isn't a very wise thing to do.  from your post, it almost seems like the guy is giving her an ultimatum, "marry me or else...."<br><br>now that just doesn't seem to go down right with me. of course i'm not saying that the guy, if he truly loves her, should just set her free, but forcing the issue isn't gonna help. it's not love when it has to be forced. she oviously doesn't love him in that way, and he has to accept that, and not force her to love him back. of course, i don't deny pple that get married for reasons other than love, and these pple have my utmost pity.<br><br>back to your firend, A. well like the rest, i feel that this should be a lesson learnt. WHAT she can do from now beats the hell out of me, but getting married (now) is definitely out of the question. i stand by MC2's opinion on this.<br><br>perhaps she could try the relationship somemore, but not get married yet. i do not know the financial implications of this (screw the social implications, colleagues can talk all they want) but information on that (HDB most likely) can be easily obtained. one obvious question to ask is whether the deposit could be used in the future because they do not want to get married yet.<br><br>i don't like the chances of them ever mutually loving each other, but it's not impossible. if they do decide to try again, she will have to open her heart, and i believe learning to love someone is possible. however i believe that when a break-up occurs, it's always hard, if not impossible to get it back. what with that huge deposit looming over their heads, and the heartache of a cancelled marraige, the odds just seem too skewed.<br><br>now, another point that no one has mentioned. it's about YOU cutie~!<br><br>we know u are worried sick for ur friend, and in ur retort to delusion (his nick suits him) i can see that u are offended at the insensitivity towards your friend's problem, which in turn communicates the concern you have for her. however you are not there to solve her problems, but to be her strength to carry her thru. i hope u will not attempt to rectify the sh[/i]it (for want of a better word) that she has gotten herself in, but rather to give her the strength so that she can go thru this. of course in future, you'd do well to remind her if she still has problems with getting into relationships which aren't suitable for her. (heaven forbid! she should learn her lesson by now!)<br><br>you can only do so much. she's obviously scared and depressed. if you become like her becos of her, i'm sure she'll feel worse.<br><br>best luck and wishes to her, and to you also.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ask ur friend to call HDB personally and explain the whole scenario to them. They will be able to advice her on what to do next..... If she really donÂ’t want to rom with him, I personally dont think HDB will fully refund the 30k.... there should be a penalty fine.<br><br>My friend kannaÂ… divorced case, house only bough 1 yr ago (with HDB grant of 50k.) Now hdb want them to pay 50k cash back to them first. The reason is becoz when hdb approved their grant, they deposited 50k cash in their cpf account, so now they want the cash back.<br><br>So better check with HDB first if she is not willing to ROM with him.....</div>
