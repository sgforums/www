              <p>alright here`s the problem .</p>
              <p>One month ago i met this gal who was my friend`s friend . She was kina hot and all plus my friend told me she was kina interested in me .So i started chasing her . On v-day i bought her a bag which cost 250. And treated her to a meal 100+ . Plus i drop her a  msg telling her how i feel towards her . She then told me she needed more time to me my gf. Ok so i decided to give her more time and i`m still chasing her . I would pick her up from work everyday even though it`s not on the way and i have go through erpS just to fetch her home we wont even go out and eat or watever i just go and fetch her home like a driver. Suddenly today she told me wat would u do if you didn`t get anything back from me after u have done so much ?</p>
              <p>I totally went blank. So my question is do you guys out there think that i`ve done to much to give up now ? Or is that normal in chasing girls .</p>
              <p>And if guys had such bad experience pls share it out so i can judge for myself and see if i`ve done too much.</p>

              <p>alright here`s the problem .</p>
              <p>One month ago i met this gal who was my friend`s friend .
              She was kina hot and all plus my friend told me she was kina
              interested in me .So i started chasing her . On v-day i bought her
              a bag which cost 250. And treated her to a meal 100+ . Plus i drop
              her a  msg telling her how i feel towards her . She then told
              me she needed more time to me my gf. Ok so i decided to give her
              more time and i`m still chasing her . I would pick her up from work
              everyday even though it`s not on the way and i have go through erpS
              just to fetch her home we wont even go out and eat or watever i
              just go and fetch her home like a driver. Suddenly today she told
              me wat would u do if you didn`t get anything back from me after u
              have done so much ?</p>
              <p>I totally went blank. So my question is do you guys out there
              think that i`ve done to much to give up now ? Or is that normal in
              chasing girls .</p>
              <p>And if guys had such bad experience pls share it out so i can
              judge for myself and see if i`ve done too much.</p>

              <p>but it appears she's not interested in u as a bf, that's why so worried that you are so good to her</p>
              <p>maybe it's time for u to tone down the 'nice-ness', be nice but not so nice and see how it goes</p>

              <p>anyway i feel that u are doing too much to her...</p>
              <p>just my opinion.. my own one.. which could be very wrong..<br>i think that even if u can afford such things.. u are still doing too much..</p>
              <p>however its alright..u can try to be nice to her.. but then no need give such expensive stuff...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ok unless if she thinks that 250 bag is nothing but cheap stuff...</p>

              <p><br>Hmm.. I wouldn't say that the girl deliberately took him as a roberto right from the start..</p>
              <p>In his case, it appears that the girl 'suffered a gradual decrease in her interest level in him'.. I could imagine if I were in her shoes, I probably would feel that this whole thing with this guy is so mundane and unexciting..</p>
