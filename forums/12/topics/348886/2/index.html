              <p>alright here`s the problem .</p>
              <p>One month ago i met this gal who was my friend`s friend . She was kina hot and all plus my friend told me she was kina interested in me .So i started chasing her . On v-day i bought her a bag which cost 250. And treated her to a meal 100+ . Plus i drop her a  msg telling her how i feel towards her . She then told me she needed more time to me my gf. Ok so i decided to give her more time and i`m still chasing her . I would pick her up from work everyday even though it`s not on the way and i have go through erpS just to fetch her home we wont even go out and eat or watever i just go and fetch her home like a driver. Suddenly today she told me wat would u do if you didn`t get anything back from me after u have done so much ?</p>
              <p>I totally went blank. So my question is do you guys out there think that i`ve done to much to give up now ? Or is that normal in chasing girls .</p>
              <p>And if guys had such bad experience pls share it out so i can judge for myself and see if i`ve done too much.</p>

              <p>Another one whom went down the same way as TS.</p>
              <p>Consider this statement I made earlier "Guys whom only know how to play it the nice way, fail most of the time" You know, amigo.. this whole science of attraction goes beyond being nice..</p>
              <p>I refer to the last sentence and I got worrying - just because a lady 'allows' your wooing means she got to <strong>accept</strong> your wooing.</p>
              <p>Oh well, c'est la vie... Be humble in victory, and <strong>gracious in defeat</strong>.. Better luck next time, pal <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>it appears that she is no longer as interested as u at the start. I think what u have is starting to cause her discomfort.</p>
              <p>TS i know that you are trying to be sincere, but apparently to her you are overdoing things. I suggest you just stop all this and leave her alone. If she misses you, then she will contact you automatically de.</p>

              <p>alright here`s the problem .</p>
              <p>One month ago i met this gal who was my friend`s friend .
              She was kina hot and all plus my friend told me she was kina
              interested in me .So i started chasing her . On v-day i bought her
              a bag which cost 250. And treated her to a meal 100+ . Plus i drop
              her a  msg telling her how i feel towards her . She then told
              me she needed more time to me my gf. Ok so i decided to give her
              more time and i`m still chasing her . I would pick her up from work
              everyday even though it`s not on the way and i have go through erpS
              just to fetch her home we wont even go out and eat or watever i
              just go and fetch her home like a driver. Suddenly today she told
              me wat would u do if you didn`t get anything back from me after u
              have done so much ?</p>
              <p>I totally went blank. So my question is do you guys out there
              think that i`ve done to much to give up now ? Or is that normal in
              chasing girls .</p>
              <p>And if guys had such bad experience pls share it out so i can
              judge for myself and see if i`ve done too much.</p>

              <p>I think you did too much, imo. <br><br>If I were you, I wouldn't do so much (plus I know she has some interest in me). I wouldn't fetch her home every day. Maybe twice a week. And I don't just fetch her home, I'll bring her to some places - to dine or relax. We need to have some communication you see. I'm not a chauffeur and don't wanna be one. <br><br>Yes, you know she is kind of into you. But how much do you 2 know about each other? Did you 2 sit down and have a chat? Perhaps she might have interest in your physical appearance only, but what about the inside? (your character)  Probably after your 'courting' (the vday experience), she might think you lack of some substance (good, yes, in a way that you drive her home after her work, but then you might not be entertaining enough). I don't know.  <br></p>
              <p>Anyway, fret not. For her question part, (wat would u do if you didn`t get anything back from me after u
              have done so much ?) :<br><br><strong>1.</strong> She could be testing you. Are you the type of guy who retreats after being rejected? Are you good to her only during the courting stage? How much patience do you have? Are you the type of guy who asks for something in return when you treat a girl good? How 'da fang' (generous or something) are you in handling rejection?<br><br><strong>2.</strong> It's about guilty. She thinks your not for her and that you shouldn't have done so much for her. Don't waste your time you can find a girl that appreciates your efforts. <br><br></p>
              <p>For now, I don't think you should give up now. BUT, you should cut down on your activities that revolves around her. What do i mean. Don't fetch her TOO often. And if so, dine out. Don't just fetch her home blindly. Talk. Get to know more about her. Any intelligent conversation between the 2 of you? Or just pure labor works? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> (fetch her home after work. Fuck, there isnt even any orgasm.) <br></p>

              <p><br>Thanks for all your replys .</p>
              <p>Anyway i hope she is testing me. But everytime when i fetch her home i would ask if she wants to go have dinner or something . She would always say no i dont wanna get fat and then there`ll be nothing else to do .</p>
              <p>And we talk almost every night . During the first 2 weeks of knowing her we talked like for 3 hours every night . Then it started becoming lesser and now it`s like 5 mins of talking time . Cause for some reason she would call me at like 2.30am and say she is very tired then wat else can i say but , ok lor u go sleep first . Oh btw she is the one who always calls me. But i rather i call her cause i really hate waiting for her call.</p>
              <p>One other problem is her sms replies are kina rubbish like. As in her reply is some times short . For example she would just reply a LOL ok ok . This kind of reply i rather she not reply is like she`s not even interested to reply me is like she`s just entertaining me but on the other hand she might be busy. But no matter how busy i`m i would still find a topic to reply her msg.</p>

              <p>alright here`s the problem .</p>
              <p>One month ago i met this gal who was my friend`s friend . She was kina hot and all plus my friend told me she was kina interested in me .So i started chasing her . On v-day i bought her a bag which cost 250. And treated her to a meal 100+ . Plus i drop her a  msg telling her how i feel towards her . She then told me she needed more time to me my gf. Ok so i decided to give her more time and i`m still chasing her . I would pick her up from work everyday even though it`s not on the way and i have go through erpS just to fetch her home we wont even go out and eat or watever i just go and fetch her home like a driver. Suddenly today she told me wat would u do if you didn`t get anything back from me after u have done so much ?</p>
              <p>I totally went blank. So my question is do you guys out there think that i`ve done to much to give up now ? Or is that normal in chasing girls .</p>
              <p>And if guys had such bad experience pls share it out so i can judge for myself and see if i`ve done too much.</p>

              <p>Is this yr first time chase gal?</p>
              <p>Gal like surprise and excitement.  If she likes yr $250 bag, she just likes yr money and not the person u are. She maybe thinking u treat every gal the same. Buy expensive stuff when met initiately.</p>
              <p>U are behaving too predictable, too easy to guess for the gal. Lack excitement.</p>
              <p>I agree with what many people say. U needs communication with her. Not lavishly spending on her. U even got a car, solve the problem of transportation.</p>
              <p>Bring her to some quality place where both of u can have a heart to heart talk. Quality places does not mean expensive place. U both no need always go for dinning. Just invite her for some drink at some quality places to chin out.</p>
