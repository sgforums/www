            <div class='col-md body'><p>yup. i think u should see it as an investment. if it goes well u will have good returns. if not, too bad, change target. but my advice to u, dont give up. move her heart with ur perseverance. show her how much she mean to u. finally, i feel that u shouldnt complain, cos u did it willingly (picking her up, treating her to meal, buying her handbag). however, u should strike a balance. maybe u wanna cut down on the money u spend on her. u can buy her a handbag, but maybe not one that cost too much. $250 to me is ok, but still it depends on your budget. fetching her home everyday is very nice of u, but occasionally, u can miss the trip. to let her feel that she needs u and not to take u for granted.</p></div>

              <p>alright here`s the problem .</p>
              <p>One month ago i met this gal who was my friend`s friend .
              She was kina hot and all plus my friend told me she was kina
              interested in me .So i started chasing her . On v-day i bought her
              a bag which cost 250. And treated her to a meal 100+ . Plus i drop
              her a  msg telling her how i feel towards her . She then told
              me she needed more time to me my gf. Ok so i decided to give her
              more time and i`m still chasing her . I would pick her up from work
              everyday even though it`s not on the way and i have go through erpS
              just to fetch her home we wont even go out and eat or watever i
              just go and fetch her home like a driver. Suddenly today she told
              me wat would u do if you didn`t get anything back from me after u
              have done so much ?</p>
              <p>I totally went blank. So my question is do you guys out there
              think that i`ve done to much to give up now ? Or is that normal in
              chasing girls .</p>
              <p>And if guys had such bad experience pls share it out so i can
              judge for myself and see if i`ve done too much.</p>

              <p>Ok, i'm not claiming to be a dating expert but this are a few of the "mistakes" i could single out.<br><em><br>"On v-day i bought her
              a bag which cost 250. And treated her to a meal 100+ ."</em></p>
              <p>I'm guessing that this is your first Valentine's with her.?</p>
              <p>Well.... You kind of OVERDID it. You only give a girl such a LUXURIOUS Valentine's when she is going out steady with you OR when shes a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lITJK4jdUEE">gold digger</a>.</p>
              <p><em>"Plus i drop
              her a  msg telling her how i feel towards her." </em></p>
              <p>Again, i'm guessing you just started going out with her, probably a month or two...? Most likely even lesser than that.</p>
              <p>You are taking things way too fast... Right now, you're just at the DATING stage. Meaning, shes NOT your girlfriend. In other words, NOT OBLIGATED TO ENTERTAIN YOU. This is the stage where it's all playful flirty fun and no commitment. And what you're trying to do is to "seal the deal" with her, skipping the fun of dating.</p>
              <p>That is why she hesitated to go out steady with you.</p>
              <p><em>" I would pick her up from work
              everyday even though it`s not on the way and i have go through erpS
              just to fetch her home we wont even go out and eat or watever i
              just go and fetch her home like a driver."</em></p>
              <p>YOU'RE DOING TOO MUCH AND TRYING TOO HARD...!!! What you're doing doesn't give her the impression that you're a considerate lover who would go he extra mile for her. All it does is show her that you're a NEEDY, DESPERATE and POSSESIVE lover.</p>
              <p>Base on my instincts, i'm guessing shes actually planning to dump you. But she seems to be a nice girl, too nice to bear to deal this blow on you after all you've done for her. But once she confides in her friends and actually is ready to unload that shot on you. You can kiss this relationship good bye. And base on my gut, is going to be REALLY REALLY soon unless your able to learn for what i just mentioned to you and salvage this sinking ship.</p>
              <p>Good luck to you.</p>
