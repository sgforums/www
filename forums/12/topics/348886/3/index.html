              started becoming lesser and now it`s like 5 mins of talking time .
              Cause for some reason she would call me at like 2.30am and say she
              is very tired then wat else can i say but , ok lor u go sleep

              <p>One other problem is her sms replies are kina rubbish like. As

              <p>Huh. Weird. Then she must very skinny or somethin. Ask her la. Sure or not. Why dont want to dine with you. In a joking manner. </p>
              <p>Hmm. She always made the move huh. Not bad leh.</p>
              <p>The SMS thing dont care la. It depends what u send her earlier on. Sometimes there isnt much to reply so that explains the short reply lor.</p>
              <p>Sometimes when you want to know somethin, just ask. But dont ask blindly, ask in a different manner. A different approach to get your answer. That will be easier. Instead of making wild guesses.</p>

              <p>lol @ most of yous de comment. Seriously though..</p>
              <p>I admit that Karma needs to get some communication going on. Cant always be a driver like EVERYDAY. I know u like her and all. Give her the gifts n stuff during valentines. But if she starts to think u r all boring... keep fetching her, then she THINKS she can find someone else better ? Then go find la. I mean honestly, i will not fetch her everyday n all, and just to bring her home but if that is how u feel towards her n wanna treat her nice n stuff and she dun like it, its her loss. Not yours. U just wasted petrol money only and wasted ur effort in being urself.. thats if your nature is a nice and caring guy n all. Interests takes to build. But u can always set a bar and the initial periods to GET her attention, u gotta do what u gotta do. Thats all cool and good.Power projection, u gotta know when to use it and how to use it and WHO you use it on.</p>
              <p>But you gotta make sure the bar u set, u can maintain when in a relationship. Wooing period is easy, the part in holding on to the relationship is not easy. Cause girls will always compare.. they just cant go back in lifestyle man, n thts thefucked up thing, but thats pretty much fact.. unfortunately.</p>
              <p>Those here talking about oh... cant be nice, girl power ... hey, dun hate the player.. hate the game. Oh and about the 'brother that i never had' thank God i have to get any replies like that from any girl i liked, but if they said that, i'll just say 'well, i am not ur brother and never will. I do this because i like you, and it aint no brotherly love. ;p.. but now i know, that i am only just a brother.. u never had. U into incest? ' kekeke</p>
              <p>There is also different girls , different mentality and personalities. Good things take time. U can tone down, but can still remain in a relationship. They play thier mind games, you just do what u gotta do. She wants a normal relationship ? Its cool, pretty much means u can be friends with her n still look for other girls and date them at the same time.But that is entirely up to you. Depends how much u really really like her.</p>
              <p>If she dun appreciate the things you have done and put effort into it , u just accept the fact and its up to you whether u wanna use the time as friends to slowly worm your way in, or move on. And if she comes running back to you, do u think its fair to you? Fucking ur mind like that... playing u by the balls. N dun let those pretty watery doe eyes get u all weak n shit... never ever forget the past. N personally , i do not think its fair. If they can play that kind of game, they gotta live with the consequences of it.</p>
              <p>I know u get weak n all , feeling all fucked up. But get a grip on urself man. Its not the end of the world. Since u already tell her just be normal friends, all relationship start off as friends. U gotta know how to get ur priorities right man.. ur exams nearing, u study. Some girls like a guy who always pamper her, some girls like a man that take charge of his shit. I say u take care of your own shit first.. n thats get ur exams going. Get some good results and after ur exam then u start to think of her again.</p>
              <p>If u do things without expecting any returns, good stuffs will happen. Dun ever think tht investing on a girl expecting returns. U do it because u wanna do it and u feel good doing it and u wanna see her happy with it. Making or seeing her happy makes u happy. In the end of the day if she doesnt give a hoot about u, well...  tell her good luck in finding someone else better. And if she does find someone better, u should be happy that she is happy.</p>
              <p>Anyways, asking around wont really help ur problem but maybe get some insight ppl's different experience. So, all the best ;p Never ever rush things unless u for some unforseen reasons need to.. like lack of time to know her  etc.. hehehe...</p>

That's what most guy does lah, b4 together show them how good how good, after being together, become a total dick.</p></div>
