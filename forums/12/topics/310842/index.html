              <p>well. t start, i want t say that i feel really stupid. but you cant blame me, can you ? i admit i was not thinking right, i was a little rash. alright, here goes.</p>
              <p>less than a week ago, i broke up w my boyf. first, i started off msging him. then he gave me this cold reply. this doesnt happen just once, or twice. it`s many times. i know he`s out w his friends, i can tell. <em>but guys, do you really ignore/not bother at all about your girlf when you`re out w friends ? in my opinion, if th girl <span style="text-decoration: underline;">matters at all</span> t you, you wont do so.</em></p>
              <p>i asked for a brkup. it was sms, he replied <em>okay.</em> it totally seemed like he didnt care at all.</p>
              <p>th nxt day, i msged him again, i asked t patch. he told me that we should move on. then we quarrelled abit, he told me this : <em>give me till th end of th hols, i`ll give you an ans aft th hols.</em></p>
              <p>th hols are coming t an end. i guess you know what ans i want t get, right ? anw. i still msg him every morning, every night, even though he doesnt reply.</p>
              <p>2 days ago, we had this conversation. in short, he told me 5 things. first, he told me that no matter what happens, we still hav t move on (i didnt reply him yet). then, he told me he wanted t patch (well, i didnt reply yet. it could b what his friend sent, i dontknow. but he didnt deny it anw). then he told me not t bother (w what he said previously). then, he told me i was thinking too much, &amp; he said aft th holidays meant aft th holidays. last, i asked if i still had a chance w him, told him not t drag anymore if he had already decided t end all this. but he said <em>most probably.</em></p>
              <p>i dontknow how t face it. if th ans he`s going t give me is that we <em>wont hav another chance. </em>i want t know, what forumners think. advice is really appreciated, thank you for reading.</p>

              <p>i have to agree with purpledragon. move on with your life girl. he's totally lost interest in you. giving you an answer after the holidays is probaly just to give you time to cool down and pull yourself. he probaly knew you couldn't take the break immedietly thus this 'aft holiday thingy' came up.</p>
              <p>i know its hard to show the downside to your family and friends. if its embarassing to show it to your family, turn to your friends than. your true friends who will really piece your life back up again. i do hope you learn to pick yourself up. slowly but gradually.</p>
              <p>remember you can slowly progress and move forward. take your time. you can even stay stagnent with your life. but, don't ever walk backwards in life.</p>

              <p>I agree that he is just dragging it to let you cool down first. Guys don't like to face an emotional wreck..</p>
              <p>Girl, I know you like to hint to make him react. Like asking for a breakup, hoping that he will say something or do something nicer. Unfortunately, guys are dense. To him, breakup = breakup. He won't read too much into your motives and such..</p>

              <p>Candy,</p>
              <p>Sorry to say this. But you have played with fire.. now you've got your eyebrows burned.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, I don;t really believe you actually is still in love with him. A woman who is in love with her beau will not anyhow say break up one.</p>
              <p>You just cannot get over the fact that he took it (the break-up) so easily in his stride.</p>
              <p>You are perhaps.. hoping for some kind of "dramatic" episode where your guy begs you not to let this relationship go. You just want to feel that you have the advantage to control this relationship but, too bad he's not letting you have your day.</p>
              <p>Even if he comes back to you.. will you be a better gal friend ? Or will you stay the same, taking this relationship lightly ,happy happy break ?</p>
              <p>Women.. . we want to win.. but sometimes even if we do get what we want.. we'll still feel like the loser.. this is what you are feeling right now.. yes ?</p>
              <p>At the end of the day.. I assure you.. even if you managed to beg him back.. he'll treat you like dirt. Because he can no longer love you like before anymore.</p>
              <p>The thought of getting even with him.. may seem sweet now.. but the after taste of revenge will always be bitter.</p>
              <p>My suggestion to you girl... is go find someone else you can truly respect and admire. That way, you'll be able to cherish a good man.</p>

              <p>don't ever play around with the idea of "break-up", we guys take it very seriously!!<br><br>no point for regret now that you have burnt your finger. If you really want him back then put in the effort to show him that you are SERIOUS about him and don't ever toy with the the idea of "break-up" again.</p>
              <p>however, from what I see, I have to be honest that the chance of you 2 getting patching back is indeed very slim given how cold your guy is, and he seems quite keen to move on.</p>
              <p>gd luck gal, but maybe it's time for you to move on too</p>

              <p>My advise for you: Can you type properly? It is difficult to read what you are trying to say. A <strong>t</strong> with an <strong>o </strong>which makes up the word <strong>to</strong>, is that so difficult?</p>
              <p>If i'm your bf, i would get fed up and not reply your sms. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> Ok jokes aside.</p>
              <p>Break up, he dont deserves you and has lost interest in you already.</p>

              <p>Not trying to give you any false hope here. As you have posted (minus some other finer details) here is how I will look at it from another perspective.</p>
              <p>It is initially shocking to receive a break up especially by the interpersonal method you adopted doing it - via SMS. In my opinion such an act is really an act of cowardice and really doesn't speak well about your character and integrity. To me r/s is something so trivial to you, that I just cannot know when it will be before you come with your nuances again. So as a guy, I would go for the protect myself option, I will commit as long as you are committed. Other than that I cannot trust your emotions again, so before you are going to hurt me I will remain as status quo.</p>
              <p>It take 2 to tango and what you have done is really hurting even though he may not have confessed his feelings about this recent episode and I would not be surprise at all. You cannot even handle your emotions, so how is he going to trust his in you. I do not know what had conspired between the both of you but I gather it has something to do with the lack of attention from him. Correct me if I am wrong. On the whole picture, I think it would really help if the both of you can devote more time communicating with each other and learn how to anticipate each other's needs. In that way, you can avoid wasting your time 2nd guessing the other party and let all that negative feelings eat and come in between the both of you.</p>
              <p>What I see from his reply is simply that I wouldn't want any committment till I have gotten assurance from you that you will not look at our r/s so trivially and overlook me as a human being with feelings. Period.</p>
              <p>Hope you see things from another perspective.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents worth.</p>

              <p>Luckily you're the one who initiated the breakup, otherwise, he can't have the reason to prey on other girls....If he's the one who initiated the breakup, then it won't be nice on his image....</p>
              <p>Now, with you initiating the breakup, "mai tu liao"...got another sad story to share with the next girl he'll prey on....i.e. Up his chances of getting the girl...</p>
              <p>All thanks to you!</p>

              <p>Nonetheless, since what's done has been done, &amp; he doesn't wanna patch back with you...it's time you hould take another deep breath &amp; feel the difference....Yes...it'll be of a significant difference..just take a slow deep breath &amp; exhale...Look out of the window &amp; see...</p>

              <p>well. i think it was a right decision ba.</p>
              <p>jj, if a guy does that, he doesnt love you anymore. he said it. whatever for should you continue regretting, crying, for him ? think from another point of view, you still have a long way t go in life. friends, family, studies/work, w/e. manymany things t do. take a deep breath, calm down. do things you like, spend more time w your family. then out there, there are still manymany guys awaiting you.</p>
              <p>for th new t come, th old has t go. life is not perfect, therefore you inevitably will experience such things. try t think from another point, you`ll b cheered up better. like me (:</p>
              <p>good luck !</p>
