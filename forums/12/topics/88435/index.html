Eh.. you committed suicide and u can write in? how you suppose to do that?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Ok.. On a more serious note..<br><br>Firstly, you made a mistake by breaking up with your fiance because of another guy.. Both of you are suppose to be engaged or some would say married.. My question to you is.. Are you really ready to get married or are you getting married for the sake of being married?<br><br>At the way you are talking abt this new guy, it seems tat he is trying to break you up from a marriage.. Just because of something that is soooo important than he goes to find a prostitude? What is he trying to tell you? That if you are not around, there are other women out there who can "satisfy" his needs?<br><br>You said you die die won't give him up and he promised that both of you are going to get engaged this coming dec.. Miss ah.. like one of those who replied to you.. Marriage is a life long thing.. It is not something that after 3 to 5 years, you are sick of it, you divorce or what.. Think of the effects he may give to the family after both of you are husband and wife..<br><br>He has visited prostitudes.. How clean is he? Can i ask? You have done 2 times abortion for him.. If he really loves you, he would have kept those 2 innocent lifes and not ask you to abort it..<br><br>Throughout the whole incident, i can sadly say you have been fooled... What you are feeling remorse now is because you DID NOT do that compulsory thing which made him to look for prostitudes.. Than do you think behind your back, he never go visit them?<br><br>Conclusion: This guy is really not worthy of your love.. He is actually showing you his true colours and since you know what he is like, should do something abt it.. My advice.. End it asap or you will suffer..<br><br></div>

My dear girl, open your eyes and don't be naive. How old are the both of you?

Especially yunhaier.. or maybe you could call devil for help.. Dun worry.. there are nice ppl.. You seriously need to think about your r/s with this guy... You are almost getting married with your past fiance but then you left him for this new "perfect" guy..<br><br>Is he really that good.. ?? Noone is perfect.. Dun get fooled by him.. You are jus too emotional in handling r/s.. You based all purely on your feelings.. no rational thinking.. You should reflect yourself.. you did so much thing for him.. but what do you get in returN?? Jus becos of one stupid mistake and he's making your life screwed upside down.. What is so compulsory and importanT? Ppl do make mistake.. Have he learn to forgive you.. NO! He merely taking revenge... or out to spike you by doin such things.. Is all his excuses!!<br><br>You not goin to give him up jus becos you both are engaging this year end.. Are you sure that you wanna live with him your whole life?? Marriage ain't child play.. Is full of commitment.. he can do this once to you.. there bound to be a second.. And worse of all.. all these started even before the marriage.. Whart makes you so sure and confirm that he will change when you both are married.. Are you sure you have the power to do that? Don't be too naive.. Wake up and see the real world! You have to learn to protect yourself!!<br><br>Cheers   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

And seriously, HOW SERIOUS do you expect a man like him, whom you had two abortion with, to be your happily ever after? I beg to differ, do you think he would actually marry you considering the fact that you had TWO abortion of his child and I presume part of pressure in aborting comes from him? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Once is still ok.

True, once dead, u r free from all ur probs... But have u tot of the people who cares for u around u? Ur parents, esp... Alot of people all care for u, n if u jus go lik tat, can u imagine their sadness? Mayb to u their sadness is nothin... But do spare a tot for them... The anguish they suffer cannot be described in words, esp ur parents...<br><br>Do u really think it is worth to die for a guy lik tat? Do u think he will be remoseful, etc? Think twice, the way he treats u, i think he won't... sorry if i m bein harsh here... Don u think tat bein alive is far better than bein dead? Aren't there many other things tat u haven' fufil?<br><br>U haven't seen ur self in ur happiest moment, gettin married...<br>Havin children...<br>Growin old, havin grand children, etc...<br>Ur job...<br>Happy moments tat u will treasure, but u wouldn know if u r gone...<br><br>Wat u should do is actually to SHOW HIM tat u can live a happy life even without him!!! He tot tat u cannot do without him... Thus, he dares to be so darin... Askin u to listen to him havin sex wif another gal...<br><br>Think bout tis... Do u really want tis kind of guy as ur hubby? For the rest of ur life? He may promise to get engaged, but will he? And he is able to do such a cruel thing, u can guarantee tat he won do tat again in the future?<br><br>U needn feel guilty about havin the abortions... I mean, both of u aren't ready yet to be parents... It won be fair to the child if he or she is born, n deemed as a burden... The child surely won be loved as much as u would have liked to... N it is so unfair to the child...<br><br>Jus forget everythin... Put the past behind u... I think u really love him so much tat u r willin to do so much for him... But one should have a limit to where u stand... Certain things r jus to much to bear...<br><br>R u afraid, coz u feel u mak a wrong choice in the 1st place? Tat u chosen tis guy over another guy u were supposed to get engaged to? Tis tots mak u want to stay on to tis relationship to prove tat u aren't wrong?<br><br>Every one makes mistakes in his or her judgement... But if we realise it n is willin to rectify it, things wouldn be so bad...<br><br>I feel tat u deserved better...<br><br>Things may get tough in the beginnin.... But then... Try erase the past, start all over again... Go into another relationship only if u feel ready... Don let others force u anymore...<br><br>Mayb u r afraid of the fact tat coz u have abortion twice, tat people will mind? I feel tat all tis is part of ur past... U can choose to keep a secret forever... Jus treat it as a nite mare...<br><br>I sincerly hop tat things will turn out better for u... Life is precious, please don do so silly things for someone tat is such a jerk n not worth it...<br><br>Be strong... N prove to him n urself more imptly, tat u can face everythin n can do without him... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
