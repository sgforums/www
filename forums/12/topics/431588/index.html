              <p>Hi guys :)</p>
              <p>I'm a graduate holding a Media diploma. Since graduation, it's been quite hard for me to find myself a media job. Currently I'm in the service line but I have already considered quitting and getting myself a new job altogether, or go back to school once January comes by again.</p>
              <p>I've always wanted to learn Fashion Merchandising / Visual Merchandising but didn't get the opportunity to back then (since I was already in Media I just took it). Now if I were to apply for a Diploma for either of these courses, I won't be able to afford the fees since I already have a Dip and I can't enjoy the Govt grant.</p>
              <p>If I were to consider taking those subjects as a Degree I don't have any portfolios even if I am accepted for an interview.</p>
              <p>So I decided to not give up and browse through and I saw that ITE Bishan is offering Higher NITEC in Visual Merchandising and that I can apply.</p>
              <p>Thing is, will they be able to accept my application even if I already have a Diploma? Does anyone know? Please help :)</p>
              <p>Thanks in advanced!</p>

              <p>Hi Jay1990, </p>
              <p>don't waste your time.  Not that I look down in ITE, but it is different caliber.  In my younger days, I had a mechanical diploma, and wish to study business degree, but I know nuts about business management, and took LCCI diploma, the people there were so low that the entire class only me interacting with the lecturer!  Where those students just want to finish fast and go home.  In less than 2 months, i quit and took up a degree, and have never look back.</p>
              <p>Take stock of your life, and see what really interest you.  Don't just study for the sake of study.  If possible, take the challenge to get out of Singapore.  Learn to see thing from other perspective, and wider your horizon. </p>
              <p>BTW, I am in my 40's, and doing my doctorate in north America.  I am also learning.   </p>

              <p>and the concept of education here is completely wrong, unlike in taiwan, education is mend to have a good upbringing, good civil and so call educated person, after that whatever career they wanted, they go and take the necessary courses and skills, like if you want to be an actress, go to the relevant acting insitute and so on.</p>
              <p>In here, every person mind, from parents to childrens to govt to the society at large, education means getting a better jobs and better paid, which is completely wrong. Education is mend to educate you to be a better, knowledgeable, able to think and do analysis and research, confdent and able to plan well. Education become stressful when one start to think that he/she wants to become a big shot and earn big bucks</p>

              <p>but in taiwan, as young as 12yo, you or your parent will decide on your liking and enrol you to the relevant knowledge and skill development, with a 3 month grace period, once you do not like it, you can opts out, every courses come with basic english, chinese and science, a must, but not a die die must pass one.  You will see more talent and able taiwanese in near future, last time they got all these high school which learn nothing but created lots of lovers, bfgf and relationship. Today, they revised the education system to concentrate on the needs of the country and make provision to educated it peoples to the right choice, unlike Singapore, that depend much on MNCs, taiwan, korea and japan create their own industries, the like of samsung, sony, HTC, acer, etc etc, which are large conglomerate, bigger than some of the western corporation, that prevent the relying of MNCs and foreigners.</p>
              <p>But sad to say that Singapore still stick on to their stringent straight education system, which end up studying alots, but few applicable to job.</p>
