            <div class='col-md body'>Good question, the many different advises coming from different AA contributors should not confused the topic starter(the person seeking advice).<br><br>Because the person who posted the agony is capable of self-thought and weighing the pros and the cons of each different advices. Eventually it is still up to the topic starter to determine which advice is appropriate for him/her to undertake.<br><br>Sometimes as an AA contributor, I wondered if some of the agonies are true or just some bogus make-up scenarios to twist our mind and heart.<br><br>I believe all the advices given here in AA sgForums are good advices given by people who had actually put in the effort to generate or relate real-life experiences or scenarios...for the sake of helping another soul out there and preventing them from experiencing the same hurt.<br><br>There're heaps of advices given to many different types of agonies...even the non-authentic ones. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> However, I must stress to people seeking advices here...that the contributors can only provide the insight or an alternative to solve the problem. The real problem is often hidden away deep in the realms of the mind. That's probably the most difficult part of it. However, being an AA contributor does has it's own satisfaction...having seen other people benefited/happy/rejoice over the resolving of their problems is the best reward of all and it really makes my day most of the time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The worst part of being an AA contributor is probably when some idiots tried to belittle on your advice by voicing out some irresponsible/brainless statments. I sincerely hope that they can bring their nonsense to somewhere else and to some other forums.<br><br>Well, everybody has it's own fair share of problems...and if anyone...I mean anyone tries to step on each other's effort/attempt to share their own personal experiences/advices/efforts to another unfortunate soul, that person will not be forgiven.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> Well...at least by me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>So I sincerely hope that those offenders will be plagued by heaps of unsolvable problems in their lives and may their very soul be shredded and pierced by sea of knifes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Oops...a little too evil~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>They know who they are...so I'm looking forward to their future pain.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to answer the first 3 questions, we need to know<br>- the intention of the first post ie validation/seeking opinion/etc<br>- their afterthoughts after reading the responses<br>- their reasons for their actions thereafter<br>most of which would be best answered by the individual in question and not by second guessing.<br><br><blockquote> HOW WILL giving similiar advices from different people help too? </blockquote>if we assume that the person doing the asking has never been in a specific situation (might have decided on) but is not sure of the next course of action.<br><br>one aspect of getting similar advice from different people helps in "safety in numbers", many people saying the same thing must be right kind of mentality.<br>while it could give the person sufficient confidence on what to do next, it does not necessarily help the situation/person.<br><br><blockquote> Will they be at peace and hence affect them to make their decisions? </blockquote>i think a large extent depends on how the advice is given<br>for example a person described a a series of positive events and is thinking if he/she should ask for a date.<br>a contributer proposed that one should do a follow up.<br>another simply says that he usually knows within 5 to 10 minutes of talking to know whether he should ask her out for dinner or not.<br><br>the second response is more likely to force the poster to examine more closely at his own siutation and his own needs<br>why 5 minutes? what does he look for? what does he do to make a decision in such short time?<br>the latter not only provokes introspection, but also hints at how personal the decision can be to an individual.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Having different advices may confuse the person but may also open him to things that he have not taken notice until now...<br><br>Having all same advices may help him to decide, but the possibility of him becoming bias in some sense and not seeing the whole picture is there.<br><br>Even when a person is seeking advice, s/he has the ability to think through the advices presented to him and come out with his/her won decision eventually. If not, then its better that they don't seek advices or they will come rambling to you saying, "see lah, told me to do this do that..."<br><br>Like what some others pointed out, there are some who already have some idea of what to do, but would like support from others to be more confident abt their decision.<br><br>There are also some who are here to seek advice as they are lost at what to do. How they use the advicee given is up to them. Advisors can only advise, the usage depends on the person themselves.<br><br>Some others only needs a listening ear and not advices...<br><br>There are also those that would only want to listen to words they wanted to hear.
