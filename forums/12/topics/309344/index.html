              <p>Hi people,</p>
              <p>I have realised that i have suffered from mild depression recently.</p>
              <p>This are some of the symptoms</p>
              <p><em>Because this is only the mild form of the disorder, the symptoms are not very severe. Sufferer may carry on with their normal lives, only appearing low in spirits and possibly less sharp in their thinking or in their interest. They may stop doing things they do not actually have to do, but will often continue with the essentials, such as going to work or carring for the family. </em></p>
              <p><em>However, they will tend not to be as conscientious about these things as previously, or will become upset because they feel they are not coping as well as they should because they feel too tired.</em></p>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">feeling worthless, helpless or hopeless,</span> </li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">sleeping more or less than usual,</span> </li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">eating more or less than usual,</span> </li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">having difficulty concentrating or making decisions,</span> </li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">loss of interest in taking part in activities,</span> </li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">decreased sex drive,</span> </li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">avoiding other people,</span> </li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">overwhelming feelings of sadness or grief,</span> </li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">feeling unreasonably guilty,</span> </li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">loss of energy, feeling very tired,</span> </li>
              <li><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Verdana;">thoughts of death or suicide.</span> </li>
              <p>And this explain why i become tired easily. Why i have lost motivation in my studies and end up screwing my grades, my social and love life. Some of my friends do not understand the reason why i'm so easily tired. I have became withdrawn from many things, avoiding people and situation. Neither was i clear with my low ebb of energy level.</p>
              <p>I have been in low spirit for years.. trying to deal with it. I thought i was normal and i do not know i was depressed mildly. I know i need to seek help but i can't help but feel sad that my life is pretty up screwed now.</p>

              <p>Who diagnosed you with mild depression?</p>
              <p>These symptoms could very well be some one dieting and is malnourished. Diabetic, hypertension, renal failure, etc, it is better to have a professional assessment. Doctors would arrive at the proper prognosis by the process of elimination.</p>

Dont let your nose be led by this depression. Use your  determination and willpower to fight it. Only when you have been ' abused ' or tired of it , then you will want to get rid of it. You know that this is not some physical illness , so go to a polyclinic and get referral to visit a psychiatrist.</p></div>
