              I cant sit and watch. Now, i've read the post as well as some comments by other Sgforumers. First of all, i feel your pain. But can we look at this from another point of view? I think that this is a huge problem that high, valued teenage guys in singapore face right now. We want to find some girl and give her some love but they're all not virgins!!!!
              
              *crowd moans*
              
              Call me fake, but i think high valued guys should lose their virginity to high valued girls. Its just that everytime we see a pretty, sexy, hot, fun, bubbly, character-great chick, there's like 90% chance of her not being a virgin by the time we know of her briliance. And the percentage is getting higher even as i'm typing this post.
              
              Well, what's done cant be undone, so dont feel too sad about this. (hey, at least you got wont die a virgin now) But please, for the love of God, Jesus and Jose Mourinho, please ask your virgin girl friends to choose their sex partners wisely. If they ever want to lose it, make sure they lose it to a high valued guy can? The last thing we need is to hear about a high valued girl losing her virginity to some skinny jeans wearing, small dick weak ass loser.
              
              What's high valued? You'll know one when you see one...

              <p>Call me fake, but i think high valued guys should lose their
              virginity to high valued girls. Its just that everytime we see a
              pretty, sexy, hot, fun, bubbly, character-great chick, there’s like
              90% chance of her not being a virgin by the time we know of her
              briliance. And the percentage is getting higher even as i’m typing
              this post.</p>
              <p>Well, what’s done cant be undone, so dont feel too sad about
              this. (hey, at least you got wont die a virgin now) But please, for
              the love of God, Jesus and Jose Mourinho, please ask your virgin
              girl friends to choose their sex partners wisely. If they ever want
              to lose it, make sure they lose it to a high valued guy can? The
              last thing we need is to hear about a high valued girl losing her
              virginity to some skinny jeans wearing, small dick weak ass
              loser.</p>
              <p>What’s high valued? You’ll know one when you see one…</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I just broke up with my boyfriend yesterday after finding out a
              lie which really shocked me. He had lied to me several times and i
              forgave him time after time. The first lie had said was about his
              first intercourse with a girl.. As i tend to ask him abit about his
              past.. I know he had had 1 girlfriend before and He said he had
              slept with a senior from his college and that was the one and only
              intercourse he ever had in his life.</p>
              <p>I know some of you are already thinking why shoud i ask so much
              about his past and i do have a past too right. Before you are about
              to say anything, please, listen to the whole story. I had never
              lied to him about my past before.. how many guys i date..etc.</p>
              <p>After what he told me, i found out another lie of his. He told
              me he had broken up with his girlfriend last july and she begged
              him back. I read his online diary and found out that he was the one
              begging for her and he had been stalking her all these month. It's
              already the past, i don't wish to pursue it either but it's the
              trust issue. I trusted him times after times.. he only lied to me
              again and again.. I don't mind about whether he got dumped by his
              ex or his ex dumping him.. i just wish he would tell me the truth
              and not lie to me about everything right in my face! This isnt a
              big issue anyway..just a blog post discovered by me and i merely
              ask him about it.<br> <br> However, here is the 1st big lie that sets in. He said the senior
              college girl had actually bought him to the hotel and raped him
              there! and he mentioned that it took place 3 years ago.. It was
              then i began to find it fishy.. he is 22 years old this year. He
              was a freshman last year..3 years ago he was a mere highschool boy.
              I used these evidence to bombard him and he finally admitted it was
              last november. Well, he only lied about the time period so i
              thought it was alright but i was already finding myself to be
              standing in a very difficult position having to trust this guy
              again..I just can't trust him anymore after having him lying to me
              times after times.</p>
              <p>That's not the end of the story. What makes me want to break up
              with him yesterday?</p>
              <p>After he revealed his 2nd lie to me, he told me that next
              consecutive days, he had had the same nightmare repeating itself.
              He dreamt of me leaving him! and i thought it was funny and i just
              told him "if you do not have anymore things hiding from me, you
              wouldnt be dreaming of such things!" . This guy must had not had a
              clear conscious that is why he is dreaming of such things! My
              instinct was right.</p>
              <p>I felt strange for the past few days and i realised that this
              guy might be hiding a bigger thing from me which he finally
              admitted. Yes, he lost his first time to a woman but it wasnt the
              senior from his college but to a PROSTITUTE. Even if i were to be
              generous to forget about his past since he only did it once with a
              prostitute what makes you think he wouldnt frequent the brotel a
              2nd or a 3rd time and i find it extremely irresponsible of him to
              lie to me about such a big thing !</p>
              <p>I was a virgin when i met him and he took my virginity with no
              guilt or shame. Luckily he had protection on. But i think it is
              very irresponsible of him to hide such a thing from me! If he had
              sex with his girlfriend i wouldnt blame him..even if it was
              the imaginary college senior..anyone is more clean than the
              PROSTITUTE! what if he had no protection on at that time and he
              caught some STD or aids from the prostitute and pass it to me?</p>
              <p>I do not know whether he had protection on while he was doing
              with her..but i know that he had protection when he did it with me.
              I felt really hurt and awful right now.. I was a virgin and i
              thought i had lost it to someone i truly love..BUT it was only
              yesterday that i found out the person i had truly loved all along
              had actually been a BIG liar and not only that he was an
              irresponsible person.Before even taking the virginity of an 18 year
              old away, even if he is too shy to admit he slept with a
              prostitute, if he still have a living conscience, the least he can
              do is to not have any intercourse with me!  This is so
              dreadful. People, i really need advice now.. If you were to come
              here to say anything provoking or spiteful please keep it to
              yourself. I just got hurt and what i need is advice and comfort
              right now.Thankyou.</p>
              <p>Have i done a wrong thing? if you would me would u forgive such
              acts?</p>
