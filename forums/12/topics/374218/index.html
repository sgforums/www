              <p>hi i couldnt help but notice the sitruation you are in.its nothing new,boyfriend had sex fantasies,too weak to even resist a girl from raping him,stalking some otherwomanetc etc etc.</p>
              <p>dump him and stop wasting your time and effort.if hecould be raped by girls then chances that guyswould have made him pregnant in the not too distant future!dump him and get a better boyfriend!</p>

              <p>hmm.. he took my virginity yes..but we didn't really "do it"<br>as im a virgin.. it is really difficult for him to do it for the first time..he just poked it in... and it slipped out and poked in.. it was painful so i told him to stop.. but i bleed abit and when i went to the toilet i bled more !!</p>
              <p>so you know.. i lost my virginity from that poking &gt;,&lt; <br>his liquid or fluid never come out cos we didnt even start doing yet :/</p>
              <p>and yes, i loved him..the times i had with him be it just a long stroll or just chatting with him made me happy.. he had never done anything disappointing when i was with him..</p>
              <p>It's his past and his lies about his past that really frightens me. i don't think i can be with him again.yes..he is a jerk.. but whatever it is..if i be with him again, my risk of catching STD from him is HIGH. i don't want risk my life.i rather be lesbian or single for the rest of my life hahaha.</p>

              <p>You did the right thing to dump him.</p>
              <p>Now do stop agonising about it and go snip his kuku bird off.</p>
              <p>Or at least do what the woman in some video did.  Wear your spike-ist stillettos to meet him, then proceed to slam your stilettos into his kukubird area as hard and as often as you can.</p>
              <p>You can also do it one shot, dont take off your stiletto and make sure your heel end connects with his balls in one hard puncture.</p>

              <p>You used protection, so (hopefully) you're in the clear.  Apart from that, nothing of any particular consequence has actually taken place.  Virginity's overrated and now that you know he's a lying bastard you've dropped him.</p>
              <p>It's time to move on.  Life's too short to worry about things that have no long-term implications.</p>

              <p>Your one and only important thing now.  Is to keep up regular exercise, keep yourself fit and trim.  Make sure your education level is enough to put him to shame.  Make sure your future is bright and wonderful.</p>
              <p>And make sure the next guy who lies to you, lay bellydown with his hands outstretch to try to reach you in the wake of your dust you kick up when you drives or marathon jog away from him.</p>
