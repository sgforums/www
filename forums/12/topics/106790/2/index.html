            <div class='col-md body'>Personally, I'm the kind of person who cannot tolerate my bf contacting his exes. But then again, it all depends on the depth of love for him. My bf and I always quarrels over his ex. She has been calling him, sms-ing him and I don't even know whether they'd met up behind my back. You all may say that I don't have trust in him. But I believe that a gal would never be so persistent for a year even when she knows that he's with me now, unless he gave her the impression that they're still possible!<br><br>She would call him in the wee hours of the night (e.g 3am or 4am) just to ask what is he doing or how is he. On several occasions, I was so flared up till I snatch the phone and asked what she want. She just apologised profusely and hung up. On another occasion, (also around 3am) when I picked up the call, she asked me who am I instead. When i revealed my name, she asked for my bf. But my bf doesn't want to answer her call. So, she hung up the phone. I mean, I understand there are such b|tches who don't know how to be considerate. But on the other hand, if the guy never gives any false impression, would the gal still continue to be a b|tch?<br><br>As for flirting with other gals, he addresses those gals as "Gal" when he reply to their sms. I am helpless about that because that is a general address. Maybe he is really good in covering up for himself when he goes out. So far, I've not known of his any affairs outside. Back then, when you love someone too much, you tend to be ignorant of his whatever doings outside. That is not very healthy. I'm still trying to help myself to wake up...</div>

But then again, it all depends on the depth of love for him. My bf and I always quarrels over his ex. She has been calling him, sms-ing him and I don't even know whether they'd met up behind my back. You all may say that I don't have trust in him. But I believe that a gal would never be so persistent for a year even when she knows that he's with me now, unless he gave her the impression that they're still possible!<br><br>She would call him in the wee hours of the night (e.g 3am or 4am) just to ask what is he doing or how is he. On several occasions, I was so flared up till I snatch the phone and asked what she want. She just apologised profusely and hung up. On another occasion, (also around 3am) when I picked up the call, she asked me who am I instead. When i revealed my name, she asked for my bf. But my bf doesn't want to answer her call. So, she hung up the phone. I mean, I understand there are such b|tches who don't know how to be considerate. <span style="color: blue;">But on the other hand, if the guy never gives any false impression, would the gal still continue to be a b|tch? </span><br><br>In some cases. Yes.<br><br><strong><br>As for flirting with other gals, he addresses those gals as "Gal" when he reply to their sms. I am helpless about that because that is a general address. Maybe he is really good in covering up for himself when he goes out. So far, I've not known of his any affairs outside. Back then, <span style="color: darkblue;">when you love someone too much, you tend to be ignorant of his whatever doings outside. That is not very healthy. I'm still trying to help myself to wake up...  </span></strong></div></blockquote><strong>Well... Sometimes being overly sensitive is not healthy too...?</strong></div>
