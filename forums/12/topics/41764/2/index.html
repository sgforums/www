The king liked one of his followers<br>very much because he was very wise and always gave very useful<br>advice. Therefore the king took him along wherever he went.<br>One day, the king was bitten by a dog, the finger was injured and<br>the wound was getting worse. He asked the follower if that was a bad<br>sign. The follower said, 'Good or bad, hard to say'. In the end, the<br>finger of the king was too bad that had to be cut. The king asked the<br>follower again if that was a bad sign. Again, the follower gave the<br>same<br>answer, 'Good or bad, hard to say'. The king became very angry and sent<br>the follower to prison.<br><br>One day, the king went hunting in the jungle. He got excited when<br>he was on the chase of a deer. Deeper and deeper he went inside the<br>jungle. In the end he found himself lost in the jungle. To make thing<br>worse,<br>he got captured by the native people lived inside the jungle. They<br>wanted<br>to sacrifice him to their god. But when they noticed that the king<br>had one finger short, they released him immediately as he was not a<br>perfect man anymore and not suitable for sacriface.<br><br>The king managed to get back to his palace after all. And he<br>finally understood the follower's wise quote, 'Good or bad, hard to<br>say'.<br>If he hadn't lost one finger, he could have been killed by the native<br>people.<br><br>He ordered to release the follower, and apologized to him. But to<br>the king amaze, the follower was not mad at him at all. Instead, the<br>follower said, 'It wasn't a bad thing that you locked me up.' Why?<br>Because if the king hadn't locked the follower up, he would have<br>brought the follower along to the jungle. If the native found that the<br>king was not suitable, they would have used the follower. Again, the<br>quote<br><br>'Good or bad, hard to say' stands.<br>The moral of the story is that everything that happens in this<br>world, there is no absolute good or bad. Sometimes good things turned<br>out<br>to be bad things eventually, while bad things become a gain.<br><br>Whatever good things that happen to you, enjoy it, but don't have<br>to hold too tight to it, treat it as a surprise in your life.<br>Whatever bad things that happen to you, don't have to feel too sad or<br>dispair<br>in the end, it might not be a total bad thing after all. If one can<br>understand this, he or she will find life much easier.<br><br>knowing these ppl = good or bad??? u decide....</div>
