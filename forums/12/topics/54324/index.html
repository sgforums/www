            <div class='col-md body'>I have a bf of nine months... During this 9 months.. 2 months are overseas and he waited... i know he surfed porn and i didn't mind as its very normal.. even bought few vcds for him.. I fly around frequently and it adds up to like half of the month every month. Just today, i saw an email accidentally from his inbox... I admit that it was wrong for intruding his privacy... (Put that aside 1st) but i saw this email and i wanna know what he was thinking when he send this email to a gal from an adult friend making website. This website are ppl who r interested to find erotic frenz or sexmates to place their profile etc..<br>It says :<br>"hi... 20(age) here. saw ur posting on blah blah blah.....curious abt wat kind of guy u are looking for... grateful if u cld attach a pic too...."<br>During the early stages of our relationship.. i was very insecured but he shows signs that he really care for me. In order to talk to me for a longer time when i'm overseas, he bought me a pocket pc so that we can chat online in the hotel... I was finally convinced that he really love me and know this.... am i getting a little paranoid? Am i making a hil out of a mole?.... or is this a sign that he might be astray? What was he thinking abt when he send this email to that person? Can u guys tell me? Please.. thanks you</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's good that you accepted his high sexuality drive, <span style="font-style: italic;">(afterall everyone has their fair share of it, just how well controlled and disciplined one is, that's all)</span> but as to be encouraging him further by buying him vcds, im not so sure about it. Having an open mind is good, but think of the consequences it will lead it....<br><br>Every action results in equal or opposite reaction... so here's the opposite reaction from your action of buying vcds for him. You're not here for him, he needs to satisfy his lust. What to do next? He don't like to 'D.I.Y.', so he's finding someone who's into similar passion... Get it?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Besides I dont see if you have anything to get worried about if it's an overseas site you're talking about. Singapore localised porno sites are by far few, unless I'm wrong... Just getting his fair share of thrill and excitment when you're not around.<br><br>By the way, how I see it as is that, you provided him the chance to be lad astray if he really is. Imagine this 'My gf bought me vcds to watch, but she's not around... damn, do I do it myself or what?', 'Heck! Let's try and see if someone is willing to do it for me.. anyway no one knows.'<br><br>Then the next question I want to ask you is this, 'Are you sure it's an accident when you clicked on his email?' Nothing is ever done on accident... if you know it's an accidental process, why carry on to read his mail knowing you're invading his privacy? Subconsciously, you want to know what he's been doing while you're not around, you want to see the kind of mails he's been receiving during your absence, thus you proceeded to read his mails. In other words, you simply don't quite trust him, do you? If you trust him, you won't have done what you did.<br><br>Think about it, what is it that you guys are together? Becoz you've got your needs and it can be satisfied by your guy? Or you guys are together bcoz it's really L.O.V.E. you're talking about.<br><br>Pardon my frankness... just my 2 cents worth.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by shirurinu:</div><div class="quote_body">I have a bf of nine months...
