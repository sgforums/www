            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Auntie Agony and Uncle Agony, xiao di desperately needs all ur professional advice here... OK i know a girl 4 mths ago, she's really my dream girl tat i think she should be in the same rank as those angel up on the sky.. We have feelings for each other as tat what she told me but the problem is she still can't really get over her ex(broke off 5 mths ago bcoz of 2 timing her) She told me she needs some time, she said she dun love him anymore its only left with the pain in her heart. BUT out of the sudden she told me she dun wanna waste my time and not to wait for her anymore as in the very begining i told her i'm willing to wait for her to be ready for another relationship. I respect her decision although in my heart i still want to wait.(i'm in my late 20s and she's 4 years younger than me) She treats me very differently from then. Very cold and heartless i would say (nearly a month) but i still refused to give up.Then for the past 2 weeks we r kind of back to normal again for not reason but without anyone of us mentioning abt the past. We talked on the phone for 2 to 3 hours a day. She will feel jealous when i went out or talk on the phone with other girls etc... Seriously i really dun know what she's thinking right now. I'm afraid if i ask her how she feels abt me again, i might lose her once again.. Haiz.. she juz called me again right after she wake up.. It might be a very simple question to u ppl up there tat u might mock at me but i'm right in the picture now hence i'm really very confused, hope i dun confused u ppl too... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  Thanks for all of ur advice from the bottom of my heart... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Then tell her that you din wanted to pressure her or anything and you know that when she is ready, she will tell you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The key element is 'Consistent advancement' and keeping the tension.<br><br>P.S: 'The longer you take to prepare your spell, the more potent it is.' - LWR - CloUdiSm'<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shes in pain, shes in confusion hell both of you are in confusion. Sounds like she doesn't know what she wants, does she. Wants you to stop waiting, but gets jealous when you talk to other girls. Now thats just terrible, maybe as she though on, in the way she feels she is not good enough for you. Its always a possibilty especially if they just broke off from a 'close' relationship (know what i mean). I think you should go for it, i mean how often is it that you find someone you really like right? I think you just have to let her know that no matter what you still like to give the relationship a shot.<br><br>This is by no means pofessional advice, i just hope you would be able to slove your problem soon.

Trust is like a promise - as long as you don't say anything (provided it is not morally wrong to do so) - it doesn't mean anything. But however when you did mention things that you could do well, by not mentioning - you lose this relative advantage you are at - Advantage ground.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Your ex wants to patch back with you - think she has little chance because you are interested in this girl now. Then during your conversation, since you have told her about your ex and stuff, try to draw the topic towards this issue and make comments like, 'I don't think I will go back to her anymore.'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>She will ask why  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Tell her, people has to move on and its emotionally tiring to be stagnant and holding onto the past.

Maybe its bcoz u r not in my position. First thing is somehow rather i will be giving her more stress as she had a lot of it in her work, can't bear to do tat. Moreover i dun think she will take forever to forget her ex, i believe in good things need more effort and time to attain hence i dun mind the wait. Can see that she's still not ready yet, i dun want a half-hearted relationship either...  I'm very contended with the attention and treatment she gave it to me right now.. Perhaps this is my retribution for the things i have done when i was young... Well, i will definitely ask her when i feel that she's ready.... Last but not least i wish u all the best in ur love life...</div>
