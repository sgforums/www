Maybe its bcoz u r not in my position. First thing is somehow rather i will be giving her more stress as she had a lot of it in her work, can't bear to do tat. Moreover i dun think she will take forever to forget her ex, i believe in good things need more effort and time to attain hence i dun mind the wait. Can see that she's still not ready yet, i dun want a half-hearted relationship either...  I'm very contended with the attention and treatment she gave it to me right now.. Perhaps this is my retribution for the things i have done when i was young... Well, i will definitely ask her when i feel that she's ready.... Last but not least i wish u all the best in ur love life...</div></blockquote>simply put, if you never ask her, she'll never be sure if you're willing to be her bf. maybe you don't have to ask her to be your gf, just say that as long as she's ready, you're more than wiling to be her bf.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Tequila,<br><br>When you mentioned that she gets jealous easily whenever you go out with other girls or even talk with someone else, it shows that she has an interest in you be it small or large. No Man can understand exactly what a girl is thinking so let us just assume as accurate as possible. In my opinion, she told you she could not get over her ex is just a smokescreen to test if you would still wait for her or not but make sure, you dun just pounce on her and ask her to be urs immediately We guys should never be any girl's rebound guy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>And please my brother, dun get insecure easily that you will lose her.  wish I could tell there was a cure for insecurity but there isn't. That doesn't mean you can't get over it though. You just have to learn to be comfortable with yourself and don't worry so much about what other people think. Don't compare yourself to other people. You're your own person so why try to measure up to someone else's standard?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The true key to overcoming insecurity is to know yourself. You have to do some real soul-searching and find out who YOU are before you can have a successful relationship with someone else. And once you know yourself, you'll be more comfortable with who you are, and you'll feel more secure.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>So I suggest that you back off for a bit. She knows you're interested so just work on being a friend and being yourself around her .You have to realize that some things aren't meant to be. Just giver her some time and the keyword her is time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I think everyone goes through emotional disasters, it's a part of life, and we come out stronger in the end, well most of us at least. I won't get into that though.Well, since you know your friend's situation about the relationship and everything else, I would just kick back and go for the ride. If your friend wanted anything more out of the relationship she'd show it, like maybe say yes to your date suggestions and even if you only ask her as a friend, I'm sure there are always hidden messages being thrown back and forth especially if you like her <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> .You should just continue to be there for her, improve those chances of getting asked out and even ask her out every once in a while. If you ever get into a deeper relationship with her, you can tell her how you feel now. I think patience will do you good, meanwhile continue to show that you care.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>"<strong><span style="color: red;">There's a story about a man who lost a his key inside his dark house. He went outside under the street light where it was brighter, to look for it. He was looking and looking but he could never find it. The reason was because this key wasn't under the streetlight where he could see everything but it was inside his dark scary house where he never bothered to look."</span></strong><br><br>I wish you the best. Cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>
