Everytime when we go out, I wanted so much to tell him how I feel and how would very much know how he feels too, but it's very hard to say out loud.<br><br>We have been going out a few times so far. He is a relatively shy and passive guy. Sometimes, I am tempted to ask him when I chatted with him on msn but I feel that it is not sincere enough, yet it's the easiest way to tell him.<br><br>How do I know a guy, especially a shy guy, if he likes me?<br><br>Cheers,<br>Shizuka</div></blockquote>If you like him, give him strength to evade his shyness, guide him into your arms, there are alots of blur blur boys out there that do not know how to tackle gals, or get shaken all over when a gal just smile at them, they are just dumbfolded by our expression at times, but cute lah.<br><br>Some of the guys also do not know how to fashion themselves, wear like ah beng and ah seng, slowly as their gf, we must nurture them to be a man, but then some of them are so stuck up with their ego and pride that they thought listen to a gal is like mama boys.<br><br>Buy him a something like a t shirt or other gift with the word "love you" will do.<br>If he still cannot get it, then he must be above sotong mentality, maybe cuttlefish liao, but i like such shy guy, at least we can control them.</div>
