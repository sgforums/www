            <div class='col-md body'>Double timing is never a good time. Even if you do not have feelings for your current gf, it is your responsibility to end your relationship with her before even trying to start a new. Actually, do you really want to break up with your gf in the first place. If you manage to date this "new" gal, and THEN you break with your gf, what will you do if you regret your decision? Break with the "new" gal and go back? Advice : NEVER DOUBLE TIME. Even if you break up, don't get into a new relation too soon.<br><br>Anyway, from what I read, you are not actually asking advice but rather someone to agree with you that you should just start this new relationship. Do really think about it serious and not just let your heart lead you.</div>

Referring to the post you've made right after this one... Don't think too much about things especially after a sound decision has been made... Usually in this world, there's no such thing as a 'perfect solution'... There're bound to be 'loop holes' to the decision you make, here and there... The more you think of how it COULD have been if you made the other choices, you more you might regret your current choice... The fact is you'll never know if things would have been worse if you choose to go the other path(s).... The possibility is quite endless usually, so quit wasting your time on such...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
