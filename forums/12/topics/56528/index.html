Ok, even if it's for sake of meetup after so long didn't contact....I guess one would usually not meetup for the second time. When we chat with each other, I would have the feeling of gf n bf, cox sometimes when we talk, the distance quite close. It's not that I'm seeking a new direction but...why i would get that feel?<br><br>Whether is it worth, I'm not sure cox no one will know...but I do know that if I proceed at least I try.<br><br>Ok..if the suituations becomes like this.....<br>1) I'm single but she's attached<br>2) We're both single<br>3) We're both single but she and I have that bit of interest towards<br>each other<br>4) I made it known to her even though she's attached but no sure<br>whether she have that interest in me too<br><br>what will become of it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just my 5cents worth....<br><br>i hope ur "excitement" with this old flame of urs will be overcomed by ur responsibility towards ur current gf eventually.As the saying goes, "The grass is always greener on the other side". But did u look carefully enough at the patch of grass u have been stepping on for the past few years,sticking through rain and shine with you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Sometimes...humans are like that.they always want to get something which is impossible or detrimental to oneself just for the sake of getting it.The important question u should ask urself is...Is it worth it? Only u urself can answer that.<br><br>To be truthful,i also thought of how sweet and nice it would feel if i could contact this particular girl i liked a few years back.everyone does...so we do not blame u.The temptation is even greater if the other party gives some positive signals...however,i told myself to resist tempting myself by not contacting her.thats the only thing i can do to protect myself and my gf.<br><br>Since u are already attached and she already has a bf.I would advise u to remain as friends for the time being.It would not be too late to make any decision later on rite? do not be selfish,u are going to make a decision that is not only going to affect 3 person, but 4.hope u will find true happiness.my parting words to u is......<br><br>Is it worth it?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

Your views are great and really make a good guidance for me. U see, I always believe it takes two hands to clap. When I asked her out, it was a positive reply.

Remember all these are your impression and preception. What makes you so sure it is something significiant for her as well? Distance closed up and your heart tremble with overflowing emotions - same for her as well? Maybe not 100% applicable. She definitely feel comfortable with you, but that does not equate to love. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Meeting up after long recesses of non-existence contact doesn't mean anything as well.<br><br>Your situation 1 to 4 are redundant. Notice that from case 1 to 4 - you mentioned <strong>nothing</strong> about you being attached - your subconscious avoid the fact that you have a gf (in reality) and must be accountability to her. I said before in my prior post - all is fair in love and war, but before one new chapter open, the other must close. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> However if you are single, she got or no bf, got or no interest, whatsoever doesn't matter.<br><br>P.S: Living on temporary illusion to decide upon important decision is dangerous and unwise - If choice made badly, You are likely to regret or at least cross a couple of karmic hurdle before you can walk on smooth love road again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
