            <div class='col-md body'>How would u know it wont help till u tried it??<br><br>The fact that u can acknowledge this problem u are already facing is a good start. However you should take it one step futher and seek professional help. Its going to be hard to approach them and you WILL feel ashamed of yourself and guilty of the fact that what you are doing is wrong but NO ONE CAN HELP YOU IF YOU ARNT WILLING TO HELP YOURSELF FIRST.<br><br>None of us here can give you any advise other than seeking professinal help cause we dont fully understand what you are going thru ( unless we've been thru that). There are others out there with the same situation as you dont feel that your problem is so strange that there is no one to help you cause u know thats not true... just need the courage to face up to your problem</div>

I am still in secondary school and since the age of 14 I have always had a fetish for other guys of my age. You might say that I am a homosexual. But I realised because of this problem that I have, I feel less confident with other normal guys. I feel insecure. It's good that you know that this is a problem, but you really must tell yourself that the change is worth it. No point going for counselling and all those expensive help because it all lies with you.<br><br>Now ask yourself, can you change?<br><br>If your answer is yes, I wish you all the best.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> And i'm sure those in this forum are willing to help you too!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, love yourself.<br><br>Secondly, try not to masturbate for a while. Each time you think of this kind of thoughts, try to occupy yourself with other things. If you come back from somewhere to find you have the whole house to yourself, an easy trap for you to crossdress again, turn around, walk out the door. Go to McDonald's or Starbucks and get your mind off your urges. Get a hobby, maybe do some exercise...build up your muscles!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>You can do it!</div>
