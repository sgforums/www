              <p>abby,</p>
              <p>He wants a baby badly, because that's how he can trap you. Sadly, you see it as sign of love.</p>
              <p>You
                               seem desperately wanting his love, so he is able to control you by 
                              withholding love. Feeding you scraps whenever he feels like it, yet you 
                              lap it up like a hungry puppy, and beg for more.</p>
              <p>When you no longer desire his approval,<strong> you shall be emotionally free</strong>. He cannot hurt you anymore when you don't care for his love.</p>
              <p>You are a mother now, focus your priority on your <strong>child</strong>, for he/she is the only one in this world capable of giving you UNCONDITIONAL love.</p>
              <p>Let your husband rot.</p>
              <p>Draw strength from your family living with you. As long as they are there, he will not dare treat you worst.</p>
              <p>Your husband bully you because he can, it's not love. Every time you shed a tear for him, he is embolden.</p>
              <p>Your husband is but a coward, to treat you badly when you are most VULNERABLE.</p>
              <p>Your
                               child will grow up to accept abuse as normal, and in turn allow 
                              themselves  and/or their own partner to be treated this way.. the 
                              vicious cycle will continue into your next generation.</p>
              <p>Get a police report every time he lays his abusive hands on you.</p>
              <p>Better a broken family than an abusive one.</p>
              <p>Be strong. Have courage to stand up to his bullying ways, and you will be victim no more.</p>

              <p>abby, it seems like you're in a really difficult position. It's definitely not easy being you, but do this, be positive and continue to be strong. Here are some things that you may want to consider...</p>
              <p>1) A person cannot survive without money. If he refuse to work, then do NOT give him money. Secretly stash away something for yourself and the child. Stop cooking once a while and let him go hungry. Let's see how long he can last.</p>
              <p>2) Understand this (there are scientific evidence backing this reasoning out so if you want proof, go google). If you're hanging out with people with bad mood, you will be influenced and your mood will drop. If you're hanging with happy lively people, similarly your mood will be positively affected, you will be happier. Saying this, it's good for you to start having some social life with positive friends if your husband continues to be a bad influence on your life, as in causing unhappiness. Then again, you might be able to start putting a happy positive thinking attitude in the hope that he will be positively influenced, but if it doesn't work, then just concentrate on your own life. Look, I do not condone divorce but in some cases, this can be the solution.</p>
              <p>3) I think it's important for couples to find a suitable day, when both are feeling ok (or in a good mood), and start a heart to heart discussion about the issues on hand. Both have to agree as a team and commit towards solutions for the problems on hand. Some mistakes couples make is when they come to discussion, they usually play the blame game. This is NO time for blaming. This is the time for both to take responsibilities for their own lives and strive towards a common goal.</p>
              <p>4) Some mistakes people make is jumping to assumptions. Is there maybe some chance that what you think may be wrong? For example, he may be looking for a job but he couldn't get an interview yet? Or maybe he really loves you but he's so stressed and depressed over his current situation and he doesn't know how to express it? Guys and girls think differently. For example, when a guy is sad, he won't cry in front of you. He will hide his feelings and want to be alone (perhaps the real reason why he don't want to sleep with you). The fact that he suggests moving to JB hints at the fact of a quick solution to solving the problems. Usually when guys are stressed out, they tend to find a quick fix instead of a long term solution, so really maybe he's depressed but he didn't want to show. I mean guys are like that, they don't reveal their true feelings.</p>
              <p>5) This is the most important advice that I can ever give to you. A man who beat or physically abuse a lady is not a man, he's a coward monster, no matter what the reason. So my suggestion to you is that if he hurts you physically, it's time to move on. While you're still young, you can still find a nice guy who will take care of you and give you monthly allowances to spend on necessities. It is damn stupid to keep wasting your life and then regret when you're like 60 years old, by then you're running out of time and choices.</p>
              <p>And finally, be strong and be positive. Every problem will pass eventually, you just need to endure and overcome it.</p>

              <p>Dear TS,</p>
              <p>You must learn the meaning of detachement, learn to detach from the illusion of life, as we move along in life, we start to make ourselve attached to many things, from love to greed to carving. We had alway wanted a normal life, and that itself is a carving, a carving for normal life, and that carving turns to attachment. This in turn create an illusion in you that you hv a normal happy family life, and once attached, you do not know how to detach when things do not go so normal as you dream to be, therefore, you are still living into believing that things are normal, but is it not, it is getting worst by the days. We gals tends to have a soft spot that men love to exploit by making you attached to that spot of weakness, be strong, learn to detach it. I myself adore and admire women who control their husbands, but few do that, most are like you, weak and soft, which is why our women charter is set up for. Seek to be yourself, find back yourself, you are actually a single, nice, happy woman, but why become like this, because you are attached to something that you yourself do not want to let go, just let go, and you will see life better</p>

              <p>JB a lot of conveniences. Mebbe yer husband like vice bcause I used to go to the nightclubs there for cheap bar gals from Indon, Viet and PRC. In addition JB grocery is very cheap. Can live in house for once. Golf is oso very cheap in JB as with petrol. Police in JB not very gud mebbe tat is why he want to go there, a lot of domestic violence go unreported in Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Haiz, useless husband. His job is to bring food to the table but instead he like to play computer game. Wat is he? Ten year old? But u neva indicate why he dun want to find a job. He got criminal record? He is unqualified?</p>
              <p>Anyway, u're rite, baby shld grow up wif better environment. Rite now u got two baby, yer baby n yer husband. The latter one shld be discarded. Mebbe u're better off on yer own. But then again, u miss out a lot more details, so I dunno half of the story. Furthermore, we're listening yer side of the story.</p>

              me<br> begging and crying. Should this marriage be saved? I don't
              know...<br> It just hurts me so bad right now. When I was pregnant, he hit me
              for not wanting to accompany his mum. I was too tired, I
              needed<br> to rest. When I was in my confinement, he hit me again for reasons
              I can't even remember.<br> Should I suffer in silence for my marriage. So that my baby would
              not grow up in a broken family?<br></div>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> I can empathize with your situation; it's not easy having to manage a
               seemingly loveless relationship, two young children, financial woes and
               family violence all in one single package.</p>
              <p>I am actually worried about your safety - family violence is not tolerated under any circumstances. </p>
              <p>As
               you type, I was just wondering when is the turning point in your 
              marriage since you mentioned that the both of you wanted a baby so badly
               in the past. Or was it a case of a wrong perceived expectation or 
              desire? You also mentioned about forcing him to sleep with you? Seemed 
              like the relationship has notably been damaged and perhaps you could 
              share what could have caused this.</p>
              <p>P.S: You don't have to 
              suffer in silence; depending on where you stay, you can approach the 
              nearest family service centre for assistance. If you don't know where to
               go, PM me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>To change him words are not enough, change with your behaviour and that is a message in itself as to what you u are willing to put up with or not.  Of course, it presupposes love and being kind to oneself first. If the latter is absent, it will be a game of who is rite/wrong and so on so forth.</p>
              <p>Being a responsible mother and human being to yourself should precede anything like a divorce or another man.</p>
