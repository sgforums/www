This guy asked for my contact number thru my staff, but why didnt he constantly sms me ??? i mean he just sms a few n then stopped. Does it mean he is not interested or he just take my number for record keeping?<br><br>2. I have a liking of a guy in my night class. we xchange eye contacts alot. The prob here is, i guess he is afraid to talk to me, cos my boss is sitting beside me during the class. But he doesnt know thats my boss, not my bf.<br>I am also very reserved to talk to him... if then, how can we progress from such situation ?</div></blockquote>lol i could very well be that guy who asked u your no.<br>ok i've got ur no, i sms and the reply was luke warm, so i couldn't and dunno wat to say to u anymore, if you could just show a little initiative and sms first for at least 1 time i would be happy to know that u don't mind chatting wif me at all, makes sense?<br>u see, to me good conversation is 2 ways. can't expect the guys to talk all the time rite? i personally would feel that i'm an irritating person talking to someone who doesn't response to wat u talk.<br><br>ps i'm not that guy u gave the no to, i was not in any classes at all. it's just that i'm trying to help u "decode" the guy from my real life experience <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) after a few sms, he find that you are not his type.<br><br>2) Try to be alone in front of him like maybe shake your boss off for a while when he is around. If he really interested, he would initiate, else you go ahead and talk to him first lor. like ask for notes or something... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
