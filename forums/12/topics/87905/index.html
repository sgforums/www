She is not even your girlfriend yet and is already starting to violate your freedom.<br><br>Anyway, do what you think will make you happier. She is not your girlfriend and you don't have to worry about her feelings if you choose to ignore/avoid  her.<br><br>And by the way, don't go and anyhow hold people's hand and hug them even if they allow you to do so. If you don't like her, don't do it. Make up your mind and tell her what you feel and get it over with. In that way, even if she has to feel hurt by you...the damage will be minimum.<br></div>

All so self-rightous one.<br><br>I say it is no harm continuing the relatioship if you are not sure. Give yourself and others a chance. But don't promise anything or ever go into sexual relatioship. You don't want to hurt anyone.<br><br>If necessary, make it clear to the other party that you are unsure and see how she takes it. This way, if things don't work out, she will not be hurted. And if she decides to leave you when you say you are not sure, then she is just probably trying to grab a person, any person.<br><br>The decision to be together should be a decision made by both parties. And one should not rush into a relationship. Get to know each other better. Know what you like and dislike about that person. And decide if you can live with those dislike for the rest of your life.<br><br>Don't wait for the perfect person. Too many people are doing that. They either end up single all their life or end up marrying someone who appear to be perfect only to find out all the flaws later.</div>

Your impression begins FROM imagination cum fantasy and when you do meet her - you don't automatically fall for the real her. In fact, some portion of this fantasy lingers and you THINK that you truely like the person. (However, if she turn out to be something extremely different from your mental expectation, I truely doubt you would fall for her even if she has the same personality as one you fall for online - this is not being superficial, rather psychologically, if you even plan to advance such relationship further before the meet up, the barrier from the mind will hinder you greatly)<br><br>And when you do know the real her, reality will alter your online impression and accumulates negative points because we are all not perfect in some ways or another.<br><br>Seriously, don't dream of having a relationship with someone virtually first <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before you thought of being a friend</span>. The mind usually lags and couldn't process the speed your emotions runs.<br><br>Remain friends since she seemed unsuitable - you led her, therefore don't expect the best of both world solution now. If you have to do the explaination... do it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1.you got check with her if she wants to be attached at all or not?<br>maybe she also just want to have the type of 'couple' feeling with you<br>but don't want to be attached leh? cannot assume wor.<br><br>2. aiyah. girls when not familiar with the guy but find him attractive always 'pretend pretend' one lah. I dont know what's the problem why so many girls become 'delicate and weak' in the 'getting to know you' part of the relationship. Maybe when get to know her better liao, you realise actually she also like to eat a lot   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>3. Oh yeah. Though judging from her tell you dont eat this dont eat that - i think this girl already think you are her boyfriend. Good luck to you. she sounds like the type who'll nag you to death in order to show her affection.<br><br>5. So doesn't mean cannot carry on. YOu dont have special feelings for her now, doesn't mean later wont have. BUT i do agree you have to make things clear to her.<br><br>7. But chances are, women lah, will try harder to 'hold on' to you when you tell them you are 'not sure'. probably fastest way to get a woman to volunteer to have sex - emotional blackmail. Dastardly, but it works.<br><br>11. So, ultimately, the question is - how big an A********* do you want to be? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
