              <p>1. Be aware that life is never a bed of roses. There will ALWAYS be bad times and good times. What you are going through is only the bad times. It may hurt, it is painful, and is real. But take comfort that what you had gone through, many billions of peopleÂ had gone through as well throughout the course of human history. You are not alone or the only one in this world suffering this pain. Many million others shareÂ the same pain as you.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>The only difference between you and them is that they are attempting to survive it, to rise above such pains, as others had successfullyÂ done. But sadly, you choose the easy way out, with pills to destroy your own precious life. Your pain is real, but when you are done or even worse, dead, have you ever thoughtÂ of the pain of those who TRULY love you and and want you happy? These people are your family, your mother who carried you for nine months in her body, bearing the hardships as she prepared food and love for theÂ family. YourÂ father who worked hard, accepting scoldings and hurt in order to earn his money, so that he can afford things in life for you. Your brothers and sisters, if you have any. Your relatives and friends.</p>
              <p>Have you thought of the pain you feel now being inflicted on them, these people who love you, whom you should care more about then rubbish people who didnt care about you?</p>
              <p>You should be happy that they dump you now, and not later when the pain becomes more miserable if you are married and became a mother of your own.</p>
              <p>Take heart that there are others in the world who is waiting for you and will love you. This is a reality, ask those happily married,Â and will be a reality, but only if you are determine to live and work hard to find that good man waiting for you, as he is workingÂ hard to find you too, through hit and misses just you will be doing.Â </p>
