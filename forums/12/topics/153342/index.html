            <div class='col-md body'>thx for e replies..wld appreciate for more elaboration though.<br><br>was juz askin for a fren whos in tis situation (briefly narrated, apology for any confusion in sequence):<br><br>1.  Guy asks Gal out for 1st date.<br><br>2.  They go on 1st date and Guy brings Gal to restaurant, then a romantic beach walk &amp; tries to kiss Gal.<br><br>3.  Gal rejects Guy's advances (Gal is a friendly lady) and feels shocked about Guy's advances (too fast)<br><br>4.  Guy later apologies and promise not to do it again, and ask Gal for 2nd date immediately. Also starts calling &amp; smsing her frequently. They have some proposed biz partnership too, but not finalized yet.<br><br>5.  Gal &amp; Guy goes on few more dates, and acts like couple cos Guy always hold her hands wen they r out. Seldom discuss biz dealings. Gal always initiates the biz dealing discussion.<br><br>6.  Recently, Guy &amp; Gal started keeping a distance from each other after last very intimate phone call. Guy was then frequently calling her up from office.<br>Gal already told guy she would be leaving abroad in a yr's time, so low chance of sustaining a relationship.<br><br>7.  Gal nv intended to fall in love with Guy, cos career-minded at moment.<br>Guy sends lots of signal intending to hav a true relationshup.<br><br>8.  Gal for personal reason, cannot fulfil proposed biz partnership with guy, guy then suddenly pulls back. (True reason unknown, but gal suspects partly bcos she wants to strike e biz on her own, while guy keeps wanting to partner with her saying they can complement each other well, and he feels comfortable working with her.)<br><br>9.  Gal treats guy as normal fren now, and hopes to have an understanding on his intention. That simple.<br><br>Thanks in advance for any useful advice given.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
