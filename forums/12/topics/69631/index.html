            <div class='col-md body'>WEell, yilang_hq, I think you have your answer already if you acknowledge that you're not pushing enough to get into the game.<br><br>The unfortunate nature of things is that if you want something, you have to go out to get it.  Even more unfortunately, even if you do go out to get it, it may not work.  However,  it's not just going to come to you, so you don't really have much of an option of sitting around and waiting.<br><br>It's not about looks or money.  It's about who you are as a person, so you can't afford to keep your best qualities hidden behind a shy appearance.<br><br></div>

(In fact, man of the olden days never depend on such qualities to get woman. For those who depend on themselves to woo the fine ladies, its always the 'elements that cannot be seen' that actually scores. Money, fame, status, etc.) Your attitude towards love forms a major part of the reason why you never succeed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You think that waiting for fate to arrive is best way for the chase because if you are fated, you both will see each other, talk to each other, meet each other, etc. THIS IS SO WRONG. In fact, you are inferior, passive and lack initiative. <strong>Opportunity is there for you to further worked upon but you chose to wait for opportunity to feed you like a baby.</strong> You want that to happen? Simple. Wait until one fine day a girl falls for you and return that love and I guarantee you that usually this girl wouldn't be the kind of girl you would like. (Unless neptune/sun aspect triggers Love-at-first-sight aspect, karmic, Saturn/pluto aspects, Higher Twin Self theory or simply Art of seduction).<br><br><blockquote>what i did during those times...was not like other guys..i think that other guys if they like a girl..they will ask her out..try to chat with her...care for her...but i did none of these...i just look at her...everytime look..at her...neber dare to find a chance to talk to her....thinking that like drama like that</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You want your love to be like drama - reflects upon your weak emotionally needs. You crave not for a relationship - but for dramatic BGR love to norish you. And you feel you are 'indifferent' because you will NOT advance towards getting to know the girl better and you think that is helping you at all?<br><br><blockquote>Decided to like a girl..who i really think that she will not be so choosing about a boyfriend..since she herself..was not pretty.. </blockquote>You can't have your dramatic love, you employ sense of logics and input into the dynamic of relationship - thinking that it would be easier to get her or everything. And what's with the word 'Decide'? So your needs has now transformed into a desire? Something that you can trigger or release?<br><br>Then later came an older woman. You returned back to your usual tactics of admiring from afar. <strong>Do you realise </strong>why you have been doing that for only the secondary school girl and her? Because they seemed such a distance to obtain and your hidden gnawing inferiority dare not put up any reality challenge. Your sense of logics comes in and conjunct with your inferior - made you afraid of getting hurt, therefore you minimize your chances of injury, unknown to you that it also reduce your chance to succeed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Your idea of love has now degenerate to a desperate mode of having a girlfriend. You look back in your life and felt empty because you have zero-relationship experience. Sure emotionally, you are, but that isn't something you can force and make it happen overnight. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Don't decide to fall in love, you fall when you will. Work for your opportunity. Fear to get hurt, don't chase. Rejection is painful, but at least you can smile and tell yourself you already did what you could and move on instead of lingering in wondering-thoughts if you could get her if you did something in the past.<br><br>Cheers</div>
