We act all cheery or cool outside, when we're suffering inside. We don't feel happy, we feel a little sad, nothing that major, but we're losing interest in life.<br><br>Awaken something within you. Find something in you to attach your interest to. Pick up a new sport, a hobby, a game, or even a good book. For me, i picked up SGforums, and it has helped me a lot. I don't feel that depressed anymore.</span><br><br>Why am i so cold to people? I literally freeze up when i met new people. I find it hard to change my attitude.. I feel so guilty-ridden when people with nice attitude treat me well but i always return with coldness and behaving so cool.. such a facade to hide the more vulnerable me.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Its most likely a past event that happened. You may have gotton treated badly by someone you met(treated with disfavor) when you were young, and that incident has left a scar on you, that remains to this very day.<br><br>It could also be that you've once opened up, and got backstabbed by someone you know. So you find it hard to meet new people and treat them well.<br><br>Only you know the answer to this. To fully overcome this, you need to look back at your past. Search for the event that brought about this coolness in you, and overcome it. Such is the only way.</span><br><br>Is it wrong with me to behave so cold and ignore people who cared for me?<br>I feel i'm so selfish.. i don't want my life to end up having a negative impact on people around me... really... even when i was young i want to do something for the less unfortunate.. being a postive person and yet i'm not doing it..<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Who can say what's right or wrong? We're all humans, we're in this together. If you really want to be a positive person and do something for the less fortunate, but you're Not doing it, what you need is Motivation.<br><br>Get a friend or someone you know well, and sign up for blood donation at the hospital, volunteer at the orphanage, the old folks home. If you can find a partner, especially a committed/dedicated and hardworking one, you'll be much more motivated.</span><br><br>I'm just so scared.. shit.. i know it's irrational... but i cant just help it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Then do some soul-searching, and try the steps listed above. It'll help.</span><br></div></blockquote></div>

The psychologist term it as "social phobia", it's more<br>of related to the past underlying problems which you are not prepared to<br>face, maybe the hurt and hatred you have has not been resolved. Look for<br>a psychologist, maybe they can provide professional advise.</div>
