            <div class='col-md body'>I used to crossdress alone at home for a short period several years ago when i was still young. However, I did feel that it was very wrong and I stop doing it. On 2nd thoughts, it was really disgusting.<br><br>But recently, I felt really stress and upset. I do not know why but the thought of crossdressing came back to me. I promise myself that i will stop within a week... I really need to relieve my stress. However, it did not go away. Instead, I even went to buy several more pair of bras and panties. I do not know for how long but I have been wearing female underwear the moment I return to home. Until now, I have been wearing female underwear everyday at home for the past few months. I even fantasize about wearing female bra and underwear to work. This is going crazy and obviously many people are going to think that i am a disgusting pervert or what. No to deny, I think so too and I am really upset with myself for doing all these.<br><br>I used to get excited wearing female underwear. It was something that can help me masturbate. Please, many people masturbate loh but of cause they do not say it out. Yes... I felt really pervert when doing so. I do not think it is morally correct at all. The thing now is I do not know why I still want to wear female underwear. Now, I can wear female bra and panties but do not get excited at all. Infact, I feel comfortable in wearing them. This is really big time siao leow...siao leow.<br><br>I do not believe I am a inclined towards a thinking of a transsexual or a woman in a man's body. I am a 100% guy who has only liking for the opposite sex and I am not deprived of female or guy friends. This is really upsetting for me. I am unable to get rid of this habit. I do not have a girlfriend currently. I am still waiting for this girl for 2 years plus. Think she will be ultimately disgusted if she finds out this obscene secret.<br><br>I really like to hear some suggestful comments, especially from girls. Think girls would be totally disgusted with me. I really wish I can stop doing all these but I seems to be unable to control myself. I seems to have split personality or what. If this carrys on, I see myself just wearing female underwear everyday and still behave as a normal guy outside. This is crazy. Sometimes, I thought that when i was in army it was better. At least I would not have the chance to crossdress. (Actually I don like the word crossdress.. it sux)<br><br>I do not want to call what helpline or what because I think if all these has to stop then I must be the one who has the determination to stop this crazy habit. I would just  like to hear some of you people's views. Btw, it seems to me getting myself involved in another activities such as sports or reading are useless to me.<br><br>Lastly, please to not make awful replies like ( U *** ah gua!, U ****...,Go die... Or what ever ) Respect youself and everybody else please. Ehmm, seriously may those who make idiotic and vulgar replies be cursed for the next 3 months (ie. Better watchout when u cross the road..)

Most people don't seek help, because of several factor and prefer to solve things by themselves - well, let me ask you: If you could solve this by yourself, it wouldn't be a problem at all in the first place. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>This has to do alot with your childhood psychological - since you mentioned that when you were young, you did cross dress. Let me guess - you have poor relationship with your dad? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Because the more you wear them, the more addicted you will get.

It seems illogical that your mind and behaviour contradicts. You know it's wrong, but still continues. It clearly spells out that you are unable to find out what exactly wrong is with you.<br><br>We are no experts in advising or counselling or even analysing. We can only share your story to a certain extent. From there onwards, everything is to your own judgement and decision as to what you want to do about it and whether you are determined to put your act to a stop.<br><br>Having said so much, I would like to stress again that knowing what went so wrong in you is crucial and ought to be done as soon as possible.<br><br>Just a few questions: Do you live alone?

A few questions of my own for you?<br><br>1. When was the 1st time you started wearing all these? How old were you then? How old are you now?<br><br>2. What triggered you off in wearing them for the 1st time? (honest answer pls...)<br><br>3. Have you discuss or talk to anyone in private from the forum regarding your matter?<br><br>4.

Self-esteem destroyed and all form of dignitiy gone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>At this point of time even when you seek help, you have an additional problem there: which is to build back those confidence to face strangers, people and even your friends and relatives.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I tried crossdressing when I was like 14-15 years old. But I managed to stop very soon. I'm 22 years old now and I just pick up the habit again few months back ago. The first time was because I'm curious how it feels to be to have to wear a bra. But now, I feel extremely comfortable when wearing a bra. I mean, it has become a part of my life already. Whenever I reach home, finish bathing I will change into my bra, it makes me feel more relax and secure.<br><br>Nope, I have never talk to anybody else. Actually, I also do not know what kinda help I can get from here...Sometimes.. I just feel like it is normal for me to wear bra and panty, I am so envious of girls that can wear bra out to street.. why can't I?? I always think that female clothes are nicer.. some times i dream of having a woman's body. Am I mad? Maybe,.. but i still feel that I am a normal guy as in i am only 100% interested in women.<br><br>When I was in army,...of course I did not crossdress...It came to me some time after I ORDed... I think i was want to experiment the life as a girl a period of time... i do not know why.. would people really mind? Does any of you have similar problems? I guess not many and if got also would not dare to say...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Lone Ranger,<br><br>Are you doing this because it's just something different for you to do and you need a release for your energy or are you doing this as a way to become sexually aroused?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I believe the condition you are in is called "transvestism." As opposed to cross-dressing that is momentary, casual or ritualistic, transvestism is a condition in which one habitually develops excitement by wearing clothes of the opposite sex". Apparently, transvestism exists only in males so it's not exactly uncommon to find men who wear women's clothes such as shoes or underwear. Such men are not likely to be homosexual than other men and in spite of their occasional cross-dressing, transvestites (as they are called) spend most of their time appearing masculine and choosing masculine professions.<br><br>I suggest you talk to your parents about this so they can help you find someone professionally competent to help you deal with this situation. Keep in mind that there is <strong>NOTHING </strong>wrong with you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> .<br><br>Sexuality is never static. It changes as we change. Sometimes we can feel attracted more to some people than others and ocassionally more to men or to women. There are also very few people who are completely 100% straight or 100% not straight. Most of us fall somewhere in between  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Master,<br><br>To me, I feel that this is my very personal problem. I cannot possibly discuss this with my parents. I'm already in my 20s, I would not want to upset them. I was just hoping to continue to keep this secret. I do not deny at first it does arouse me but after some time.. some times it does not arouses me anymore. I feel normal to be wearing a bra doing things walking around, the presence is not there and i somehow feel more happy to be able to wear a bra.<br><br>But there is something I'm worried. I actually bought breast enhancement cream and pills so that i can develop breasts and now I have close to a B cup. I'm thinking if people starts to realise I got breasts..<br><br>Everytime when I leave house, I have to take of my bra and it just feels very uncomfortable, the chest/breast area feels very insecure, i just feel quite embarassed without wearing it anymore..</div>

What's next? Hormone Pills? I suggest in my deepest and sincere opinion... seek a psychologist or visit websites which relates to transgender issues.<br><br>Sincerely, i feel if you dun wish to be a man. You can by all means try to be socially adapted to the mainstream society as a woman. I support you.

You don't have to let the whole world knows about it, medical issues are usually quite confidential.<br><br>Like the way ya mentioned that you do not wish to be a female, taking of breast enhancement pills would only upset your horomones and could have you going towards that tendency without you realising it in time to come? A word of caution here, do NOT take medications without properly prescription.<br><br>Like the 'normal' guy you've mentioned yourself to be, the state you're in now is definitely not normal... If you're to be interested in girls, spare a thought for yourself. What you're making of yourself would probably render you unpopular to a woman's wantings.<br><br>Of course you can go ahead and wear your bra &amp; panties on the street. But whatever's off the norm set especially a great due of it... Would have a high price to pay in return....<br><br>Regards.</div>
