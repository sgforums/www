Mental illness means that your brain is sick (not pervertic or mad); just like flu or fever kinda of sick. Can be cured. It could also because initially you want to be different and your childhood experiences are haunting and Â“encouragingÂ” you to do this again. Things will only get Â“worseÂ” if you donÂ’t do something about it now (You did mention that you are doing this a longer period now than before). Conclusion: Only 2 ways to solve your potentially dangerous habit. 1. Help yourself by kicking the habit yourself OR 2. Seek professional help. A psychologist is a professional who will help you deal with it mentally (and will NOT laugh at you).</div>

The question is now if your gf knows about your insidious behavior, <strong>you think she will accept you? </strong>And because of this behavior, I bet you will seal your lips regarding this: a shadow will gloom over you and probably you will have conflict between telling and keeping it a secret - trust problem.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Then what If you don't truly love a girl? Or if nobody suitable ever comes? Let me tell you, you will never change? Things will be worst if you are a Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius or Taurus.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You never have a gf - probably you never would until you do something about these and not find a gf then do something about it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>This is the same for people who is obsess with porns and indulge in it everyday and available moment. This behavior will subconsciously change the attitude and reception of woman and will degenerate his own value, personality and character.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>It is like Artifact domination in AD &amp; D (Advanced Dungeon and Dragon).

Your problem is unique and and requires professional help and <strong>which you WON'T BE ABLE to find it here</strong>.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Lone Ranger,<br><br>There are people out there who cross-dress. Curiosity drives them to it. Questions like 'what does it feel like to be a woman?', 'How do they feel wearing those clothes?' and etc. It seems that for you, you were quite unhappy with some situation you were facing months back and thus used it to help you de-stress. Could that also be the reason why you felt safe in it? In addition, you were rejected by someone you like and hence you could desire to sort of 'be like her', know why she felt that way.<br><br>So why are you still doing it? I'm suggesting that since wearing female underwear made you feel safe, without it would cause the opposite effect. It's like Linus (in Peanuts) who always lugged around a blanket. Even when Charlie Brown's sister (who apparently likes him very much, but is not reciprocated) tries to take it away, she cant. When we were young, we all had something we held on to, be it a bolster, hankie, toy, etc. But we later learn that it's ok even when we are without it, we learn to let go.<br><br>For women now, it's a social etiquette to put on a brassiere. It has less to do with feelings of security. Before all this lingerie business, Adam and Eve were both born naked until they took a bite of the apple which gave them the knowledge between good and evil. It's not comfort but 'required'.<br><br>I would like to encourage you since you lived all your life without wearing female underwear, you can do so without it definitely! It's a mindset that you need to break that you are naked. You are not and it is not required for you to put on lingerie. You are not going to be less as a person. In fact, you will not feel the shame and fear you now do. Even though the girl you have been waiting for has rejected you, you are not undesirable. You have many strengths. It's just a case of mis-matching. Do not blame yourself or feel less.<br><br>What do you think?</div>
