When someone is wooing u, they will be oblivious to rejections.  Even when u've rejected them outright, they will never give up.

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh i remembered how i rejected someone long time ago.  I think it went like...<br><br>"You're a very nice person.  But our character doesn't match.  Furthermore, i'm not the person for u because i cannot commit myself to u.  Going steady with me will bring only misery to u.  And i really don't want to see u in pain because it will hurt me like mad.  So i hope u understand that we remains as friends.  At least, we can look after each other without the commitment(sp).  Don't feel bad, someone better than me will come along and u'll be very much happier.  Thanks for loving me..."  sob sob...<br><br>Don't know if it works but i didn't have problems with her after that and we're still friends.<br><br>Hey, must be getting old.  I didn't remember it to be so well phrased?!?   :p</div>
