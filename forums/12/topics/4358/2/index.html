I always wish guys i reject stays with me as my friend. I used to think of the usual crap that 'cannot be a couple but still can be a friend'.<br><br>But once after i read a book, i sat down and seriously think, when i hope the guy who used to like me remains my friend, i just want to remember forever that he use to like me...shit!!!!! i am very bad hor?<br><br>Now, whenever i cannot accept anyone, i let go. i no longer keep him near me to do get him do things for me willingly.<br><br>Diagnose my illness!</div></blockquote>That's a good way to reject someone.  I guess its normal to want ex-s to be still friends.  If you and they can handle it why not but sometimes the memories are just too painful and a clean break is best.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
