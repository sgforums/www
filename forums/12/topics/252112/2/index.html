Maybe as said i'll move on?<br><br>5) If you day her most trusted friend told you that she is only using you, while waiting for her prince charming, what will you do?<br><br>FYI. That girl has no link to my gf... she's an old time secondary school mate of mine. As i said as well, i just felt comforted... no developing of feelings at this point...<br>6) Have you talked about marriage with her? And her reply is ?<br><br>Yep. Umpteen times. Her replies usually get very excited and of course ask when will the big day comes lol<br><br>7) Do you know her parents?<br><br>Yes of course. I've been staying at her house for 3/4 of the week.<br><br>8 ) Does she know your parent?<br><br>Yes... as well she comes over when i can't go over.<br><br>9) If the day comes when the other girl confess that she like you, will you consider her at all after knowing that your girl friend will get worst..<br><br>Until all hopes and ties are gone with my current gf. I'll not do or proceed any further as friends. I don't know how to express it but i truly love her to bits. Yeah guys may call me a sissy boy but when guys... you meet the one you know you have never felt this way b4... will you say the same? situation differs man.<br><br></strong><br><br>1) Both of you are earning quite a good some so marriage should not be a problem for both of you.<br><br>2) 2 yrs is good enough for both of you to understand each other.<br><br>3)  "Have you talked about marriage with her? And her reply is ?<br>Yep. Umpteen times. Her replies usually get very excited and of course ask when will the big day comes lol "<br><br>Question is did you ask for her hand and plan for any wedding date?<br><br>4) Since both sides know each other so marriage should not be a problem.<br><br>5) Since you know yourself very well and can answer my question so well then what is holding you back?<br></div>

When you shower her with lotsa love and gifts. When you're broke to the last penny and still u wanna use that penny to make her happy. When the time spent with her is more than even spending time with your family... She still treats you so for granted and get angry (the princess anger)....<br><br>You felt so down and angry for the things you've done for her she still treats you like that...<br><br>Suddenly a friend which you'd know for years came to comfort you and you felt comforted... yet you knew something within yourself is geminating towards her but you know you shouldn't cos u had a gf...<br><br>What will you do?</div></blockquote>does ur gf ever too spend till her last penny just to get u something or make u happy?<br><br>if i haf this type of gfs, i too will feel very down. not say i haf low self confidence or wat, but the truth is it takes 2hands to clap.. if she doesnt reciprocate her feelings, it's time to move on..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
