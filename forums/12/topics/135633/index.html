See yourself from various angles... It certainly DOESN'T help if you yourself is already picturing yourself as a BORING PERSON.</div>

You probably don't realised it because you're still with your old friends and they still have this hard-coded mentality of you being a MCP. So it's difficult for you to notice even the slightest change in yourself.<br><br>Keep your old friends and go find some new ones. Remember to constantly remind yourself that you've been a MCP before and you're not going to let it ruin your new-forged friendships with your new friends. If you can keep your new-found friends satisfied and without any complaints for you as their friends, then you'll know that you've changed for the better.<br><br>MCP is part of the upbringing and you must realised that you yourself have supported it for so many years in your life, so it's not easy to get rid of it overnight. But you must realised that once you've been a MCP before, it will remained as part of your character whether you like it or not. But once you realised and have suffered for it, you'll know that you never want to get stuck in your life again...just like now.<br><br>It's really up to you to prove yourself once again to your friends/girlfriend and yourself.<br><br>Good luck and be strong...losing doesn't means that you're weak, it just means that you've taken on a greater courage to a stronger self. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
