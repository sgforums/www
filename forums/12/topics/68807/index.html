She's worried you'll lead her on and u're worried she'll be scared off.. in the end.. i believe both of u dun wanna lose the friendship irregardles of feelings of romance.. so i would advice the both of u to just put how u feel abt this whole arrangement on the table and talk about it. let her know that u might have feelings for her but u would rather have her as a friend then lose her thru wooing her.
