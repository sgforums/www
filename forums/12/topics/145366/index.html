            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, even for love developed from friendship, there are risks that the relationship can turn sour.  If things escalate, you can scars &amp; a friendship in tatters.  True love is NOT guaranteed, you can't expect it, you can only hope for it, &amp; do what you can to make the relationship work.  Why do you think they call it "effort"?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>True love, or what I've learnt so far, is giving &amp; taking, of both parties feeling loved &amp; treasured, of both parties having fun, &amp; sharing something that No other can replace.  True love also means being willing to forgive, willing to forget, &amp; willing to nag sometimes.<br><br>But that's<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> just what I've learnt</span>, it doesn't mean that other people experience the same thing.
