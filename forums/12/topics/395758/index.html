              <p>sounds cliched.. but this requires a long time and a lot of communication...</p>
              <p>make an appointment to talk to him.. find a place which privacy is ensured, there are no distractions, and he cannot run away without good reason... turn off all mobiles and whatever.. sit and talk...</p>
              <p>do not be judgmental.. listen.. prompt.. ask open ended questions to encourage more communication... do not raise your voice..</p>
              <p>you have to make your own preparations too.. have a list of your concerns.. do not be emotional.. be as objective as possible..</p>
              <p>most of all, be patient... one session usually doesn't even come close to opening up and his revealing his hang-ups and issues... it may take many sessions.. so hang in there...</p>
