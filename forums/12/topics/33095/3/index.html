            <div class='col-md body'>Though it was raining, Crystal never stopped running. She was disillusioned from the words of the man she loved Â– Half vampire? Hello? This is totally absurd! If he didnÂ’t want to be with her, he could have told her right in her presence. Why must he go around the bush, trying to evade questions, feelings and most importantly Â– himself?<br><br>Tears kept tickling down her cheeks, as she takes no effort in trying to wipe it away. Crystal was too shocked, too stunnedÂ…<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>Â‘ErmÂ… I tell you tomorrowÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Why tomorrow? Tell me now!Â’<br><br>Â‘I need to prepare firstÂ…Â’ </span><br><br>DidnÂ’t he wanted to get her a gift or something so as to appear more sincere when he expressed his feelings? So the preparation he wanted wasnÂ’t a gift Â– it was an excuse. And it wasnÂ’t a confession of love Â– it was a rejection using a lame excuse. Within a night, Crystal had complete change of impression in Leo, which hurts her the most when she realised that point. The man whom she had spends her time happily withÂ… all these is ending?<br><br>The rain had gradually brewed into a thunderstorm. Flashing and roaring across the night sky Â– it was as if heaven, too, was displeased with Leo. Crystal finally ran out of breath, she stopped by the roadside and sat by the concrete floor. She doesnÂ’t care getting drenched in the pouring rain; the mental and emotional torment she was undergoing was like a ton of iron on her. Nobody should be rejected in such a manner... nobody should play around peopleÂ’s feelingsÂ… Nobody shouldÂ…<br><br>Suddenly, Crystal felt that the rain is getting lighter on her Â– someone standing beside her, shielding with an umbrella. Crystal looked up and saw Ray, whose irritable features seemed to have disappeared, leaving a warm, approachable figure.<br><br>Â‘DonÂ’t stand here in the rain Crystal! You will get sick. Come, get into my car.Â’<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â‘Well, since you donÂ’t care about me, what for I bother about you? There are someone who obviously care more about me even though he may seemed slightly unappealing, but at least he cares.Â’ </span><br><br>Without a second thought Crystal got into the car. Ray hastily fetched a towel from the car compartment and passed it to her.<br><br>Â‘Lower down the aircon, Joe,Â’ instructed Ray to his chauffeur, Â‘where do you stay Crystal? I happen to come by and saw you sitting in the open all by yourself? Where is Leo? How could he leave you here all by yourself?Â’<br><br>Â‘DonÂ’t speak about that jerk. I donÂ’t want to go home; He is there. Bring me somewhere else.Â’<br><br>Â‘AlrightÂ…Â’<br><br>CrystalÂ’s unable to control her wild emotions once more, fell into another bout of whimpering. Ray then puts his hands around her, trying to comfort and console.<br><br>Â‘Judging at his cocky appearance, I knew that Leo was a jerk within. He look so flirtÂ… you are better off without himÂ…Â’<br><br>Crystal absorbed nothing of RayÂ’s words as Ray kept blabbering about how lousy Leo was, etc. It was only when the car came to a sudden stop that brought her back to reality.<br><br>Â‘Where is this place?Â’<br><br>Â‘DonÂ’t worry, its my house. Joe Â– shelter Crystal into the house.Â’<br><br>Rationally, Crystal shouldnÂ’t enter his house Â– but her mind is clouded and her womanly instinct couldnÂ’t reach to warn her. She got out of the car and walked into the detached house, the last one at a dead-end road. Like his car, Crystal was expecting nothing less than some grand interior design; it was an understatement. Crystal slumped onto the comfy sofa Â– her eyes still sore from the crying.<br><br>Â‘So could you like a drink?Â’ said Ray as he signalled Joe to exit himself.<br><br>Â‘Anything would do,Â’ replied Crystal, still very affected by LeoÂ’s words. It seemed like a blow she will never recover, critical hit right on her heart. It wasnÂ’t any ordinary sorrow Â– it was simply devastating.<br><br>Â‘<span style="font-style: italic;">Why do I have to get so emotional over him? He isnÂ’t my boyfriend!

Thinking back all the days when they were together and how happy they were, she couldnÂ’t accept the fact those days are forever gone. Why must things always happen in this way? Many a times, human have no control over their fate Â– like puppets, whose roles is being manipulated by its master. Do we have the strength to break free? Can we do anything about our dire situation?<br><br>Weeping while pondering, Crystal felt that her eyes were getting heavy and is losing focus. Rubbing it, she looked at Ray and had a double vision. She stood up and is unable to balance herself. Danger flashed across her mind, as she sensed something was wrong.<br><br>Â‘WhatÂ’s was in the drink?

            <div class='col-md body'>Ray said nothing - instead his usual vicious grimace came back as he cracked his knuckles and stretched himself, as he preparing himself for the coming event.<br><br>Crystal tried to run, but fell. Her befuddled mind was weakening her limbs and gradually, shades of blackness were over her eyes. She tried to scream; no words came, even if there was Â– it was too soft to create any impact.<br><br>Ray laughed. It was a sickening laugh. The maniacal tone of his voice was filling up her ears as she fought hard to repel it Â– it was futile.<br><br>Ray finally inched forward, after seeing his prey succumbing to his drug. She was lying on the floor, totally defeated and at his mercy. Ray lowered himself until he was closed enough to Crystal and sniffed her neck lustfully. His tongue travelled from her neck to her lustrous lips and kissed it gently.<br><br>Â‘You are so beautifulÂ… and todayÂ… you are mine!Â’<br><br>Ray hastily removed her socks and his hands then acted; his fingers caressing her thigh in a circular motion then to her waist while his nibbles moved from her face and travelled downwards. His hands slipped into her shirt, and brushed across her lacy braÂ’s cup supporting her bosoms. Following the straps, he unbuttoned her bra slowly, while continued his invading kisses and naughty hands that began on a campaign of searching and exploring on a mysterious continent Â– woman.<br><br>A door crashed Â– it was his main entrance and Ray halted whatever he was doing. Joe was flung by a force so powerful that it ripped the entire door off its position.<br><br>Â‘What the hell?Â’<br><br>Â‘You Basstard! You touch her and tried to RAPE her you fuucker!Â’<br><br>It was Leo. A wave of anger washed over him and his eyes flared into an aberrant luminous flame. His fist tightened and somehow his muscle grew incredibly huge and his once-well-define features became slightly gothic. He clasped his head in agony as if experiencing a severe headache.<br><br>Â‘<span style="font-style: italic;">KILL THE HELL OF OUT HIM</span>!Â’<br><br>Â‘<span style="font-style: italic;">NoÂ… Leo! Stop this anger now! If you donÂ’t, you will be lost to the beast forever and will be eternally condemn in the eyes of all living things!</span>Â’<br><br>Â‘<span style="font-style: italic;">HE WANTED TO RAPE HER! DONÂ’T YOU FEEL ANYTHING AT ALL</span>?Â’<br><br>Â‘<span style="font-style: italic;">It was destined that she has to go through thisÂ… even if you pulled her away from the pit of darkness, you cannot save her. This is her Karma</span>.Â’<br><br>Â‘<span style="font-style: italic;">HOW COULD YOU LET SOMEONE LIKE HIM LIVE? HE SHOULD BE DEADÂ… DEAD MAN CANÂ’T HARM YOUR CRYSTAL</span>.'<br><br>Â‘<span style="font-style: italic;">Do not listen to the beast!

            <div class='col-md body'>Leo couldnÂ’t even recall what Granny had said to him in telepathy mode. The beast Â– which seized control over him, dominated his mind. What so scary about the beast? Every vampire had a beast within them and once they fall into the clutches of the beast, they could no longer resist them and would lose humanity in themselves. To kill and consume blood regularly Â– the solo aim they lived for. Chaos is their middle name and evil is their doing, until the day when they are finally brought down to destruction, they would never stop.<br><br>Leo was a half vampire Â– the beast within him usually lay dormant; it is only when bitterness anger aroused him and indirectly lured it out. Often, he always had the willpower to suppress himself from descending into a chaotic demon Â– but his newfound emotions weakened this aspect. Love, that seemed to make him stronger, in fact has turn to ruin him.<br><br>LeoÂ’s rational mind was gone and his conscious was dipped with the touch of evil. His eyes were flaring with fiery flames that sparkled with fear each time he blinks. Two long canines tooth bare concrete evidences to his vampiric metamorphosis and he had gained supernatural strength Â– enough to crush Ray into a pulp literally.<br><br>Ray was rooted to the ground, as he was terror-stricken by LeoÂ’s appearance; only when he saw Joe escaped through the window successfully, he attempted the same thing. All Leo did was to wave his hands and Ray was pulled back by a compelling unseen force, which flung him backwards, crashing into the oaken coffee table and shattering it into several pieces.<br><br>Leo paced towards him, bearing hatred contemplation of his misdemeanour.<br><br>Forced into desperation mode, Ray resorted to holding two broken wood across one another, forming a cross. Seriously, what is the use of a holy symbol without faith? - An empty carcass. Annoyed, LeoÂ’s fist drove through his useless defence and thrust into his stomach. Blood oozed out from his ghastly wounds as Leo then split Ray from side to side - ripped his liver and he fell motionlessly on the floor, with all its bile spilling out. A sick, repulsive, disgusting sight indeed.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â‘SPOILS OF WAR Â– DRINK HIS BLOOD!Â’<br><br>Â‘No you beastÂ… you canÂ’t control meÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Oh no you are mistakenÂ… you have already fell into MY HANDS.  MUHAHAHHAHAH!Â’ </span><br><br>Clutching his head, Leo mentally dispelled the image of the beast inside his mind. Clarity gradually returned; although he knew he was permanently lost to the beast and that effect could only last for a while. With his hands closed to her forehead, a ball of energy gathered and fell into her face like invisible raindrops Â– it is to neutralize the drugÂ’s effect and to regain her consciousness.<br><br>Â‘Â…Leo?Â…Â’<br><br>Â‘Yes, its meÂ…Â’ Leo replied, feeling totally hell, yet even having to mask this emotions Â– he couldnÂ’t even cry or feel sorrow. He could only feel terrible as his senses smell blood, yet he restrained himself from consuming.<br><br>Â‘What had happened?Â’<br><br>Â‘You want to know everything?Â’<br><br>Crystal nodded.<br><br>Leo then explained everything from beginning of how he became a half vampire till now. Finishing his last words, he showed her his vampire teeth and performed a few spectacular magical effect to prove his unbelievable tales. Crystal then threw herself at him and cried, all over again, this time realising that her wilfulness had causes him to land in such a pathetic state. Her tears flowed and rolled, unable to cease. They embraced in each otherÂ’s arms, once more, knowing that it may be their final one.<br><br>Â‘We have to leave here immediatelyÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Why?Â’<br><br>Â‘When a person is killed by someone, its guardian angel will seek out its adversary after a period of time - This is the reason how retribution got its meaning. Guardian Angels are naked to human eyes; but they cannot touch mortal, although they could harm me.  Still, they could make use of reality to get their revenge Â– like when the gaoler hangs the murderer, etc. If the Guardian Angel fails to achieve justice within a stated time frame Â– the soul will become a wraith that roamed around the Earth, haunting the living.Â’<br><br>The radio started playing music involuntarily and the hall lights flickered. Wind howled eerily and breezed in chillingly.<br><br>Â‘We have no time to loseÂ…Â’<br><br>Without any delay, Leo took Crystal by her hands and ran with supernatural celerity, blinding to mortalÂ’s vision, as he witnessed a ray of holy light wavered above the corpse of Ray Â– coming sign of the arrival of RayÂ’s Guardian Angel.<br><br>(To be continued...)<br></div>
