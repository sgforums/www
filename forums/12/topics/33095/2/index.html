She told me today there is a meteor descending and she wants to see it. I have grown to appreciate and love her company despised our minor indifferences Â– she was an extrovert, full of confidence in herself, while I am more of a quieter soul. Actually GrannyÂ’s word made my mind wandered; all these Â‘first timeÂ’ and emotions I am undergoing Â– is it going to help me?<br><br>A familiar screech echoed through.<br><br>I am too engrossed with my personal thinking that I spared no divided focus on other business. Suddenly I felt a solid punch rammed into my chest - I withstand the blow like a tower. Annoying emotions was filling me as I looked up to see who was it; it was Ray and his couple of lackey standing behind him.<br><br>Â‘So you are CrystalÂ’s boyfriend? Oh please! Look at your f.u.c.king face Â– pale like a drug addict. Do you think she really likes you?Â’<br><br>No words came out. Where is my usual eloquent speech that could be used to counter his reckless remark? Has it abandoned me? Annoyance has transformed into anger as my eyes flared.<br><br>Â‘DonÂ’t you dare disturb him,Â’ growled Crystal as she made her way towards my table.<br><br>Â‘Oh no, never disturb - He and me are like good friends you know.Â’<br><br>Â‘Yeah right, come lets go.Â’<br><br>Crystal grabbed my hands and pulled me away from the scene. My emotions only fell into a slight turmoil and I was surprise; I could rarely able to control myself so well. Once a guy who pissed me off found himself in hospital after three blows from me Â– never could he walk again. Granny reprimanded me severely after this incident and made me chant sutra after sutra for his life. If I failed to control myself again, I may be lost to the beast forever.<br><br>We hopped into the taxi and made our way to Marina Square. From anger, my feelings gradually cooled down until when she cuddled into me; every malicious emotions dissipated.<br><br>Â‘DonÂ’t talk about that moron. I know he wouldnÂ’t harm you a single bit.Â’<br><br>My hands then wrapped around her and stroked her silky hair like a kitten. I think she likes it Â– I said I THINK Â– she never brushed my hands off so I supposed it was nice. She was so enchanting at times that I really feel the need to protect her. Life is so weak Â– like a shoestring, with brute strength, it will be broken.<br><br>(To be continued...)<br></div>

We sat down together with a scores of people around waiting for the few seconds sight of meteor.<br><br>Â‘Lets play scissors, paper and stone. If I win, I am suppose to kiss you.

I could read her like a book - her thoughts, feelings and senses and could predict exactly what sign she is going to come out with.<br><br>Â‘I knew you will let me win. Ok thatÂ’s 38 times I won in total, soÂ…Â’<br><br>An ant was crawling on my leg and I was trying to fling it away. Without any form of warning, she came over and locked her lips with mine.

I could felt her gentle breath on me, with that womanly pheromones that was trying to charm me.<br><br>Â‘Meteor!Â’ The crowd screamed.<br><br>We drew away from our lips and looked at the beautiful meteor that was descending. The sparkling flaring galaxy star was simply beautiful. I was awed by its presence. Then I saw Crystal, who was wishing upon the star.<br><br>Â‘What are you praying?Â’<br><br>Â‘ShhhÂ… donÂ’t disturb me first.Â’<br><br>Looking at how serious she is praying for a wish, I was wondering whether had I led her on so far till there is absolutely no way she could turn back? I knew I was a wood head: but I am cursed. The blood that was running in me is tainted. How am I supposed to tell her? Am I being fair to her?<br><br>All good things must come to an end; the starry show concluded. Everyone was wishing, giggling, smiling to themselves as if their wishes will definitely come true. Sometimes being naÃ¯ve and innocent is a kind of bliss.<br><br>Â‘Do you have anything to say to me?Â’<br><br>What? She sensed something is wrong? Oh no, I havenÂ’t prepared my speech to tell her yet. I need to delay time.<br><br>Â‘ErmÂ… I tell you tomorrowÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Why tomorrow? Tell me now!Â’<br><br>Â‘I need to prepare firstÂ…Â’<br><br>For some reason, Crystal smiled and giggled to herself.<br><br>Â‘Come lets goÂ… I still have work tomorrow morning. Need to get back home now.Â’<br><br>We strolled our way out of the beach and flagged down an approaching cab.<br><br>Â‘I really enjoyed myself today and I hope tomorrowÂ… *giggles*Â… you would be preparedÂ…Â’<br><br>I shut the door of the taxi and saw the taxi speed off. I was felt dead inside. What should I do?<br>Should I tell her about the real <span style="font-style: italic;">me</span>?<br><br>(To be contined...)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(CNY special - Slightly longer)<br><br>I told her to meet me after her work and our date venue was at her house rooftop. I was there long before the appointed time. Thinking of what to tell her, thinking about the shocking truth behind my true identity, my true self.<br><br>Confusion was overwhelming me as I sat above the water tank and observed Singapore. All was too beautiful, like a dream. Am I waking myself up too soon?<br><br>After the initial day we met, the beast within me never acts upon me ever since. What has happened? I knew not. Granny told me this is work of what folks called it Â‘Love.Â’ Does Love has the power to draws the evil essence in my life?<br><br>What exactly is love? I know no love Â– in my life, survival is the only thing I knew. When I was young, I was despised and my parents were murdered. Bitterness and rancorous residue are only elements that were left behind. I was turned when Granny was hunting my sire and successful annihilated him, though she couldnÂ’t save me from the metamorphosis. Granny took pity and didnÂ’t destroy me but instead, she guides me and tried to find ways and means to undo my transformation. I had few friends, because people found me eccentric and avoid. Crystal was my only close friend and somehow, only to her, I could communicate well.<br><br>The time has come to reveal; but deep within me I was afraid, I was scared that she will avoid me once she knew about this. I couldnÂ’t help but to feel inferior because I wasnÂ’t normal and wasnÂ’t leading a normal life.<br><br>I know she is the solution key to my suffering, but I donÂ’t know how could she help me. I experienced several feelings for the first time, not knowing what it was Â– it was Crystal who taught me the meaning and allows a chance for me to learn. I guess she is teaching me the way of life Â– Yes! It must be it! The way of life.<br><br>I sensed her presence.<br><br>The entrance door creaked opened.<br><br>Â‘Leo, why are we meeting up here?Â’<br><br>I was silent, totally absorb in admiring the starry red sky. In fact, her presence sets my pulse racing Â– I still havenÂ’t come to a conclusion yet.<br><br>Crystal climbed her way up and sat beside me. The atmosphere grew extremely tense. She puts her arms around me and gentle bit my earlobe.<br><br>Â‘Tell me what had happened?Â’ she whispered.<br><br>Â‘What if I tell you that I have been keeping something from you. Would you be angry?Â’<br><br>Â‘DonÂ’t be silly. If you have something to keep from me, you only heed what I have told you Â– you cannot be too frank at times,Â’ Crystal laughed.<br><br>Â‘No Crystal. I am serious.Â’<br><br>Looking at my stern appearance, she knew that I wasnÂ’t joking. Gradually, she regained her composure and kept real quiet.<br><br>Â‘SoÂ…?Â’<br><br>Â‘Ok answer me this: How do you define our relation?Â’<br><br>What? Defining our relation? I donÂ’t even know what is going on Â– how am I supposed to define? Man, this is getting sticky.<br><br>Â‘DonÂ’t know what is going on?!? DonÂ’t youÂ… donÂ’t you even feel anything special when you are with me?Â’<br><br>I was silent by her sudden burst of emotions. I could see watery tears emerging from her eyes. I think I said something that I shouldnÂ’t, but I was very determined to get my message across her. I am sick and tired of living a double life Â– I need to pour everything tonight.<br><br>Â‘Listen to me, I feel every comfortable when I am with youÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Ok thatÂ’s GOOD enough, donÂ’t you want to be with me?Â’<br><br>Â‘I CANÂ’T!Â’<br><br>Â‘WHY?Â’<br><br>Â‘Because I am not human; I am a <span style="font-style: italic;">half vampire</span>!Â’<br><br>Crystal was staring deep into my eyes and I could feel a raging anger brewing beneath her pretty face. She couldnÂ’t believe all that was said in just mere five minutes and a drop of tear rolled down her cheek.<br><br>Â‘Even if you donÂ’t love me, you donÂ’t have to come out with such a lame excuse to reject meÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘NoÂ… I am notÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Then WHY did you came to my rescue on that day? And why did you meet me everyday?Â’<br><br>Â‘ThatÂ’s because Granny said I needed to seek youÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Seek me? For a reason? IsnÂ’t love the reason why you wanted to meet me?Â’<br><br>I was dumbfounded. An unnatural silence surrounded us, as I was lost for words to explain myself. I know I was wrong to lead her on without even telling her the truth beforehand. Have I really seek her because I fell in love with her or is it because I needed her to cleansed my accursed life? I havenÂ’t figured that out myself.<br><br>Â‘I have mistaken youÂ…Â’<br><br>Crystal leaped off from the water tank and ran off, leaving precious drops of tears as she left. I wanted to chase after her, but I thought that itÂ’s best to allow her time to calm down. Suddenly, I felt very lousy Â– a guy who couldnÂ’t face up to reality, a guy who escaped and lived in his world of deceits and lies.<br><br>I felt raindrops on my arm Â– It was raining.<br><br>Heaven weeping?<br><br>(To be continued...)<br></div>
