            <div class='col-md body'>If life itself is complicated, just like what the world is really now, my life would be the king of all lives.<br><br>To me, living is enclosing a shocking truth within me and never able to release it ever. The depressing feelings of sorrow deep within me never allow a single tear to weep from my eye. I hate myself, my life, and the way destiny is leading me. Â– I was totally different from any common mortal on the street, even though peopleÂ’s feature isnÂ’t as defined as mine Â– everyone still has a pair of eyes, ears and all other natural human constructs right? At least majority have.<br><br>Granny pulled me back from the doors Hades and but ironically, even though I appreciated her effort Â– I wished she never did. At least, my life story wouldnÂ’t be entertaining the Gods above Â– who will be revelling at my cruel fate that completely overpowered me.<br><br>I forced myself to adapt to this dynamic world, forced myself to accept what nobody could accept, forced myself to live on despite being an outcast Â– God shunned me. I couldnÂ’t enter any religious building as if a powerful antipathy spell was placed on every visible opening that could fit me through, repelling only me.<br><br>Â‘<span style="font-style: italic;">Believe in him and you will be savedÂ…</span>Â’<br><br>Salvation wasnÂ’t in my dictionary because I knew I was cursed beyond any hope of redemption. But Granny said that there was a way out; she told me that I had to find this special lady whom will bring deliverance to my soul, like light upon my bleak fate. I waited and I searched, not knowing how she looks like, not knowing who is she. Granny only told that it would be her if she gives me that feeling.<br><br>What you mean by that feeling? I was puzzled and confused.<br><br>Love?<br><br>Â‘<span style="font-style: italic;">LoveÂ…It can guide hearts to purity or destroy entire galaxies. It can make strong<br>men weep &amp; weak men rule. And, it can drive others to a state where they have trouble thinking...</span>Â’<br><br>Destroy galaxy? Strong man weep? Weak men rule? That powerful? I doubt so.<br><br>It has been many years that I lost count, in searching for her in Taiwan and I was at the brink of despair and nearly give up my small gleams of hope. The Beast within me is growing restless as I tried to curb it, with more difficulty each time it happened. If she donÂ’t appear quick, I guess I would be destroy in the hands of Granny herself sooner or later Â– who have to think for the sake of mankind.<br><br>For the rest of my life, I had to live on planned identity throughout my immortal life and the worst thing is I couldnÂ’t even commit suicide Â– I just canÂ’t die!<br><br>I was helpless like an infant, doing what I do best Â– wandering around Singapore (Granny predicted that she would be in Singapore). I thought it would be another futile trip over Â– not until when I finally found her, working in Atrium - Bakers Inn. This extraordinary feeling is lofty yet warmth and I found myself embracing it willing. Never had I experience such a feeling after that day Â– it was like rebirth, so pure and gentle.<br><br>In simple Â– even though she may not as appealing as other women, but to me, she seemed made in Heaven, propagated not of human production, but of mystical means. Her killer feature is her sparkling eyes, that defeats even the strongest man, teamed up together with her aura of charisma and air of exalted awesomeness Â– it seductive enough to enchant a monk to even renown his faith for her sake.<br><br>Â‘<span style="font-style: italic;">SoÂ… what am I suppose to do when I found her</span>?Â’<br><br>(To be continued...)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Our eyes met and my cold nature immediately surrendered to her deep gaze. Both of us were locked into it for what seemed like eternality. To the both of us, the queer familiarity intertwined with hint of mysteriousness is captivatingly alluring. I sat down at one of the table, still remaining the eye contact, until when she finally break off and returned my a smile instead.<br><br>Â‘Sorry sir, but we are closing now, maybe you would like to return tomorrow?Â’<br><br>Â‘My purposes here isnÂ’t here to patronÂ…Â’<br><br>My sentence was cut by a suddenly screech of halting car that is so terribly annoying, I had this feeling that the owner wouldnÂ’t be very much different.<br><br>Â‘Sorry, but I have to go workÂ…Â’<br><br>I turned around and saw this punk making his way towards BakerÂ’s Inn. He wore a grimace smirk on his face with arrogance and witnessing the way he looked at women, perversity is written all over his face. Standing outside the store and picking his teeth while smiling at the manager inside BakerÂ’s Inn, the manager nodded as if he knew what the punk wants.<br><br>Â‘CrystalÂ… you could leave now. There is nothing else for you to clear up. Robert will handle it.Â’<br><br>Â‘ButÂ… butÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘No butsÂ… just do as I say.Â’<br><br>I could sensed her discomfort-ness trying to leave at this point of time Â– my guess would be at the appearance of the punk. A sudden urge to help her in anyway I could rush in when her glance was crying for help. The punk then camped nearer to the door like a predatory waiting for his potential prey to leave her safety net.<br><br>Crystal sighed and took her bag, resigned to her fate - I feel that she had decided to face the coming music.<br><br>Â‘Sorry, but you really have to go now. We are closing.Â’<br><br>I nodded and make my way out. Crystal waited for me, holding onto the door, trying to buy time before her ill-fate arrives.<br><br>Â‘How can I help her?Â’ I thought to myself while walking towards her. No ideas sprung out.<br><br>Â‘So have no reason you could reject my offer for a date?Â’  A voice came from the punk wannabe.<br><br>Crystal hesitated.<br><br>I have to react; I grabbed her hands and she was stunned by my sudden unpredicted actions.<br><br>Â‘Come, follow me!Â’ I spoke into her mind and her resistance relented.<br><br>Â‘Sorry, but I have to accompany my boyfriendÂ…byeÂ…Â’ she replied back to him and the both of us disappeared from the scene hastily.<br><br>(To be continued...)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was running Â– and I could feel as if my long-ceased beating heart working. Could she be the key to my suffering? I had no answer myself; I could only keep running. Held on her silky hands, for the first time, I feel complete and wholesome.<br><br>Â‘CouldÂ…could we stopped for a moment?Â’<br><br>How ungentlemanly could get I? Immediately, we stopped to catch our breath, for her case I mean. As we sat down on the nearest available benches around, she adjusted her hair properly in places before turning to me.<br><br>Â‘How on earth did you knew I needed such assistance? You reaction is timely and fast and saved me from going out with that moron.Â’<br><br>I smiled sheepishly.<br><br>Â“WhatÂ’s your name?Â’ Crystal asked.<br><br>Â‘Leo. And I know you are Crystal.Â’<br><br>Â‘Yeah, from my boss right? Who wouldnÂ’t have heard him speak? That idiot Â– I bet they had some unnatural business going on between him and that punk - Ray. You know something? Ever since after he came and wanted to date me out, with failed attempts, my boss have been treating me very well, totally contradicting to his shrewd self.Â’<br><br>Â‘Oh really?Â’<br><br>I looked at the gleaming stars above and I couldnÂ’t believe myself Â– I calculated it was her birthday today (one useful skill I learned from Granny, who taught me some of her unmatched art of astronomy and astrology).<br><br>Â‘Your birthday today?Â’<br><br>CrystalÂ’s face brightened up and I could see question marks on her head.<br><br>Â‘How on Earth did you know?Â’<br><br>Whoops, I made a blunder mistake. Oh no! I needed a quick excuse!<br><br>Â‘ErmÂ… nah, a lucky guess. I thought that it must be since Ray had planned all these just to celebrate with you. I mean it must have been a special day.Â’<br><br>She smiled, this time as sweetly as sugar. Never have I spoke so eloquently before! I donÂ’t believe this.<br><br>Â‘An intelligent deductionÂ…Â’<br><br>As we walked down the street, we chatted as if we knew for decades. I discovered that she an orphan living by herself near Chinatown. She once had a guardian, her aunt, living together but she passed away a year ago. We were like best of friends, yet not quite one. In all my years of lonely existence, having a friendship is like a gift to my damned life. Time distorted and went by slowly and how I wished this could continued forever.<br><br>Oh wait a second! It was her birthday and how could I not give her any present? My eyes darts around for any shop still opening, but to my dismay, it was a disappointment. What store could have opened at such late hours of the night? Oh waitÂ… I think I have something with me.<br><br>Â‘Ah wait Crystal, this is for you.Â’<br><br>I took out a glittering ring from my pocket and its beauty dazzled Crystal, who recovered from it after a moment of admiration.<br><br>Â‘I couldnÂ’t accept such expensive gift. I am not richÂ…Â’<br><br>I took her right hand and put it for her. She tried to resistance, but my firm attempt overpowered her.<br><br>Â‘Its your birthday and this ring has imbedded with crystal around it Â– which suits your name, and most important, the mistress Â– you.Â’<br><br>Crystal blushed and I donÂ’t understand why would I say something as mushy as that. Oh my gosh Â– too many first time in a day makes me feel terribly weird and uneasy Â– I donÂ’t believe thisÂ… again.<br><br>Â‘I guess I couldnÂ’t thank you enough. Here is my number Â– allow me to treat you a lunch and I after such a nice chat with you Â– I am home!Â’<br><br>I looked at her and nodded. We exchanged numbers and somehow I felt a little reluctant that all these are concluding for the day.<br><br>She left and I stood her until I caught zero glimpse of her. Strangely, the beast within me is tamed and I feel rejuvenated.<br><br>I could sensed my accursed life moving away from me! Yeah!<br><br>(To be continued...)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everyday, without fail, be it rain or shine Â– I could visit The Bakers Inn just to see her. Even though she is busy with her work, when time allows her small freedom, she would winked at me and she literally spoke a thousands words. Just admiring her at the corner of the store, I feel that it is more than enough. We were like close friends now, talk about everything under the sun. I feel myself transforming more humanly each time we are connected in speech, mentally, spiritually or emotionally. Crystal is like my drugs Â– her addiction is great.<br><br>I told Granny that I found her and Granny was overjoyed. Finally her prayers to the Gods have answered her.<br><br>Â‘Granny, I asked, Â‘how is she going to help my cleanse my life?Â’<br><br>Â‘I have no answer myself, but I am certain that her appearance in your life would be the ending point of your accursed life.Â’<br><br>Recalling what Granny has told me, I couldnÂ’t help but to smile inside my heart. Finally something good has come into my life Â– Oh well, at least something good did happened. I am contented.<br><br>Making her way towards me, Crystal whispered into my ear, Â‘Wait for me alright? I go and change then we leave for dinner alright?Â’<br><br>I nodded and her elfish grin nearly made me pinch her cheeks. Today marks one hundred and fifty days since we met, therefore we have agreed on a one day celebration Â– a dinner. Sometimes I wonder why am I so willing to be together with Crystal just to spend time with one another? Even though she is the key to my cursed life, why does her power comes from? She is like any other ordinary folk around, with the exception of her Â‘killerÂ’ eyes.<br><br>Â‘Ta da!Â’<br><br>I was taken aback Â– A black tube Â– highlighting her well-endowed assets - and ivory skirt, which exuded female hormones used only for one purpose: to stir up the raging hormones of any males species around. She wore light make-up, particular around her eyes Â– I knew she realise that she had medusaÂ’s gaze. Well, women sure know how to emphasize on their strengths. If I was a common men, I would be bowed over by her suggestive dressing.<br><br>Â‘Pretty, I should sayÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘ThatÂ’s all? I was expecting a list of adjective describing me.Â’<br><br>Â‘Well, I came up with one, but your stunning appearance made me forget my list.Â’<br><br>We both laughed.<br><br>Â‘I was just jokingÂ… so where should we have dinner?Â’<br><br>We travelled from Atrium Orchard down to my planned destination Â– Orchard point. On our chatty way there, I could see from the corner of my eyes, guys stealing glances at her, some even made lewd comments and a strange emotions brewed within me. Even though they did nothing physically, I was affected by their thoughts and involuntary actions. This strange emotions, I had never experience it before. What do you called it?<br><br>Â‘You called itÂ… ah. Tell you next time.Â’ came CrystalÂ’s cheeky reply, Â‘And to solve it, you have toÂ…Â’<br><br>Crystal took my hands and put it around her shoulders, while her hands wrapped around my waist. For some unexplained reasons, I was feeling better. Oh my god! This is totally illogical! I donÂ’t even understand what was going on and even more why did I feel better that way.<br><br>Â‘SillyÂ…Â’<br><br>(To be continued...)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We finally reached our destination and decided to dine at Swenson. Making our way in, we sat and I noticed she was grinning from ear to ear.<br><br>Â‘Why are you so happy?Â’<br><br>Â‘Oh I forgot, you are a wood head. Nothing.Â’<br><br>I tried to force it out from her, but she always has her way around. Somehow, I never recover from that startling incident a while ago. Maybe it is because she always dressed so casually and her true beauty is buried within. Today, it was flaring with confidence and absolutely nobody could resist looking away, even other women.<br><br>Â‘Actually I never dare to wear a tube out, but suppose I would like the feeling that you are around and the security I get from you. My guess was right.Â’<br><br>Hello? Security? She is speaking Arabic! Â– I am lost.<br><br>Regardless, our dinner came and it was the finest one I ever tasted even though it was ordinary Fish and Chips. Guess it is not what I am feasting on; rather it is who I am eating with. Philosophy? Oh no, my brain must be damaged.<br><br>We finished everything that was prepared for us and had a little Â‘warÂ’ of fork and spoon Â– even though it was socially unethical to play with your utensil you used for your meals, we were both lost in a world of our own Â– too deep to get out. People are giving us rude stares and shaking their heads. But do we care or even bother? Not a cent.<br><br>Finally, we decide to leave and I saw the relived face of the manager. As for compensation, I left a hefty tip of fifty dollars; the waiter who served us was very delighted at the sight of a huge tip and bided us farewell, so politely that it seemed so fake.<br><br>Â‘Why do people treat others so different when money is concern?Â’<br><br>Â‘Everyone in this world has been conformed to a certain way of thinking: Money is everything. Truthfully, money is important, but there is a lot of things money cannot purchase.Â’<br><br>Â‘I know Â– like you.Â’<br><br>Crystal blushed again. We flagged down the cab and took it.<br><br>Â‘Sweet talkers guys arenÂ’t good guys you know? But I know you are a wood head Â– therefore you are excused Â– but you have to learn one thing, you cannot be too frank at times.Â’<br><br>Woman, totally contradicting to what she is saying Â– she said that I am a sweet talker, which implied that I am a bad guy, yet she said I am not one. Sometimes, I really wonder why people cannot speak to each other frankly with trust if they can? Having to conceal something and the fear of this secret to be exposed is not a good feeling. A sense of guiltiness filled me at the thought of my cursed life, which brushed across my mind.<br><br>Â‘Guys who are as naÃ¯ve as you are long dead Â– think you are the only one leftÂ…Â’<br><br>I heard the taxi driver coughed sarcastically and immediately I sensed CrystalÂ’s displeasure.<br><br>Â‘UncleÂ… keep your extra comments to yourself. Just drive your car and thatÂ’s enoughÂ…Â’<br><br>I giggled.<br><br>Uneventfully, we arrived at her house.<br><br>Â‘Thanks for you dinnerÂ…Â’<br><br>She arched over and pecked my cheek with her lips, before running off Â– I was undergoing transformation again - the power of her kiss was totally unfathomable.<br><br>Â‘Can I drive off now?Â’<br><br>Â‘ErÂ… sure?Â’<br><br>(to be continued...)</div>
