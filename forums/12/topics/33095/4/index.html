            <div class='col-md body'>Leo and Crystal kept running, at the speed of sound, totally oblivious to mortal vision. Leo knew that since that moment when he had fallen to the beast, he might never able to survive through the many adversaries that he may have to face. His only kin, the old familiar Granny, now had become his nemesis who will seek to destroy him. If it were months ago Â– Leo would be more than willing to be destroyed and then having to pay for his sin of his cursed immortal life. Now, the cards on the table are way different; Leo had found Crystal, and will do anything to preserve his life to be with her. Leo had chosen a variation in the route of his damned life Â– he has no turning back now. Regardless of how difficult life will be Â– he has to move on.<br><br>About a considerable distances away from RayÂ’s luxury house, Leo ceased his Celerity vampiric discipline.<br><br>Â‘He is there! He killed my MasterÂ’s son!Â’<br><br>Using his heightened sense, Leo detected four policemen and Joe, who was about 80 feet away from him.<br><br>Â‘Crystal,Â’ growled Leo rather unstably, Â‘step aside. Nonsense mortal is approaching their death.Â’<br><br>Hid behind a huge van, Crystal bit her lips and prayed for LeoÂ’s safety; it was totally unnecessary as his newfound power had made him totally ruthless and abominable. Taken over by the beast once again, LeoÂ’s thirst for violence and gore is far too great to resist. Charging towards them like a maddening bull with blinding speed, his unmatched unarmed combat instantly killed two policemen as he delivered a fatal punch - broken his skull, and dislocated the otherÂ’s neck as effortlessly as the ones of a chicken.<br><br>His precarious killing petrified the surviving three and before they could draw out their weaponry, Leo did a startling leap and lunged towards the nearest victim Â– Joe. Futile attempt to ward Leo off, Leo overpowered him, reached for his neck and sank in his vampire teeth.<br><br>Â‘VAMPIRES??? WHAT THE HELL?Â’<br><br>The other two policemen turned about and started fleeing Â– morbid fears have gripped their heart.<br><br>Â‘LEO! Stop it!!! Stop it now!Â’<br><br>Â‘<span style="font-style: italic;">KILL AND DRINKÂ… AHHHÂ… ITS REFRESHING ISNÂ’T IT?Â’ </span><br><br>Crystal rushed over and tried to stop Leo, who was overwhelmed by a frenzy to kill. Crystal pulled and tugged him, which agitated the beast within. In fit of anger, he snapped JoeÂ’s neck and kicked his ripped-off head, like a soccer ball, leaving the bloody headless corpse behind, slumping into a pool of blood.<br><br>Â‘LEOÂ… you have to stop killing!Â’<br><br>With a rattling howl that shook the land and trees in protest, Leo had temporary dispelled the beast and rational sense returned.<br><br>Â‘I am sorry if I scared you CrystalÂ… lets move on. We have no time to lose.Â’<br><br>A shadow figure silhouetted in the twilight of the lamps emerged and LeoÂ’s vampiric sense screamed a warning. An aura of powerful force swirled around the figure and LeoÂ’s vampiric senses detected a formidable foe.<br><br>Â‘Granny?Â’<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Granny inched her way toward Â– her eyes showed signs of disappointment. Though frail looking, Granny was healthy enough to blast the living daylight out of Leo. Years of accumulated powers were sufficient for her to take good care of any vampires and their formidable Disciplines.<br><br>Â‘<span style="font-style: italic;">ChildÂ… the sight of you pains meÂ…</span>Â’<br><br>Â‘<span style="font-style: italic;">I am sorry Granny, but I had to move onÂ… A Guardian Angel is seeking usÂ…</span>Â’<br><br>Â‘<span style="font-style: italic;">DonÂ’t you fear that I may destroy you now?</span>Â’<br><br>Â‘<span style="font-style: italic;">I doÂ… but do I have a choice? Destiny is making a fool out of meÂ… Granny, you shouldnÂ’t have save me last time when you had the chance toÂ…</span>'<br><br>Â‘<span style="font-style: italic;">NOÂ… I shouldnÂ’t have tell you to seek Crystal. I said she will change your fate Â– but I didnÂ’t realise that it meant turning you into a full-blown vampire.</span>Â’<br><br>Astrology, often, have double meaning to its prediction. A small err on her part Â– would trigger a whole new route in my life. Crystal then quickly leaped out from where she was hiding and to LeoÂ’s amazement, she stood in front of him and opened out her arms in a defensive manner.<br><br>Â‘I know you are his Granny and I know that you came to destroy him. Even though I possessive zero supernatural power to stop you from achieving what you want, I will protect the man I love as long as I am able to.Â’<br><br>Â‘Young lady, donÂ’t you know that he is a dangerous figure now? When he loses his sense, you may have you killedÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘I will try my best to change himÂ… the most if I failed my attempt, so be it - I shall die by it then.Â’<br><br>Â‘You canÂ’t change factsÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘How do you know? Have you even tried? Many times, people are crying out for a second chance Â– but does the world gives them? No! Quick as venom, they condemn and hissed at them. Compassion! Where is the worldÂ’s compassion for the unfortunate?Â’<br><br>A hideous scream echoed the land and chilled CrystalÂ’s heart.<br><br>Â‘We have no time to loseÂ… if I have to be killed tonight, I would gladly exchange this life of mine to alter his ill-fated Karma.Â’<br><br>Â‘With assurance from you, then I shall give him a final chance. I have no guarantee that I could dispelled the beast, but first, we have to stop him from killing.Â’<br><br>Multiple rays of enchanting piercing light interwoven each other and gradually formed a blanket of holy aura. Emerged from it, an winged figure levitated down gracefully, brandishing a blade that blazed fire on its own. Like a feather falling and after the AngelÂ’s feet felt the ground below, she did an enthralling dance that captivated Leo. He was entranced and was trapped by the AngelÂ’s spell.<br><br>Â‘Break it!Â’ yelled Granny as she uttered a chant that send a bolt of lightning speeding down from the clouds above. The emphatic lightning struck a lamp-post and the explosion snapped the enchantment that the Leo had fell into.<br><br>Â‘Stay away old hag, or you shall be destroyed as well.Â’<br><br>Â‘We shall seeÂ…Â’<br><br>Maintaining undivided focus, Granny uttered her next spell; a thickened fog brewed from nowhere and gradually created a well knitted wall - shielding them.<br><br>Â‘Wall of shadowÂ… kiddy spellÂ…Â’<br><br>Swinging her flaming blade towards the malicious mist, waves of blistering heat crashed into the wall of shadow, rendering it nothing more than steamy water vapours. When opaque mist dissipated, the three of them had long disappeared from the scene.<br><br>Â‘You can run now, but you canÂ’t hide foreverÂ…Â’<br><br>(To be continued...)<br></div>
