              <p>No point sleeping 1 shot alot when one gets 4 hours sleep per weekday (e.g) + high stress environment. Some people can take it, some can't. Maybe he should consider a different job with less stress or take a long holiday perhaps?</p>

              <p>if the job is stressful, maybe he can find another job that is less stressful. you mentioned that he has high IQ --&gt; meaning he's very capable-&gt; in that case, he could find a job elsewhere though.</p>

              <p>The after effect for me is bad health like weight loss, voice loss and mental deterioration. No longer alert, sharp and optimistic as before.Tired easily as well. Can say 180 degrees lifestyle change.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If he hasnt collapsed yet, it is still a hopeful case. At this juncture now, imho he should immediately take a rest from all potentially stressful activity. Dont need to press him to seek medical opinion if he not willing provided he not experiencing obvious health threatening symptoms. Then some1 whom he trust should slowly help him to evaluate his options.</p>

              <p>After working in that company for about 8 months, he lose his ability to speak properly, sort of stammering in his conversation and becoming very quiet, feeling uneasy and nothing in mind to talk with anyone.</p>
              <p>He used to have very high IQ in the past, now he had difficulties counting numbers and remembered even simple things. So pityful.</p>
              <p>Anyone know had friends with this problem? What kind of diseases in this? any treatment? It is stressed to work in a stressful, face-paced environment in Singapore!</p>
              <p>Please help...<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>
