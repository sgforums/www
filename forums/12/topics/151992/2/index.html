It requires capital, location, manpower, research, products and your will to make the business run. Even if you have started your business.. You need to make constant research to ensure that the business is running well and making a profit..<br><br>NO point setting up a business.. where 1 year later.. You are still desperately trying to get a break even of the capital and products you have..<br><br>As mentioned.. you are already at 25.. Is working at KFC your career choice and working path for the rest of your life? If it is.. i can say.. good luck to you.. Hope you enjoy your work life..<br><br>If you are not.. than do something about it... Being lazy and telling yourself that you are not keen in studying or upgrading yourself are all to me LAME excuses.. Upgrading oneself is part and parcel of life..
