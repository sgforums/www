What to advice you?<br>Personally, I also went through the same scenario before. If you cannot rip yourself of him in your mind no matter how he reject you,and that you still have that hope of thinking one fine day, you will touch his heart of stone, then you will have to face three serious consequences. I deduce this assumption based on the fact that he already make clear to you that he don't like you.<br><br>1st Consequence:<br>You will drop even further into this endless love pit. Never to see the bottom. You will never see the light of your love.<br><br>2nd Consequence:<br>When he is with another girl, you will have to bear the pain of seeing him being so imitimate with his girlfriend. This will ache your heart more.<br><br>3rd Consequence:<br>When he get married with that girl, you will probably come to the end of your road..... cry....cry...cry...and probably commit suicide.<br><br>I have been through all this but is able to pcik up fast as I know it's meaningless to carry on if that person reject outright. He/She already make it so clear to you, so why waste time and energy on that person. You are totally blinded by that guy, such that you simply ignorant of what or who is around you. If you don't like J, then just be alone loh....what to do leh.<br>I am worst than you, I am already 24 and still a single. Rejected by so many.<br>Do take my advice.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Ande Tan (edited 10 February 2001).]</div>
