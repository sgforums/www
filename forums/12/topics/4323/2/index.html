I wonder if it is possible to ask him out for dinner/drinks etc... I feel strongly that one must be proactive about things (whether male/female). Much of this stems from personal experience. At the end of the day, you won't regret the silly, stupid or embarassing episodes. What you will regret are all the things you really wanted to do, all the words left unsaid, because you just didn't believe in yourself enough or worse, just let it pass. So the question I always ask myself is : Am I waiting, or am I afraid of moving forwards ?</div>

I'm sure there are still others. Even if there isn't, I guess it's time for u to be more open and receptive to pple already. No harm getting to know more frens then after that who knows wat.<br><br></div></blockquote>hmmz.. though i say mi thin skinned and stuffs, i've been a socail butterfly and it wasn't hard for mi to knoe frenz... in fact, it's harder to stop mi from knowing frenz all around ( as quoting my friends )... though i have a wide circle of frenz and have, well, quite a lot of choices.. maybe it's bcoz of mi outgoing nature tat's why tend to attract more attention to myself.. but guess chemistry doesn't cum in tat easily... i hafta admit i have crushes veri easily.. but consequently, i'll quickly dismiss the liking for infatuation.. dun worry, i'm not robbing myself from possible chances but these r definitely those that i knoe won't result in anything ( tho no one know the future, somehow some people r juz so not meant to b... u knoe u knoe )...<br><br>but somehow, i realised i've changed quite a bit.. when in college, i practically knoe the whole skool, students, teachers, bk shop auntie and uncle, canteen stallholders, admin, comp lab and science lab technicians, cleaners.. everyone.. but realsie that nowadays i've simmer down a lot, as in the sense the enthusiasm in socialising all around... in fact, i've turned rather.. erm.. introvert ( too strong a word lahz ).. erm... more keeping to myself and not as bubbly as before... and the reason might b tat i'm rather yself enclosing into mi circle of frenz so as to limit myself from.. erm.. giving others the wrong impression.. i've been told that i'm often too overly concerned fro a person ( tink mi too KPO ) and i often give people the impression that u koe.. i like them and stuffs... and bcoz of such concern which i meant on a friendly term, they'll start to.. u knoe..<br><br>maybe i should b more " cold " but i can't help it lehz... i've lessen a lot liaoz but thenz... howhowhow???<br><br></div>
