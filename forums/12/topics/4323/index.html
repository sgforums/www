            <div class='col-md body'>Hi babyacid,<br><br>Yes you r rite cos its time you bring yrself together again. I can see that you really like that guy a lot cos 3 yrs is definately not a short time. You have tried yr best, but sometime love just don't work out the way you want it to me and there is not much you can do abt it.<br><br>After 3 yrs, I think its really time you open up yrself to others liao. Don't neglect those 'potential candidate' ard, they might just love you as deep as you love the guy. Never let go of a forest becos of a tree, esp if that tree is not worth waiting for.<br><br>Wounds will heal but it takes time. Starting from today, you can slowly open uo yrself bit by bit. After some time you will forget him and eventually open up yrself.<br><br>At the meantime, do more meaningful things to keep yrself occupied. To become a better person, we have to 'na de qi fan de xia'. Nevertheless, all the best and good luck in whatever things you r doing.<br><br>Regards<br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Waiting for a guy for 3 yrs and just let go is really a pity. and I understand that deep down inside u, u will never want just let the wait go just like that. I mean u waited for so long, I believe to u waitng longer will no mean anything. Maybe sincerity will touch him someday. and who knows wat...<br><br>However, I suggest, while u r waiting for the guy, u keep a look out for pple too.. Not that I'm saying that u get a bf who u do not love. But just that look ard, maybe there is just this other person who is also trying to wait for u for the past 2-3 yrs.. Like wat Atti has said keep ur options open. Maybe one day u may realise that that and understand y that guy said that it's impossible between the both of u.<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

J used to smoke but once he realise that he like me, he quitted smoking for two reasons.. one was becoz i hate smokers... secondly was becoz he wanted to live longer so as to be with me for a longer time... veri sweet of him, right? but i have disappointed J.. asked him to gif up a lot of times but he won't listen so i used the tough method by ignoring him totally... and now he has picked up smoking again... i wonder if he's using it to spite me coz i reallie feel bad now.. or izzit... i dunnoe~~~ his away message in irc is " LOL...going out for smoking spree...hmz....smoking more and more these few days..jialatz..dying very soon liaoz..lol..lame ahz..so? you think i care ahz? LOL..=P  "...<br>i feel reallie sad and guilthy now... but i can't possibly accept him out of guilt, right? i admit i do feel a bit for him, but it's not love.. it's not how i feel for R... and i'm the sort that if i have a guy on my mind, i wouldn't think about anyone else, let alone consider them as potential bf...<br>i reallie appreciate you guys talking to me.. hadn't really expected anione to reply.. but i'm reallie at a lost and dunnoe wat to do... frankly speaking, i oso knoe i'm sort of wasting my time on R and losing potential chances ( possibly J )... but i dun wanna gif up, not wif R whom i love so deeply...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, others might think that waiting for 3 yrs is something n that u should go on waiting. but i think otherwise. in my opinion(everybody is entitled to their own opinions), i think u should juz let go n get on wif ur life. mayb u could try to get back to being frens wif J, try to get to noe him better n help him get rid of his smoking habit. who noes, thru this process, u might find things bout J that u might like?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Babyacid,<br><br>Well love is a funny thing, i mean, every girl hope to find a guy who really treasured her and lover her, but when there is one ard, well somehow the girl won't choose that guy and go for others, its funny isn't it? But it happens to many pple ard.<br><br>But i do agree with you, you have to follow yr heart lor. If u dun like J, there's no way in forcing yrself to, and all J can do is hopefully one day he can touch yr heart by his sincererity, care and concern etc. It is definitely NOT yr fault if he picks up smoking again, for its his life. If he choose to behave in this way just to spite you, i am sorry but to say that J is not mature enuff lor. He should know well better than that.<br><br>But in actually fact, i really hope that J should buck up and not let these small things affect him. Its not easy to love a person, esp when the person is so 'zhi zhou' with love. I really hope that he can continue to show u with love and concern until one day he wins yr heart. Of cos, i am not trying to tell you to accept him but, give him a chance, even if it is only 1%. Don't totally shut him out for he might really be the one to change yr life 1 day, who knows rite?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As for R, think i really need to brainwash u a little, and forgive me for being naggy. Yes, its not easy to forget him, but do u think he will remember you or even think of you? The ans is NO!!! He don't even care if u r there or not. Its been 3 yrs (yes i admit i am impressed by yr 'zhi zhou') but its time u stop torturing yrself. You don't deserved to be tortured in this way cos u did absolutely nothing wrong, and for R, its definitely not worth it!<br><br>Time to spare a thought for yrself liao, babyacid. BTW, mind if i ask u how old r u? I dunnoe but i can roughly tell that u r abt 18-20 only from what u says (pardon me if i am wrong). U r still young and many more yrs to go, its just not healthy this way on the long run. I am sorry if i sound got carried away by this post but u do remind me of a friend of mine, and i admit, i also have problem knocking sense into her head.<br><br>At the meantime, take good care of yrself pls!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Come on pals and ladies or litto girls out there. At this point of the time, this lady here should be concentrating on her studies. Why bother herself with all these BGR stuffs? It is well, so waste of the time. Tell you what, I am not perfect, but almost a perfect bo-chup BGR things. There are reasons of cos. (sorry for being bhb)<br><br>Reason number 1: Ur mind will be tied down by a meaningless load, which put on studies will in actual fact, benefit you!<br><br>Reason number 2: Precious time of your presence on earth is wasted on things that you know is impossible, when someone, well stubborn I should say, claim possible. Even if this is true, out of millions out there, you think you are so lucky to be that 1 out there?? If you are, tell me a 4D number, I gonna put all I have on it! Also, spend time doing charity work, at least time is used on something beneficial to yourself, as well as to the society.<br><br>Reason number 3: Youngster, or rather guys, as I am one of those maybe, do not like to be tied down by responsibilties. Too young perharps to realise what it is all about so called puppy love. They will eventually realised that 1 thing more important than relationship, cause without it, eat what? Shit?? That is money!<br><br>Reason number 3: I have seen myself, people out there being "cheated". Hey that's bad, look at oneself in the mirror, you think parents nurture us up to be cheated by people? Think again, cherish kinship more than BGR, cause one day, when its not there, you gonna regret that you have not spend enough time with them, but thinking about those BGR kido stuff, that as I say, impossible to last during teen years. Maybe at an older age, it will. Look here, I did not say, definitely, but most probably, at least chances are much higher as everyone knows what they are after in their life, that is more mature in their thinking.<br><br>Reason number 4: Got to think out yourself, cause you know the cause of your living in life, I believe beside living to well....errmmm...ok so called love, I believe there are many other causes for your existence.<br><br>That's all friends, some of you might think I am trying to be a saint here, but I don't mind that at all. Cause I know what I am doing or rather its just a place of expressing views. Each has its own. The above reasons are what I have collected over a span of since sec 1 till now, about 7 or 8 years I think. Maybe there are more. But so far this are the major ones.<br><br>p/s: To succeed in life, got to work towards your goal!

Also, spend time doing charity work, at least time is used on something beneficial to yourself, as well as to the society.<br><br>Reason number 3: Youngster, or rather guys, as I am one of those maybe, do not like to be tied down by responsibilties. Too young perharps to realise what it is all about so called puppy love. They will eventually realised that 1 thing more important than relationship, cause without it, eat what? Shit?? That is money!<br><br>Reason number 3: I have seen myself, people out there being "cheated". Hey that's bad, look at oneself in the mirror, you think parents nurture us up to be cheated by people? Think again, cherish kinship more than BGR, cause one day, when its not there, you gonna regret that you have not spend enough time with them, but thinking about those BGR kido stuff, that as I say, impossible to last during teen years. Maybe at an older age, it will. Look here, I did not say, definitely, but most probably, at least chances are much higher as everyone knows what they are after in their life, that is more mature in their thinking.<br><br>Reason number 4: Got to think out yourself, cause you know the cause of your living in life, I believe beside living to well....errmmm...ok so called love, I believe there are many other causes for your existence.<br><br>That's all friends, some of you might think I am trying to be a saint here, but I don't mind that at all. Cause I know what I am doing or rather its just a place of expressing views. Each has its own. The above reasons are what I have collected over a span of since sec 1 till now, about 7 or 8 years I think. Maybe there are more. But so far this are the major ones.<br><br>p/s: To succeed in life, got to work towards your goal! Have the determination and heart to put down distractions that might hinder you from success!!!</div></blockquote>Erm.. think she's waiting for A'levels so nothing to study.. hee hee...<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, with regards to you and R, I don't see what you are waiting for. Ok, you might be a *traditional* sort of girl, but there's really no real barriers preventing you from further exploring this relationship. I mean, legitimate reasons for waiting would include physical separation (he is in another country) or temporal separation(he is really really busy at the moment). Waiting for the sake of waiting is pointless. Bear in mind that a lot of people are waiting because they have NO choice. You on the other hand do.<br><br>Speaking of choices, for pity's sake resolve your issues with R as quickly as possible so that you can choose which path you wish to walk with J. There is no greater torment for a guy then to be left hanging, getting teasers now and then but with no real answer forthcoming. If you know the pain of waiting for someone, have compassion for those who wait for you ...</div>

After reading about how you've tried to clarify things with J and how you even sympathize with him, you are obviously not that sort of person. Again, sorry for insinuating that you were.<br><br>I think I am coming to a better understanding of the female situation here. I used to believe girls just had to sit back and decide which suitor was best.<br>Now I realize the active (traditionally male) role is easier sometimes.<br>At least the guy can hold his breath and go for it.<br>If he gets rejected ... Well, he's gotta be grateful that at least he has a convincing answer to all the "what ifs". The most intense pain soon passes (coz if it doesn't you probably die from it) its the nagging aches which make it difficult to carry on with the rest of your life.<br><br></div>
