            <div class='col-md body'>Flings and impulsive moments kick harder than past relationships. Question what you want. If you want to be with her, then you have to make the effort to somehow forget it for the sake of both of your happiness. If you think you can't do it, no biggie. Leave. Simple as that.</div>

And that whole incident still riles me up easily. Like seriously easily, mere mention of his name or anything to do with that night.<br><br>For my part, I've approached the problem at different angles like:<br>1. We weren't together, so all was fair. She led her own life.<br>2. She merely indulged in a night of carnal pleasure, didn't mean a thing.<br>3. It's the past, what matters now is how I create a future together with her.<br><br>But I find that it's no use, it still bothers me. We've talked about it several times. She said she regretted the whole thing. She said it sorta made her realize she had feelings for me. She even said if it made me feel better she would stop talking to him. But it still bothers me. Honestly, if that guy was her ex, it wouldn't be an issue to me at all.<br><br>I post this to ask for your opinions and well, advice. I know what I have with her is precious and I don't want this to be a problem.
