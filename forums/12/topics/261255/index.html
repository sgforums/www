Does he tell him to fug off? And for your info, I was dressed in jeans, tee and have a blazer on with proper shoes. So there you have it.<br><br>Anyway, when I went in, there were only 2 customers, he told me flatly that they were busy and he is short-handed. Anything refer to HR. So of course, I was like WTF?!!! I just went through the rain, to get here, so that I can have like 5-10mins of your time. So yeah, I didn't tell him off or anything, I just thanked him for his time, and it was my pleasure to meet him, before leaving. Seriously...very turn offish experience. I have had the opportunity to interact with Sim Wong Hoo when I was working at Creative during their Warehouse sales 3/4yrs back, and he was honestly a caring boss. He was concerned about his staff, despite me being the lowest in the food chain, a part-timer. He asked how was the sales, the food, and if we had enough time to eat. Reminding us that though its important to sell,do not forget to take our meals to prevent gastric problems. How down to earth is that man?</div>

Okay, that extreme, but is it even possible to have them serving like 8-10 customers in their shop at one go? I believe LV has more then that at their shop in any one time man. I always wonder, what if one day, this really really rich guy, say some prince from some M.Eastern country comes by, and is dressed in berms, tee and sandals wants to buy a Patek Phillipe watch? Does he tell him to fug off? And for your info, I was dressed in jeans, tee and have a blazer on with proper shoes. So there you have it.<br><br>Anyway, when I went in, there were only 2 customers, he told me flatly that they were busy and he is short-handed. Anything refer to HR. So of course, I was like WTF?!!! I just went through the rain, to get here, so that I can have like 5-10mins of your time. So yeah, I didn't tell him off or anything, I just thanked him for his time, and it was my pleasure to meet him, before leaving. Seriously...very turn offish experience. I have had the opportunity to interact with Sim Wong Hoo when I was working at Creative during their Warehouse sales 3/4yrs back, and he was honestly a caring boss. He was concerned about his staff, despite me being the lowest in the food chain, a part-timer. He asked how was the sales, the food, and if we had enough time to eat. Reminding us that though its important to sell,do not forget to take our meals to prevent gastric problems. How down to earth is that man?</div></blockquote>Different people different tatics,  in Creative you were lucky to have a good boss but to be honest how many good bosses are there in the real world?<br>In Cortina each customer is precious cos their commision and job hangs on whether the customer buys the item or not the watch is a "want" not a real "need". In Creative is different cos the customer who buys the item becos is a "need" not a "want"<br><br>You got a lot to learn in life.</div>

Irregardless of whether or not the customer is buying. Tell me this, being totally objective...whats the difference between the response and that of an ah beng at SLS?<br><br>When the focus is the commission and not the customer satisfaction...the principle purpose is already wrong. You don't sell an inanimate object, you sell an experience.</div>
