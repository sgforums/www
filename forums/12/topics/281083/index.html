            <div class='col-md body'>so sianz.. its been like 8 months since i broke up with my ex gf. and now i have another gf but i dun really know what i want. when she is with me i feel so happy and always wanna be with her. but when she is not around, i just dun have the feeling of wanting to find her or talking to her through the phone even. i dunno what's wrong with me but i always think of my ex gf at times. think of all the wrong that she has done to me and the fact that she left me for possibly a colleague of hers perhaps which she always denies.<br><br>My ex gf is into religion now and thru her frenster i can see that she puts up my pics with her when we had happier times. and recently my ex gf called to ask some qns about my well being and all. but i know that i will never accept her back for what she did to me although i really do love her alot. when i am with my current gf, i feel that should another person who i really love alot come along, i will just go along with that gal.<br><br>Sometimes i feel that i have become a 'player'. I enjoy being in gals' company like that of my current gf. i always looked forward to meeting her when we were not an item. but after being together and 1.5 months later we had an argument, it got me thinking what i really want and if i really love this gal or am i just waiting for someone i really love to come along?<br><br>This gal also has a bf who she has been with for 2 yrs. and she is like in a trianglular relationship with me. she loves me much more than her 2 yr bf. and the fact that i dun really know her frenz and family etc after 2 months just futher makes me wanna break off from the relationship and go back to my singlehood lifestyle. but i am unable to do it as of now becoz i do not wanna make her cry(tried it once before and she cried). So i am really confused.<br><br>both of are 25 yrs old btw. i sometimes feel that i haf so much time in life to find someone whom i will truly love; someone who i wont mind spending all my time accompanying her etc etc. but yet at other times i feel that i am so old.. and that its just better to stay with someone who loves me instead(like this current one). so confused..and sianz.. sigh..</div>
