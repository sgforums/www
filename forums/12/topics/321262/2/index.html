              <p><br>I think the reason why divorce is on the rise is because not many actually think about the long term and even less endure through it. Mainly because some people settle down before their state of mind allows it, i.e they are not yet ready to be parenting a kid or lead an attached lifestyle that demands contribution. Thus the phrase 'no-strings-attached'.</p>
              <p>Dating I would like to say is to know the person better and not readily plunge into a serious relationship, that comes later. Firstly, if I was in such a scenario, I would definitely question(once she is comfortable enough) why she had a divorce, the situations and circumstances. Afterwhich it is for you to decide.</p>

              <p>You obviously are inexperienced as your nick suggests and haven't been in a matured relationship. If your partner is willing to commit as of now and have evidently worked for the relationship; it is sufficient. Surely it will infiltrate the minds once in a while, but instead of avoiding it; it would be better to have a heart-to-heart talk. Firstly to be honest with your past and secondly to reassure his/her dedication to the partner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When a quarrel occurs, only the immature/woman(for having no more points to argue with - I'm kidding ;D) will bring up the past, which has NO relation to the reason of argument.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thankfully my girlfriend and I, our angry confrontations often ransom an explanation and that once said is deemed fit enough for forgiveness and understanding.</p>

              <p><br>Ya u r rite, i am really inexperience and must learn from you. Haha hope it is really a heart-to-heart talk. Although i am inexperience but from my experience, i know lairs will never admit lying even the evidence are there. Gd luck and hope you really mean what u say, haha.</p>

              <p>I personally dun agree, at the end of the day, its the heart that counts. Unless he is singled by death, I will give the go ahead.

              <p>Well you may say that perhaps his wife is like a compulsive gambler and he cannot finance her doings and she is spoiling the kids. But instead of being a corrector, he is too powerless to control the situation.</p>

              <p>And furthermore, if his ex-wife returns after 20-30 years, his kids are going to side with their maternal parent. Not you.</p>

              <p>.....this is tricky, need to talk further</p>
              <p>..... The "step" word is no longer a stigma, people are open minded these days. I certainly don't mind. I'd rather her kids just treat me as a friend if they are not under her custody.</p>
              <p>Anyway, dating a divorcee with kids is not easy, you gotta win more than one heart and soul</p>
