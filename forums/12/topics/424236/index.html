              <p>Hi, </p>
              <p>Does a drunk guy know what he is doing all along ? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recently, my godbrother got drunk at a Friend's Birthday Party. He was offered to be sent home by one girl whom he don't even know her name. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The next day when he wake up, he is naked at the girl's house. He wasn't sure if sex did took place. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He had told his gf(4 years relationship involve sex with her) honestly what happen. Even suggest to break up with her as her feels that he is in the wrong the first place. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it possible not to know what you did when you were drunk? Or the girl is trying to con for money? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My brother told me before, a girl tried to con him before. They did not had sex but then he was also awake naked. But he dunno what happen. Later then he know the girl con his money as a result of it. </p>

              <p>your godbrother is telling the truth....</p>
              <p>if very drunk, many people go into deep sleep after that... and you can strip him but he still won't wake up... some will even throw up and still won't wake up... and next morning then realize they are sleeping in their own vomit... its common</p>
              <p>the part about having sex... don't worry. its possible to have sex with a sleeping girl but its near to impossible to have sex with a sleeping guy...</p>

              <p>The guy's thing is already standing, so the girl strip him to do it? Cos she is despo for it ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One big problem is my godbro dun wan to tell me or any other people who the heck that girl came from. I think he have to go pass his ego first. I had a tough time trying to gather details from him for the past 3 days. He wasn't willing to tell me at first, but end up he still told me when no one was around looking at him. I can't sense that he felt regret but it's a little too late.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He didn't even want to reply any of his ex-gf's msg. Cos his's ex-gf sent alot of stuff saying bad about him. She even said she wanna expose this to the public to let everyone know. However after that at night she apologise to him. Saying she was really very angry and i feel it's more like she love him alot but he is like trying to run away from this problem. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the part above how i know it, is i go see his hp. Usually he dun mind i see his phone de. But he go toilet then i saw it. But i think he has a rather big ego. Cos the gf did tell him, that they can go through it together but he refuse. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hard to find this kinda gf le. I think this is really true love. He did wrong le, she still able to try to salvage this r/s. But for him, i think maybe he needs time. </p>

              <p>Hi, </p>
              <p>Does a drunk guy know what he is doing all along ? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recently, my godbrother got drunk at a Friend's Birthday Party.
              He was offered to be sent home by one girl whom he don't even know
              her name. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The next day when he wake up, he is naked at the girl's house.
              He wasn't sure if sex did took place. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He had told his gf(4 years relationship involve sex with her)
              honestly what happen. Even suggest to break up with her as her
              feels that he is in the wrong the first place. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it possible not to know what you did when you were drunk? Or
              the girl is trying to con for money? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My brother told me before, a girl tried to con him before. They
              did not had sex but then he was also awake naked. But he dunno what
              happen. Later then he know the girl con his money as a result of
              it. </p>

              <p>Nope, a really drunk person do not have any recollections of what happen during the period.</p>
              <p>They can seems to behave normal but those who know them well would know that they had lost it or starting to lose it...</p>
              <p>Even a person under the influence of lots of alcohol might have trouble remembering what he did last night before waking up...</p>

              <p>For this type of case, usually the guy who know how to
              drink will know his limitation, he can get sober or tipsy but not
              completely wipe out. I believe your so called God bro had been
              spiked, I use to do that on guy who feel they are very macho and
              challenge me 5 bottles, and after 3 bottles, he go down sleeping
              like a pig, so I won and take the cash </p>

              <p>It is definitely possible not to know what one is doing while drunk, to answer your question.</p>
              <p>Before total drunkness, one can possibly at most only remember bits and bits when they start to become "high".</p>
              <p>Bad luck for him, if only he had brought a few friends who will bring him home or just not get drunk.</p>
