If a girl liked you, in order to forget somebody whom she's loved from afar, &amp; 1 day, she finds out that No matter how fond she is of you, you'll never be able to replace that person whom she sought so desperately to replace?<br><br>Let's say you'd fallen deeply in love with her by then, &amp; hoped to marry her.  How would you feel?<br><br>To me, there's a risk of "residual feelings" that can't be gotten rid of just because you've found someone else to like.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ray87:</div><div class="quote_body">mc square, being a youth myself, i am interested to hear your perspective on why the idea of liking another as a way to forget the current might bring undesirable consequences to relationships.<br><br>I thought for a moment and tried to figured out the truth in your advice. Is it because that we shouldnt "like another" just for the purpose of "forgetting someone"?<br><br>And to ethan-1,2-diol, be fair to yourself and dont let yourself suffer in pursue of a futile relationship. Yeah.. futile, at least in the current sense when you are still a student and do not have anything that can make your teacher think of you as worthy partner.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ethane-1,2-diol:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi, I'm new here. My fren recommended me this site and I found it quite gd. Was able know about what is happening arnd the community and how ppl felt about things that are happening around us. As an individual, I too has a problem and I'm not sure how to go about handling it. Hope someone out there will be able to help me find a solution.<br><br>I'm a guy, age 18. Going to be enlisted to NS soon :X. Currently studying at a local junior college. like many other guys, I do have crushes for this gal or that gal, and they nv last long. That's besides the point. But recently, I actually started to develop 'feelings' for my maths teacher. (tml's A'lvls Maths Paper :X) Yep, U are not seeing things. I have a crush on my maths teacher. Or maybe it's more than just a crush. I dunno. She's rather young, not much older than me, quite pretty and most impt of all, she's just so nice. She's nice to everyone (my classmates) and her smile really melts my heart. Maths used to be my hack-care subject i.e. do well = gd lor, nv do well = so be it. But all this changed after I got to know her i.e. ever since I got into JC. I worked hard for maths everytime, and my results nv disappointed her. When I dun think of her as a teacher, she's actually the kinda gal that most guys would wanna treat her well and respect her. Occasionally, I try to get her attention by doing all the small little things e.g. treat her to sweets, help with things etc. And everytime she would reciprocate with a nice n gentle smile. And our relationship became more than just a teacher-student relationship. Dun get it wrong, it's just a became a even closer teacher-student relationship. haha?<br><br>But, she already had a boyfren.<br><br>Recently, I got to know her handphone number (not really a big deal, all my classmates have her no.) and started to sms her occasionally. Initially, it was about maths and school. But the sms content started to change from maths to smth else more. Like I would ask her how is she, go to bed early etc - concerns that's beyond a student. Then Lately, she seems to realise I'm not just a ordinary student and started to give me 'cold shoulder'. I dunno whether izzit just my own thinking or is it true. Close frenz tell me to stop thinking of her, but I always fail to do so. At least whenever I have her in my mind, my maths seems unstoppable i.e. in preparation for A'lvls, I nv had problems with my maths. Then again, I'm the kinda guy who believes that in order to forget someone, you have to like another. I'm really afraid I'll still be thinking of her after the A'lvls, and thru-out the course of NS.<br><br>Wad shld I do?<br><br>Btw, good luck to all those taking A'lvls!</div></blockquote>u are treading in dangerous water.... i was in similar situation, only that my date is from my school.... coz u are in a position of taking A levels, n after As u go NS super sian nothing much to do only will think of girls and having dates... if u are having relationship problems... ur ns will be very tough... mind thinking of girl and still have to go thru super tough physical training... my friend who broke up with his gf b4 NS, broke down half way during NS and he's a bit psycho ever since.<br><br>try to get urself distracted by other things...im sure ur teacher thought u are just a friendly sweet student b4, but now she probably think u might have a crush on her and so she subtly ignoring u... pls dont be an asshole, just forget about her... do well for As, then go NS, then after ORD, go uni n flirt with the uni girls... trust me uni girls are better for u... dont go after teachers... when u go uni u will forget abt her one..coz everyday also can see very pretty fashionable girls.. sometimes in mini skirts, sometimes in other things..dont be an emotional wussy, go n fall in love with a teacher, somemore few yrs older... grow up bro...</div>
