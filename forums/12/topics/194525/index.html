            <div class='col-md body'>I was in de same situation as you... one yr back exactly....<br><br>I did the exactly same thing as you... more or less... and now it's had me seriously worrying about my future.<br><br>A levels is no joke... you've probably heard it all before but here it is from a "war veteran"... hehe... it is seriously the most important thing in your life now...pls don't throw it away. If you do, you're effectively throwing away the next 50 yrs of your life.<br><br>1)Understand it is you and only you who can make the change... posting in here won't help much...yeah, pple would give you advice... but it's up to you to follow them. You must first want to change n you must really want to do well in the A levels. A's in de single most important thing in ur life right now. It's like life or death issue. Once you really understand this... you won't be sleeping anymore...<br><br>2)do something...anything....draw up a study plan and set incremental goals n work towards them. <strong>simple things like finishing up assignments and tutorials are enough.</strong> These are the small important steps tt will help you gain confidence.<br>But if you can, study in advance. <strong>It's still not too late, but there is a lot of things to cover n no time to waste.</strong><br>It is damn difficult to make a start... I know by experience... but once you get into the rhythym of studying it wld be easier..<br><br>3)Look into the way you're studying... it's probably you're study skills or style of working tt is causing this prob. choose a style that suits you... maybe you feel more motivated in the morning? or night? Maybe it's the way you make notes? Try mind-mapping..<br><br>4)If all this doesn't work, form a study group with some friends... this is what I wish I'd done... any people who are serious about the A's.. rope in the intelligent ones in your class to help... if they r nice pple they wld agree to help... and they will usually try to make sure you all don't end up chatting during the study sessions...<br><br>Trust me, if you still feel like slacking.. think about this... nx yr when you've fin your A level you will have six $%*^ing months to slack before uni... trust me it gets REALLY boring... you wld almost wish ur back at school and for some exercise for ur brains...</div>

Help?</div></blockquote>While my A lvls looks such a distant memory that it is almost prehistoric when I look back now(well, maybe that's how little an impression it left on me)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> , I can certainly empathise with what you're going through.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Personally, I must admit I didn't study much(and I'm not encouraging you to take after me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ), but I don't think I did badly at all. Basically, what motivated me then was just a matter of comprehending where I wanted to go(from aspiring to be at the world's best universities in the near future to achieving big goals 20-30 yrs down the road) in life and how my A lvls would open the doors towards fulfilling those dreams. So with all that sorted, motivation wasn't much of a problem, really(to be honest, I'm not sure if my style would work for you if you happened to be one of those just drifting along and haven't really thought about your future and long-term goals).<br><br>Nevertheless, do take heed of xXStormFallXx's suggestions(<strong>well, except for points 1 and 2 which I personally disagree with</strong>) - however, only apply them if you're certain those styles work for you; afterall, everyone has to figure how he/she studies best. For me, studies were <strong>never</strong> matters of life and death - it really is nothing more than just one of the countless games I've played in my life - and contrary to what most Asians would tell you, it's not something you'll look back and dwell too much on on your deathbed. By saying that, of course I do not mean it's totally unimportant and that you shouldn't put in a single iota of effort, but it certainly helps if you understand studies is only one of life's many priorities and you enjoy the learning process more than being obssessed with wanting to do well solely for the sake of the grades alone. If you had an interest in what you're learning and are still able to keep a sense of perspective, I'm sure you wouldn't be afflicted by 'pressure/stress' as much as some of your peers are...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Afterall, I've always believed in a philosophy which puts stress/pressure in perspective : "There's no pressure in studies - pressure is when poor people struggle to feed their families, people averting a natural disaster or terminally-ill patients coming to terms with life's challenges". Hope that helps!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
