To feel good about your relationship you need to feel good about yourself.<br>5. Make room in your relationship for differences and value them.<br>6. Relationships are flexible Â– let your relationship adapt and grow with you.<br>7. Set goals for your relationship and plan your future together.<br>8.

            <div class='col-md body'>Relationships were never easy. Frankly speaking, I don't see any true love sparkling at the age of 16. You are still too young. You see, you fell for another gal when you are in a relationship. You are simply not ready.<br><br>But then, I do have friends who are very blissful and lucky. I think they are meant for each other. They were together when they were 14. Now, they're married. 9 years of courtship, now husband and wife. But, such examples are hard to find.<br><br>I advise you not to indulge too much into relationship now. At least wait till you have gone army, then you will think differently.<br><br>Good luck.</div>

Or did you jump into it just because she likes you, and you like her?<br><br>Too often, many people jump into relationships without giving second thoughts. Why? That's because they're only looking for people who will love them, instead of people who will meet each other's needs. Such relationships will more often than not cool off very quickly.<br><br>Ask yourself these questions before you go into a relationship:<br><br>- What do I want out from a relationship?<br><br>- What do I want from my partner?<br><br>- WHY do I need to get into a relationship?<br><br>This is important for both genders because it allows both parties to understand what they truly want/need from a relationship, which is essential for a long lasting relationship.<br><br>I strongly suggest  you and your ex-girlfriend to ask yourselves these questions. Perhaps you'll get a clearer answer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>guys always do that and i can tell you it hurts like fuk. Your selfish in a sense that you never think about her feelings and you expect her to consider yours now? she'll probably be afraid to trust you again, afraid that she might get hurt.</div>

Crush is also a form of love. So dun go and hurt ur ex when shes happy. Just leave her alone. U dun deserve her anymore!</div>

Dunno why i love him tat much also.. Haha.. We got along very well..<br><br>Almost a yr have gone by since we broke off.. Still i am missin him alot.. Though i have given up totally on him.. Our breakoff was mutal.. But then.. Haha.. He now has got on wit life, found a new gf.. Whereas for mi.. I am still unable to start on a new relationship..<br><br>I feel tat.. Hmm.. True.. Is indeed a mistake to go steady at such a young age, say 16... There isn a gd time whereby people say.. U r still young or etc.. It all depends on ur maturity level..<br><br>U may feel tat.. I am old enough.. I am matured enough to handle all of tat in a relationship... I am very much in love.. etc.. Haha.. i been thru all tis..<br><br>But then, i come to realise tat.. I was wrong.. At different pt of time.. I stead at 15.. so at 16.. Ok.. my thinkin still bt the same.. But when i reach 18, and we both got into poly.. Change of envt, friends..<br><br>Suddenly, we both changed.. our preceptions, our thinkin.. It was then we realise tat we both were not rite for each other.. Despite how hmm.. close we were..
