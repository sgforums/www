Is your dad still providing for the family financially, emotionally and physically?<br>If yes, then his flings is just to satisfy his sexual needs. Some men are more sexual active than others. Just like when you feel hungry, some men are hungry for sex - it's natural. Men can be sexually active up till more than 80 years of age. Even if they are not virile, they are horny (no bad connotations) And if they cannot get satisfaction from home, they will look elsewhere.<br><br>You just have to find some ways to educate him on STDs. Are you old enough? How did you find out?<br><br>You are in a very bad position to help your mum but getting more family engagements is needed to ween him of his craving for sex. Asia women, especially our parent generation, are usually less sexual active and the only reason for sex is procreation. Which, we homo sapient are not created that why...some even argued that we are polygamous!<br><br>2. If your dad is neglecting the family financially, emotionally and physically, then something must be done. This is usually the last straw. But before you go all out, your parents must go for marital counsellings. Sometimes it may help.<br><br>How did you find out? Is it recent of it's been a while? Need all these info to give better evaluation and advises.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By the way Mir4cle, how is the relationship between your father and you ?<br><br>Do you have other siblings ? Are they close to your dad ?<br><br>In situations like this, the last thing you want to do is to ostracize your father.<br><br>Now is the time to tighten the bonds, not losen it.<br><br>If you don't have a fantastic relationship with your father , it is time to start building it.</div>

And it is not fair to you and your brother, neither is she being fair to your father.<br><br>Leaving a letter to your dad before you leave, means he has no chance to explain his side of the story to you. Is that being fair to him ?<br><br>You can summon your courage and talk to him.<br><br>Say something like this to start .<br><br>" Dad, thank you for taking care of us all these time. We really love you. And because of you, we are very fortunate to have a wonderful and supportive family.<br><br>But there is something that is really bugging me, and I really don't want to go home without having a adult-adult talk with you. The last thing I want is to have any misunderstanding between us.<br><br>I heard you talking to a lady last night, and I saw some messages while cleaning up the computer. I'm wondering, are you having second thoughts about the love you have for mom ?<br><br>I can understand that you are a man, and being away from your wife for such a long time , can make you very lonely. And you do have your needs too.<br><br>But I do hope you will do what is right for the family.<br><br>We love you, respect you and appreciate your sacrifices.<br><br>Both me and brother looks up to you and sees a great example of a loving father and a husband."<br><br>I know this can be an emotional time for you, if you cannot handle talking face to face.<br><br>You can pen this down into a letter, but make sure he gets the time to read it and response to you while you are still there.<br><br>Perhaps you can ask him out to a nice and quiet coffee place and hand this to him, let him read it and wait for his response.<br><br>Be strong.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>do not do anything yet...you could make it very bad for the whole thing to recover.....speak to your mother and ask if she needs to have this in the open...there are folks who can keep things under pretense and things move on...sometimes it works and other times it doesn't.....<br><br>at 18 and you want to engage your father? he'll probably get mad and may even leave the marriage to spite you.....you are in no position to confront and don't listen to some wise ass about writing some silly note.....picture this, when your father reads the letter and he says to you, "who the hell are you to teach your father!" then he leaves the family for some china slut...</div>
