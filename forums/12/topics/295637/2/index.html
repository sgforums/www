Me thinks half the time, kids with cheating parents wind up in casual relationships for the most part of their adulthood. Fast forward 10 or 20 years, we scratch our heads and wonder why weÂ’re screwed up, then wonder what went wrong when our parents were faulty specimens to begin with Â– such is life.<br><br>DonÂ’t let the task of savaging their marriage fall upon your shoulders Â– itÂ’s not possible for anyone outside of it to understand the whys and hows of their relationship.<br><br>Writing your dad a letter sounds like a neat idea - let it all out but go easy on the swear words. Continue being a friend to your mom, listen to what she wants to say but please know that the task of savaging their marriage is not on your shoulders.<br><br>ItÂ’s not your shoulder because no one else can fully understand your dad and mom - no one knows what brought them together in the first place and besides, adults are complex, what with their need for desire, affection, bond, thrill, familiarity (as if itÂ’s all supposed to mean something so important)<br><br>Just be a good listener and keep the faith.<br><br>Just my two cents worth.<br></div>
