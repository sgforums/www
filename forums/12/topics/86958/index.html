Honestly we did not get into any arguements or anything like that. Neither did i do anything seriously wrong. I treated her as well as i could, pampered on her etc. Yet she complained that our relationship is getting routine and boring. When i ask her what did i do wrong, she tells me she doesn't know, and that somehow her feelings for me just faded.<br><br>Gradually, by talking with one of her best friend and much thoughts, i conclude that she is feeling insecure. Throughout our relationship, she will for no apparent reason start crying and pleading with me not to leave her, even though i have no such intention at all. By the way, she comes from a broken family, her father married and remarried several times.......<br><br>Actually i tried not SMSing her and etc, but that backfired. She simply don't give a damn.<br><br>My point is that she may be unsure of our relationship, but the way she is behaving towards me really hurts! I told her how hurted i am, how unappreciated i feel. But yet she continues doing so, i am just wondering how much more i can take?</div>

My ex gf did the same thing to me. It's also 3 years. Anyway apparently she's been cheating on me and it's just her way of telling me to back off and just let go. Which of cos I did. It was hard but in the long run it's the best solution. Sure we will be hurt but we learn from our relationship this way. It sucks when you get shit from someone you actually loves a lot. Anyway take care and take heed my feelings. It's just my 2 cents worth <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

She claims she suddenly unsure about her feelings for her a few months back. After going through so much with her these 3 years, i really couldn't bear to give up.

Meanwhile she is still confused on whether to break up. In her state of confusion, her treatment towards me is so cold! When she feels like replying to my SMS, she will reply, if not, it's like my SMS are invisible. Everytime i call her, she will be busy with something! She is happier being with her colleagues and friends than with me!

She's doesn't want to say.. She doesn't wants to be claim as the "bad person" who initates the break-up..<br><br>Her attitutde has change towards you.. What's the use of hanging onto something where there's no return.. You are the only one giving and not her... she feels happy with anyone else.. but not you! she already has the intention to break-up.. her confusion only signifies to say or not to say.. and not.. whether to even consider she loves or do not love you..<br><br>Let her go.. let yourself breathe.. you are near to death.. if you dun let go.. you'll be choke to death one day... get out of her life... give yourself time.. to adjust back to your own living.. and have a new start again.. 3 years.. oso not say long.. anyway.. in r/s is not the time that counts.. is the moments and happiness you had and give to each other..<br><br>Don't look back..

I didn't do anything to let her down. Our 3 years relationship was doing really really well. Out of a sudden, she lost interest in me and claims that she just wants to be alone.
