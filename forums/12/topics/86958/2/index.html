            <div class='col-md body'>she said  that she finds the relationship a routine? maybe u can try breaking up with her ,  she would be inhuman if she dosent feel sad . u all have been together for 3 yrs rite? after breaking up, ask from her friends how sad she is and u would know if she really needs u (emotionally). if she really luvs u, she will feel sad and be conscious of how much she luvs u.. u have a chance to win her heart again.. but its a very risky solution larz.. i've tried this, we patched up 7 months later, its alot of hard work.. couples who get back together after breaking up wont consider another break up that easily..<br><br>my 2 cents worth la, wish u the best.. keep us updated k?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am very afraid that my wait will be in vain too.<br><br>Honestly, looking at the fact that he told you to keep the joint account and the car, i find that he is not that serious in wanting to break up. I thought that perhaps he is trying to use breaking up as a tool to make you do something he wants.<br><br>Have you been doing something that really annoys him? Or not been doing something that he wants you to?</div>

She claims she suddenly unsure about her feelings for her a few months back. After going through so much with her these 3 years, i really couldn't bear to give up. So i decide to hang on to this relationship, no matter what. At least until she tells me in the face that she wants a break-up.<br><br>It has been months and i am still hanging on. Meanwhile she is still confused on whether to break up. In her state of confusion, her treatment towards me is so cold! When she feels like replying to my SMS, she will reply, if not, it's like my SMS are invisible. Everytime i call her, she will be busy with something! She is happier being with her colleagues and friends than with me! My mind can't help comparing her current attitude towards me with her behavior just a few months back!<br><br>The pain is indescribable!<br><br></div></blockquote>Quite bad ...but if u kanna lik me den u more headache, friend see ex(tat time we still together) going hotel wid her guy friend...tat is knn...but true lah, when te incident kanna you, little bit is already intoloratable liao...</div>
