Melbourne is the tourism capital of Australia.<br><br>Sydney has a penal colony history while Melbourne's history was made up of enterprising migrants.<br><br>Sydney has the famous bondi beach. Melbourne's beaches not as famous as Sydney's.<br><br>Sydney has harbour bridge. Melbourne has Southbank. Brisbane has story bridge which is nicknamed the poor man's bridge .<br><br>Sydney houses the Gay Capital : Oxford Street, and famous Redlight district of Kingcross. Melbourne is more tamed with Chapel Street - aka the nightlife.<br><br>Sydney has the harbour. Melbourne has the spirit of tasmania ( just cross over to tassie in the cruiseliner) . However from Sydney you can take a coach to  the Capital of Australia, Canberra ( which is good for day tours only) or you can cruise Port Melbourne to Yarra  and smell the fumes of cargo ships.<br><br>Sydney is sprawled out ...Melbourne is planned out. Transportation costs are a consideration if you plan to see all parts of Sydney . Sometimes their sydney buses don't even come. Melbourne has interconnecting trams lines.<br><br>Sydney has Sydney University which is the oldest university in Australia - go to the Great Hall and School of Public Health  if you can. Melbourne has University of Melbourne . Both are sandstone universities aka old fart established unis.<br><br>There is Newtown in Sydney for all your eating delights , Haymarket (chinatown) and then double bay for gelato , leichardt for little italy , cabramatta ( for vietnamese food or if you want to see if you get robbed) - all far apart and public transport might not reach all areas. Melbourne has Lygon ( little italy), Chinatown, Greek Precint which is side by side and within walking distance and then you can take a tram to richmond to have a look at the vietnamese part of town.<br><br>Sydney has fox studios (nothing spectacular) and Melbourne has the Science Museum.<br><br>Each place has its oddities. Depends on what you want.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by storywolf:</div><div class="quote_body">Ok I stay in both Sydney and Melbourne before, so can tell you more about it.<br><br>Sydney much a larger city with more city stuff, like better resturants, theaters and city stuff. People who say they like it more is people who like city living, those that like harbours, great resturants, theaters and other city stuff.  Outside sydney they too have good attraction like wineyard &amp; bluemountains.<br><br>Melbourne, is much more of a small city. But I kind of like it better,  Sydney maybe big and more city stuff, but it is more messy, and shopping all over the place. When you go there, there is alway time constraint, thus for sydney, with the stuff all over the place, even the things are there, you will not have the time to see much. Melbourne is more organised with things all closer grouped togehter, thus make shopping more fun and fruitful.<br><br>Both Sydney &amp; Melbourne offer mountain areas , wineyard and other stuff. But I like melbourne better - as I guess the diverify of the attractions is more and closer distance.<br>Getting tour in Australia is rather expensive. If you can drive, it is much cheaper to rent a car and drive it yourself and visit more destinations.<br></div></blockquote>thanks Folks for your kind advice.<br>It really helped me in my travel decision.<br><br>Good news is.....after reading your postings and advice, I've just booked myself an air ticket to Melbourne.<br><br>I do like the mix of different attractions that Melbourne offers, the Ocean Road,  Philip Island, wineyard, etc.<br><br>One more question....where's the best area to stay in Melbourne? any recommended hotels? My budget is SGD 150 per night.<br>Criteria: central, near to major shopping area / tourist attraction / transport.<br>Preferably a hotel that comes with room broadband (to catch up on my work emails at night), i understand if fee applies.<br><br>thanks lots, folks.<br></div>
