            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, some Singaporeans are quite racist to other Asians too, esp those who come from other poorer countries. I experienced this in Singapore. Last yr, I stayed in Elizabeth hotel, a nice hotel but a racist reception. The black man (maybe Malaysian) was great, but the other Chinise man whom I was told as the Reception Manager,  he was a nasty racist. Will never stay this hotel again. Please if you have friends from those places, do not book them to stay in this hotel.</div>
