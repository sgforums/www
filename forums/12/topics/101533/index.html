Its not about the question of love nor anything (as a healthy good BGR relationship could also incorporate sex into the picture) - the problem is about the emotional aspects that comes with the act. Love is about empathy and feelings: to ease one's desire at emotional expense of the other, is none of the two qualities mentioned and in fact, its more lust than the act of love.<br><br>As long as a portion of you don't feel at ease - drop the idea. It's not so much about the V question - its about respecting one's decision, which boils down to personal understanding of their partner.<br><br>Like when your partner value soccer more than his life and you completely dread it, thinking what so fun about 20 odd people chasing one dumb ball - would he force you to watch with him, despite KNOWING that you simply dread it?<br><br>Or if you are a devout buddhist and he a faithful christian, would you force him to burn incense and pray?<br><br>P.S: Personal understanding of partner is crucial. Remember sex cannot deliver stress (in fact, it de-stress to certain extend), however if it does, avoid placing yourself in such situations. <strong>You are simply not emotional in tune and prepared</strong>, yet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

There're lots of selfish guys around with the view (gf=sex) and who dun give a rat's ass to their gf's feelings and needs. From what i see, many couples just stop becoming lovey-dovey anymore after sex has entered the relationship, and its always the girl who has to bear the psychological and physical aftereffects into their next relationship after both parties call it quits.<br><br>You DO NOT need sex for love and intimacy in the relationship.<br><br>And please don't be fooled by all the deprived army boy crap.. If that were true i would have died long ago and not have survived ns and 4 years of study afterwards with my gf. If he can't even handle his sexual urges now, how sure can you be of his faithfulness to you when he meets other girls outside???<br><br>I'm pretty sure that overseas trip is no more than an excuse for him to get an opportunity to corner you alone in a hotel room in a foreign land.. so pls think thrice!<br><br>Personally if i were you, i'd have ditched that guy manz..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
