            <div class='col-md body'><strong> If he says the words "show me u love me by having sex" , you tell him that if he truly loves you and respects you , he will wait til marriage (or whenever). If he breaks up with you over this, it is not your fault at all - it is just his fault that he can't keep his pants on.  </strong><br><br>I also think it is best to wait til a person is married to have sex. Marriage is a secure system whereby two persons have to combine resources to support each other. Sex, as you know, can lead to unexpected nine months of a gestational "problem" . At least if you are married , any unexpected "problem" could be at least respectable and supported by a person you truly love.<br><br>I am not being religious here but advising caution <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>'JUST SAY NO' He sounds like those type of guys who likes to control gf through emotional blackmail. Personally I would advise you to ditch the loser cos you deserve someone better. If hes so desperate ask him to go GL and give him the money for a pack of condom. You are still so young so don't make the mistake of doing this for a jerk. Save it for your husband. And don't even think of going on a oversea trip alone with him. God knows what might happens since he sound like someone who allows his little head to think for him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  Drat reading about this kind of creature really &lt;&gt; piss me up.</div>

Ur bf shld respect u. I feel that the fact that ur bf wanted to break with u bcos u din have sex with him is really ridiculous. Does he love u at all? If he does, he shld respect ur decision at all and shld love u deep enough to noe how u feel and what u want. His reactions questions his love for u. So wat even if hes in ns? There are alot of guys in ns who stil din do with their gf or some other girls.<br><br>Is he interested in love or in sex with u? Not giving him the benefit of the doubt, I will say if u go with him to the trip, 100% u will return not a virgin. I believe thats not what u want now based on what u say. IF u are not ready, he shld wait until u are and respect ur decision till then.<br><br>This issue is about how he shld respect u. DUn have to think too much abt it. Dun feel comfortable, just dun give to him. If he wants to break, just goes to show hes not serious abt a relationship. Respect urself, protect urself and be urself. I will want to give him a slap based on the fact he wanted to break with u based on such a reason.</div>
