            <div class='col-md body'>hmm... one of my most disturbing dreams was that i simply beat someone to death. murdered him in cold blood and i didn't even know the guy. the horror of the dream was the aftermath of the murder, when i knew i had committed a crime, and that it was a crime punishable by death, and the feeling of dread, of fearful anticipation, of knowing the police were hnting me down, and how i was finally caught. The emotions of being caught, of being hunted down like some prey, that was the nightmare...<br><br>i also had a dream earlier on, where i dreamt i was back in my primary school playground, and i was a student. it was morning assembly, and they were preparing to hang me from the chin up bars, because the school rules stated that the penalty for not handing up your homework was death, and i didn't hand up my homework the day b4, so i was going to be excecuted during the next morning assembly.<br>*shiver*</div>

Like you're trying to reach out to the world, to the people around you.... Communicate... But seems like there's either no reason or no opportunity?<br><br>About the outstanding 'guy' in your dream... Just someone you wish to have him disappear from your life? (not necessarily having him killed in any sense) He can also be symbolic in your dream. A sign of 'suppression'.</div>

Likely of the 2 possibilities...<br><br>1. It's just a 'sensual dream'. The context of the dream itself doesn't really hold anything meaningful. But rather, you may have experienced which left an 'impression' on you just around the period when you had that dream... It could be something 'physical' or something reallly left quite an 'impact' on your mind..<br><br>2. Your subconscious mind might have been triggered. Was there something which had happened to you probably quite long ago and long forgotten? Somehow that memory has been triggered off probably without you realising it around that period.</div>
