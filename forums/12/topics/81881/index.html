            <div class='col-md body'>i think u r a coward.. no guts to say "i love u" face to face how to jio girls? confession by irc or sms is the worst form of confession loh.. no sincerity at all.. i can tell u she would hv been ur gf one yr ago loh if u haf more guts.. girls r lidat one.. dey say wat concentrate on studies n let nature take its course.. total bullsh|t.. actually in their heart they really hope u will give a big bouquet of flowers n say "i love u"..<br><br>i think wat u do now is.. ask her out this weekend.. like normal outing.. but this time u wear nicer a bit la.. no bermudas or sandals.. den give her a bouquet of roses.. ask her to be ur gf first thing u saw her... give her a surprise confirm will succeed one.. if she has been single 2 yrs already, means she is waiting for u to make the move.. the moment is this weekend bro.. rber.."humji will bring u nowhere"</div>

Yes, all that is important to the element of chase, but insufficient for you to receive your reward because you lack the impact when you finally pop the question.<br><br>You are someone she feels decently comfortable with - you do not belong to the type where she get instant magnetic attraction. Since you do not belong to this category, you can only work hard and play smart. You first minor mistake comes from expressing through virtual space - the fringing` most common way, yet the most insincere as well as the least effective.<br><br>You have kept in contact with her all these while; its time for you to learn to sell yourself and let her discover new aspects of you after these two years. You can attempt to try again, but this time, you may not need to lie low. <strong>Like a straight line curve, you begin easy and advance steadily</strong>, till that MOMENT - you need to win her thoroughly and not simply a question and that's it.<br><br>To win thoroughly is to sweep her off her feet and destroy her womanly instinct to repel chase.
