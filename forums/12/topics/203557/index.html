Our psyche and psychological built up is vastly different. Should he consciously 'forgot' to employ the feminine side of his whole, he revert back to himself.<br><br>We should never measure love according to the number of roses he got for you in valentine day (or the absence of it). What matters is that he loves you for who you are... is willing to accept your knowing flaws and still choose you.<br><br>When a stranger pays you a compliment, it holds greater weight than a compliment from people we know (a.k.a friends and love ones). This is because a stranger doesn't know our vulnerability and how imperfect we are, while the people we know are so emotionally close to us that a compliment from them has this diminished effect because they know us.<br><br>Many times, this is how infidelity first strikes - when a stranger focus more on what lovable about ourselves and our love ones are usually more flaw-centric.<br><br>Has love gone? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>P.S: We must understand that in passion, we all love differently.
