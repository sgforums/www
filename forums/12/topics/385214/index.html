                      Then what you want the guy to do? Masturbate in the girl's mouth just because she came clean (pun intended)? But a lot of it depends on how the guy feels towards the girl though.

              <p> Don't pay for your movie tickets, dinner? you expect him to pay for all your dinner and movies? are you selling your body? nowadays girls want bf to have everything, respect them, buy stuff for them. than must as well go become social escort!!! some girl are contradictive want boy friend to respect them while living of them, you are using his money yet you wanna behave like a queen, if you are taking his money than you must endure all the bad things that he has. your relationship is not base on love but is base on money, if one day the guy is broke than you will leave him as you think that he is no longer a "good boyfriend"(walking atm)......you want to use guys money, than behave like older times women. Listen to thier husband, if you are a capable and indepandant women than use your own money......</p>

              <p>Totally agree with <a href="/users/242112">Mymoja</a></p>
              <p>How about gals who do the very same things towards guys?</p>
              <p>I have seen so many gals who made use of guys and just dump them.</p>
              <p>Like this case.</p>
              <p>A gal friend of mine was so proud that she has completed her degree. When she was asked whether was the course tough she she say no. She boast out loud that she got a guy who did all her homework and project for and she did nothing. The very day she finish her final exam she dump the guy and say he was too ugly for her.</p>
              <p>In reality people who got better looks always wins. The only way to study harder and get better grades than them, to have a better chance in life.</p>

              <p><br>If all the above is his honest behaviour, then I guess I can accept that it is just a common sin.</p>
              <p>Worse is that they pretend to be nice and caring to win your heart then turn around and rape your life and show you who they really are.</p>
              <p>But it won't happen to me cos my is very sharp in detecting dishonesty in guys. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
