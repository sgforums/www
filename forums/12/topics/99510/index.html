            <div class='col-md body'>I think I am in love this girl. I met her while I was working in a departmental store as a part time salesperson 3 years ago. We used to have lunch together and we would take the same mrt home. Life was pleasant then. Even after I quit my part time job, we would still keep in contact with each other via sms. After 1 year of constant smsing and talking on the phone, I decided to express my feelings to her and asked her to be my girlfriend. However, she just ignored me and did not contact me anymore. I was not sure if she agreed, but I guess in my heart I knew it was not meant to be. That was 2 months before I had to enlist for my NS. Therefore, I was left with no choice but to enter NS with a broken heart. During my BMT, I thought of her quite a frequently. Fortunately, NS made me more mature and I realize that what was not meant to be was not meant to be.<br><br>However, fate is rather cruel to me. One day, I received an sms from her saying that she missed my voice. I was rather stunned. Since I was free that day, I decided to give her a call. We talked about anything to everything. Moreover, every night before she reaches home after work, she would sms me asking me what I was doing. For the past month that we have been in contact, we would meet up on weekends just to talk or eat out. This led me to rekindle my feelings for her again. I have tried asking about her past relationships and hinted about us being together. However, she does not seem to be interested in a relationship and would try to change the topic whenever I hint to her. I really donÂ’t have the finest clue as to what she thinks of my chances. Sometimes, I get this feeling that she likes me. Other times, i feel like she is using me to listen to all her worries. Guess I donÂ’t really know her well enough even though I have known her for 3+ years.<br><br>She knows that I am going to Australia to study my degree for the next 3 year. When she knows about that, she smsed me saying that if by the age of 26 or 27, if we both have not settled down, we could both go to the ROM. I was puzzled by what that meant and messaged her saying that I am stunned and am not sure on how to reply the question.<br><br>Now the question I would like to ask is:<br>Could anyone interpret what the above paragraph means?<br>What are my chances to be her b/f from the above scenario?<br>Should I try to ask her directly to be my girlfriend, or just be a good friend to her?<br><br>I like her coz she is very optimistic, good with words and a fun person to be with. Whenever I am with her, I can forget my worries and I can really be at ease.<br><br>I kinda need some advice as i am new to relationship  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div>

Then after she sms you back.. cos she tot you might have forgotten the thought of askng her to be your gf..<br><br>Firstly.. you don't know her well..<br><br>Secondly.. she rejected you.. and after 1 year later.. she contacted you again... Missing your voice? Maybe is becos she knwos that you are a good friend.. someone who can share, listen and talk to at ease..<br><br>Thirdly.. you are going overseas to study.. long distance is not easy to maintain.. Moreover both don't really understand well.. if this r/s were to go further.. is very unstable..<br><br>So I suggest that you and her should be still friends first... Noone can predict what will happen over the years.. As refer to what she says about the 26/27 ROM thing.. Don't take it too seriously.. SHe only say "if" Don't pinned too much hope on it.. There's no need for you to reply.. Jus put a smiley will do..<br><br>Your chances are quite slim.. You wan to get rejected the 2nd time?? Learn from your 1st experience.. Confessed only when you are confident that you both will end up somewhere.. She can be a very good friend.. If you still think that you can handle this.. and still wan to go on.. noone can stop you.. But you must always be prepared for the worst.. Cos i feel that even you both are together.. this wont last long.. Since you are goin overseas.. Unless your bonds are very very strong together..<br><br>Well.. everyone is new to their 1st r/s.. everyone start from somewhere.. Some start off good.. some starts off bad.. Abd then.. there you'll learn..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sounds like she's unsure whether she wants that kind of relationship or not..I would say keep your options open. When you're overseas, anything can happen...and long distance relationships when you're not particularly close are not very likely to succeed.</div>
