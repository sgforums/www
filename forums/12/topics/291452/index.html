            <div class='col-md body'>I got to know G last year. We're in the same class. Used to be sworn enemies at first, but as time passed, we got to know each other better and now we are close friends. I don't know if she does treat me as a close friend but I do, at least I can guarantee that I'm one of the closer ones with her in class. Thinking back now, we were once foe but now friend.<br><br>Everything went on nice daily, always looking out for my 2 best pals(G is one of them, the other one is a guy), always discussing what to have for lunch, enjoys the time spent with both of them, looking forward to the next laugh with them.<br><br>It was until one day(few months ago) when another guy told me that he fell for G, a strange feeling overwhelmed me...like despair. He started by asking if I like M and if we have any special bond. Of course I said no and he went on saying that he can foresee that G and I will be together but I just shooed that sentence away. Then he felt safe enough to confess that he likes G.<br><br>After that incident, I've been pondering what that feeling I had was about. I reflected my memories so many times but I couldn't come to a solution. Or maybe I should say, I didn't dare to tell myself the final answer because I know what it is. Everyday, I'm only staring at the door in the morning because the sight of G is like my coffee for the day, discussed what to have for lunch so I know that she's eating well, enjoys the time spent with her knowing that she's well and also I can hear her voice, always looking forward for the next laugh to see her smile and know that she's at least happy.<br><br>It sucks, I always thought that I treat G only like a buddy and didn't expect myself to slip so easily. I know I can't continue like this, and since we are both in the same team on an important project coming up, having those feelings for her is an even more no no. If luck is on my side, any BGR will only hinder the whole group. If luck isn't on my side, the distance that my confession will make between G and I will break the team.<br><br>That's y I need some of your valuable suggestions on how I can keep my feelings within boundaries. How do I form a heart of stone? I still want to remain as close friends with her, but I do not want to fall for her...<br><br>Thanks for your time.<br><br>CrimsonWind~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you really don't want to go into a r/s with her..?<br>it will be hard at first.. because you are so used to having her around.. laughing, sharing your encounters, practically all the stuff that you are doing involves her.. and when you get involved too much with her, you start to have feelings for her.. this is normal..<br>but to deliberately 'turn your heart to stone', it's gonna be one tough decision.. Let your male friend confess to her.. see what happens.. if she goes into a r/s with him, it will be exceedingly easy for you to distant yourself with her.. because she will be pre-occupied with him.. and slowly your 'position' will drop.. but that's if she really likes the guy a lot la..<br>but you must remember one thing.. once you decide to let this happen, it's going to be a long term thing.. you will feel like sh!t because your best friend will devote time to her bf, and not so much to you anymore, sure there will be times you all can go out together and stuff, but her no.1 will be the bf.. if all goes well, you will be a good friend with her and her bf.. but if not, you hafta be prepared to be clean forgotten..<br>but have you thought of a good scenario..? why do you not want to start a r/s with her..? have her to yourself..? think of the things you can do for her, making her happy, being there for her.. ask yourself this question: <strong>what if she likes you?</strong> are you going to be passive about it..? and let another guy get her..? love is not about "i see her happy with another guy then i also happy" leh.. love is selfish.. you want her, you tell her.. if you want to have a heart of stone, you must have determination.. you must know how to distant yourself from her.. when in your project or team discussion, stop playing around with her, and be all work no nonsense..<br>lastly, think long and think hard.. what is she in your heart? visualize, picture a life without her.. can you do it..? do you want to share your everyday life with another girl? if you can do so, then your heart of stone will come automatically.. if you think of her all the time like your "coffee for the day", you need to act..<br>hope it's useful advice.. cheers..</div>

You can always tell yourself a million times that you don't want to fall in love with her, but if that's of any help in the first place, then you probably won't be in agony.<br><br>The truth is that you are suffering because you are resisting against this natural rhythm of life - you got to accept the emotions that are surfacing and decide how are you going to deal with this love. Constraining Love's presence will only encourage it to escalate out of control and it usually promises much misery.<br><br>You cannot return back to where you come from; you can only decide how you want to move from here. Upon realization of your feelings for your woman, there is simply no way you can revert back being a close friend, without this overwhelming, flooding love that seeks to embrace your relationship with her.<br><br>Deny all you want - at the end of the day, you will face your naked soul alone, with all the suppression you coerced yourself to believe in.<br><br>Sometimes in Love, a boy never grows into a man... until you introduce a competitor. The competitor is not a competitor; it's a catalysis for transformation. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

How attractive do you think she is (my apologies if you are offended by this question)?<br><br>If your long term goal in mind is to be together with her, then chill.

At least, the most basic is dun confess to her when only met once, this kind of thing i know. But after several months being together, somehow i just fall for her, enjoy her companion and all. So just wanna express my thought to her even though i know the chance of succeeding is low. I think TS should really think carefully before confessing to the girl.</div>

If u fail to become couple,will u still want to be good pals with her? If yes,u better be caution of yr subsequent action...<br><br>She is just like TS, from foes to friends. Definitely she will be caught unaware of TS liking her. Even prolong time together doesn't gurantee she will like TS as she may be treating TS as good friends only. Suddenly a good friend situation becomes a bgr thing,how will this affect her? If she realise she has liking for TS,fine! But if still remain platonic friendship,how? The situation will never be platonic again. She will be in an awakward situation which she wants to avoid and TS can say bye bye to this friendship.. Think carefully what u want. Don't confess just becos u wants to. As i mention timing is critical and she must have mental preparation for the confession. Slowly throw small hint day by day to her if u want to attempt this r/s!</div>
