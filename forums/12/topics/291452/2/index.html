If u fail to become couple,will u still want to be good pals with her? If yes,u better be caution of yr subsequent action...<br><br>She is just like TS, from foes to friends. Definitely she will be caught unaware of TS liking her. Even prolong time together doesn't gurantee she will like TS as she may be treating TS as good friends only. Suddenly a good friend situation becomes a bgr thing,how will this affect her? If she realise she has liking for TS,fine! But if still remain platonic friendship,how? The situation will never be platonic again. She will be in an awakward situation which she wants to avoid and TS can say bye bye to this friendship.. Think carefully what u want. Don't confess just becos u wants to. As i mention timing is critical and she must have mental preparation for the confession. Slowly throw small hint day by day to her if u want to attempt this r/s!</div></blockquote>This is indeed a splendid advice thanks CannyOng. TS i think this is something that u should use to consider ur next move <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yup hints are important.. like how u care for her, notice her liking and dislike.. caring and always be there for her.. dont forget , gals have this amazing 6th sense and most of them are correct... i bet she wil somehow sense something that u like her if u throw some hints. but dun turn out like a wussy to suddenly say u love her which will shock her immediately and she might run away.<br><br>The easiest hint that gal can spot any guy like them is that the caring that u show.. how often u always be ther for her.. how often u try to understand how she feel and share with her.. this one will get any gals attention..<br><br>again , dont forget the gal's 6th sense !! and all gals just want to be loved and to understand them...<br><br>u can start by asking how is her day... and if she has any prob, u offer ur help and want to share her problem. and most important thing is that, when a gal tell u their problem of how they feel, just b a listener and NOT a Problem Solver. Listen 1st, understand how she feel bout it then comfort her or take her to yamcha or any fun place.<br><br>I think all gals like dolls, buy her some dolls, if she asked why , u can simply say, u felt like buying it for u and u dont know why <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
