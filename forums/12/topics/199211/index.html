            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, since she has left you, why do you need to wait for her then? Did you do anything wrong or rather so wrong in the first place that makes her leave you? How did she left you for your friend. SOrry for asking too much...<br><br>If its really her fault, why do you need to give her an alternative if in future,she realised that she has chosen a wrong guy???<br><br>ANyway, waiting for her will definitely make yourself more miserable and you will not  be able see what lies ahead. Be happy, make your concious mind think positively. Cheers.</div>
