              <p>She says its because of the cirumstances. (Another guy (our mutual friend) confessed to her too)</p>
              <p>She says she dont want to hurt any of us thats why she dont want to choose.  But I thought this is the worst decision. everyone gets hurt.</p>
              <p>Its me and the guy and she dont know who to pick. isnt it?</p>

              <p>Hi jojo,</p>
              <p>I suppose the answer is no? Its only me confessing to her.</p>
              <p>When I confessed to her that night, she accepted my confession and said she liked me too and she had feelings for me too. however, on that night, she was very unsure on who to choose. She held my hands but i told her i will give her time. </p>
              <p>the next day, she texted me that she will reject the both of us. she said that shes not ready for a relationship now and all sort of reasons. she asked to be friends just like the last time.</p>
              <p>With regards to the 2nd question, I confessed ot her 1month after the guy did so. she avoided his question and did not give him a clear reply, partly because the guy already had a girlfriend. but in the 1 month after the guy confessed to her, we went out and became close.</p>
              <p>yup.</p>

              <p>You are correct. Girls don't want to play the  villian. We know most guys don't take rejection well. We were called nasty names, threatened, hated on by guys we rejected.</p>
              <p>E.g You called her selfish didn't you. </p>
              <p>She's just taking care not to wound your ego, that's why she ask to be just friends with all kinds of lame excuses to just say no to you.</p>
              <p>But alas, you are smarter than that. Be gracious and accept the rejection. </p>
