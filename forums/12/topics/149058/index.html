Candle-lit dinners, ballets, the partner's best friend and a date for the most happening party in town tempt, so much so that one can barely resist falling in love.

At the same time, a overall feeling of happiness and contentment is felt as well.<br><br>In psychology, we always work to achieve the same positive result as we did previously.

A good relationship keep the body, mind and heart stable, healthy and an overall wellness. If we venture deeper, being in Love fulfilled a portion of what the soul needs - the reunification of your 'other half'.

It is unlike the Love of our pets, for we are unable to commuicate with them verbally and Love is kept as it is - Love and Simple, for there isn't anymore sides. Fullstop.<br><br>By knowing more about our Love, in turn, OURSELVES - do we think that Love has gone complicated and no longer functioning the way it used to be?<br><br>Or are we deluding ourselves, thinking that it is better to Love without knowledge than to earn those colours and strive to bring out those colours to its fullest potential?<br><br>We LOVE because we desire to see ourselves in our own portray, drawing our own pictures with glisters and colours... learning the better combination of two separate paints put together... learning WHAT will work and what don't... learning that the Sun isn't painted as black and WHY... and the list goes on forever because we are eternal students of Cupid.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We Love because we want to learn more about ourselves... the angle where the mirror never reveal to us. </strong></span><br><br>It is the knowledge that we seek.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
