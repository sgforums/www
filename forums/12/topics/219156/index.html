            <div class='col-md body'>You are definitely not a weakling.<br><br>It was an accident, I'm sure you didn't ask to injure yourself. It's good that you care about your family. Just give your ankle time to heal and you can start working in Feb. Try not to think of yourself as a burden, it can happen to anybody. Life is full of obstacles, it's how you overcome them that matters. All the best!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My friend once gave me this awesome theory.<br><br>He said that life was like an rpg.<br><br>The people we meet, the people we see they are called NPCs.<br>The small obstacles we have, We call them monsters.<br>And when we overcame this "Obstacles".<br>We'll level up, When we level it means both mentally and physically;So as to prepare us for the "Boss battles"<br><br>The big obstacles; The one you have right now. We call them Bosses.<br>To overcome them, We'll need lots of levels.<br>What does this means, I believe that an operation recovery or sucess rate doesn't depends on the surgeon alone <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The patient should posses a positive mindset, and be ready about it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. Like brownie said, Stop brooding over what had happened. What's most important is what lies ahead.<br><br>There's an old phrase, Yesterday was history. Tommorow is a mystery. And today is a gift, which is why its called Present.<br><br>Your injury happened, You might feel that you'll now be a burden to the family thinking of the things you wont be able to do. And the things you'll need help with. But think about it, [I emphasise on this point] What has happened, already DID HAPPENED. Recover from the incident, and prepare yourself for the surgery. I'll pray for your sucess.</div>
