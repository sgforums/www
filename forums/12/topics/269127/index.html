Therefore, I always could get whatever I wanted.<br><br>During Primary School, I never studied for my entire 6 years.

For some reasons, I passed all my subjects but was thrown to the last class.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Competition was damn high within my school.

Then I continued slacking, till 1 month before O'Levels. I only studied a little, but managed to get decent grades, not good grades but decent enuff.<br><br>Then I went to Poly, before Poly I was always alone, I only had a few good friends, so in Poly, I told myself, I wanted to be the best, wanted to change and make many friends.

            <div class='col-md body'>"Life, is yours smooth?" Wrong focus... you are focusing on the wrong things... whether your life is smooth or not is at best an illusion in your head.. so what if it is smooth or rough? So what? Nothing! Unless you make it into something.</div>
