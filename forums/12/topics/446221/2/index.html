              <p>you call your own child an "it" ? No wonder you are not so keen
              paying for <strong>it</strong>. <strong>it</strong> is not even
              human in your eye. How sad.</p>
              <p>You are leveraging your wife's $3000 so you don't need to pay a
              heftier sum. If she has to stay home and care for your child.. how
              is she going to make that $3000 ?</p>
              <p>If she has to work, who is going to care for her child ? Bring
              <strong>it</strong> to work too ? Leave it at home alone , like a
              dog ? Train it to pee and poop and eat from a bowl you left on the
              floor ?</p>
              <p>well, <strong>it</strong> does not survive on diapers alone.
              <strong>it</strong> needs more than diapers. <strong>it</strong> will grow up and as it grows, <strong>it</strong> will cost more
              and more. it will soon outgrow all your baby purchases, you'll need
              to purchase more age appropriate items all the way until they can
              make their own money all by themself.</p>
              <p>Maybe you use toilet papers to wipe your child, feed your child
              tap water and sunshine, basically let it grow like a weed or a pet
              dog. When it falls sick it will crawl its own way to a doctor who
              will care for it for free. Perhaps eat other people's poop so it
              can immunise itself from all the diseases in our world.</p>
              <p>I am a mother, my child cost about $2000 per month . According
              to research a child  cost about 250k-300k just to raise them ,
              not including cost of education.</p>
              <p>I make sure my child gets quality clothings, eat good
              nutritional food, enjoys toys that stimulate her brains and
              learning abilities. Go to the best school for learning and
              enrichments. All these are not cheap.</p>
              <p>And my husband made sure he has adequate life and health care
              insurance for the family just in case something bad happens to
              him.</p>
              <p>We are saving up for my child education from day one of her
              birth. How much are you socking away for <strong>it</strong> ?</p>
              <p>And you think your meagre $450 is gonna cut it because the court
              say so ? Tell that to any sensible, responsible father, they will
              balk at you.</p>
              <p>I feel very sorry for your <strong>it</strong>. It's father earn
              a decent $4500 per month, but cares only for himself. Maybe
              <strong>it</strong> can burn those money for you during your
              funeral, if <strong>it</strong> is willing to attend.</p>
              <p>I do not know what you are thinking divorcing your wife when
              your child is only 9 month old. </p>
              <p>Singaporean men like you sickens any woman, I hope you get
              yourself a <strong>vasectomy</strong>. Don't bother father another
              child ever again.</p>

              <p>Bro, be a man...</p>
              <p>$450 is really peanut. You are comparing diapers is 418 for a
              huge bag?</p>
              <p>normally 1 bag can only last a week, a can if milk ard $40 can
              last a week.</p>
              <p>Children get sick almost every month, a normal GP (note not PD)
              will cost around $50/visit.</p>
              <p>If go childcare in future, after subsidy is easily $400~600
              monthly.</p>
              <p>clothing almost every month need to buy some, unless you want
              your child to look like slop with over size clothes then is another
              issue.</p>
              <p>if without a maid, infant care after subsidy still maybe need to
              pay $700~900 monthly.</p>
              <p>if you think your $450 is so big to a child, counter propose
              that the mum show all inv on amount spend on kids and she apy $450
              and bal you pay.. I believe the mum will be jumping with joy...</p>

              <p>You are right. But child-care need not be considered now. the mother can ask me more when my child go to child-care. The rest of the things what it need considered already and fit well within 250 dollars as per the budget shown by her lawyer and scrutiny in the cross examination. Note that y child is 9 months old. It is not relying anymore on formula milk-food alone. It takes cereals as well. My child is good. In the past 9 months, only once was my child sick. so no doctor fee. Guess it has inherited my gene correctly. Mother pays another 590 for maid and levy. the maid is used by other 6 members in her house. Judge should have asked me to pay one-half of S$250 and one-14th of S$590. So I should have been asked to pay only S$200. Since the judge wanted to be kind to mother, she has asked me to pay S$450. I agree at the moment. don't want to appeal. Have got other works to do.</p>

              <p>It seem quite obvious you are not the care taker of it since day one.</p>
              <p>You are so ignorant to a child needs, and will continue to be absent from it's life. Destined to be the absentee father.</p>
              <p><strong>Because you are so un-engaged, you will forever be fighting child payments due to your own ignorance.</strong></p>
              <p>May I know why you have chosen to be so uninvolved yet had to father one ?</p>
              <p>Your child is only 9 months old. Baby formula is still needed. Cereals and other solid baby foods are only SUPPLEMENTS.  Parents feed their babies formula or breast milk till age 2 nowadays, according to up to date Pediatrician's guidelines.</p>
              <p>Yes we all know that our mothers used to feed babies water. All those yesteryear mothers practise has to stop. It is no longer practised in our time. So forget what your mother tells you, speak to a Pediatrician instead.</p>
              <p>Your child will need IMMUNIZATIONs. When was the last time he/she went to see a PEDIATRIC doctor ?  For the first 18 months, one visit per month for immunizations shots and well baby checkups. Subsequent booster shots according to doctor's schedule till 18 years old.</p>
              <p>Judge not being kind to mother, judge being kind to you the retarded father. What's the point of you earning so much money ?</p>
              <p>Every time your child needs more money, your ex has to go to court. How much is that gonna cost her ?  Don't both of you need to work ?</p>
              <p>Your child inherited your gene ?I say you should just sterilise it so no more bastard like you in the next generation pool.</p>
