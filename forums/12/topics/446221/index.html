              <p>Child support is child support. Alimony is alimony. Please do not confuse the two together.</p>
              <p>Child support is what a child need .</p>
              <p>If you are the father, you should know by now how much it cost to care for a child. There is nothing wrong for you to continue supporting your child even after the divorce.</p>
              <p>If your wife is capable of earning, she will be required to share some the cost of child support. But since the child is only 1 year old, the custody will usually go to the mother. So as the father, you need to pay more, since the majority care of the child is with the mother.</p>
              <p>If the child expenses is $2000 per month.. you cannot expect your wife to take on the full expenses just because she earns almost as much as you.</p>
              <p>Please do not punish the child just because you cannot get along with your wife.</p>
              <p>But if you are the other woman, thinking of marrying a guy with an ex-wife and 1 year old child. Be prepared that his still needs to provide for his children/ex-wife first. That obligation will not end until his child becomes legal age.</p>
              <p>If your man wants to run away from his obligations to his children, then be warned he is not a guy worth giving your life to. A man who can shrug his obligations to his first family can also do the same to you later.</p>

Most singaporean fathers had PRC wifes, Vietnam wife, thai wife, pinay wifeys, and most of their marriages are mend/make to divorce, married for the sake of getting a divorce and payout later on, in such cases, the custody of the child will be with the singapore father, that is why today, you see many lone man carrying a child to clinic, kk, or polyclinic.

              <p>The quantity of benefit is irrelevant. The all the money goes to the ex-wife. How much filter down to the child, we'd be politely silent. Thats why it is not $750.</p>

              <p>While, you can alway wear poorly and carry the child along rocher or orchard road with a can, some drop $10 and some even put $50, acting poor in Singapore is a blessing, so many want to contribute back to you due to their sins of exploiting the poor.</p>

              <p>you call your own child an "it" ? No wonder you are not so keen paying for<strong> it</strong>. <strong>it</strong> is not even human in your eye. How sad.</p>
              <p>You are leveraging your wife's $3000 so you don't need to pay a heftier sum. If she has to stay home and care for your child.. how is she going to make that $3000 ?</p>
              <p>If she has to work, who is going to care for her child ? Bring <strong>it </strong>to work too ? Leave it at home alone , like a dog ? Train it to pee and poop and eat from a bowl you left on the floor ?</p>
              <p>well,<strong> it </strong>does not survive on diapers alone. <strong>it</strong> needs more than diapers. <strong>it</strong> will grow up and as it grows, <strong>it </strong>will cost more and more. it will soon outgrow all your baby purchases, you'll need to purchase more age appropriate items all the way until they can make their own money all by themself.</p>
              <p>Maybe you use toilet papers to wipe your child, feed your child tap water and sunshine, basically let it grow like a weed or a pet dog. When it falls sick it will crawl its own way to a doctor who will care for it for free.  Perhaps eat other people's poop so it can immunise itself from all the diseases in our world.</p>
              <p>I am a mother, my child cost about $2000 per month . According to research a child  cost about 250k-300k just to raise them , not including cost of education.</p>
              <p>I make sure my child gets quality clothings, eat good nutritional food, enjoys toys that stimulate her brains and learning abilities. Go to the best school for learning and enrichments. All these are not cheap.</p>
              <p>And my husband made sure he has adequate life and health care 
                                  insurance for the family just in case something bad happens to him.</p>
              <p>We are saving up for my child education from day one of her birth. How much are you socking away for <strong>it</strong> ?</p>
              <p>And you think your meagre $450 is gonna cut it because the court say so ? Tell that to any sensible, responsible father, they will balk at you.</p>
              <p>I feel very sorry for your <strong>it</strong>. It's father earn a decent $4500 per month, but cares only for himself. Maybe <strong>it </strong>can burn those money for you during your funeral, if<strong> it</strong> is willing to attend.</p>
              <p>I do not know what you are thinking divorcing your wife when your child 
                                          is only 9 month old. </p>
              <p>Singaporean men like you sickens any woman, I hope you get yourself a<strong> vasectomy</strong>. Don't bother father another child ever again.</p>

              <p>At least for husband contribution is 2000 or 40 percents of income and wife 1000 or 35 percent of income not inclusive of all educations expenses. this money has to be maintained in the bank until the child is about 25-30years old. just speculation but it workable...</p>
