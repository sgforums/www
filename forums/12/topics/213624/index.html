            <div class='col-md body'>Well...in Poly...its a diverse and like a small city on its own. You meet all sorts of characters, there are some, whom you can just be friends with, while others, make really good colleagues. Choose your close friends in poly wisely...don't be like my gf who kena all the influence and has turned materialistic. Basic rule of thumb here is that everybody can be your friend, but those whom can be good friends, best friends and colleagues are really few. I've learnt that lesson the hardway when these poor colleagues,avg. friends screw up projects etc. So yeah, must open your eyes, people are no longer pure and simple like in sec. school.Many have their own agenda....</div>
