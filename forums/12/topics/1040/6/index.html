            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i think you have the same problem as me. I knew my Gf the as you. At first I thought she would never leave me as I thought she was hopelessly in love with me.We have been together for 3 years.<br>But.. When the second year when she started to work. She changed as she know more friends and things like that.<br><br>Recently she work and work and work and got no time for me, so i would sometimes complaint bout it. When ask her to go out with me and asked her to go back a bit later but her excuse was that she had to get up early next day. But when she went out with her friends she can go out til very late. When she was with me she always sms and sms. until one day i shouted at her and asked her to stop sms cos i had told her many times but she still refused to listen to me. After that she did not called me thought I tried to call her. She refused to answer my call.<br><br>And when i called her and asked her u must give me a answer and dun avoid my calls. She said "ITS TIME WE BREAK UP, I WANNA BE ALONE AND ENJOY THE FEELING OF THAT" Sucks man!! And BREAK was an inevitalbe one i guess.<br><br>After i had gave her my heart and everything told her my deepest fear. The faith I had in her yesterday. When has it all gone to???<br><br>This was just a week ago man!!!<br><br>My advice to u is that if u really love her dun break her heart. If u think i want a better gal with brains i think u have to make a decision. Dun forget that she treated u very very good.

You better freaking changed your f*ckedup childish behaviour and treat your lady well.<br><br>If not don't blame her for finding a new guy at work.
