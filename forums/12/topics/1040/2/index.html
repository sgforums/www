I believe fellow girls will stand by each other as they share thoughts for each other if they feel that they are treated unfairly. Even for guys too.. Think about it...<br><br>Furthermore, beyond their angry remarks are some advice which are the important things you are seeking if you genuinely seek views from others here. Probably you may want to think about the rational behind their words. It's just like when we're young, we are often scolded by our parents. They shout... they slap... they beat... but why did that do it?? you became you, a decent proper guy from these harsh punishments right??

You have only tried so many ways to get her to increase her chances of improving, and failed, but there many other options left.<br><br>true enough, few guys can tahan girls with no look and to take them in as their wife, but fewer amongst those to recognise the hidden treasure beneath the not so presentable appearance.<br><br>for a couple who earns an average combined income of 4k, is not enough to cover expenses for a house, car and other luxuries, but you need NO CASH to cover for a open, kind heart like your gf.<br><br>if you think, that<br>1.she has no brains,<br>2.she has no looks,<br>3.she has no money,<br>4.you can find a better girl,<br>get out of her life, for she deserve a better man than you are.<br><br>if you think, that<br>1. you resign yourself to a simple life<br>2. forever envying big houses and fast cars,<br>3. you can never show her in front of your friends,<br>get out of her life, for she deserve a more matured, down to earth guy than you are.<br><br>if you can think, that<br>1. both of you can change for the better in characteristics<br>2. her heart is made of gold,<br>3. you will stop nagging, and sit down to communicate thoughts in a finer way<br>4. pretty looks will fade over time<br>5. you will carve yourself a wonderful career path that covers far more expenses for both of you<br>6. she will continue to sacrifice for you (with brains or no brains)<br>7. you will never think of messy thoughts of why you dont deserve a pretty, brainy chick,<br>then i say, you must take her as your wife<br><br>otherwise, once again, i say, rather than be agonizing over these issue, get out of her life. she deserve a better man than you are.<br><br>you know what i mean, it is the painful truth that hurts you the most. but if you are willing to look forward, the future can be just as sweet for the both of you.

You have only tried so many ways to get her to increase her chances of improving, and failed, but there many other options left.<br><br>true enough, few guys can tahan girls with no look and to take them in as their wife, but fewer amongst those to recognise the hidden treasure beneath the not so presentable appearance.<br><br>for a couple who earns an average combined income of 4k, is not enough to cover expenses for a house, car and other luxuries, but you need NO CASH to cover for a open, kind heart like your gf.<br><br>if you think, that<br>1.she has no brains,<br>2.she has no looks,<br>3.she has no money,<br>4.you can find a better girl,<br>get out of her life, for she deserve a better man than you are.<br><br>if you think, that<br>1. you resign yourself to a simple life<br>2. forever envying big houses and fast cars,<br>3. you can never show her in front of your friends,<br>get out of her life, for she deserve a more matured, down to earth guy than you are.<br><br>if you can think, that<br>1. both of you can change for the better in characteristics<br>2. her heart is made of gold,<br>3. you will stop nagging, and sit down to communicate thoughts in a finer way<br>4. pretty looks will fade over time<br>5. you will carve yourself a wonderful career path that covers far more expenses for both of you<br>6. she will continue to sacrifice for you (with brains or no brains)<br>7. you will never think of messy thoughts of why you dont deserve a pretty, brainy chick,<br>then i say, you must take her as your wife<br><br>otherwise, once again, i say, rather than be agonizing over these issue, get out of her life. she deserve a better man than you are.<br><br>you know what i mean, it is the painful truth that hurts you the most. but if you are willing to look forward, the future can be just as sweet for the both of you. You seriously need a change in character and thoughts first.</div></blockquote>*Clap clap clap clap*!<br>I'm impressed by your 'speech'.
