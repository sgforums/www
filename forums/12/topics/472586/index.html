              <p>Not necessary only the passengers right infront or next to. Any seated passenger in the bus can give up their seats to that old lady.</p>
              <p>I have seen several times passengers few rows away gave up their seats for the needy.</p>
              <p>You simply cannot fault the indian lady, for she has her son next to her. Some children get anxious/nervous when they are seated next to strangers because they rely on their parents to tell them where to alight.</p>
              <p>Seats near the exit are preferable for older people as they do not need to squeeze through crowded bus to get off.</p>

              <p>I can not blame you at all for mistaking me bcoz I mentioned race indeed, but I really want to emphasize on bus etiquette. My mind was kind of troubled when I wrote above, as I saw another thread whose arthor was apparently a Indian, said how he was looked down upon and unfairly treated in Singapore and concluded that with racism. That is false accusation in my view. In my writing, I somehow decided to mention the race, as I believe race is not the explanation in my case, I will not explain it by racism as the Indian poster did in other thread, which was totally ignorant and unwarranted! </p>
