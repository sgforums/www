            <div class='col-md body'>I'd agree with the guys who said that deleting her contact is sensible, but that blocking it is not a good idea, for two reasons.  First, if you block her and she finds out, you're going to come off looking like a sore loser regardless.  Second, there's nothing to say that just because she's moved on at the moment that your paths will not cross again - blocking her will only close off that opportunity.  It's all a game - if you're going to have any chance of winning it, you've got to be in it in the first place.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by social_misfit:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi.<br><br>Recently, I found out that the gal I like has already been attached since a few months ago. Just a little background info, here's my old story: http://agony.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=169944<br><br>Apparently, I waited and nothing materialized; she has moved on with her life and is gone. Basically, I must take responsibility of fluffing my own chance. However, to avoid behaving like some guys who show their ugly nature when they can't get the gals they want, I've chosen to retreat gracefully and to avoid and forget her, lest I feel the pain of the loss again.<br><br>I try to distance myself from her by blocking her on MSN messenger, so that she won't be able to see that I'm online and try to initiate chats with me, which she did in the past. Not that I'm jealous or anything, just want to move away from her so that I won't be tempted to feel attracted to her again and then realise that she's attached and unavailable.<br><br>However, by blocking her on MSN, I seriously don't know if what I'm doing is right or is gracious. Am I acting like a sore loser instead? Is it normal or ok for me to avoid her and sort of disappear from her life?<br><br>I still do meet her irregularly once every 2 or 3 months, and I'm cutting down on it as well. I'm thinking of moving on with my life as well and trying hard to forget her, and the best way to forget her is to see her and talk to her less often.</div></blockquote>You shouldn't really TRY to forget her... You just FORGET with time...<br><br>If you think you can't handle it, just cut down contact with her... Sore loser or not, nothing's really wrong with that...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey yea. was in a same position as you before. i blocked and deleted the person too because seeing him online makes me want to talk to him, and knowing we would never be together hurts a lot. so yea..delete her off too. but i can tell you, when you see her again, your feelings will just return like many others here because you only try to block her away from your mind instead of letting your feelings fade naturally...<br>well. it's better than nothing...i don't think staying as friends at this stage is possible. how can you see someone you really like as only a friend??? well, i can't.<br>so my bottom line is, although many ppl would not agree, i think it's better to stay away/avoid her first. i think it's a gracious act. since she has a boyfriend as well. ^^</div>
