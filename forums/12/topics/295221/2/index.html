And they really admire and appreciate their bf who is able to bear with their bad temper, tho they wanted to change but it just seem like addicted to it, they just wanted to blow off at their love ones even on small matters. If you leave her, she will be very very sad...on the other hand, if she not like this, guess you also love her rite, so it fated.<br><br>Sayang her and tell her you understand her temper and know she love you very much, tell her you will bear with her and love her forever.</div>

The funny thing is that some men love xiao jie pi qi type of gal, i guess you must be one of them.<br><br>Do you believe in fate, if not, you are fated to be under her control and have to bear with it for the rest of your life if you really love her.<br><br>But here is the consolation, as a gal myself have met and spoken with to gals with such temper, they told me deep inside them, they really love their men, and sometime when after an angry fit, they regretted over it, it just that they never want to show off to their bf. And they really admire and appreciate their bf who is able to bear with their bad temper, tho they wanted to change but it just seem like addicted to it, they just wanted to blow off at their love ones even on small matters. If you leave her, she will be very very sad...on the other hand, if she not like this, guess you also love her rite, so it fated.<br><br>Sayang her and tell her you understand her temper and know she love you very much, tell her you will bear with her and love her forever. </div></blockquote>thats why from a girl point of view i am happy to see this... as who know my gf is like u mentioned...i did told her countless time that i love her alot...<br>will be thick n thin with her etc...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well guess all i can say is that sometimes we guys are being too practical. we THINK that we are right but in actual fact we don't really know what the girl have been going through thus quarrels happen because both parties thinks the other party is in the wrong.<br><br>i agree with angel to a large extend with regards to the "regretful actions". some girls really are like this.<br><br>bro i believe you're old enough to think. its no longer honeymoon anymore and i believe you know that yourself. i know its tiring to always give in but sometimes you got to understand that she is also giving in to you. you might not be the one always giving in either  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
