I wanted to create one and ask for help, but I don't know how to start..  anyway, I truely loves my wife.  I treasure my family too..  where possible I will always be home right after work.  The thing is, my girlfriend comes in at a time when I need help most.  She is always there .  She sort of fill up the shortfall of my wife...  ( not that my wife is no good ).  Say it as an excuse but it is possible for a man to love two persons at the same time, question is who do you loves most.  Sex? yes, which man don't want if you can still handle it? But sex is not the motivation.  I must say, among the two, I still loves my wife most.  So I try to make a clean break but sigh ... it is very difficult...  I fear for the worst now ..</div>

Do you ever think of that when you are with another woman/gal.<br><br>You are a matured adult man, in term of life, you are more experiences than me, more knowledgeable than me, more older with better wisdom than me. If as a daughter to you, i plead " Please come back home Daddy" will you feel sorry and sad for what you have done??. If me as a young person is able to generalise and think better than you, i guess you are no better than a small boy in the kindergarden if you allow such affair to carry on.<br><br>Worst to the very worst, to compare, i will prefer those who go geyland and have a one time off with their need than you having an affair with a love for any person knowing that you are a married man. At least those are not love and go back clean it up and forget about it. Uncle, Dun bring dirty laundry home ya.<br><br>You give me a very bad impression of bad. Men cannot be trust.<br><br></div>

There were alots of lies and unhappiness in my mom life, she cried most of the times. As I was youngest, my Dad use to bring me to his company function and party like Dinner and Dance, and as young as i am, i still can notice his closeness with his beautiful whoring secretary.<br><br>Then mom got into illness and passed away within 6 months, i believe part of it was caused by depression and saddness. My brothers and me then decided to leave our Dad and go live with our grandparents. We hated our Dad, but nevertheless, he is still our Dad, after mom death, he had changed, maybe due to old age or simply realized his mistakes in life. He then resigned and open his own business and work hard on it till now. I worked for him, but he never give me any work, just look look see see only. Recently, he bought me a car and also a condo under my name, but i never bother to take it. I guess it is to show his love and caring for me. So in the end, my granpa drives it and the condo was rented out.<br><br>We had never question his personnal life, now he lives alone and I think he feels remorseful of what he did when he was younger. So, to all men, if you are married, please cherish and treasure your love ones dearly, if not no matter how rich or powerful, handsome, macho you are, you will shatter your family and in the end find no true love. Money is powerful, but still it got it deficiency, it cannot buy true love and time.<br><br>There are alots of poor souls out there still searching for love, but never get it, and there are also alots of lucky soul that got so much love that they took it causally and in the end, regretted. The world is not fair, why are some born rich, some born poor, some born pretty and nice, some born fat and ugly...but that is what the world is made of, take it or leave it.<br><br>The relationship of my parents family had brought about a phobia on me about having a steady bf, yes, i got lot of bfs, fat ,thin,sexy, tall, ugly, handsome, ang mo, japanese, even malays, so far no indian yet. But I have only treated them as mere friends, free dinner at posh restaurant, free wine, free party and disco nite, but i knew myself, it not time yet, as the sad eyes of my mother still stare in emptiness bring about saddness in me. A man mistake not only brought about a broken family but also the lingering effect on his childrens, and I, Angel, is one of them with a 666.<br><br>I hope i presented myself clearly to all, do not feel sorry or angry, my purpose is to tell all men or boys out there, treat us womanfolk better. Of course all men can cock all the way as a cockerel as they like,  but it is the hen, the woman that borne them.</div>
