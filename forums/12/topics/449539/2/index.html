              <p>I have been together with my boyfriend for more than 3 years. He used to be very sweet and good and put me as priority. But since the commencement of his school, he seems to be drifting further from me. He even forgot our 3 years anniversary despite me reminding him since the week before. He promised to bring me to Cable car dinner/Flyer dinner to celebrate this grand day and I was looking very forward to it, but he forgot everything and broke all the promises.</p>
              <p>Secondly, we dont text often. Everytime i Sms him, he will take 2-3 hours to reply and the content he reply is not answering to what i have smsed him. E.g. I ask " what time you going school?" 2-3 hours later He reply" Have you eaten your meal?"..</p>
              <p>Thirdly, I feel that he is very snobbish. He seems to look down on people that comes from private school. he will always say that his who ever friend cmi so ended in SIM etc. I feel very inferior as i am also a private school student though I know that he is not referring to me.</p>
              <p>Apart from these he is still a kinda nice guy. He will deliver supper to me if i am hungry or fetch me from school if i ended class very late.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I  know i am contradicting. but what should i do?</p>

              for it. Have you spoken to your bf about it? when you gave him the
              presents, what was he complaining about?</p>

              <p>For the wallet, he says about no coin areas, thread dropping, compartment not enough.</p>
              <p>Pillow he never comment anything but he just layed it inside the storeroom. </p>
              <p>Ipod Nano he kept trying to "return to me", He said that i need it more than him. Then when i asked him why he did not use, he said that he fear the ipod nano has scratches(blame myself for not getting a casing with it) but his ipod touch is not protected with any casing too...</p>
              <p>@FireIce i am unsure what you mean by "the talk" do you mean if i have communicate with him regarding the issues? Yes i did.<br><br>These were his replies for </p>
              <p>Point 1: Forgotten Important Dates</p>
              <p>For instance regarding the Anniversary,he said that he has planned to bring me to a special place but the place he planned was "full house".Furthermore, regarding anniversary gift, he said he plan to get me a couple ring but because i was not there to choose so he did not get ( till NOW he still has not get the ring and has seems to forget about it). I replied him " Is ok. You are busy with school. I understand" and his response was " sorry that he had forgotten our anniversary". </p>
              <p>He will always defend himself with tons of Excuses(LIES) which I feel very disappointed and has no strength to hold on :( I do not know why he has cooked excuses to deceive/hurt me?</p>
              <p>Point 2: Never reply Text</p>
              <p>He said that he has No reception, Did not receive the SMS, Sent but was not send through, or thought he press Sent but actually he did not send,busy with project discussion, attending lectures. Alot and ALOT of reasons..</p>
              <p>Point 3:Snobbish</p>
              <p>He said he was very sorry about that and promise to change. Weeks later when A level results release, he commented how atrocious his friend has done and said that his friend "chui" and confirm ended up in SIM. He also keep commenting that why my modules are so easy and easy to score. So meaningless, not like him mugging so hard.. i Feel very depress and stupid.. haiz.</p>

              <p>@all really appreciate the constructive solutions. I have thought through the pass few days. Mayb i am no longer his priority in life that y he has been treatin me this way. Like many say he must have decided to place studies on top of me. I have decided to either to give him a final chance in hope for changes or ask for a halt in the r/s so that he can fcous on studies...:/</p>
