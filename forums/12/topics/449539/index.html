              <p>I have been together with my boyfriend for more than 3 years. He used to be very sweet and good and put me as priority. But since the commencement of his school, he seems to be drifting further from me. He even forgot our 3 years anniversary despite me reminding him since the week before. He promised to bring me to Cable car dinner/Flyer dinner to celebrate this grand day and I was looking very forward to it, but he forgot everything and broke all the promises.</p>
              <p>Secondly, we dont text often. Everytime i Sms him, he will take 2-3 hours to reply and the content he reply is not answering to what i have smsed him. E.g. I ask " what time you going school?" 2-3 hours later He reply" Have you eaten your meal?"..</p>
              <p>Thirdly, I feel that he is very snobbish. He seems to look down on people that comes from private school. he will always say that his who ever friend cmi so ended in SIM etc. I feel very inferior as i am also a private school student though I know that he is not referring to me.</p>
              <p>Apart from these he is still a kinda nice guy. He will deliver supper to me if i am hungry or fetch me from school if i ended class very late.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I  know i am contradicting. but what should i do?</p>

              treat him like a man, and he will treat u like a woman....take care of his ego...and he will respect and love u more.....dun take him like a kid how his mum would ask him...wat time u gonna school...gonna eat....only his mum will do that and dun expect u to treat him like a mummy boy....
              
              he will like u to be a little mature....perhaps...

              <p>I am seriously unsure what a guy wants.</p>
              <p> His birthday i got him a branded wallet and a painting of us. He just cant stop complaining about the wallet. So i thought guys are more concern of needs product than wants. Eventually his nxt bday, i got him a pillow as his pillow was dented. N the week later the pillow i gave was in the storeroom.. </p>
              <p>Affer this pillow stuff, i got him ipod nano for anniversary as he love jogging. But he dont seem to appreciate and left his nano at home even when he go jogging. He still continues using his ipod touch..</p>
              <p>I am not expecting much. But i believe every girl wants their bf to remember annoversary day.. So do i..</p>

              <p>I think the problem is, he has expectations. Like the gifts example, things like pillow, wallet, etc are just too common and while it might be something he need, it's not something he wants. Getting him something he already has an alternative, will see it wasted. People say it's the thoughts that count, but seriously, often times, we look at gifts and dismisses them in our mind.</p>
              <p>Perhaps if he has an interest and you got something related to it, like for example, a die cast car if he's into that.</p>
              <p>And about the SMS thing, maybe you should read back your old messages. Have you been boring/clingy? Cause as a guy, I hate chatting with some people because it's so mundane, that after a few lines, there's nothing left to say and this cycle repeats itself daily.</p>
              <p>I think you need your own personal time for a bit right now, to think and collect yourself, while at the same time, giving your BF space, for him to decide if he still loves/need you.</p>

              <p>I have been together with my boyfriend for more than 3 years. He
              used to be very sweet and good and put me as priority. But since
              the commencement of his school, he seems to be drifting further
              from me. He even forgot our 3 years anniversary despite me
              reminding him since the week before. He promised to bring me to
              Cable car dinner/Flyer dinner to celebrate this grand day and I was
              looking very forward to it, but he forgot everything and broke all
              the promises.</p>
              <p>Secondly, we dont text often. Everytime i Sms him, he will take
              2-3 hours to reply and the content he reply is not answering to
              what i have smsed him. E.g. I ask " what time you going school?"
              2-3 hours later He reply" Have you eaten your meal?"..</p>
              <p>Thirdly, I feel that he is very snobbish. He seems to look down
              on people that comes from private school. he will always say that
              his who ever friend cmi so ended in SIM etc. I feel very inferior
              as i am also a private school student though I know that he is not
              referring to me.</p>
              <p>Apart from these he is still a kinda nice guy. He will deliver
              supper to me if i am hungry or fetch me from school if i ended
              class very late.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I  know i am contradicting. but what should i do?</p>

              <p>Honestly. The messages usually start of with good morning n he
              replied good morning. Thus i wanted to ask question in hope to keep
              the conversation going.. Perhaps i have nothing else to keep us
              chatting...</p>

              <p>I guess it always happens, it's normally perceived as the fading of a relationship.. but i dont think it is.. </p>
              <p>this normally happens when couples are so used to each other's presence - sort of like a relationship between a parent and a child or sibling.. that quintessentially their significant other is sort of like a stable constant in a ever changing world.. </p>
              <p>they will definitely be affected when such a constant disappears or leaves their lives..</p>
              <p>your bf could probably be stressed out by his school work..  or other factors in his life.. </p>
