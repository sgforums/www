Rather, im asking for second opinions on understanding of the situation and understanding of his actions.   And of course, i will not go into a relationship when im not ready.  Neither can anyone make me do things that i do not wish to do.<br><br>My 'right' guy.  Someone's goals in life are in congruent with mine.  Compatible lifestyle and personality.  There must be chemistry of course.  Someone who is mature and stable.   Faithful, and committed to make relationship work.<br><br>I do not 'want' to love him.  Anyway, what is that?  Rather, i feel that there is chemistry and i want to know him better.  Jaded?  i dont think i am.  Rather, i've learned to be wiser and take my time, and not to rush into things.  Afterall, i have only known him for one month.  Like we said above, if it is true love, it should be able to withstand the test of time.  If it aint true love, i dun need it.  So, what is the rush? So a non jaded person will plunge into a relationship after knowing a guy for a month?  i applaud the courage, but i call that reckless.<br><br>Yes, there is no way to know where a boat will take you unless you board it, but aren't you goin to check the condition of the boat before jumping into a boat?  Or are you juz goin to jump onto a boat because you like the boat and it 'looks' good, and take the risk that halfway during the journey, the boat might sink due to mechanical failure or lack of petrol cos you did not check earlier?</div>
