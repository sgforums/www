Usually people will bail out of the situation - for some at least. </span>  <span style="color: darkred;">---&gt; yes, all this consistent and continuous pressure is causing me to juz bail out.  It is so hard to progress naturally in this relationship anymore.  I feel so pressurized.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">But it depends on situation. Some how you are still measuring him up. And being wiser, you might be seeing beyond all the good treatment and trying to suss out more of what kind of a person he is and can you click with him and such. Because you are looking for long term basis, short term trial.</span><span style="color: darkred;"> ---&gt;  Totally agree.    </span>  For long term, the criteria would be different and these are weighted against your current freedom, space, friends and other opportunity you are giving up just to with this person. <span style="color: blue;">Besides, you do not know much more about a person in a couple of weeks. In addition, you can wait 30 plus years, a couple of months is nothing.</span><span style="color: darkred;"> Precisely.  I rather spend a few months knowing a person then get into a relationship, than to go into a relationship with a wrong person and waste a few years.   </span>       But is section here is based on generalising... so it might not apply to you...<br><br><span style="color: blue;">If he keeps pressing, and making you feel uncomfortable, he might back fire. </span>  <span style="color: darkred;">----&gt;  And of cos it is back firing now.  Badly back fired.</span><br>But if all he wants is short term, perhaps this technique worked on younger girls who like to be chased and he got to bang them before moving on.  So now he is using the same technique on you... but anyways, just use your judgement...  to me, personal happiness is something to strive for, with or without a partner by my side... I am not sure about yours but I wish you luck </div></blockquote></div>

Everyone wants relationship on the table as fast as they want instant noodles to be served at the snap of fingers.  But relationships are like good soup.  Good soup needs time to brew.<br><br>I'm not an amateur in relationships.  Yes, i have had my fair share of bad relationships, i rushed into relationships when i was young.  So i've learned to know more about the person before committing.  And surely, i think using a couple of months, say 3-4 months (juz a figure of speech. of cos you cant measure understanding using time). to know a person before committing is not excessive, is it?<br><br>Yes, i know that after getting into a relationship i can still back out, but with emotions attachment and intimacy, is it still so easy to leave unscath?  why not take a little more time (like i said, say a couple of months) to know the person before committing?  And this is what i call calculated risk.<br><br>Cheers</div>

Come on guys, take it slow and steady. Step by step and make the r/s more enjoyable. Don't blame Singaporean girls( Are you Singaporean?). Be patient and let the woman come on to you slowly. Love is about respecting each other and at the same time enjoying each other's company.<br><br>If I were you, I would have told him I would not date him if he continues to be like this.</div>
