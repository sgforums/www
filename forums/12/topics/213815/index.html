Trust factor.  You spoke my mind!  He is a foreigner.  for all you know, he could even be married in his country!  We need time to establish a lot of things, thereby build trust, no?  Sorry, that is the skeptical and irritated me talking.  Im so irritated and this is realli getting to me.<br><br>Yes, i do feel positively towards him.  But can you be cornered and rushed every day or every other day!?!?  How much positive feelings can withstand such pressure and annoyance?<br><br>I did ask him that question.  He said cos he liked me so much.  And i do have many guys goin after me, being together will give him sense of security cos im the faithful type when im in a relationship.  Aiya, i think it is juz a guy's thing to want to shorten the courtship process, cos in a relationship, guys need to do less work and enjoy the security and of cos, intimacy.</div>

Usually people will bail out of the situation - for some at least.<br><br>But it depends on situation. Some how you are still measuring him up. And being wiser, you might be seeing beyond all the good treatment and trying to suss out more of what kind of a person he is and can you click with him and such. Because you are looking for long term basis, short term trial. For long term, the criteria would be different and these are weighted against your current freedom, space, friends and other opportunity you are giving up just to with this person. Besides, you do not know much more about a person in a couple of weeks. In addition, you can wait 30 plus years, a couple of months is nothing. But is section here is based on generalising... so it might not apply to you...<br><br>If he keeps pressing, and making you feel uncomfortable, he might back fire.<br>But if all he wants is short term, perhaps this technique worked on younger girls who like to be chased and he got to bang them before moving on.  So now he is using the same technique on you... but anyways, just use your judgement...  to me, personal happiness is something to strive for, with or without a partner by my side...
