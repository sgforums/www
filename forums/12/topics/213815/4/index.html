What is the basis for comparison?<br><br>Anyway, onlookers will never know what is going on in a relationship.  Only the parties involved will know all the details.  To you, he may be Mr. Dream-lover, to her, she might have seen his flaws.<br><br>Having said that, like what mongster highlighted, if he indeed is really Mr Dream-lover, your friend needs to be reminded that no one is perfect.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello, ladie<br><br>Your friend is not the only one in a hurry to rush you into relationship.  I, too, met a number of men who do the same.  Are there men who can be patient to wait for a reasonable time?  Not every gal wants to rush into relationship.  Guys wait, train your patience OK.  No venture no gain, no pain no enjoyment of the fruit of labour!<br><br>There and then if their needs of going into relationship are not met they back off and totally cut themselves off from the gals.  So sad!  I am one who believe if gal and guy can't be bf and gf we still can be friends, too bad the guys don't take it that way.<br></div>

These days, women are so much more independent... No man won't die one... and we realise we have every right to walk out of a bad or failing relationship anytime...
