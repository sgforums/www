Sad  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> !!!!  I experience this with friends, family members and bf.  It's kind of sensitive to bring up such issue, but it is not impossible to sort this out (depends on the party).  If you can think of ways to communicate this concern in the way that the other party if he/she is open and  does not get hurt, by all means go ahead.  May be do it indirectly first and see how it goes.    Different people different personalities so there is no one method that works on all people.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

That will be the time when the giver cracked. Depending on the response as to how the giver can no longer gives:<br><br>1. The receiver bo hew and life goes on.<br>2. The receiver gives back.<br>3. The receiver starts to question the relationship.<br>4. With a bit of 3, the receiver walks out on the relationship altogether.<br>5.

            <div class='col-md body'>i think r/s is goes both ways. When I give to someone (girl/friend/family)... I don't expect them to do anything extraordinary for me but to treat me as nice as I treat them. To me, little things count... remembering birthdays... keeping in contact and stuff like this... If I realised the other side totally, absoultely don't give me that little bit of love I need... then it'll not work for me.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One of the common flaws we exhibit in most relationships is that often at times, we take each other for granted and often only learn to appreciate what we had after we lost it.<br><br>I am not sure exactly how involved both of you are in this relationship, also i dont often comment too much on BGRs. But if you feel you both are in it for the long run, then the relationship is both about committment as it is about shared responsiblities towards each other. In layman terms: Give and take and often striking a compromise.<br><br>You can try to approach her to speak about it plainly, however if she isnt serious/interested in talking about the topic/relationship, then i will be doubtful if such a single sided relationship will bear fruit. But this is not to say such relationships dont exist or last long and infact some of the most enduring relationships can tend to be blind delication to the other party. However the question then would be if you feel that person could be you.<br><br>Best of luck.<br><br>L.i.P</div>
