            <div class='col-md body'>Nahz.. I dun think u r weird.. I mean it's normally for pple to recall all the things that had happen to him. As they say once bitten twice shy... Especially when it's something that is felt terribly in ur heart...<br><br>Look here... watever ur first love said is already ion the past.. u can't live in it. I understand that one's first love always gives one the most heart-felt feelings. Be it good or bad, one's first love is the hardest thing to get over.<br><br>No one can just make u love her just like that... No such thing as love in first sight. Okie.. I believe that there is such a thing, but it will not last. I 'm pretty sure u are matured enuff to tell urself that u r looking for a r/s that will last rite?? Since it wun drop from the sky, y not u take the initial step to get to know some gers in ur institution. For instance, if the gers are to approach u, just be friendly. They are not that dumb to say that they will fall in love wif u, they just want to apprach u. They just wanna make frens with u, not asking u that u haf to be their bf. I'm sure there's not harm to it on ur side rite??<br><br>Getting to know them is a first step to find love.. U can appraoch other gers in ur institution as well... just a friendly approach... U still need to get to know the person well first. If u r not going base ur r/s on mutual understanding, and knowing each other, wat are u going put for the foundation?? looks?? money?? I'm sure u know that such things are just material wants, doesn't work out to haf a good long r/s rite?<br><br>Just 2 points to note...<br>1) dun tell pple that u r a gay.. becoz news spreads, and after that more and more pple will had the mistaken idea... In the end, only u haf to bear the consequences.. Just be friendly.. Worst still, real gays might come to u.. and  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>2) Dun use ur first love as a gruage, for other gers that u r interested in. Chances is that u will look back and compare.. But I'm here to tell u that we are all individuals. we haf our unique character.. no one can be as good or as bad as ur first love. U just haf to appreciate and to accept the person as she is, becoz she is she... If u wanna change her, she wun be she, but a bad substitute for ur first love. becopz she can never make it to be equal to ur first love.<br><br>Wishing u all the best...<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>
