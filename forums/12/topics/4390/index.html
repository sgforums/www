            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, new to this forum, so if I make any mistakes, please bear with me. =] Quite vexed now, as 2day just found out that the gal that I like actually have a bf. When I first knew her, she told me that she doesn't have a bf, that's why I courted her(did alot of stupid things, flowers, poems, you name it!!!) Anyway, she didn't really reciprocate, so too bad. I don't mind being rejected, but I feel that she shouldn't have told me don't have a bf when she actually had one. My principles are very clear, if a gal have bf, I won't think of courting her. What she did to me was leading me on a wild goose chase, wasting all my time and efforts and my love. Though she didn't reciprocate my love, it's ok to me to be rejected. If I fail I fail, that's that. But lying to me and causing me all these agonies is what I feel hurt me alot. Sigh...! Anyway, got a few questions to ask you guys. What would you all have done if you were me? Do girls nowadays go out with guys, acting intimately and yet do not acknowledge the other as bf? Obviously the second question was a revelation to me as I only knew there's such things happening nowadays. Anyway, please give me your kind advise. Thanks!!! =]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys! Thanks alot for all your replys!!! Well, the anger have subsided now, and with a logical head, I am writing this. I think I will just maintain a friendship with her. No longer will I do anything for her now. Not worth it. I thought of giving her a scolding and such, but I don't think it'll do any good. Conflicts will not solve problems, but will make it worse. Think that the best way for me is to lead my life even better and strive harder no matter in my studies, work, etc. At the end of the day, I will succeed in my life and that's the best way. Who knows, she may then knock herself on her head and ask why she didn't choose me then! Haha! Let me turn this anger and frustration into a new force in the shaping of a better life.
