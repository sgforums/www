            <div class='col-md body'>I think when girls start work... they are exposed to a type of guys that can be different from their b/fs especially if they know their bfs in school...<br><br>A lot of these older colleagues tend to be more experienced, more savvy, more confident and worldly wise... and for a suddenly moment, the artless bf when see next and compared, end up looking less glossy and less well-packaged.<br><br>I think this is the most fragile part in a relationship ba... the relationship didn't change.. she did.. and she can't help changing cos her environment have changed... I think she is probably very confused also... unfortunately you are a casualty of this confusion<br><br>I am sorry this happened to you... it is very heartbreaking. You sound like a well meaning, sincere guy who is really trying to make the relationship work even when you look on in despair as things change. And that takes a lot of courage.Worse, bewilderment cos you don't understand how things can change so much so fast.<br><br>I hope it doesn't make you disillusioned about love. You have a gift you can choose to share and just because someone had been careless with it, doesn't mean another person won't treasure it. Perhaps when you give it away next, it won't be as new or flawless as the first time, but like fine antiques can grow in value in time. As we collect the wounds, it can make us better or bitter.</div>

These are the signs that her feelings are gone. She hangs out with that guy is to try to make you make that decison of breaking up with her. She does not want to bad person. Nobody wants to be the bad man. I guess the time is up. Hence, she break the news. My case is exactly the same as you.</div>

Those bastards deserve to be whip in their asses. But then, we cannot totally blame on those bastards. If those gals dun allow further contacts with them, then no such things will happen. Cheer up dude. This is part and parcel of life. Your so called FINE relationship is being put under test and somehow she just strayed off. You should be glad to know this before marriage.</div>
