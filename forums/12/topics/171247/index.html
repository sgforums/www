            <div class='col-md body'>hmm .. mayb make more effort ?? like when she off work go pick her up or wat?? deprive the other male the chance to perform .. try to be more attentive n catch more hints .. like ur gf say she like this or that .. try to  suprise her ?? so she wont find u boring n prefer the colleague over u ?? hmm .. try to add spice in the rls ? kinda hard i guess .. i guess the other colleague may hav a motive here .. well take ur step slowly .. this is all about the mind .. if u let ur emotions get better of u .. like say u suddenly had a big quarrel with her .. she sad .. the only person she would go to is the colleague .. thus u will let their relationship lvl raise ..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well HONESTLY, if shes placing her frends higher priority over u, then she most probably finds them more fun. u gotta show her ur fun side too!! bring her out more often, get her gifts that she REALLY REALLY wants, not just ANY gift. talk with her about almost anything under the sun, gotta have some fun, relax, talk like u both are best friends and can discuss any topic without feeling guilty or anything...try to spend your time with her such that shes practically smiling and laughing all thw while with u...dont get serious over small stuff...have some fun.<br><br>another thing is u gotta ask her to spend more time with u.. tell her what u feel inside uknowwadimsayin =P tell her that u really like her and would not wish to have any barriers within your relationship with her. cos if she starts spending less time with u, u better start doing smthing b4 it gets too late!!<br><br>however!!!! being women, they will definately need some space for themselves to enjoy away from YOUR company, she needs to have fun with her own friends too, but tell her if shes overdoing it if she really is.<br><br>u could also offer to hang out with her and her friends. that way u can get to know their personalities and whether their reliable or safe for your GF to hang out with u know!!!<br><br>well hope this helps!!! ^^</div>

Office relationships are so common now and so discreet somemore. Haf u watched GetReal by Diana Ser? They haf this segment on Office relationship...<br><br>These are the signs that she wants a breakup. I am not scaring u but I want u to be prepared mentality when the time she breaks the news to u. I am a victim of your case too and I am here to help even though I am having my problems too. Some guys are really bastard. They know that gal got BF still want to get up close and personal with that lady. These kind of guys deserved to be given a tight slap.</div>
