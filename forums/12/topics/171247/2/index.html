It's burning and killing inside ur heart, it will be worse if u keep everything inside urself.<br><br>In my opinion, i feel that that guy is pretty interested in ur gf, he's taking no chance and spend as much time as he can with her, to accumulate his affections.<br><br>Although, i have no doubt ur gf is pretty much in love with u, on the hand, she might have give that guy a chance or may even alittle feeling for him, which mean it may be quite risky on ur relationship.<br><br>However, there's no chance for u to be too emotional and burst out ur temper, which will mess out everything and exposed a gap for the guy to come into ur relationship.<br><br>I have no idea how ur gf character is like. My suggestion is if u think u are confidence enough, do something unexpected for her, touch her deep inside her heart, letting her know u can do anything for her. Most impt, control ur temper, try to compromise.<br><br>Well, my analyse is quite extreme, but this is how i can see in a hostlic manner.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It can help if u try to numb e pain for a while and look back to the period just before yr gf got her new job and colleague. Importantly...<br><br>did u both have some underlying issues that remain unsettled?<br><br>any persisting arguments or disagreements that haven't been resolved?<br><br>how do you both, as a couple, solve problems concerning yr relationships?<br><br>etc...<br><br>if both of u are still dating, still together and haven't break up, it may not mean that she's interested in that colleague of hers. There're many reasons, and since as it appears that there isn't any going on between them, it'll help by you dropping this issue together and instead, work on improving your relationship between you and yr gf before things really go wrong. This is to trust yr gf, and also give her the space that she needs, and also e benefit of the doubt. On your part, do try to keep yourself in check whenever you're with her, so that you do not overreact when trying to talk about the "colleague issue"<br><br>Very importantly, there is a concern that if this pattern persist, things can happen the way you don't want it to be. A breakup at worst - i'm sure u'd want to avoid. Stay calm, try yr best to. Go back to the days you were dating and having conflicts. Explore the conflicts you both had..disturbing or unsettling it might be...exploring (on your own) your difficult times together can give your insights to how you can be a better boyfriend to her, or even answers to why she might be behaving the way she is today.<br><br>i hope this helps</div>

Get to know more new friends and go out with them. This would pull you out from the tiny little corner which consist only the two of you. Painful at first, but slowly you would get used to it, and you will find yourself handling people and relationships much better. Stop trapping yourself and open up! Hope it helps.</div>
