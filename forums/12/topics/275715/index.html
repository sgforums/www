Not to worry though, every soul goes through this phase. There are certain things you need to ascertain<br>though:<br><br>1) Where does your strength lies eg creativity? Analytical mind? Meticulous number crunching? - This would determine your competitive advantage<br><br>2) Where does your interest lies -&gt; You mentioned playing games, well what kinda games?? Its important as this would help in determining your<br>strengths (eg Warcraft?? -&gt; you like strategic planning, Racing games? -&gt; You like challenges (sales)<br><br>What course did you undertake in poly btw?? There are many jobs out in the market currently. However, whether you excel in those jobs or not<br>largely depends on your passion as well as attitude when you embark on your career. Meanwhile, I would say just relax and undergo your NS<br>1st. During this period, you will be exposed to social classification and the realism of life. You will mature and eventually, you will find you answer in due course. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Cheers</div>
