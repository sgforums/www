Before completing Poly, she was already working PT at the GValue (now Shop &amp; Save) as a cashier and then foreman and continue to do so 6 months after graduation.  She said she was not so keen on engineering work and likely to remain in retail as she found out she liked what she did as part timer very much, except for low pay.  She went for an interview at Changi Airport as a custom officer, but eventually she decided  for her current job in Orchard because she doesn't like the shift work schedule</div>

Try working on different environment to see how it goes.<br><br>I guess we're pretty much the same, im not sure what i want to do/be few years back. Then i wasted a few years, doin somethin i've no interest in and im very regretful. But now i know what i want to pursue in life, and trying to work towards it. Might be difficult tho. But with passion, perseverance and determination, i think nothin could hinder me to doin what i want. Haha~<br><br>For now, just complete your studies and after that, you could do what you want to do~ Decide for yourself, dont let others decide for you to do what you want to do in life. Thats what i did last time, i really regretted.<br><br>Passion or Money? You decide.<br><br>For me, i believe in passion. Might not apply in this place we're livin in but, it's just me. I'd rather do somethin i like but with low pay than to do somethin i've no interest in but high pay. Perhaps im very silly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Anyway i like to draw too, and am very interested in Visual Arts.
