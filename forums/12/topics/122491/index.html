            <div class='col-md body'>My first instinct when I read your story is the guy is a fraud who is simply giving excuses to buy time with you until he finds the right girl after which he will "heck"-care about u. However, you posted subsequently that you have betrayed his trust before, and other possibilities came to my mind. Maybe he still needs time to get over your betrayal OR he may simply be using this time round as his revenge to get back at you.<br><br>As there seems to be multiple scenarios, and I'm not this guy, therefore I don't know what's going thro his mind, I'd have to advise you to follow your heart then. If you feel that his contact with you now is genuine, that his care and concern for you is genuine, and you still want him back, then you have to continue the waiting game. And if that's the case, you better banish those images of him "doing" it with the old-act-cute Cyndi-Wang (BTW, what's so good abt looking like Cyndi? She has the look of a S L U T) or you'd feel like you're in the dump most of the time, and that's not good for your mental/physical health.<br><br>On the other hand, if you feel that his care and concern for you is just routine, without the passion, then you should seriously consider putting him into the friendship category and stick to that decision. You don't have another one or two years to wait for him...you're not getting any younger, you know.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> If you don't let him go, the next guy won't come along. And who knows, the next guy may just be the right one yar.<br><br>It's your call from here. Good luck!</div>

From then, u can decide on how to carry on with ur life. make things easier for everyone. If u got doubts, erase it. tats alL~~ For ur consideration~~</div>

It just shows you haven't grown much since the break up.<br>REmember that every relationship has it's reasons for it's failure and successes.<br><br>If he does want you back, he'll have to fight his way to prove his sincerity and how much you mean to him. But do not hope for it.
