            <div class='col-md body'>Heard many of u said love is blind, but I do not agree with it. For instance, parents love their children very much, but do they love their children blindly?no, whenever the child did a mistake, they scold him hoping he will change to the good person. Actually love is patience, caring, you care and respect the person..for someone who is 'blind' because of 'love', I don't think it's love at all. He/She who follows blindly or gave up blindly in someone they 'like' even though they know the other side is wrong is not does not have love but simply they are afraid of losing the person only. They only want the person to be their side. Any opinions?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That phrase, "Love is Blind", is open to many interpretations.  Some people think like you, taking the phrase literally (which is NOT wrong, by the way).  Some prefer to interpret it as accepting a person, faults &amp; all.<br><br>It doesn't mean you don't correct a person when you love them.  A parent wouldn't want a child to get into trouble with the law, or do anything to jeopardise his/her career, his/her life, etc.  But despite all these faults a child may have, doesn't the parent still love them?  If the child still had these faults, the parent wouldn't simply give up &amp; stop loving them, right?<br><br>The above is the 2nd interpretation of Love is blind.  You love that person despite that person having faults, even if you try to help the person overcome certain ones which you feel may be detrimental to their well-being.<br><br>If you smoke &amp; your parent tells you Not to  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> their love is Not blind?

            <div class='col-md body'>'Love is blind' happens mostly during teenage years and yes it is inevitable, but try to avoid these sort of situations. I dun believe most will end up happily ever after, maybe onli a few. What cause the 'blindness' to your partner's faults etc... is your heart(Emotion). If u let your heart rules too much, your mind becomes<br>irrational &amp; may do crazy or stupid thing.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  I believe in balancing both.<br><br>*Heart = Emotion, Moods &amp; so on &amp; *Mind = Logic, Understanding &amp; so on. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

Please understand &amp; remember ALL above are mainly cause by the Heart (our negative emotions). Sometimes we say that heaven is playing trick on us, but actually it is our *Heart that we lost control of. When that happens, depression + jealousy-possessive + anxiety + anger sets in, we are tempted to do crazy things. Basically the Mind cannot think logically after that.<br><br>Conclusion: Heart/Love (Emotion). If u love some1 or even something VERY VERY MUCH. Usually your Mind cannot work properly, sometime it jus went blank. (Literally blinded in love). Dun let this happen guys <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
