              <p>I don't think the problem lies with you liking that girl.</p>
              <p>I think its your attitude that needs correction. Maybe over-aggressive flirting i guess? Or maybe the "smart alec" mentality. You know it yourself dude.</p>

              <p>Heres some suggestion which may help you.</p>
              <p>Firstly, prevent them from having things to say about you. So don't do stupid things.</p>
              <p>Secondly, ignore them when they make remarks, but nonetheless be kind to them, like assisting them when they need help etc. It's hard for a person to hate someone friendly.</p>
              <p>Finally, try to have some backbone. When some remarks are overboard, like when it invovles your family, you must stand up for yourself and challenge them. Not challenge them to a fight, but prove to them that what they said are wrong.</p>

              <p>you are only 14?? oh my god, too young too young to be vex over these type of puppy love.. concentrate on your studies la.</p>
              <p>People that spreads about others are childish, and yet you want to spread back, therefore you are just as childish. What you should do is ignore it, and from now on change over a new leaf and become a better person. Dont have to do unnecessary stuffs to get revenge or get even with ya friends. If ya are sincere in changing yourself, i believe everyone can see with their own eyes.</p>
              <p>But you are also too be blamed. Maybe it was something that you did in the past that people saw already thought that you always have a liking for many girls at a time. Sometimes, people suffer because of the past actions.</p>
              <p>Cheer up dude, dont cry over such a small issue. Your friends are childish but you must not be as childish as them. You may not have what they have, but believe in your self and believe yourself that you are special in your own ways. One fine day you will find a girl that really loves you for who you are. Girls only, and girls will definitely cause boys to have problems and heartaches. So this is part and parcels of life. Get used to it. If she likes you and wants to be with you, then she will understand you as who you really are. If she listens to other people instead of knowing you for who you are then, she is not suitable for you, because she did not even make an effort to know you well.</p>
              <p>So cheer up, and study first la. O level might be 2 years ahead, but having a strong foundation is important in securing a good o level and your future. So study hard, if not in the future, we might see ya here again but this type being in agony because of your lousy O level score and no future life.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p><br>Hmm...don't worry, you won't be screwed.</p>
              <p>At most only the girl that you like will end up being Gang-RAPed by those popular Fs.</p>
              <p>Since you're so helpless about it right now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But hey!!! You could eventually come up with a solution and come to terms with it 10years later, so wait long long for someone to come and spoon-feed you the solution you needed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You already know what you need to do long ago, you don't really need to come here and look for an excuse to justify your cowardice. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>u better lose urself in the music the moment u own it u better never let it go go cos u only got one shot..</p>
              <p>aiyah, ok lah i gib advice lawls..</p>
              <p>at ur age, the kids are typically like that.. the problem now is that ur lacking "respect" from them. thats why its easier for them to mock and make fun of you. dude have u seen 8 mile the movie? ur fucking eminem man.. lawls.. what eminem did was simple. he absorb all the loser facts. in fact, it came out from his mouth. so when other ppl say it to mock u, it has lesser effect. and u gotta know some shit about the ppl ur dealing with. so u can throw it back at them.</p>
              <p>ur a flirt. ur a player. u like that girl. just admit so what? the reason why they are teasing u wit it is because they know they got one up over u cos u feel irritated. so u admit all these and stand proud they got nothing to make u irritated with. and thats when u move in and come up with their shit to make them feel irritated. and then "respect" is there and ur untouchable. and u will be eminem.</p>
