            <div class='col-md body'>One day a father and his rich family took his young son on a trip to the country with the firm purpose to show him how poor people can be.  They  spent a day and a night in the farm of a very poor family.  When they got back from their trip the father asked his son, "How was the trip?"<br><br>Very good, Dad!"<br><br>"Did you see how poor people can be?" the father asked.<br><br>"Yeah!"  "And what did you learn?"<br><br>The son answered, "I saw that we have a dog at home, and they have four.  We have a pool that reaches to the middle of the garden, they have a creek that has no end.  We have imported lamps in the garden, they have the stars.  Our patio reaches to the front yard, they have a whole horizon.<br><br>When the little boy was finishing, his father was speechless.<br><br>His son added, "Thanks, Dad, for showing me how poor we are!" Isn't it true that it all depends on the way you look at things?  If you have love, friends, family, health, good humor and a positive attitude toward life, you've got everything!<br><br>You can't buy any of these things.  You can have all the material possessions you can imagine, provisions for the future, etc., but if you are poor of spirit, you have nothing!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heheheh<br><br>When I first read this post, I wanted to respond to reassure the writer how education does not directly relate to qualities such as confidence, intelligence, understanding and maturity - qualities which I believe most girls will prize above and beyond a mere certificate.<br><br>I also wanted to share how I have settled down with my husband, who is an ITE graduate while I am a degree holder. In the beginning, he often confess that he feels very inferior about it despite me reassuring him it doesn't bother me at all. In fact, till now, he has me convinced that his good points far exceed many other so-called 'highly educated' people I have met.<br><br>Until i read the end of the post, and how the writer laments why only fat girls (despite the fact that these are not judgemental, not materialistic girls, albeit imperfect in other ways) seem to the only ones that finds him attractive and he can't get another girl who is more physically beautiful.<br><br>Then I realise.. ooops mebbe he is right. Hee!! Unfortunately I AM 'aesthetically challenged'!! So alas, I can't help the writer anymore - maybe he is condemned to an existence of unsatisfied desire. Too bad.</div>

The thirst for learning, improving, evolving and leveling up doesn't NOT only apply only to academic studies. It applies to your career, what you want to do with your life and how you want to shape your destiny.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> One example I can give you is Mark Lee - he got no paper cert, typical ah-beng-ah-beng kind and he married a decent-looking loving wife.<br><br>Of course, there are more real life example WHOM will tell you otherwise, which will fuel your current thinking even more, in a negative way. My stand is very simple: do you neccessary have to be what is happening to others? (Or becoming part of the statistic?) Can't you be the exception? Can't THIS is the movitation for you to attempt more than just 'hard' to excel in your life?<br><br>If you are merely contented, or lack the aggressiveness to change your path of destiny, then you will end up whatever you think you will be. You got to be street-smart/EQ, not IQ smart to success in life. If I was you, being a cook for nine years (without paper cert), I would spend these nine years to:<br><br>I) Build contacts.<br><br>II) Plan what you need to escape the fate of being a mere junior cook. You got to strive upwards.<br><br>III) Constant lookout for opportunity.<br><br>You got to work upwards and not be stangant - thinking that your job only revolves around 8-5 or similar AND merely working during that time. Or if your job is pretty mundane/mono, resist the idea of learning other things that could be related to cooking. No, it shouldn't be because you into 'society university' and the minute you resign to fate and be contended, you have sealed your own destiny.<br><br>THIS IS THE QUALITY THAT A MAN EXUDE AND MAKES HIM CHARMING AND WANTING - character. (In mandarin, it is known as Ge Xing)<br><br>If you don't have looks... fine. No paper... fine. Not born rich... fine. But if you also don't have that personality and character, you have nothing, even if you have the above three. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
