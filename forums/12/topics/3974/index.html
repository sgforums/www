Initially, i started to send her an email asking how's her job and things like that.<br>And we began to use email to "talk" every 2-1 day or so. But i had not gone out individual with her yet.I tried hinting her by saying things like<br>"....if i hve a wife like u, ............" and she repply<br>"no lah,me not good, too talkative.... so better find one not like mi..........." ,get the picture????<br><br>So just wondering if i got good chance of getting her anot????

Trust me, I'd already served NS, u will neglect her unconciously, mayb what u should do now is juz to keep in contact with her, mayb after your BMT, see whether your vovation in army is the "zo bo" vocatn, then u consider this problem and try to hint to her more directly. it's better this way, from my pt. of view.<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>
