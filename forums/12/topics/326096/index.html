              <p>The story goes like that-</p>
              <p>I join this company last year in Sept for an overseas project in Middleeast. The human resource personnel informed me that the project will starts in Oct 2007 and I will draw a fixed allowance of $3500. However, the basis pay was low ($1700) however I decided to take up this job as it was a project management role and the total pay package was good. The contract that the company gave me was a one year contract and it is suppose to end in Sept 2008.</p>
              <p>However, things start to take a turn in Oct. The company informed me that the project had been delay and it was only start till further notice. I was shocked by this news because I was not deployed overseas, there will be no allowance. Therefore I spoke to my supervisor whom I address as Mr.Ong and he informed me that we have to wait as we were specially recruited for this project. I waited till Apr 2008 and decided to surface this issue to the management regarding a change of job as there was another project management role in another key project in Sentosa. I spoken to the relevant project managers of the Sentosa project and they told me that they will take me into the project as well as Mr.Ong released me.</p>
              <p>I spoke to Mr.Ong and he also encourage me to cross over to the Sentosa project as the trip to Middle East is uncertain and the other project has better prospects. Therefore with the blessings of Mr.Ong as well as some other managers and engineers, I crossed over to the Sentosa project. However the nightware just begins to surface.</p>
              <p>The Sentosa project is a major project which involves close to 60 people in the team. The organisation chart is very complex which consist of a Project Director, 3 deputy project directors and 6 project managers for six different sites which means as a project executive, I am reporting to 10 managers who are seniors. While I was in the team, I realised that I am the only project administrator. As the work load was enormous and detail, I decided to speak to my dept manager, Mr.Ang and requested  for a salary adjustment. He replied that the salary adjustment is not justifiable and I will need to prove myself for at least 2 months before any adjustments were made. Feeling rejected, I accepted the decision and continue with my work. In the first week of June, I received a job offer from my previous company to take up a senior position and therefore I submitted my resignation letter at the 3rd week of June which means my last day of service is at the 3rd week of July. Prior to this resignation, I tendered my resignation for at least another 2 times but was rejected by the management as they begged me to stay. However, I made up my mind to resign this time was because the salary was much better and the job scope is direct and not political in nature.</p>
              <p>On July 7, I received the most shocking news of my career. I received a letter from this GLC company that they have terminated my contract as on 7 July 2008 as I have not reported for work on 4 July and 5 July. They claimed that I did not inform anyone of my whereabouts and therefore terminated my contract. They also accused me of stealing some confidential information of the company as well as some laptops from the company. Therefore on 8 July, I made a report with the police regarding the accusations but till now the police had not got back to me. I also higligted this matter to the ministry of Home affairs and Comissioner of Police and Director ISD as the information missing was cricual and highly senstive in nature. Till now, only the comissioner of police had got back to me only when I send a direct email to SM Goh to inform abt this matter on Monday.</p>
              <p>I had also spoken to NTUC Union to assist me in this manner and it is still in the pipeline. The most ugly part of the thing was that this company took my passport from my drawers and retain it and dont want to return to me. I personally went to their office which was located in Jurong East St 21 to take back but they refused to return also. I called 999 to report about this matter but the police office (SI Koh) who attended to me also did not lodge as a report. Last week, I went to Yishun North NPC to enquire abt this matter and was shocked to hear from the officer that there was no report made at all against the company except for the missing passport NP312 report that I made. This GLC company also got the assistance of a police officer (investigation officer) from Clementi Police Station to harass me but calling me to report at 12am at clementi police station.</p>
              <p>For your information, I was serving in the police force as an NS officer and still is an active ns officer. I am disppointed for what had happened as no one else can help me, even the law enforcers take the law into their own hand. can anyone help me?</p>

              <p>If you wish to contest your wrongful dismissal, the Police cannot help you. This is where legal advice comes in.</p>
              <p>The Police prolly haven't gotten back to you about your report either because:</p>
              <p>1) investigations are still ongoing [should take a lengthy while, as they always do when involving these types of cases]</p>
              <p>or</p>
              <p>2) they found nothing substantial in those accusations against you.</p>
              <p>But you got a call from Clementi Police Station asking you to report at 12am, probably because the GLC lodged a report at Clementi around that time.</p>

The company legal consel was only there when I demanded my passport to be return and he refuse. the police officer who were deployed there did nothing to retrieve my passport. I have nothing to my name now as it is very difficult for me to find a job now. I will not give up the fight against this company because as long as I am alive, I will use my last breath to fight for my rights. I did not send email to PM Lee or MM Lee because Mdm Ho is the executive director of Temask Holdings which this company reports to directly.</p></div>

And coming here to voice your grievances won't do you any good. This is just a small part of a forum society. I suggest you try the big guns like Business Times forum or some other media which has no direct link or whatsoever to your ex-company or to Temasek. And as other forumites suggested get a lawyer and not just any lawyer. A powerful one. If you have connection overseas, get from there otherwise I foresee you will be in deep deep shit</p></div>

              <p>So was it true that u were missing for 2 days...?</p>
              <p>And did u take out a laptop..?</p>
              <p>Maybe it is just a misunderstanding.....since u said u wanted to quit...maybe some manager had a similar experience of a former employee who did some unfriendly things.</p>
              <p>I think u should calm down first.</p>
              <p>Dont be too confrontational.....stop reporting to police, writing to ISD, writing to SM Goh.</p>
              <p>You blow it out of proportion.</p>
              <p>Calm down and be more subtle.</p>
              <p>Contact your Mr Ang and Mr Ong.....tell your story and ask their help....or any other persons who you are familiar with.....also HR people...</p>
              <p>But remember dont be confrontational....since you are an ex-employee now...if you are hostile they will be hostile back to you.</p>
