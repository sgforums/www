You can consider yourself 'unlucky' if you want to, that you happens to be with him during this phase and he happens to have other commitments attached to him at the same phase...<br><br>You have to learn this thing about 'commitments'. Understand that sometimes we have limited time and energy for things. One way or another, we still have to handle it. Though sometimes we just can't 'satisfy it all'... Try to be a little more tolerant with him for now... Understanding...? At least he's not out clubbing and having fun away with other girls behind your back... And treasure this bf of yours who has a good sense of responsibility for commitment which would probably be quite a GOOD POINT for you in your relationship in the future...<br><br>The BETTER NEWS... This 'phase' would probably fade in time to come... NS... BMT (the earlier phase of NS service) is often the more 'busy' part with lots of restrictions... Of course, there'll be periods on and off in which he'll be more busy and tied up with his NS issues... But this early point is crucial... Generally speaking, it should be better as he's attached out to units....<br><br>Then comes the 'after 2 years' (after NSF)... If both of you survived it that is...? Hehheh... Probably the 'fruit' and a more 'fruitful relationship' if both of you learn how to appreciate and respect each other now... And by giving him more understandings for now, you'll probably command more respect from him as well..? And a higher sense of maturity in handling the relationship in the future...?<br><br>So I say you can either learn to overcome and make the better of this relationship at this phase for now, or just 'give up' or be prepared for a losing battle in the future...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As for the 'attachments' to his family... Personally suggest...<br><br>Go down to his workplace on Sundays... Spend time with him (don't care who else is there...) and his family members... When the time is ripe, just politely reject or let his parents know when you'll like to be alone with him by making simple excuses... When you get them to accept and like you, it shouldn't be too difficult for them to see your point...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

What Kopiosatu says really rings bells! I remember my bf-ns days. They hang out with guys in camp, come out on weekends, hang out with guys and go into NS-chat mode <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> When they're not with their guy pals, they want to be with their family.  It's really a great time to get to know their new friends, keep in touch with school friends and get to know your bf's family better.  I managed to pick up a third language after a few months too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Give your bf and his family alittle time to adjust to the change? He's going through a different phase in his life now. Quarrelling won't help but supporting him might well bring you guys closer - he's got too little time to do everything he wants to do when he books out, including being with you. You may not be able to spend alone time with him for the time being but you can still be with him, even if it's with his family and his friends, right?  In time, you'll probably have him all to yourself again <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

It seems as if got gf like no gf like that which means I think he treats u more of a companion than a gf. I dun think there is some bf who wont spend the special day of bday with gf alone.<br><br>I suggest u have a good chat with him in a calm way. Quarrel doesnt solve things cos I think he doesnt understand what u want from him.

            <div class='col-md body'>It all depends on whether you both are willing to accept quality rather than quantity.<br><br>NS is something every guy goes through. Not that we expect the girls to understand - c'mon even the guys dun!<br><br>But knowing he does need a day to relax or help out his dad shows he needs his own breathing space. Life in NS consists of routine and more routine. It can be vigorous or boring. Either way, it's that close to living behind bars. Girls should at least understand that.<br><br>The fact that he feels a responsibility to help his dad shows he will one day accept a responsibility towards you. Neither of you have to face up to real challenges yet since you're in the 19-20 age bracket. So treat this as a start. Giving each other their own space is part of a relationship.<br><br>I have seen girls hugging their bfs outside camp just before booking in. Some won't even let go. Crazy as it sounds, letting go is always the hardest thing to do. But the sooner you get used to it, the better you will feel.<br><br></div>

Please take note a commited relationship involved both partner to spend quality time with each other perhaps the LEAST once a week. Both might have other important stuff need to do, but this is a relationship. If cannot even make decision and spend time with their partner, there's no pt going into one</div>

Understand that this is all a passing phase in most guys in Singapore. You can consider yourself 'unlucky' if you want to, that you happens to be with him during this phase and he happens to have other commitments attached to him at the same phase...<br><br>You have to learn this thing about 'commitments'. Understand that sometimes we have limited time and energy for things. One way or another, we still have to handle it. Though sometimes we just can't 'satisfy it all'... Try to be a little more tolerant with him for now... Understanding...? At least he's not out clubbing and having fun away with other girls behind your back... And treasure this bf of yours who has a good sense of responsibility for commitment which would probably be quite a GOOD POINT for you in your relationship in the future...<br><br>The BETTER NEWS... This 'phase' would probably fade in time to come... NS... BMT (the earlier phase of NS service) is often the more 'busy' part with lots of restrictions... Of course, there'll be periods on and off in which he'll be more busy and tied up with his NS issues... But this early point is crucial... Generally speaking, it should be better as he's attached out to units....<br><br>Then comes the 'after 2 years' (after NSF)... If both of you survived it that is...? Hehheh... Probably the 'fruit' and a more 'fruitful relationship' if both of you learn how to appreciate and respect each other now... And by giving him more understandings for now, you'll probably command more respect from him as well..? And a higher sense of maturity in handling the relationship in the future...?<br><br>So I say you can either learn to overcome and make the better of this relationship at this phase for now, or just 'give up' or be prepared for a losing battle in the future...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As for the 'attachments' to his family...
