I do agree with the fact that he is filial and family orientated but that doesnt mean having to neglect gf. Meeting up on alt Sat is the minimal. Which gf wont miss bf or vice versa for a day? Not to mention a week.<br><br>I think he shld be able to make the decisions himself. He shld realise that he cant keep helping his dad always and neglecting his love. I dun mean being filial is wrong but love is also important too.</div>

Think about it... Would it make him happy just to let him see your face for short? Make it SHORT visits.. Not routine...

Commitments don't have to be just work and family...? Can be work, family and you...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  It's just a matter of time management.. And at this point of NS, it should be quite tricky for now... If you force a form of mentality in choosing... "Tell me, 'A' or 'B'?!" type of thingy... You're just installing a form of dilemma within him.. It should in fact quickly result in certain level of instability either within himself or within the relationship.. Moreover to add, your relationship as you've mentioned moved on a 'fast tone'... That itself can be a good or bad thing... Bad in this sense of pushing him into CRITICAL DECISIONS when the relationship itself has not even stabilised and settle down...<br><br>I see a willingness in him to commit the relationship into a longer run... Hence his moves are less hasty types... You should be moving along with his pace... Slow down the momentum a bit, but at the same time try to slowly let him understand what you need from him... Let things balance off with his willingess to change... But REMEMBER, not hasty and pushing moves... No point getting all too excited with things now yeah..? Ultimately, I guess you should be expecting a long-term relationship with him? You should expect more 'challenges' ahead... Take the current one as an OPPORTUNITY to STRENGTHEN your relationship... And REMEMBER. In a relationship, it's always about 2 parties... Not one...<br><br><strong><br>He keep sayin give him time.. he'll change... but..<br><br>will it ever stop?</strong><br><br>Give him time then? Monitor things from there..? Remind him on and off...?

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;"><br>had quite a hard time understanding wat u were writing.. lol...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ... but i do sympathize with u... coz i rem during the time when i was in the army, i wld always look fwd to booking out to meet my gf... strange to me that ur bf doesnt... moreover, therez always the saying that "NS men are despos"... so it makes me wonder even more..<br><br>i suppose all u can do now is to be a little more accomodating ba.. being in the army is not exactly very ez for us guys, so i believe ur bf will really appreciate if u could make certain sacrifices for him if u truely luv him... anyway itz gonna be for only these couple of yrs, after that u can see him more often le...<br><br>may be u can try asking him to go out juz once a mth, n accompanying him at hm for the other wkends... i believe such things can be sorted out and arranged btwn any couples...<br><br>try not to begrudge the fact that he doesnt wanna go out most of the time... understand the kind of family that he has... sometimes he might be tired, or have other reasons in which he finds it difficult to tell u since u guys are only together for 5 mths...<br><br>in any case, hope u will show more tolerance to ur bf during this period of time, n that ur bf will grow to appreciate ur efforts to accomodate him... wish u luck..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></span></div>
