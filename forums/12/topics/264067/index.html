"Low self esteem"would be when you are obviously right but you feel bad when people criticise you and they are wrong.<br><br>As it is, in your post, you admit to "i gave the wrong answer" and " my post's info is wrong" ....<br><br>It is only right if you feel bad!<br><br>If you feel "very bad" or "bad excessively" then it is an attitude problem.</div>

NOT 1 sided. Not superficial. What I see from your comments is that your friends are at the superficial stage. You want to get closer to them, let them know your feelings. They think you are like a crybaby or sissy or ku niang or not man or anything that rebute you instead of UNDERSTANDING you, DUMP them.<br><br>These friends do not know the value of friendship. And you are still not strong or mature enough to handle such situations without affection your emotions at the time.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: red;">Ok, end of my view.</span></span><br><br>Be strong. Learn from all these and seek guidance &amp; opinions from more mature people on how to handle such situations and how they deal with it.</div>

Let people understand yr personality...<br>For example :<br>In SGforum bar, do u expect people to talk sense ?<br>In SGforum chit chat, do u expect all people to be serious ?<br>In SGforum AA, do u expect the TS to joking ?<br>Each different topic has a different characteristics and agenda. And we, SGFers noe these and usually tend to reply differently depends on topics...<br>Similarly :<br>If he is a joker type... when he speaks, every1's mind will switch to joking mode... if a person is a serious type... when he speaks, every1's mind will switch to serious mode... if a person is talk crap type... when he speaks, every1 will reply crap...<br>As u experience more, u will be able to switch many different kinds of personalities... But the more different kinds of personalities that u can switch, the more lonely u will become... &gt;&lt;<br>Anyway, for a head start, learn to do things that u enjoy... Let people understand u but dont let people confuse on yr personality...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm .. i have a friend who always seemed to be out of the place whenever we hav a conversation . Sometimes he jus crack lame jokes or jus simply moment abt something that has no link to the topic . Of cos the grp of us simply didnt really like him .<br><br>What i m tryin to illustrate is , prehaps ur personality don suit the grp u r in. U r tryin to suit urself to the grp . Hwever hard u try , the more awkward it seemed , resulting in adverse effects .<br><br>Of cos i m as guilty as ur frens , i used to tell my tat fren off in a rude way . It was immature n uncall for . As time goes i tend to reflect on my actions towards him , n try to tone down n accept who he is even though he is still weird in his own ways .<br><br>I cant offer u a solution , mayb u can start reflecting why r u being treated as such . I m sure no one deserves such treatment . If u can , prehaps talk to ur frens nicely telling them u r hurt. Usually its the communication problems .</div>
