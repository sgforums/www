              <p>I think this is a rather general sweeping statement. There may or may not have been someone else involved. But I do not think that is the main point.</p>
              <p>I just want to voice out what I've seen so far and my take on relationship issues. Maybe it has to do with Singapore's fast-pace way of life. Or maybe it's the mass media projection using sex to sell. Everything seem to work like instant noodle. Pour hot water and serve. A lot of sad relationships I see arise mainly because of a lack of understanding and communication. In a relationship, as days go by, partners tend to take each other for granted and not put in as much effort as during the courtship days. In my opinion, a relationship is not like an exam. You do not study just enough to pass the exam and that's it. A relationship is an ongoing process which will cause both parties to evolve and change, either for better or worse.</p>
              <p>And so, instead of looking inwards to see how to take the relationship to the next level, dissatisfaction drives a person to nit-pick on a partner's faults and resentment occurs. It is usually one party (or both at different occasions) voicing out his or her dissatisfaction and the other party ignoring and denying all tell-tale signs, only to be puzzled at why his/her partner left him/her, or <em>suddenly </em>become cold, uncaring and uninteresting.</p>
              <p>Communication is absolutely vital. Denying dissatisfactions no matter how little will not help to solve the problem but instead will accumulate and be buried over the years. Like a dormant volcano, it is only waiting to erupt.</p>
              <p>Humans are creatures of habit. Some people get so "comfortable" in a relationship also out of habit. Yes feelings are involved and "complications" occur. But that doesn't justify all that mess if one has not sorted out the internal "mess" within one's heart. What do you want in your own relationship and do you see it happening if you're already involved? Is there some too unrealistic expectations? Have you done what could be done? If what you do don't work, are you using the same unworkable method to secretly desire the same result?</p>
              <p>Not only that, some people get out of such relationships, in their haste and chase for a new love, only to land themselves in another one like this, yes you guess it, out of habit. It's a different partner, with a different face, body and build, status, social circle etc... but the same relationship patterns occur.</p>
              <p>Do you want to be in a relationship out of habit? I'm not sure for you, but I see flaws in such "contentment". If you know and have what you could do to improve your situation, would you do it?</p>

              <p>she is sick of you, not the r/s. pardon me for my frankness</p>
              <p>humans are like that, something new and excites . since she is sian den change a new gf, even if u guys carry on, it will be meaningless. this lil dissatisfaction will be blown out of proportion when the time to pull the trigger comes along n u will suffer more.</p>
              <p>pull the trigger yrself n press end game first n move on to find a better tree, u will suffer less.</p>
              <p>whether someone else is involved does not matter because if in the 1st place she is commited to the r/s, she will want to seek ways to improve it</p>
              <p>cheers my friend n may u find the solution soon</p>

              <p>My girl recently told me she is not as interested in the relationship as before. But seems like she cant bear to let go. Whats the reason for her to stay on then ? We've been together for about 2 years. And is it true that most of the time when the girl says shes nt interested in the r/s, theres someone else involved?</p>
