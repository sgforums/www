You excel in connecting with friends emotionally, which probably grant you the ability of having platonic friend without romantically involved with one.<br><br>Your passive nature could also influence you the lack of drive to do much. Maybe it's not doing nothing; you may feel that a relationship or not may not matter as much IF the bonds between two is strong.<br><br>Explore yourself and you may find your own answer. We live for ourselves, not that of others. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers  </div></blockquote>part of what you say about me is quite true except for 1 thing, it is not my lack of drive to do much that got me in this situation, its jus that I always feel that the friendship or bond that i share with them are very important and that i do not wish to do anything to damage it.<br><br>I guess unless I am able to learn to take the risk, I'll always end in the same situation over and over again ....... for now, I am happy that she has found someone that is able to give all the love and attention that she needs....<br><br>Thats what friends are for right ?????<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mate, I donÂ’t want to burst your bubble, but you are already being foolishÂ…right from the moment you realized you cannot get what you want. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>You want her as a lover in the first place, but when you realized that was not possible, you <strong>settled</strong> for the second best option! That is being foolish because you are not being true to yourself.<br><br>You can tell me how she isnÂ’t really that bad as a friend and how you donÂ’t mind giving her attention when she needs it<br><br>But the point is you SETTLED for the second best and you arenÂ’t really happy about it!<br><br>There are two types of friendship us men can have with a women.<br><br><strong>The first type is a purely platonic one.</strong> Common interests, shared history and passions in life keep the friendship alive. And both parties realized that there was no physical attraction involved.<br><br><strong>The second type is when the guy wanted the girl but couldnÂ’t raise her interest. He still opted to stay around as a friend secretly hoping that one day she will wake up and suddenly decides that he is the right one for her.</strong><br><br>You belong to the latter category.<br><br>If you are happy with that arrangement, you wouldnÂ’t be here in the first place.<br><br>HereÂ’s what you wrote to Yunhaier:<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MiX Metal:</div><div class="quote_body">I guess unless I am able to learn to take the risk, I'll always end in the same situation over and over again</div></blockquote>What you wrote to Yunhaier is the root of your problem.<br><br>Your unhappiness stems from the fact that you always ended up settling for the second best option due to your unwillingness to take risks.<br><br>You should memorize this phrase you wrote above and make it a part of your life.<br><br>And what you wrote to Zeny:<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MiX Metal:</div><div class="quote_body"> I treasure their friendship and I do not wish to do any stupid to destroy them ...... but I also know that in life, we are meant to make stupid mistakes in order to learn ...... its jus that knowing what to do and actually doing it are 2 totally different things ....Â”</div></blockquote>No one is telling you to destroy friendships.<br><br>In fact, leave all these relationships with your female friends as they are.<br><br>There isnÂ’t a need to change anything there because it is too late for you to do anything to get out of the friend zone.<br><br>Rather, focus on new relationships.<br><br>Before you start telling yourself how itÂ’s Â“complicatedÂ” and how there are a lot of things involved, go back and read what you wrote to Yunhaier.<br><br>Like I said before, I really hope you can do well one day. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>But you need to face your fears because <strong>that is the main difference between "knowing what to do and actually doing it."</strong><br><br>Brush all your other thoughts aside. Those are the product of your fear.<br><br>The only barrier you are facing, is yourself and <strong>your perception of risk.</strong><br><br>Take care.<br><br></div>
