Well, it isn't bad to an extent because we are the ones that most ppl go to when they need a listening ear or whenever they need someone to be around. It is because that we treasure friendship so much so that we do not want to let anything to disrupt it. If we go into a relationship with them, and it later ended up in a breakup, we can lose a friend. Thus, it prevent us from going into a relationship with them.<br><br>Guys who expressed interest in me, like what your female friends did, they gave me a lotsa hints. But, I guess i am a moron when it comes to decipher hints, they ended up being frustrated and went off to get another gf. As for me, I ended up frustrated because they suddenly "MIA". After a certain period, when they start to appear in my life again, its because they just broke up with their gfs.<br><br>Well, like you, they are surprised when they heard that after all these years, I am still single. hmm... I guess you know the reason.<br><br>"The best way to love someone, is not to make him your lover, but to keep him as a friend." Well, at least, thats my view now.</div>
