Which means those you are interested in, will end up as your good friends. Because you're a friend quality and best kept that way - so that they can tell you all their secrets without having you quarrelling with them like their boyfriends does.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>MÂ© suggest that you should learn to take control of the situations in courtship. Know exactly what you want and work on it.<br><br>About that gal who liked you.<br>Sad to say, your observation skills should be quite poor.<br>But then again, what did that gal do to show you that she's interested in you and waited for you?<br><br>Cheers</div>
