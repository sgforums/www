              <p>OK. So it's quite obvious she pulverized your EGO, and you are resentful about that.</p>
              <p>Let it go, ego has no place in the workplace.</p>
              <p>Now, frankly, I think both of you are so immature , if I am the boss, I'd buy both of you small frys a doll house to play with at work.</p>
              <p>Next time she ask you to pass a message on her behalf , you should respectfully decline and tell her to speak directly to that person herself.</p>
              <p>Is being a doormat part of your job scope ? I'm quite sure it's not.</p>
              <p>The only person who can treat you like a servant is your boss.</p>
              <p>You can still be friendly with her, but keep a distance if she is the kind that bully juniors. Open your eyes and recognise who are your allies or enemies.</p>
              <p>I suggest you keep co-workers as co-workers... seek your friendships OUTSIDE your work environment. SEPARATE personal life vs working life.</p>

              <p>Yagami......but do it in a subtle way...if you got a chance tell her why politely...and that you still want to be her friend but what she has done has hurt you.....sometimes woman will tyry to play the blame game but if she does it then walk away from her 'friendship" but remain in contact for work relations only...</p>
              <p>Maybe you should walk around office naked below your waist...you maybe a small fry but you can still have a big fly</p>
