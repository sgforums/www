            <div class='col-md body'>i always tell people in these situations, just tell the other person how u feel. if he reciprocates your feelings, congratulations... if he doesn't well dun be dismayed. i'm sure u wouldn't want him to ignore u...but the only reason why he'll ignore u is because u give him a reason to do so.<br><br>he might ignore u cause u make him feel uncomfy. so if u do profess(its not confess...confession is something bad) your feelings for him and he rejects your advances, i'm sure he won't want to reject you as a friend either. so be open about it. i'm sure u wouldn't want to lose him as a friend so make sure u dun give him a reason to do so(i hope u know what i mean when i say "reasons" if u dun, PM me)<br><br>if u play it cool and still treat him like a friend instead of idolising him or worshippin the ground he walks on, and he STILL ignores u, then he's a prick that's not worth your time..</div>

C is completely a character of the past with absolutely little connection. B is merely a passing by character - since he has no major impact in your personal tale - you can leave him out as well.<br><br>Then comes A, your ultimate crush, your source of agony. By the way, he is NOT a retard - in fact, there are only two reasons.<br><br>I) He knows it, but he refuse to acknowledge anything because he hasn't have any BGR feelings for you. Maybe if you consider 'sisterly love' as his form of affection bah. Anything else, hasn't been considered, yet. In my view, I am quite sure he falls under this category.<br><br>II) He truely doesn't know - man's curse. Man can't be hinted; the obvious way out of this is to speak your mind and tell him your exact feelings.<br><br>Well, you have a choice: to say or keep mum. To remain everything this way, yes you are right, you could only be good friends at best. You fear to express because you want to succeed, yet if you somehow fail, you dunno how to face him and risk losing this friendship. Why not combine this two components, modify and present them?<br><br>What I mean? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Tell him that about your liking for him WITHOUT expecting him to enter into a relationship with you. He will/will not be stunned/shocked, depending on how 'retarded' he is. Your aim for this confession is merely to let him know - well, if he truely likes you then, he will decide and tell you on a later date. This will not only relieve your emotional burden through sharing this information, but also to answer to your own queries about his thoughts and feelings. And importantly: Pick the right time.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maybe the hints u gave to guy A is not 'deep' enough for A to get your feeling. Guy A mention his Ex before you is wanted to test your feelings towards him, see wheather u would get jealous anot and not really that he still misses his Ex. Don ever give hints to a guy cause he would get confuse, guys seem to be more retard in relationship mayb. If u really like him, provided u have a moderate outlooks, just confess your feeling to him.</div>
