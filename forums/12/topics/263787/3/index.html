Thats why i always gobble up my food as quickly as possible , i dont wish to feel lonely.<br><br>In school , i got this grp of friends . Whenever one of their friends is still eating , they wait for him . But whenever im still eating , they never wait . They even ask me to help them put their plates n cups back and left just like that .  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Dat day , i asked a few of my classmates to accompany me to eat , they say they wan finish homework , no time . So i went downstairs to teh canteen to buy my lunch . I order ta pao (take away) so that can bring back to class. But i got chided because im not allowed to eat in class by my teacher . So ended up going back to the canteen to eat on my own .<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
