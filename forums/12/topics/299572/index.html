            <div class='col-md body'>it's not about who she loses her virginity to, it's about her losing her self-respect and her love for herself. i do agree that virginity is only valuable to the person who values it, so as a friend we should help her to learn how to value it and not just stand there and watch her crumble.<br><br>i understand that all you want to do is to help her... personally i would do everything i can to wake her up man. the guy doesn't even like her, why should i let this idiot hurt her unnecessarily? it's just a whole problem that doesn't need to happen. but if you've done your part, if you've tried your best, if she still chooses not to heed your advice, i feel sad but she's chosen to learn the hard way. so now the rest is up to her. she's lucky to have friends like you who care about her.<br><br></div>
