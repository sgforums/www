This is probably difficult for the birth parents especially.<br><br>but on the other hand, sometimes things should be left as they are. Looking up birth parents and openly acknowledging them may seem quite insensitive to the foster parents who brought the child up.</div>

As the saying goes, yi zhong mi yang bai zhong ren (one type of rice raise all kinds of people). Some will want to know, some wish they never found out, some wish to find out but will never admit they are their parents and the list goes on.<br><br>I doubt that the birth parents will forget about their child. It's their own child after all. I have an uncle who has been given up for adoption since young, and he's now back with us.

            <div class='col-md body'>okay...here's something from the books of adopted kids and then adults in USA.<br><br>Threadstarter, can try to locate the birth parents and keep the adopted parents in the loop of things?<br><br>Not just for curiosity sake, but also to prevent future generations mishap.  Since genetic testing isnt that widely available to members of public yet.<br><br>You dont want your children to be marrying his/her aunt/uncle.<br><br>Or married to close cousins, I think you all knows what inbreeding is.<br><br>And with eggs &amp; sperm donations, there is chances of even half siblings marrying each other.<br><br>So a certain knowledge wont hurt.  And locating birth parents can also help to ascertain possible family diesease that is genectically passed down.  So treadstarter will know and can take preventive actions earlier.<br><br>from heartattacks, diabetes, hogkins &amp; dunno how many else diesease that the threadstarter can know when he/she finally knows the birth parents.</div>

No matter what, the birth mother carried the child in her womb in 9 months, be it rich or poor, be it a beggar or a rich person, the child will not be alive if not for her. a person will be respected more if he/she do not use parents money.</div>
