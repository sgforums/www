            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, i been reading through the forums and it seem to be a common sight about guys asking if they should confess, or if they should chase their ex-gf, or if they should risk friendship over bgr. But im gonna quote this story that encouraged me to take the leap of faith [although im 100% she like me but its the other issues that im grappling with] and here it is<br><br>A couple of hundred years ago, Benjamin Franklin shared with the world the secret of his success. Never leave that till tomorrow, he said, which you can do today. This is the man who discovered electricity. You think more people would listen to what he had to say. I don't know why we put things off, but if I had to guess, I'd have to say it has a lot to do with fear. Fear of failure, fear of rejection, sometimes the fear is just of making a decision, because what if you're wrong? What if you're making a mistake you can't undo? The early bird catches the worm. A stitch in time saves nine. He who hesitates is lost. We can't pretend we hadn't been told. We've all heard the proverbs, heard the philosophers, heard our grandparents warning us about wasted time, heard the damn poets urging us to seize the day. Still sometimes we have to see for ourselves. We have to make our own mistakes. We have to learn our own lessons. We have to sweep today's possibility under tomorrow's rug until we can't anymore. Until we finally understand for ourselves what Benjamin Franklin really meant. That knowing is better than wondering, that waking is better than sleeping, and even the biggest failure, even the worst, beat the hell out of never trying. - Meredith Grey<br><br>So hey, stop fretting. Its better to fail than to never try. But of course, know that sometimes, its better to move on AFTER trying. To all troubled friends out there, gambatte!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Usually for troubled people, they are blinded. Blinded by their own emotions from the heart. Even if the solution is right in front of them, they just could not notice it. And thus without sufficient advice, life story and blah, they will be just wandering in the dark...<br><br>Many different opinions, life story and advice helped these people to feel for these solution and thus, finding their own way out of the situation. It builds up confidence lvl on these troubled people.<br><br>TS story is inspirating but does not imply for all troubled people... Probably, most of the troubled people have already heard of this story but they are still lost in the dark.<br></div>
