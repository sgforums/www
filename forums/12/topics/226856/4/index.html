The feeling is terrible, i hope everything will be fine for me but i will be strong no matter what's the outcome.  I guess all of you stop scold D, yes D use to love me very much.  But for some reasons we are not able to be together, so he is very protective towards me.  And he is always there when i am hurts.  Anyway i do not heed everything he say, usually i will think over and ask others for advice too.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update on the issue</span><br>Things turn worst on 2 Jan 07, we had a sms heated up because of what i written on my blog (purposely announce our relationship) he got angry.   Ask me to remove his contact from my blog. He don't want his online friends to know i am his girlfriend.  After that he didn't talk / sms me. So at nite i sms him, is everything ok, if i done wrong i apologize.  I ask him what happen to him after his business trip, he change alot.<br><br>3 Jan<br>sms me, he never change juz that i think and scare i talk too much to his new online friends and if he bring me back i will talk too much to his family.<br>He say believe i will not change, cos it's my character.  (which most of my fren voucher i am not)<br><br>4 Jan; 8pm<br>(1st SMS)<br>i told him, i am hurt by his comments.<br>He told me sori if it hurts, but it's true. Then..<br>he told me he will not be free these season,<br>1) busy with religious event etc..<br>2) photo taking<br>3) need time to review our relation, coz he hope his future wife will not bring pro to him and his family.<br><br>(2nd SMS)<br>he said.<br>most impt issue, d day b4 he left for trips.<br>He dreamt of something came to his dreams, to caution a lady born in my yr will bring harm to his family due to her "Poison Mouth"<br><br>5 Jan<br>Totally never heard from him.<br>Unless i initate the sms.<br><br>So now do you people still think i have problem ?<br>Frankly i didn't say nor bad mouth anyone infront of him, i only tell him my family issue etc.. what i have been stress in house, but usually i don't tell him much.
