Your boyfriend is indulging in HEALTHY and DECENT hobby... I don't see why there is a cause for concern, unless it drains too much financial ability (which you would probably nag) or if he truly neglects you in that sense. Would you rather your boyfriend spend those precious dollars in nightclubs and fool around with slattern woman?<br><br>That isn't my greatest shock - your man actually mention that he willing to compromise if there is something he hasn't done well, namely the way he treats you. If there are dissatisfaction with regards to the quality of time spent, shouldn't you be talking to him and letting him know that sometimes, you just wanna spent your time together like movies and shopping? You could also arrange that if he wants to do his photography, he would indulge in alone/with friends and when he is done with it, he could meet you for a proper date?

(2) it doesn't turn into an obsession/bondage... (3) doesn't ruin the original model of love?<br><br>(II) To take down all his faults and when things go out of hand, leave him? When you have noted a certain flaw, shouldn't you be the first to let him know, in order to reduce certain intensity in the relationship? Then you two could work together to resolve issues and not dump him with all his blind spot as you condemn him?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You are LEADING a relationship; this is not a competition on who's personality is more perfect my dear. </strong></span><br><br>(III) And worst of all crime; don't tell your boyfriend anything. Let him think.<br><br>OMFG!<br><br>Lemme translate that sh!t for you:<br><br><strong>Eliminate communication and decentralization; allow circumstances to control market force. </strong><br><br>Your relationship will probably die sooner if you eliminate communication and expect everything to be enlightened from nothing. If you wants him to reflect on certain issues, you got to FIRST speak to him before you could allow him some time to digest those mambo jambo.<br><br>WTF is if he got heart for him, he will know what to do?<br><br>I throw the question back at you: if you got heart for him, do you know what to do? And are you DOING it now? Doing it RIGHT?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Remember, you are in relationship that's truly yours.

But honestly, everyone have a hobby, and it will surely be times when he indulge in his favourite hobby and thus have less time for you. And that doesnt mean he dont love you ya?<br><br>Keep in mind, a relationship is not to control and to be obsess with someone or something. You also have your hobby, you also have things you like to do. But when you are spending time doing things you like to do, you will have to sacrifice time with him.

At this time, all your complaints are only about yourself. You know that he treats you well. You know that he likely loves you by buying expensive stuff for you. But you are not contented.<br><span style="color: red;">i know he treat me well but i want more then expensive stuff.  I need his attention.  </span><br><br>You want to put a stranglehold on his life, to not pursue his interest, because you selfishly want him to spend time with you.<br><span style="color: red;">I didn't mention nor need him to stop pursue his interest to company me through out.  I just need him to not to be so much engross in hobby until 7 days a week, 4 days into hobby and 4 days of meetup with me is follow him to photographing.. </span><br><br>Relationships arent about being sticky. You should find other avenues to keep yourself occupied.<br><span style="color: red;">I consider myself nt sticky, coz i am working 5.5 days full time.  At times, i do my freelance twice a week.  So i am not sticky</span><br><br>Importantly, realise that relationships isn't exactly about needs. You dont need to be with him very oftenly to be happy.<br><br>Still I believe the best form of relationship is where both party do not need or obssess with one another, but one where you CHOOSE and WANT to be with each other and able to keep apart without affecting your feelings.<br><span style="color: red;">I need someone who is family man and will company me.  Not someone who dump lump sum monthly and go out. </span><br><br>Seriously, with this kind of thoughts, I think your BF is better without you, not the other way around. Reflect carefully.<br><span style="color: red;">And you have no right to judge who is better off without who.  Coz he nor me had mentioned wanting without each other. But in anyway thanks for your prompt reply. appreciated.  </span></div>

Let him think.<br><br>OMFG!<br><br>Lemme translate that sh!t for you:<br><br><strong>Eliminate communication and decentralization; allow circumstances to control market force. </strong><br><br>Your relationship will probably die sooner if you eliminate communication and expect everything to be enlightened from nothing. If you wants him to reflect on certain issues, you got to FIRST speak to him before you could allow him some time to digest those mambo jambo.<br><br>WTF is if he got heart for him, he will know what to do?<br><br>I throw the question back at you: if you got heart for him, do you know what to do? And are you DOING it now? Doing it RIGHT?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Remember, you are in relationship that's truly yours.

We are not you. You boyfriend don't even understand you. Rather, did you try to understand him? Are you being loving like what a real woman should? Being loving doesn't mean you sms him your love. It can also mean you know what he is thinking and understand his problems. It also means you don't cling onto him like some guys do.<br><br>I believe there are more information that you have not been telling us. What else did you sms him? Are you expecting more sms from him? Are you secure in yourself? Or are you expecting him to make you feel secure?<br><br>I believe he's been pressured by you to spend more time with you. He's probably trying to breathe. You are trying too hard. Sometimes, you should just keep a hold on yourself.<br><br>doko</div>
