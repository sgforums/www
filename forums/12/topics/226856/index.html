You should be asking and answering yousrelf that question. Are you contented with just all this?<br><br>Btw, have you tried talking VERY HARD to him about all these.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think.. You are not understanding enough to your BF's interests. At this time, all your complaints are only about yourself. You know that he treats you well. You know that he likely loves you by buying expensive stuff for you. But you are not contented.<br><br>You want to put a stranglehold on his life, to not pursue his interest, because you selfishly want him to spend time with you.<br><br>Relationships arent about being sticky. You should find other avenues to keep yourself occupied.<br><br>Importantly, realise that relationships isn't exactly about needs. You dont need to be with him very oftenly to be happy.<br><br>Still I believe the best form of relationship is where both party do not need or obssess with one another, but one where you CHOOSE and WANT to be with each other and able to keep apart without affecting your feelings.<br><br>Seriously, with this kind of thoughts, I think your BF is better without you, not the other way around.

            <div class='col-md body'>A person comes with his quirks and idiosyncracies, hobbies &amp; habits included.  If he didn't have his own unique traits he wouldn't be HIM and you may not like him in the first place, right?<br><br>Photography is harmless really!  If it isn't a bad habit or something detrimental to his health,  I think he should be given space to indulge in it.  Just negotiate a compromise, e.g. once a week bring you out to a place of your choice, watch movie every other week, etc.  And in exchange when he is out taking photos, you let him do his thing in peace.  So he can enjoy his hobby and still make you happy.<br><br>Have a little faith in your man!  Try working out your own relationship first, before you start listening to other people and doubting your bf.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No.<br><br>I think the problem lies in you, threadstarter.<br><br>You demand a lot of love from your boyfriend. You have low self-esteem. I see nothing wrong with your guy. He treats you well, yet you want more. You want him to be with you 24/7. That is being unreasonable. Even if you don't want this relationship, sooner or later, he will call it quits if you continue your behaviour like this. Outside he may feel happy, inside, he may be trying to call off this relationship.<br><br>Think about it, girl. Get more love from parents and siblings instead, unless you don't get it from them.<br><br>doko</div>
