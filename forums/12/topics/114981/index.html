            <div class='col-md body'>felicia.. do u tink u r pretty? do u tink u r good enough for him? do u tink he cares about u when maybe he is tinking this way about u too? .. too many qns? Make the first move then... Every1's always waiting for the other party to make a move first.. Whenever u r going out in a group, u could ask him along.. Whenever u r feeling down u could call him out.. im sure he will be more than willing to listen... Maybe u could try composing some music.. Ask him to be ur personal critic... After that, to thanks him, write a song for him.. There are so many alternatives my dear sister.. As the saying goes, The higher your hopes, the more painful the crash. Hope for it, do what u can, leave the rest to god..<br>Felicia.. Love is an experience that you would sometimes really dread, or feel blissful, If u had never experience be4 love, i would say, go aheard.. But.. Keep in mind the mundane problems that come with a attached status.. The Guy that u like is going to NS soon.. U won't Be Able to see him most of the time.. He may be stressed by the Vigourous training... And may show u the least of love... I emphasise,,, MAY... Dun be scared of the consequences.. Which may be pain, hatred, anger, sadness, jealousness, nor any other emotions.. let those be expected.. Have confidence in urself.. Always tink positive.. Dun let ur life be bogged down jus becuz a guy doesnt take ur hints... U always have ur friends, families, Etc.. sighz.. well, i really wish that u will succeed in wadever step u choose to make next... TAke care alrightZ? Nitez SisZ</div>
