              place-and-train programmes have been launched as part of the National 
              Trades Union Congress's efforts to get more locals into the supply chain
               industry.</p>
              <p>The Place-and-Train Logistics Specialists programme is for locals 
              with at least N-level qualifications and it will put them in jobs paying
               at least $1,600 a month. Participating firms can get funding support 
              for up to 90 per cent of the course fees, capped at $1,800 per trainee. 
              Trainees will also get a monthly $400 training allowance for up to six 
              months.</p>
              <p>For mid-career professionals, managers and executives with diplomas, 
              there is the Place-and-Train Logistics Operation Executives programme. 
              Participants will receive a monthly $1,000 training allowance for up to 
              six months, and will have a starting salary of at least $2,500. Firms 
              can get funding for up to half of the course fees, capped at $2,750 per 
              trainee.</p>
              <p>The schemes were announced on Monday by the NTUC's Transport &amp; 
              Logistics Services Cluster. In a separate training programme for drivers
               launched in July last year, the cluster also subsidised Class 3 and 
              Class 4 driving licences for 700 unemployed or low-wage workers, thus 
              helping them to get jobs or increase their pay. Another 2,000 places are
               now available for subsidised Class 3 licences.</p>

              First asked yourself this question. You have just completed your NS and now you are suppose to be a man and no longer a teenager. Can I afford to pay for my own fee? Who is going to support me financially? Do I have enough finance to get me through my studies?

              <p>Two
               schemes to attract more Singaporeans into the logistics industry have 
              been launched by the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC).</p>
              <p>They promise a job along with training, to meet growing demand in 
              this sector that involves the storage and distribution of goods.</p>
              <p>One is the Place-and-Train Logistics Specialists programme, which 
              aims to place 100 trainees in jobs paying at least $1,600 a month.</p>
              <p>It is for Singaporeans or permanent residents with at least N-level 
              qualifications. They will receive a monthly training allowance of $400 
              while their employers can get funding for up to 90 per cent of course 
              fees, capped at $1,080 per trainee.</p>
              <p>The other scheme is for mid-career professionals, managers and executives with diplomas.</p>
              <p>Called Place-and-Train Logistics Operation Executives programme, it 
              hopes to attract 50 trainees, who will get a $1,000 training allowance 
              and starting pay of at least $2,500.</p>
              <p>Firms can get funding for half the fees, up to $2,750 per trainee.</p>
              <p>The programmes are part of NTUC's Transport &amp; Logistics Services 
              Cluster's continuing effort to draw locals into the industry.</p>
              <p>Another training scheme, launched last year, has subsidised Class 3 
              and 4 driving licences for 700 workers so far, helping them get new jobs
               or better pay. For instance, 30 unemployed workers found jobs after 
              getting a Class 3 licence, making at least $1,500.</p>
              <p>Another 206 low-wage workers had pay rises after getting Class 4 
              licences for heavy vehicles. They earn more than $2,120, up from $1,700 
              to $1,800 before. Another 2,000 places are open for Class 3 licences.</p>
              <p>The schemes and updates were announced yesterday during an NTUC visit to the Tampines warehouse of logistics company YCH Group.</p>
              <p>Following NTUC's programmes, it has drawn up two new career paths for
               material handlers, who move goods in warehouses. Now they can go on to 
              be heavy vehicle drivers, or be trained to be logistics assistants.</p>
              <p>Also, a new automated storage system has freed its material handlers 
              to acquire more skills and, in turn, earn more. Said its chief executive
               Robert Yap: "Being more productive means we can pay them more."</p>
