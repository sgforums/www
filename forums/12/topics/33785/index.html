Stereotype images of a rich, spolit, pampered girl clouded my impression of her, banishing thoughts of going after her away.<br><br>I mean, I belong to a family that barely made it to middle class. Where am I going to find a car to send her home everyday? How am I going to buy her diamonds and rain it on her? Nah, maybe if the recession makes her family poor, then I can consider going after her.<br><br>Meanwhile, my focus shifted another target. She was a partime worker who was spending her post A level holidays meaningfully in my company.<br><br>She was sweet and adorable but the major drawback was the age gap.<br><br>"Oh com'on, at least my spirit is still 21" I reassure myself of my youthfulness.<br><br>I took every opportunity to talk to her and after much effort, I managed to get her ICQ no. Speaking of ICQ, its really a great invention. I mean, how else could you get a contact information from a girl without letting the cat out that you are interested in her?<br>(She did not have a handphone as she has not attained the legal age to register for a number. Well, at least she attained the legal age to do after more important stuff.).<br><br>All this while, she responded to my 'advances' warmly, encouraging me to pursue her with more gusto. However, I managed to keep my courtship antics discreet enough to keep my colleagues in the dark... including 'Yingying'.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Soon, "underaged girl" was ending her job stint at my firm. I bought her a gift and intend to give it to her when her day ends.<br><br>Time flew that day, and soon she was bading her farewell to everyone. I was hesitant in giving her the gift as I was afraid of being rejected. Being 20 plus and still a virgin at BGR, you can imagine the countless times I was at the wrong end of rejections.<br><br>When I finally mustered up my courage, I found out that she just left the office! Shit...<br><br>I hurried to the lift landing, and thankfully she was there!<br><br>"hey, underage girl, I have something for you leh"<br><br>"Har? What?"<br><br>"Its in the office lah... you follow me come back."<br><br>So she followed me back to the office, with the curiousity of Little Red Riding Hood.<br><br>"Nah" I presented the gift to her. It was a Leo statue(Her horoscope sign) which was also a container for chocolate. I made sure I chose a gift that was neutral enough that can make her happy yet does not explicitly says that I like her, just in case she doesn't reciprocate. I ALWAYS have a 'retreat' route.<br><br>She seem to like it enough. Thanked me and left the office.<br><br>"No goodbye kiss ah?"<br><br>Of course I was just wondering to myself.<br><br>While all these transpired, it was in the full view of Yingying, who is now trying to make sense of this encounter.<br><br>Did I mention I also manage to get her pager number? hehe...<br><br>Soon, i graduated from ICQ to start having phone conversation with her.<br><br>Talking on the phone is very much different from ICQing and definitely requires more skill and power!<br><br>While ICQ allow for pauses and timeouts here and there, phone conversation is serious one on one! While during ICQ you can pause and think of something to 'say', these pauses are pretty awkward in a phone conversation! It it doesn't help that both parties are nervous and apprehensive. Thats why anyone can be a Casanova on the Net. The same person can be a retard on the phone. A professor in ICQ can fail the PSLE in phone.<br><br>Nevertheless, the first phone conversation went ok, mainly due to my diligence in jotting down topics on paper before the call.<br><br>But subsequent phone encounters were less than satisfactory, as topics start to wither out. I mean i already mastered her family tree until the last leaf liao, and we really didn't have much in common. Though we attended the same secondary school, we studied at different locations! The toll of the age gap starts to set in.<br><br>The chemistry really does not seem to be there.<br><br>Or issit? I think we are both new to this game, so probably still very raw and self concious. Just give it time.<br><br>Other than that, she played her part in reciprocating my feelings well.<br><br>All the signs seem to be pointing in right direction. After consulting the stars, the moon and the milky way, I decided to ask her out on a date.<br><br>(Notice, unlike other typical stories, I don't have a "Casanova, Lady Killer" irritating friend dishing out advice to me. Cos I don't believe in consulting one. Not that I don't have friends lah.)<br><br>Anyway, we decided on the clinche movie date. Pearl Harbour was the movie. Maybe she can cry on my shoulder when Ben Affleck's plane is shot down.<br><br>(Mistake No.1: Don't choose a movie with a hunk looking better than you. Pearl Harbour is one fatal mistake cos it has 2! Imagine a girl watching 2 dashing hunks maneuvering fighter jets, gunning down baddies and winning the battle despite being outnumbered 2,000 to 3 and you told her that you lost your way while locating the toilet. That will not do you good. Watch movies with goofy guys who make fools of themselves, like Robin Williams.)<br><br>Anyway, the movie went well, though there was no bodily contact throughout, unfortunately.<br><br>We decided to discuss the Great Battle at the McDonalds.<br><br>After the customary "So, how you find the movie?" The converastion seemed doomed and going nowhere as we anxiously searched for topics by staring in the air.<br><br>"Nah, this one for you"<br><br>She got something for me too.<br><br>It was a clock. Wow. She remembered!<br><br>It was like weeks ago that I mentioned I came in office late cos of a faulty alarm clock.<br><br>"Thanks. You really go for the details."<br><br>"I observant mah."<br><br>We both laughed. That was a real life-saver.<br><br>But warning: Do not use this technique too often, cos you'll both go broke very soon.<br><br></div>
