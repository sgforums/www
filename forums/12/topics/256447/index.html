Why not bring that lesson with you (since you had already 'paid' that lesson) and strive to excel towards a next possible relationship?<br><br>Your ex-girlfriend will not bother about whether you are moving on or not. Here you are telling us about how depress you are and how she meant a world to you and there she is revelling in the gaiety of her new life. Then perhaps you should have that maturity to be accepting and learn to proceed forward instead of back-tracking your route.<br><br>Seriously, doing silly things like popping by with a bunch of roses just further your losses and counting.<br><br>Mend your wounds first by being accepting about your situation.

It's all too late to realize everything, now she only wanted to treat me as a friend and not more than that. How? devastated, confuse, hurt and etc, all i can do is only accept it unwillingly. She's my first love and the longest duration among all my ex. We had been together for 6 months...<br><br>How to swallow this pain? Friends suggest not to think so much but it don't last long, everytime when I was doing nothing, the memory always flash back and we had go almost every places in singapore and each time I visit the places with friends, I tend to think back the memory.</div></blockquote>TS, only way is to Clench your fist, grit your teeth, put one foot in front of the other and slowly move on.<br><br>this process is not going to be easy nor fast... but it will move forward if you put your mind to it.<br><br>on another note,<br><br>isn't it funny how when we are still together, we rarely show such romantic gestures...<br><br>however it's when you have broke up, that such gestures suddenly become in abundance and sometimes even seems annoying...<br></div>
