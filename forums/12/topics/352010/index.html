              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>As the increase of number of suicide cases recently (after yr2000), especially teenagers committing suicide, I want to do a social project to help people who are having unsolvable problems by preventing them to commit suicide. I hope more people could understand that life is just an experience, no matter how much you are enjoying or suffering, you only have one chance to experience it. Nothing in life will happen twice.</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>I think nothing could be stronger than true stories of suicide saviors. If you or any of your friends had committed unsuccessful suicide and willing to share the experience with others, to help more people be aware of this issue and understand more about the true values of our precious lives.</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Please drop me a email asap if you are willing to help~</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Thank you very much!!!</span></p>

              <p>When we see someone going to jump out of a window, with tears in his or her eye, are we gonna say "Wait arh, I go look for counseller for you. I will advertise in the papers for you. Must have a degree and at least 1 year working experience, okay?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One does not need a 'qualification' to help, c'mon. It is ridiculous. All one needs is someone who has a heart and willing to offer a lending ear - that's all it bloody well takes! Even a roadsweeper can help avert the death of a wannabe suicidal confused person by listening first then directing him/her to someone who can offer solutions.</p>

              <p>I applaud the TS Apple Pie In your eyes' civic consciousness and public spiritness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is seldom seen in our too pragmatic society and espacially in institutions of higher learning, where it seemed that their quest for knowledge is mainly for their own wallet and future condos, and not for the noble purpose of uplifting the lives of the lesser educated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> They seemed to have chosed to became an elite, separating themselves from the common people, losing touch with the ground, from which we all sprang from. No one was of royal blood when Singapore became an independant state.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People like Apple Pie are the hope for a civil and more caring society. No matter how perfect or resiliant we think ourselves are, there will always be some who will be left behind, either financially, physically or mentally. We must never forget or leave them behind. They are our fellow citizens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Their forefathers worked hard to build up Singapore what it is today. Think about it as you sit in the spanking clean MRT or study in a fully equipped modern classroom and ask yourself - who paid and built such facillities?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Human lives are precious. Good Luck Apple Pie.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Thank you very much for all replies, I’m not trying to study or analyze the causes for suicide, as I think for different individuals they have different reasons. We can’t do something that could directly solve their problem, so what I want to do is using true stories to let people know that if they give up on their lives, they would miss more precious moment which would happen in their lives. I hope to have someone who tried to commit suicide but did not succeed, and they feel grateful that they did not die stand out to share their stories; or someone had friend or family member committed suicide because of some unsolvable problems, but eventually all the problems had been solved not because of his/her death. I wish to put these true stories together to let people understand nothing in life is going to last forever, every day is a fresh day. When people understand this through all true stories, they might think twice when they face difficulties in life and would not give up so easily.</span></p></div>

              Only things certain in life is death and taxes.
              
              Whenever I'm feeling like life is giving me shit, and I'm feeling my lowest. I would think of the many stories I've read on the newspaper. People who are borne with diseases, children in Africa who would marvel at the little things that we take for granted everyday. All this story will make me feel blessed with the life I have and give me hope again.
              
              There are people worse off than me, and if they are living with smiles on theirs faces then I should live everyday smiling too.
              
              Just sharing my thoughts.
