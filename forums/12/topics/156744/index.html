            <div class='col-md body'>This girl used to be kind of close to me although not very close. I've always have feelings with her ever since we met, she's not chio nor ugly, and my friends will classified me as no-taste whenever they know I keep the feelings for her cuz she's neither chio nor 'got body'. Last time I always offer myself to help her. She appreciated it when I offered help or myself to comfort her when she's alone. I knew she was never on the same page despite my feelings for her. She treats me as buddy only...a reliable buddy and she felt comfortable whenever she's with me(that's what I guess and feel). Sometimes I act cool in front of her to hide my intentions cuz I don't want to lose this friendship. But I felt no point going on like this; she treats me as a reliable fren while I have to hide myself in the dark corner just not to be seen and save this friendship. So one day I decided to confess to her few months ago. As expected, she rejected me. I was half sad half relief as I don't need to hide anymore....but it comes with a pay; she is now scared of me. She seems like will pyshically stay a distance from me. Whenever I'm physically close to her(about 2 meters away) she will go further (more than 10 meters away). She also looks at the direction away from me. I feel sad and hurt whenever she's doing this straight to my face.<br><br>Does anyone here has any suggestion how to win the friendship back/her trust that i'm not into intention? I really helped her without any intentions...but she might missuderstood what I've done now after I confessed to her. I don't mind not having her as my gf as u can't force anyone to like u but I'm really sad as it had affected our friendship. What should I do to retain this friendship? Pls help.</div>

But you gotta judge whether is she ready to hear things from you again.<br><br>because maybe she still feel awdward about your confession to her.

It will be everyone's dream to be with someone they like, but since she's not on the same page, i guess i don't dare to hope too much. Right now I just hope that we'll get back to get friendship like before I confessed to her. It really hurts me whenever I see her around but very difficult to approach her even physically as she'll stay far away from me physically.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ^mR.yellow^86:</div><div class="quote_body">This girl used to be kind of close to me although not very close. I've always have feelings with her ever since we met, she's not chio nor ugly, and my friends will classified me as no-taste whenever they know I keep the feelings for her cuz she's neither chio nor 'got body'. Last time I always offer myself to help her. She appreciated it when I offered help or myself to comfort her when she's alone. I knew she was never on the same page despite my feelings for her. She treats me as buddy only...a reliable buddy and she felt comfortable whenever she's with me(that's what I guess and feel). Sometimes I act cool in front of her to hide my intentions cuz I don't want to lose this friendship. But I felt no point going on like this; she treats me as a reliable fren while I have to hide myself in the dark corner just not to be seen and save this friendship. So one day I decided to confess to her few months ago. As expected, she rejected me. I was half sad half relief as I don't need to hide anymore....but it comes with a pay; she is now scared of me. She seems like will pyshically stay a distance from me. Whenever I'm physically close to her(about 2 meters away) she will go further (more than 10 meters away). She also looks at the direction away from me. I feel sad and hurt whenever she's doing this straight to my face.<br><br>Does anyone here has any suggestion how to win the friendship back/her trust that i'm not into intention? I really helped her without any intentions...but she might missuderstood what I've done now after I confessed to her. I don't mind not having her as my gf as u can't force anyone to like u but I'm really sad as it had affected our friendship. What should I do to retain this friendship? Pls help.</div></blockquote>Your story is almost identical to my during my JC days 3 years ago, there was this girl who I had the hots for 2 years, and somehow we became buddies instead, as i never dared 2 tell her how I feel about her. I confessed to her finally this year that i used to like her only for her to tell me that she never knew I was in love with her(yeah right).<br><br>My advice to u is to just continue to extend ur hand of friendship to her. If she keep on maintaining her distance frm u, misunderstanding ur intentions, then I guess she is just not mature enough to realise that all u want now is to be friends.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>haiz... she is like me lah... personally, i find it hard to remain friends with guys who show that they like me more than a friend, while i only see them as friends. its for a simple reason cos i will feel like i am making use of their feelings for me whenever i rely on them. like i'm not committing anything, yet fearing i am giving false hopes. maybe your gal also the same lah...<br><br>i guess she needs time. and she needs you to show that you really can see her as just a friend, nothing more, no matter what she does (like get physically close, or always relying on your for her problems). more likely than not, she might just be afraid you will like her even more if she stayed the same as previously. show that you will not, and maybe she will understand.</div>
