But the outcome is up to her, cannot force it...sometimes things aren't meant to be.<br><br>It's nice of the poster to still wanna remain friends with the gal. I was in the gal's position a long time ago and the guy treated me as invisible after that....hahaha...so small gas.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </div></blockquote>Yup.. No doubt the card might work better for same.. But I would rather risk the 'paisay' part... And having already do much and really having nothing much left for him now, I don't see what's a little 'embrassment' to place off for a FRIENDSHIP he so much wish to keep..?<br><br>On the note of that... For the other girls which the 'card trick' doesn't work, they might see it as a serious lack of sincerity or might even just land the card into a bin or chunk the card into a deserted corner... The whole thing might not even really cross their mind, as they just get on with their own life...?</div>

I've always have feelings with her ever since we met, she's not chio nor ugly, and my friends will classified me as no-taste whenever they know I keep the feelings for her cuz she's neither chio nor 'got body'. Last time I always offer myself to help her. She appreciated it when I offered help or myself to comfort her when she's alone. I knew she was never on the same page despite my feelings for her. She treats me as buddy only...a reliable buddy and she felt comfortable whenever she's with me(that's what I guess and feel). Sometimes I act cool in front of her to hide my intentions cuz I don't want to lose this friendship. But I felt no point going on like this; she treats me as a reliable fren while I have to hide myself in the dark corner just not to be seen and save this friendship. So one day I decided to confess to her few months ago. As expected, she rejected me. I was half sad half relief as I don't need to hide anymore....but it comes with a pay; she is now scared of me. She seems like will pyshically stay a distance from me. Whenever I'm physically close to her(about 2 meters away) she will go further (more than 10 meters away). She also looks at the direction away from me. I feel sad and hurt whenever she's doing this straight to my face.<br><br>Does anyone here has any suggestion how to win the friendship back/her trust that i'm not into intention? I really helped her without any intentions...but she might missuderstood what I've done now after I confessed to her. I don't mind not having her as my gf as u can't force anyone to like u but I'm really sad as it had affected our friendship. What should I do to retain this friendship? Pls help.</div></blockquote>alamak, u burst the bubble how u expect the bubble to build back. "Xian zhong qiu sheng zai hu yi ge sheng zi, xian er shu jiu hao bie mao xian", means when obtaining a win through risk, if u risk and lose its better not to risk. if there is an element of risk, unless u sure its gonna win then dun risk but if u know u gonna win then its not risk. in simpler terms, if there is risk, wait until there is no risk.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
