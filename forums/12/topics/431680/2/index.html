              <p>It depends on the FSC. They mostly charge on a sliding scale, i.e. if your income is higher, you pay a little more. But usually not more than $30-50 per session. Check out the website of your nearest FSC.</p>

              <p>It depends.....it depends on the severity of the problem......</p>
              <p>Also it can be combined.....the TS can go to a psychiatrist for medication....and then talk to a psychologist or counsellor for the advices part.....</p>
              <p>The main thing of going to psychiatrist is......the ability to get medication.....which does help.....</p>
              <p>For example lets say you cannot sleep......you can go talk to someone for advices and lessen your burden....which is true, it is indeed helpful....but if you go to doctor he can give you sleeping pills which forces your body to sleep and enable your body to function normally (sleep)..........it is the same with mental health......you can talk to a psychologist or counsellor.....but the medication can help in that it stabilizes your mental condition physically....</p>

              <p>Dont visit doctors. Take my word for it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Psychiatrists are a waste of time. They only know how to talk cock, make wild guesses, and prescribe medicine. You be better off talking to a wall.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You know why?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because ... whats the point? You can have 1,000,000 sessions with a therapist and still feel miserable to death. The fundamental issue that you have STILL REMAINS. Talking to the therapist or taking medication does not resolve anything at all. What the therapist gives is NOT practical help !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You will only be happy if your problems get resolved !! And it is up to you to find a solution for your problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You only visit therapists when you done something wrong and need a medical report to prove that you did it in a fit of insanity. Other than that, they are practially USELESS, except to leech you out of your money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The best advice is:</p>
              <p>Try confiding in the person that is the closest to you. That you feel the most comfortable witth. Your girl/boyfriend. Your best friend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because this person not just can offer you comfort and advice, but you have a shoulder to lean on to cry and you can have a nice warm hug.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All these dont cost money and they definitely work better than any therapist session or medicine you can receive.</p>
              <p> </p>
