Asian parents normally like that one lah, they wun say thanks to their kids or apologise to them. Likewise, have we kids really say thank you to our parents often  except only when they give us money and most of them think it is their obligation to give  us  money. So if i t just a small m atter of plates then let it go,  afterall its y our father who has provided for you, not  any other stranger.</div>

This is neither your fault nor his fault.. is jus a <strong>MISCOMMUNICATION</strong> between you and your dad...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Your parents are old and aging.. I don't see any wrong with you helping him to wash his plates.. since you said you are about to finish washing.. but HAVent right?? Moreover they brought you up all these years.. And it has been hard for them too..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You are rather sensible as you know by doing some chores and helping out at home.. can reduce your mother workload.. As a daughter.. I don't see you need to make a big fuss about such thing.. Washing one more plate doesn't make any difference...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Last time you depend so much on them.. Now is time for them to depend on you.. If you are holding your principle that strong.. that everyone must wash their plates when their done.. If your parents are old and weak.. one day while you about to finish washing.. your dad chuck his plates to you again.. are you still goin to grumble at him saying he should wash this himself?? NO! everyone in the family do contribute alittle to this house..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Your mum is now stuck between you and your dad..

"SHOU PI SHI ROU SHOU XIN YE SHI ROU".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>As a daughter, try to be more considerate.. No matter what they are still your parents.. If you are really so unhappy about such things.. Talk to them nicely.. Sit down and chat with them... Don't talk to them like as if you so "buay song" with them.. Respect them!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Treasure them.. Once they are gone.. you regret for being so unreasonable in the future...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Try to communicate with them more often if possible.. all these small little problems can be avoided.. If you dun feel that irritated by the doings of your dad.. will this matter arise?? No right? SOmetimes when you are angry about your parents.. think twice first.. Issit really a must to get angry over such things.. Issit really that important?? They know you are big enough to take care of yourself.. And of cos.. Slowly it will be you to take care of the home and everything..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
