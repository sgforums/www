I guess nothing i say will make you wake up from your foolishness. You are still young, you will meet thousands of girls in the years to come...<br><br>Do you think she'll give a damm when you fail your Os??? NO! She'll probably look down on you and think that you are such a failure!<br><br>If you really love her, study hard! Do well for your O's, maybe then will you earn some attention from her. If your love is really undying(quite impossible), study extremely hard and earn lots of money next time. If she doesn't want you, I can bet that many girls will want you.<br><br></div></blockquote>XiaoJune, your point of June is correct to some extent, this is actually the case for majority of the girls in society nowadays, without bread, how can u have love, rite? Go towards the 5 Cs first and u will definitely be blessed with a gd life.<br>But remember there's always an exception loh, being too materialistic is also not a wise choice, but juz make sure u complete ur studies with at least an O and mayb u can take some more upgrading course while u r working if u really dun have interest in studying anymore...<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>
