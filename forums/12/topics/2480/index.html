            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Guys... This is the first/2nd day i'm here ... and i would like to share with you all some of my problems.<br><br>A normal day for me would be, right after school, after a bathe and everything after i reach home, I would IRC/ICQ until at night ... irc and icq because i'm waiting for someone i love to be online, and while waiting, i usually would play a MUD called Dawn Of Time. But the most important things are ... I can't Get myself to Study ! No matter how hard i try ... i can't concentrate on my homework or studies ... haI~ And These days ... i'm trying to resolve some problems with the girl i like ... and it's like i'm totally buzzed out to study ... i might be giving excuses but i never did study before in my life. ..<br><br>That's the reason why i dropped from sec 2 express to sec 3 normal.<br><br>Please tell me what i can do ... thank you all in advance ...<br>and btw .. you can email me @ Aaron84z@hotmail.com or ICQ me at 13535415 .. or even find me at IRC as AaroN^_^ .<br><br>Please THink about this and give me a reply, in icq or email, if it's not possible for you to reply here ...<br><br>*Self Intro*<br>I am a 16/m from hongkah secondary school.<br>CCA ( Head of Chess ) ( SPL (Head) of Scouts )<br><br>------------------<br>Love is Full Of Difficulties and problems ... even if you like her, she might not like you and vice versa ... and even if you 2 like each other ... there are always problems ...

            <div class='col-md body'>Head of chess and even a scout....... well maybe u can try to be more actively involve in other things rather then to face the computer the whole day.<br><br>I know the addiction of what icq n esp IRC can do, but i also know very well that in the end, other than wasting a lot of time, u will achieve nothing playing IRC, that's one of the reason why i seldom play.<br><br>Anyway, guess its pretty easy for guys like yr age to be heavily engagged in irc n have crushes over some 'gers' in the channel. But then, how possible do you think that things might work out.<br><br>Again, other than yrself, no1 can help you....... maybe u can get out of yr house 2 do some reading else where so that here will be no computer ard to distract you.<br><br>Guess u r having Ns this yr and u should noe pretty well that without passing yr Ns, u can forget abt yr Os. U have already waste 1 yr, from express to normal, so u shouldn't waste another.<br><br>I believe u r a sensible guy, from some of the replies u gave actually can tell. So pls think, which is more important. And again, virtual love or love through IRC dun usually last........ so pls, get a life.......<br><br>Regards</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wow...waited 6 months for a girl, everyday frm afternoon till night!!! Guess I really admire u for yr patience. You dun have any other means of contacting her? Like through the phone? Then won't have to wait for her on IRC everyday.<br><br>For me, think have the same situation...hehe<br>Also waiting for a girl on IRC, but not frm afternoon till night, juz 1 hr every nite, guess not too bad. Unlike U who hav waited 6 months for her, I waited 3 weeks already cannot Tahan... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Heard that its because her PC is spoilt, so guess have to wait till her PC is repaired b4 I can meet her again, but dunno when that day will be. Think she's not that cruel to make me wait that long. Too bad I dun have her other contact number other than her ICQ. Hope she can receive the message I sent her through ICQ. REally miss her a lot.<br><br>Think for u after waiting for 6 months, chances are quite slim...but anyway still wish u the best. Hope She'll not be so cruel to make u wait any longer. But again, not to forget, though u're addicted to much things, some things r certainly more imptortant than others.</div>

She'll probably look down on you and think that you are such a failure!<br><br>If you really love her, study hard! Do well for your O's, maybe then will you earn some attention from her. If your love is really undying(quite impossible), study extremely hard and earn lots of money next time.
