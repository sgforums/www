              <p>Remain where you are, even if you go out you will have to get stuck in IT sector unless you want to be Bus/Taxi Drivers or something which you can pick up the skills along the way.</p>
              <p>Since you have supportive colleagues, it is a very good thing already. Most others now are trying to prevent themselves from being backstabbed by their colleagues, as they fight for survival in their jobs.</p>
              <p>If you can, take a long leave and rest for now, you sound like you could use a good break.</p>

              <p>Hi new_b,</p>
              <p>Since you have no idea about which career you want to switch over to, it will be better for you to remain in the IT sector, since this is your field of expertise. </p>
              <p>However, instead of randomly entering another area in IT, you may wish to have a look at the IT positions available from the newspaper as well as the internet, and choose one which actually interests you.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
