Before anyone jumps the gun, I must stress I'm not for the idea of doing so simply for the challenge of it, but rather only doing so if I genuinely believe she's the one for me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>That said, it is highly unlikely I will ever try this on a total stranger simply because there is a host of issues to consider(ie.character, compatibility, etc) and looks alone will not tempt me to attempt hitting on someone(whether attached or not). In essence, in all probability, I'd probably have to get to know her well enough as a friend for me to do that if I decided she's the right one.<br><br>I mean, if she possessed most of the qualities that I'd like in my partner(in other words, women with her quality would be few and far between), then obviously, I wouldn't hesitate courting her as I see no reason to stay away from something which I could regret later on - afterall, I only live once and I can't afford to give that many opportunities a miss!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Of course, I'd be more than willing to accept and respect her decision whatever happens...<br><br>Personally, I don't know where those people who buy the "what goes around comes around" logic are coming from - I mean, for me, you've obviously got to be able to offer her something better than she could have in her current relationship to convince her that she'd be better off with you than her current flame. And if she was genuinely convinced of having a brighter and more secure future with me and that I could better satisfy her needs than her current squeeze, isn't it only logical that she'd find it sensible that she'd be better off with me? Afterall, everything in life and love's a fair game and a gamble to some extent - even marriages are not guaranteed to last a lifetime. So why should anyone hold back from pursuing someone who is potentially his/her soulmate solely on the basis of "what goes around comes around"?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>oh I dun feel that one should hold back because of "what goes around comes around" However, I do feel that its fairly pathetic to covet that of others.<br><br>Of course, if u put yourself into the other person's shoes, how would u feel if someone came along and snatched your gf/bf?<br><br>Do people have to be so despicable?</div>

As I'd mentioned earlier, if she didn't share my views as to a common future and decided to stick with her current beau, that too is still a decision I could live with.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>All said and done, if we got together under the abovementioned circumstances, then I certainly don't see how this "what goes around comes around" notion should even hold or why I should worry about someone "snatching" her from me later on(at the end of the day, even relationship commitments are a gamble in every sense of the word and even if no one snatched her away from me, there's no guarantee our relationship will not sour for other reasons later on) - and before anyone jumps the gun, I'm not saying this(someone snatching her from me) can't happen, but it's just not something I'd give much thought to when I decide whether to make a move for someone who is attached.<br><br>I mean "putting yourself into the other person's shoes" is hardly a sensible analogy that could be applied exhaustively to everything in life(certainly not in this case IMO) - afterall, half the world survive on under USD2 per day. Will you then find it reasonable to survive on that kind of pittance if you were living in a cosmopolitan city of the developed world?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
