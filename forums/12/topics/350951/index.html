              <p><br>Since your friend have a habit of copying you, this means you are leading the way and at the front of the industry (Whichever products you are marketing at the present).</p>
              <p>You can always spend more time to improve your own business to be more efficient.</p>
              <p>Since it is online-based, then there's almost no copyright nor intellectual-property protection for your business. And it is legal for your friend to copy your website.</p>
              <p>Remember, the business can be exactly the same...but no businessman/woman are the same.</p>
              <p>The difference in the business performance will reveal in time because the business-owners are of different breed and abilities.</p>
              <p>No need to feel bad about it, you should be proud that people are looking up to you.</p>
              <p>But don't be arrogant okie? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> </p>

              <p>There infact many online shops selling almost the same thing from china and mostly the imported clothing sizes are pretty very small and with not so good quality. If your friend can copy your design and style or everything in your webby, so can others who visited your site. Just by this you know that friend cannot be trusted. In life, you can only trust yourself. Even the best of friends can betray you just for things they are pursuing - pursuing the same interest as you. So in future, make sure that you do not share your information with anyone of where you order or purchase from or even the cost of your items and even teach them how you start up your website. They should learn their way up and there is no short-cut to it! Tell them nicely that you got somone to do for you &amp; not yourself and the items are from your friend.</p>
              <p>Now the only thing you can do is to carryon with your website, perhaps change your layout alittle, the pricing alittle cheaper than them to beat them! Or look for dropshipper to dropship your items for you without cost, at least a different range of items from your existing ones. Use one of the dropshipper I knoe is Axxfactor.com dropship for reseller. you can start if off with them and include more items as time goes by.</p>
              <p>Last but not least, don't be depressed as they are not worth your time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Best wishes!</p>
