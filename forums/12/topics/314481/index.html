              <p>Hi people. I don't know if this is the right forum for me but since it's kind of an agony to me, I was thinking, why not?</p>
              <p>Basically, I'm 18 this year and a guy. This problem has been bugging me for sometime since about I was 16. Kinda long to rectify a problem huh?</p>
              <p>Okay, I'll cut straight to the point. I think I have a medical condition known as Phimosis. For those who do not know what it is, it's the inability to pull the foreskin all the way back to the end of the dickhead. I used to think this is normal, but until I read more in depth about it then I realise its a problem and that at least 10% of guys suffer from it. Further more, if left alone, it may result in complications in future.</p>
              <p>Which is why I'm deciding on a circumcision. I know that the foreskin itself has the most nerves in the human body and should it be removed, sex won't be as enjoyable as before. But I do not want to risk having the skin tearing during intercourse or damaging it in any manner at all. I don't mind the lost of sensation but I only fear the pain.</p>
              <p>It's like now my head is extremely sensitive and touching it is like mad. I can wash it but only what ever portion I reveal. Using the showerhead to wash it hurts like hell so I can only just let water slowly rinse downwards to it.</p>
              <p>Anyone with a rough idea? Cause I heard circumcision has a hell load of aftermath to endure.</p>

              <p>Most of the time it's not an issue and you'll lead a rather normal life, in fact some doctors have suggested it's not really a condition at all and simply a generic trait like how some people don't have earlobes.</p>

              <p>Hi bro,</p>
              <p>(I believe you can work out the math...but just in case you can't...)</p>
              <p>If you are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">postively </span>diagnosed with it, then do go for the procedure. The pain will eventually go away and you will be healthier.</p>
              <p>As for sex, foreskin is just a minute fraction of satisfaction derived in the entire acitivity/experience. There are so many other nerve endings, style, karma sultra, positions, mental stimulations, attitude, and whatever physical, mental and spiritual conditions that affect the end result.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I encourage him to cut now.</p>
              <p>I had an infection during NS and it hurts like hell. I thought my best buddy is going to leave me! Was like freaking scared during that period man.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TS, do it now! Or... you can wait till NS then cut... SAF will subsidise the operations.</p>

              <p>Hello friend,</p>
              <p>Firstly, i think it's really brave of you to post such a "private" issue. Good on you mate!</p>
              <p>Next, if it has been bothering you for two years now, I think it is really time for you to see a doctor about it and get it circumcised. It will hurt momentarily, and will eventually ease out around 3 weeks. Or would you rather it to hurt even more if you were to just leave it as it is? I doubt so right. So yeah!</p>
              <p>And man... you are 18! Be brave my friend!</p>
              <p>As I said, it is a painfull procedure, but in all, worth it.</p>

              <p><br>You only started wanking when you were 15? LOL. That's late.</p>
              <p>ANYWAYS. I think you should go for circumcision. After it, your problem will be solved forever(: Isn't that what you want? Unless you want the problem to remain. Just go for it.. I think you'll be much happier after the procedure.</p>

              no need to cut, many with tight foreskin don't realise that it can be retracted with a little bit of help, use plenty of lubricant and each time you pull a little more, add more lube until the damn thing exposes, it may take a little bit of work but it can be done...
              
              had an army mate who went to kelantan clinic thinking he got some disease because of the 'cheese'....lol...the male doc saw the dick and in one sec, retracted the skin and commented, 'you never wash there ar'...lol....this mate was embarrassed but very elated to see the head for the first time in his life...lol...can be done, no need to potong.....

              <p><br>Thanks everyone for the valuable input!!</p>
              <p>I realised that I can pull back when flaccid, but it's very dry and very sensitive. I heard of this condition which is called paraphimosis, where by the skin is pulled back but cannot be pushed back again. That calls for a medical emergency.</p>
              <p>I tried to pull all the way back when flaccid but about 3/4 of the way, I chickened out because I was afraid I won't be able to pull back.</p>
              <p>And where can I get lube?</p>

              <p>dude .. you don't need lube ... you just need courage ......</p>
              <p>i suffered from the same thing when I was young too .... foreskin was stuck to the head and couldn't be pulled back ....</p>
              <p>all you need ... is a bit of balls to endure a little bit of pain .....</p>
