              <h2>Patient-Friendly Alternatives to Circumcision</h2>
              <p class="author"><a href="http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/norm_uk_who.html#409"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Dr Peter Ball</span></a> MB,B Chir</p>
              <p class="update">Last updated on 13th April 2008</p>
              <p>The vast majority of tight foreskins can be suitably loosened within a month or so by persistant stretching twice daily. <br>When possible start by warming the penis. Use baby oil, Vaseline intensive care hand and body lotion, Nivea or any bland cream as a lubricant. Pull the foreskin forward away from the body several times then pull it back as far as it will go and hold it in this stretched position for several minutes.Do this several times a day. When the glans ( head of the penis} becomes visible, grip it between thumb and fingers and roll the foreskin forward over the glans until the tight ring is white with stretching. Hold it in this position as long as you can at a time - say 5 minutes. Repeat as often as you have the time and enthusiasm for. Later you will find there is room for two or more fingers to insert into the tight ring to stretch it further. <br><br>It may become apparent that further retraction of the foreskin is held up by a short frenulum ( the tongue of skin in the mid-line underneath the glans) This is called a Frenulum Breve and can be cured by a small operation under a local anaesthetic called a frenuloplasty. <br><br>Take care to avoid trapping the foreskin behind the glans (Paraphimosis) when it becomes loose enough to happen but tight enough to be difficult to bring forward again. Seek medical advice early if you fail to return the foreskin to cover the glans. <br><br>If you are unable to see the glans or make any headway stretching , consider buying a glansie (www.glansie.com) to bring the foreskin to the stage when the above methods can apply. <br>Attempt to retract your foreskin every time you pass water. <br><br><br><a name="464"></a></p>
              <p>NORM-UK estimates that at least 9 out of 10 patients undergoing circumcision in British hospitals do not need to be there <a class="superscript" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#466"><span style="color: #0000ff;">1</span></a> <a class="superscript" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#467"><span style="color: #0000ff;">2</span></a>. Conservative, non-surgical treatments for common foreskin problems are much easier, cheaper and far less likely to cause long-term harm to the patient <a class="superscript" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#635"><span style="color: #0000ff;">3</span></a>. Unfortunately many doctors are unaware of these. Others are uninterested in preserving the patient's foreskin for religious, personal or even financial reasons.</p>
              <p class="blockquote">It is important that doctors keep up to date and ensure that any decisions to undertake an invasive procedure are based on the best available evidence. Therefore, to circumcise for therapeutic reasons where medical research has shown other techniques to be at least as effective and less invasive would be unethical and inappropriate. [<a href="http://www.bma.org.uk/ap.nsf/Content/malecircumcision2003"><span style="color: #0000ff;">The law &amp; ethics of male circumcision - Guidance for Doctors</span></a>, BMA, March 2003]</p>
              <p><a name="217"></a></p>
              <h3>Development</h3>
              <p>The foreskin and the glans develop as one structure. Natural separation of the two structures occurs gradually during childhood. The age at which the foreskin becomes retractable differs for each child. It may take until the age of 17 or beyond. This is normal. Forcing the foreskin to retract may cause pain, bleeding, scarring, infection, and adhesions. Therefore, the foreskin of a child should be retracted only by the child himself when he is ready to do so.<a name="589"></a></p>
              <h3>Steroid creams</h3>
              <p>Steroid creams should be used next if no significant progress has been made after a month. The cream you need is called Betamethasone 0.05% sold in 30 G tubes. It is sold in the UK as Diprosone. It is a prescription-only medicine which means you will have to ask your doctor for a prescription. The cream should be massaged into the tight part of the foreskin inside and outside 2-3 times a day for at least a month combined with further stretching. As the foreskin widens it may become apparent that the frenulum is restricting retraction. This can be remedied by a small operation called a frenuloplasty performed under a local anaesthetic.<a name="588"></a></p>
              <h3>Preputioplasty (Dorsal Relieving Incision)</h3>
              <p>A preputioplasty should be able to cure any tight foreskin where stretching and steroid cream application have failed. This is an operation in which a cut is made through the tight ring that is limiting foreskin retraction, in an up and down direction and then sewn up in an across direction. Once this has healed (2-3 weeks) the foreskin can usually be retracted fully and the only change in appearance is a notch that becomes visible in the skin as it is retracted. Make sure that you agree with your surgeon how far you will allow him to cut through the foreskin.</p>
              <p></p>
              <h3>Short frenulum</h3>
              <p>A short frenulum may be the cause of a foreskin not retracting behind the glans, or pulling the glans downwards as soon as retraction begins. If stretching the frenulum fails, as it usually does, it can be freed by a minor operation called a Frenuloplasty. This can usually be performed under a local anaesthetic.<a name="220"></a></p>
              <h3>Ballooning of the Foreskin</h3>
              <p>Ballooning of the foreskin while urinating can be a normal phase of development during childhood. It is <strong>not</strong> an indication for circumcision. Ballooning is a temporary phenomenon that arises when the foreskin begins to separate from the glans. It speeds the process of separation and disappears when the process is complete.<a name="218"></a></p>
              <h3>Phimosis</h3>
              <p>Phimosis is a name given to the condition where the foreskin is unretractable. We must distinguish normal (physiological) unretractability from abnormal (pathological) unretractability. Physiological unretractability of the foreskin is found in nearly all new-born infants, and becomes increasingly uncommon with advancing age. It is not an indication for circumcision. <br><br>Pathological phimosis is scarring and obstruction of the opening of the foreskin. This is rare and may be found in diabetes, and in a localised skin condition called lichen sclerosus which is often referred to as "balanitis xerotica <br>obliterans" (BXO) when it affects the penis. In this condition the skin is thickened, white, and hard. Circumcision is a treatment option for lichen sclerosus of the foreskin when it is refractory (unresponsive) to conservative treatment. Circumcision will not however cure or prevent outbreaks of lichen slerosus elsewhere on the penis.<a name="465"></a></p>
              <p>The medical literature contains many reports showing that most cases of phimosis can be treated effectively by topical steroid applications or by conservative surgery.</p>
              <p class="blockquote">"True" phimosis --- better termed "preputial stenosis," because "phimosis" has so many different definitions it now is devoid of any useful meaning --- occurs in less than 2% of intact males.</p>
              <p class="blockquote">Of these 2%, 85-95% will respond to topical steroids. Of those who fail this, at least 75% will respond to stretching under local anesthesia, either manually or with a balloon. The arithmetic is simple: At the very most 7 boys in 10,000 may need surgery for preputial stenosis. No wonder the Canadian Paediatric Society calls circumcision an "obsolete" procedure!

              Damn, you sure have a medical name for every identification....now I start to worry if you are just being neurotic or what!!!! If you can get it back but feels dry...you can spit on it or get Olive oil (non cooking; from pharmacy) to oil it abit. Good for the skin as well.
              
              Just dun use Singer oil, WD-40 or è™Žæ¨™ä¸‡ç²¾æ²¹!!

              <p><br>Anyway, I don't think TS has Phimosis. The condition that TS is experiencing is probably due to fungus or other bacterial buildup around under the foreskin which led TS to believe it might be Phimosis. This is probably a bad case caused by neglection of personal hygiene.</p>
              <p>To remedy it, it is advisable to pull back foreskin gently under warm water in erected condition. Wash thoroughly with gentle soap (no dettol pls) and remember to wash foreskin thoroughly everyday, especially after intercourse or simulated intercourse. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p>

              <p>I realised that I can pull back when flaccid, but it's very dry and very sensitive. I heard of this condition which is called paraphimosis, where by the skin is pulled back but cannot be pushed back again. That calls for a medical emergency.</p>
              <p>I tried to pull all the way back when flaccid but about 3/4 of the way, I chickened out because I was afraid I won't be able to pull back.</p>
              <p>And where can I get lube?</p>

              <p>dun think so, i also sort of have this condition</p>
              <p>let me share my exp with TS.</p>
              <p>starting out, my foreskin was so tight that it cannot be stretched even when flaccid. but day by day i slowly tried to stretch it and now it can be stretched back to reveal the whole dickhead. and when i try to clean it, it feels very very tender to touch and a bit pain. i think its like that, because it stayed under covers for so long. just keep touching it to let it get used to touching :D</p>
              <p>but now the problem is although i can stretch it quite abit when flaccid, i cannot stretch is much when erect. but i think if i continue stretching one day it will be able to stretch. ya so keep practicing.<br>as for sex and intercourse, pls do not worry about it much. because, when u think abt it, most of the time you have sex you will use a condom. then the condom covers your whole dick, dun have to worry abt foreskin retract a not right? coz its safely under the condom.</p>
              <p>as for unprotected sex, well, all i can say is, if the girl is lubricated enough, there is no problem. :P</p>

              <p>I don't have a foreskin and I enjoy sex very much. If your foreskin is causing you problems you should not hesitate to have it removed. The loss of sensitivity if any will be very mild. If nothing else your partner probably won't mind if it takes you a few minutes longer to <em>pop your cork. </em></p>

              <p>Hi people. I don't know if this is the right forum for me but since it's kind of an agony to me, I was thinking, why not?</p>
              <p>Basically, I'm 18 this year and a guy. This problem has been bugging me for sometime since about I was 16. Kinda long to rectify a problem huh?</p>
              <p>Okay, I'll cut straight to the point. I think I have a medical condition known as Phimosis. For those who do not know what it is, it's the inability to pull the foreskin all the way back to the end of the dickhead. I used to think this is normal, but until I read more in depth about it then I realise its a problem and that at least 10% of guys suffer from it. Further more, if left alone, it may result in complications in future.</p>
              <p>Which is why I'm deciding on a circumcision. I know that the foreskin itself has the most nerves in the human body and should it be removed, sex won't be as enjoyable as before. But I do not want to risk having the skin tearing during intercourse or damaging it in any manner at all. I don't mind the lost of sensation but I only fear the pain.</p>
              <p>It's like now my head is extremely sensitive and touching it is like mad. I can wash it but only what ever portion I reveal. Using the showerhead to wash it hurts like hell so I can only just let water slowly rinse downwards to it.</p>
              <p>Anyone with a rough idea? Cause I heard circumcision has a hell load of aftermath to endure.</p>
