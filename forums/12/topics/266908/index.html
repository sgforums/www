But ask yourself this, what SHOULD You do? Continue to whine in ur misery? Or just buck up, and look ahead?<br><br>If I were u, I would go and focus on one thing I am weak at, such as my studies. Tell myself that I won't let other things get to me. Then Go back to ur textbook and read 1 paragraph of any chapter u want. After that paragraph, test urself what u understand from that chapter. Then look back at the textbook to compare to see if what u understand tallies with what is stated in the textbook. This will help to build up self-confidence, and subsequently, u will feel happier.</div>
