Let me show you my way. Since that 2nd girl you mentioned has make known her feelings towards you, and if you feel that she's still not bad, y not just accept her? Waiting for the girl you really like is a disadvantage to you, y waste your previous time ?NEVER waste time on people that's not worthy. Furthermore she has her bf, u only stand to lose( I mean emotionally). She doesnt even know( or care) how u r feeling now. By accepting the 2nd girl, u've not done anything wrong. U dont need to answer anything to the 1st girl(since she has bf). The 2nd one might truly care for u &amp; treat you better.<br>As for the girl you like( 1st one la), still keep in touch, pretend nth has happened, dont rush give her time to decide. When the relationship between them gets bored or if they quarrel, these are times u seize the chances and earn points on the girl. And not forcing her to make up her mind. If one day u find that she's not the real person u like, or she's not gd enough for u at least u have that 2nd girl that really cared for u in the 1st place. Why sit there and wait?</div>

U r not doing anything wrong. U do not need to let B know anythingabout A, and u dont have to answer anything to her. Since she(B) has bf, she can chose as she like[ as u mention, ball is in her court], y cant u? She has no right to accuse u[ if one day] becoz of her own actions. all this i've said is to your own advantage[ if someone has bf, yr "LUCK" is 50%, how long they go on u wouldn't know], advice can only be this much, choice is yours, what u ultimately do really depends on yrself k.. think carefully</div>
