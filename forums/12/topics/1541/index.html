At least it applies to you, anyway, I prefer to sms as u can see my problem posed here, mayb it's bcos of these that I got rejected.  If u ask me to talk to her thru the phone abt this, I really lack the courage, but thru sms, I dare, that's the real reason why I like sms...<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree wif kofguy on not being accepted by the girl.. Just tell urself this.. if u never ask, will u ever be satisfied?? if u never ask will u happy just by watching her in the distance?? I'm sure all of us want something closer than just a casual fren... Toking face to face can show her in her face, ur sincerity and ur 'goodness' to her. Giving her the 'I-really-care-for-u' look.<br><br>Worrying abt the aftermath will only make u get confuse... Dun tell me u r not worthy of her?? Or u r not sincere in ur words to her?? Wif some positive thinking and confidence, it will make her feel safe to be wif you...<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)<br>~.~.~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, you can't be sure that after she agreeds to be your gf you will be happy ever after right? So its also unpredictable. The hurt from failed relationship should be more than the embarassment of being rejected.
