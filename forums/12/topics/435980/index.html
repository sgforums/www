Never have a gf before.<br><br>Got a selfish mother who only think about herself. Since young, its my father who support me. Mother don't want to support me. Everyday she just want to save more and more money for herself.<br><br>My salary only enough to support myself. No girls want to marry a poor guy like me.<br><br>Always at home by myself watching tv and movies, surfing net. Don't know why I am working for what.<br><br>When I think about how I may work so hard and save so much money only to give to my selfish mother in the end its really pointless. Or maybe I will give it to my father if I die before him, but I am actually not close to both of my parents so find it quite meaningless to give my money to my father too since he will share the money with my stepmum and I got no sibilings or wife to give my money to in future.<br><br>Anyone here experience the same situation as me?</div></div>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you even know what homestaying is? A homestay is you go stay with a family overseas and try to experience their way of life. You eat what they eat, you work what they work, you play what they play.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are quite a plenty of homestay portals online, go look at them, google them up !! You can find plenty of hospitable families to stay with.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or, if you dun like the idea of homestay, you can always join a tour group or go backpacking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are so many things you can do to spice up your life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But all you choose is to be cooped up there in your little corner and WHINE &amp; COMPLAIN.</p>

              <p>Yeah agreed. Your situation doesn't sound ideal, but it's up to you to do something about it and change it for yourself.</p>
              <p>If support from your parents isn't there, then try and build a good relationship with friends or others. Instead of staying at home and watching the box all the time, try and go out and join some clubs/social groups to do things u like to do. This doesn't have to costs much money at all.</p>

              <p>1. Change jobs. The effort of looking, and new environment means there is some change in your life. Money not so important here- as long as not worse.</p>

              <p>2. Working visa- I think you are under 30, yes?  Then you have a great opportunity. Most Western countries like Canada, Australia, UK, allow you to travel and work. You will meet many friendly ppl in same situation, make friends. And you will get away from parents and SG and see how small SG is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3. Don't rely on SGforums for friends to help you. Most people dont have your expereince, so won't understand/empathsise, and you'll get replies that wont help you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4. One of the above repliers was right about one thing- getting a girlfriend is not hard- but getting one you want is- which usually means getting a slim pretty girl, right?  If you can- try to lower your expectations about her physical aspects. I dont mean you have to go all Lydia Lum, but sorry, Denise Keller and Fiona Xie are out of yuor (our!) league.</p>
