Comprehension and Composition.<br><br>Try writing one composition per week and ask your English teacher to mark it. Then have a debrief session with her, ask her to show you where you've committed your mistakes. If possible, ask her to suggest how can you improve in the future. Whether it require improvement in the content, grammar, vocab or other parts.<br><br>For Comprehension, these 2 parts. The comprehension and summery. Buy comprehension assessment book and do. Always read the passage twice before attempting the questions. As what the word '<span style="font-style: italic;">comprehension</span>' means, it's testing your ability to comprehend. You must understand what the passage is saying about before you can try the question.<br><br>While for the summery part, it's also a skill that you must learn. There is a way of writing summery. Always find the keypoints(usually 15 point), these 15 points will give you the content marks. The rest are vocab and grammar.<br><br>My teacher told me that once you've identify the 15 key points, then re-write these point '<span style="font-style: italic;">In your own word</span>'. Here it's where your vocab is tested.<br><br></div>
