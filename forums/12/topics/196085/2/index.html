            <div class='col-md body'>i think its a build up. and if the resentment is already built up in you, very difficult to move on ba. Its like what they say, if you like someone, the person pour soup over you also never mind. But if you dont like someone, the way the person hold the spoon u also cannot stand.<br><br>If what happened to you happened to me (as an isolated incident) honestly I dont know.. err.. why u are angry leh? My mum is always like this one, drag time drag time, I just relack one corner watch tv or watever loh.... until she ready to go. Not like I always spend time with her or what.<br><br>But if it is becos of previous related incidents, then well, it will be very difficult to solve the problem ba.. becos every small incident that recur again, you will have a strong emotional reaction to it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In most cases, parents think they know their children at the back of the hand however forgotten the fact that they have already grown up and have their own set of thinking. There is nothing wrong of parents giving advise on what courses to take, since they are already engaged in the workforce they may be more aware of the work situation than ourselves(the children).<br><br>The breakdown in communication between you and your parents (especially your mum) may be due to inability to understand one another. Your mom may be using situational explanation to explain what she does while you may see her action as a dispositional factor(her personality).

In others' minds, they might sometimes be otherwise deemed as excuses... Worse still when they do have even know of those 'reasons'.... Many times we just PRESUME that the other party SHOULD know our reason(s) for doing things.. That's when COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN comes about on a primary basis....<br><br>And on the other part where the forumite has suggested that when you've already engaged a biased view of someone for quite a while, you would tend to have distorted perception of things...<br><br>'Reasons' labelled for her actions and often but just your perceptions and presumptions of things...<br><br>Sorry to be blunt, but take examples?<br><br>"she repeatedly raised her voice and screamed at me when i refused to talk to her and she acted like a kid, stomping her foot on the floor and whimpering."<br><br>- because you refused and ignored her (maybe more than that in her eyes)?<br><br>"kept hammering on the door, threatening to break down my room and call my PC."<br><br>- because you ignored her and locked the door?<br><br>At this point, you've got 2 separate options...<br><br>1. To choose to go through and think about what I've told you, and maybe even attempt to better the situation next time..<br><br>2. Be stubborn about it and dismiss whatever I've said.<br><br>It's really your choice and your call...? Because it's YOUR LIFE...?<br><br>But... Before you start to complain about things again next time... THINK THROUGH CAREFULLY... Why are those things happening to me..?<br><br>Is it really LUCK? Is it really because people all over me are really f*cked up..? Or is it because...?<br><br>And even if situation or people are not that fantastic, can you do something to change things for the better...?<br><br>Don't always think in terms of what's your loss and what you SHOULD be gaining... Because if everybody just thinks about themselves... You'll probably be ZERO down to almost nothing at the end of the day <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br></div></blockquote>you have patience.
