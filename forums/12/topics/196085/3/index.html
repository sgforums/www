So what is there left?<br><br>The only thing that is within YOUR control to change is your own behaviour and how that can improve your relationship with your mum. Telling you your mum is a bitch is not going to help - but sharing that perhaps since your mum is obviously not able to control herself or her temper, you should take the initiative to be the one to start being pleasant even when it is difficult to. When your mum sees that you are trying so hard to accommodate her BECAUSE you love her and care for her, things can change. How determined are you to keep things pleasant even when she does something that hurt you? That will be how things are going to change.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When she screamed, you scream and because of her ego as a mother, she screamed louder. So ya, you should just walk away when she scream. Is true that mother should show respect to her children too and so do the children. But the most important part you had missed out is why is she behaving this way? This is important for us to help you to solve the problem. We are not against you, we are here to help you. For your information, not everybody can get along with their parent by natural. I think partially due to generation gap. I do have difficult times too and I have to remind myself whenever I have conflict with my parent not to do or say things I regret later. I am thankful for whatever things they have provide for me. I remember once I said thing that hurt my dad. I am glad that we patch back, I don't want to regret when he is not around.

We can go ahead and say you're right and your mum is wrong. And your mum should change and everything... But how would that help? Your mum probably won't even be here listening to us... For all I know we might even further fuel your hatre towards yuor mum... So much for helping?<br><br>In this given situation, it's not really about who's right and who's wrong... It's really about whether you wish to improve on the situation?<br><br>Put yourself up to the challenge, see if you can IMPROVE on the situation...? Complaining's too easy... Almost everybody can do that....<br><br>End of the day if you think just rantings and complainings would be enough for you... By all means... Nobody's really stopping you.
