            <div class='col-md body'>have been speaking chinese through out my life. Recently, i got to know this<br>group of friends who speak english and i find it really hard to communicate with them. Whenever i open my mouth and talk, i willl find myself stammering, putting myself into shame.<br><br>i've tried overcoming this problem by speaking to the wall and myself everyday, using english but all was to no avail. Being frustrated, i told my father about this and asked if there's anything i could do to rectify this problem. His reply was; my tongue was born like that (Not very good) and all i need to do is to keep practicing and practicing.<br><br>Ok.. I agreed with him and heeded his advice, speaking to myself and the wall once again. ONE month had passed and yeah, i still cant speak proper and fluent english. I will start stammering once I open my mouth. Also, I find it hard to talk and communicate even thought i have 101 answers on what my friends' questions are about.<br><br>I really dont want to spend the rest of my 2 years in poly like that. I want to paticipate in everything and live my life in poly to the fullest, in any ways possible.<br><br>Please Help me. What can i do?<br><br>Sincere replies please and thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To have a better command of the English language, all I can say is: immerse yourself in it. Read more English, think more English, and speak more English.<br><br>Do small changes in your everyday life to help you work on improving your English. Write proper sentences in your SMSes and your MSN messages, for instance. Instead of writing 'Hey, wan 2 go 4 dinner tonite?' in your SMS, type out a proper 'Hey, do you wish to meet for dinner tonight?' instead.<br><br>Otherwise, if writing in SMS lingo becomes second nature to you, then it's hard to write proper English anymore. My tuition student has a very, very bad habit of using SMS lingo in his compositions. I've since warned him to switch to proper sentences in his SMSes, but he resists doing so.<br><br>So for now I'm still heavily penalising him for those mistakes in his compositions. Don't fall into the same trap as he has.</div>

For me I am fluent in both english and chinese even though I stutter sometimes when speaking which ever language. And it's not wrong to answer your frens(provided they understand chinese) in chinese if they ask you something in english.</div>
