            <div class='col-md body'>OKAY. LISTEN UP.<br><br>firstly, you should stop speaking (conversing) in mandarin.<br><br>[you speak mandarin, you don't speak chinese. You write in chinese but you don't write in mandarin.]<br><br>but i don't mean completely. i mean 80% of the time; you should speak english.<br><br>next, stop listening to those stupid chinese songs, which simply triggers unnecessary emotions.<br><br>and stop watching those silly taiwanese vairety shows and dumb chinese shows which ain't gonna improve your english. (their english is simply terrible)<br><br>one of the most IMPORTANT step is to READ more english books.<br><br>and yes, WATCH MORE english news. Go learn about political stuff.<br><br>if possible, look up in the ENGLISH DICTIONARY to discover new words.<br><br>p/s: DO NOT type like this: f.U.c.K eUu cHeEnaa-A*SeS! (together with the 'liao', 'lah', 'le', 'wor' etc, be it in sms-es or writing.<br><br>Not only does it piss people off, it simply shows how f*cked up your english is and how lowly-educated you are.<br><br>Oh. not to mention chinese-oriented fools such as ah bengs/ ah lians' poor standard of english.<br><br>take my advice and you're on your way to enjoying your stay in poly with your ENGLISH-SPEAKING (AKA POTATO, ENGLISH-ORIENTED) poly mates!<br>[NOT CHEE-NA DIMWITS!)<br><br>no sooner and you'll be ozzing with confidence and would be adept in english.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

(Correct me if i'm wrong.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> )<br><br>Watch more English movies. Especially those with English subtitles. Look at the way the artiste speak. Learn from them.<br><br>Lastly, hang out with that group of frens as frequent as possible. Speak to them confidently in English.

However, the native tongue of a person can give clues to the sort of social conditioning he or she has received.

            <div class='col-md body'>I fully understand your situation threadstarter, for me at primary school, i personnely suffer from communciation problems due to the fact that i have short tongue.<br><br>Thankfully, i have great teachers who helped me alot. I will just list down the things that i been trying 2 overcome my short tongue which i have done quite sucessfully<br><br>First - understand the words you are trying to speak. Know how to pronouce them and try to converse slowly. Do not Jump the Gun and rattle your words. Take your time. For example. If your friend were to ask u. Hey do u want to come out for lunch tml? You can always replay. Err, Can you  givee   mee sommeee timeee??? Take your time to articulate your words. Only learning how 2 pronouce these words slowly then u can take the 2nd step by saying it quickly<br><br>Secondly. Try to Read aloud when u are reading english articles esp on newspapers. Try to go at your own pace. As said from bros here, Practice makes perfect. Go at a slower pace, when you are ready, then increase your speed. Your friends will understand you and they will help you perfect the language.<br><br>Thirdly. I will advise you to reduce using chinese to converse. When you are at home, it is always good, if you can speak and use simple senteces by english. For example. Dinner is ready. I go and bathe. Do you all wish to watch tv? I wan to eat oranges. etc etc. It is the small little steps that are vital to your sucess.<br><br>Last but not least. If u believe in god. God will only help those who help themselves. If you are a buddhist. Guan yin hui bao you ni de. Jia You. All the best bro. if u need more info can always pm me. For i am in the same situation as you before.</div>
