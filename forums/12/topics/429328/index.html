              <p>Anything as long as the employer is willing to work out something with you?</p>
              <p>I used to have to go off for appointments regularly too, albeit not as frequently as you need to. My boss allowed me to go for them without having to take leave, because the location was near my workplace (hence going there and back did not take much time), as long as I continued working during lunch hour for that day.</p>
              <p>Though... the dinosaurs in my department weren't pleased with it at all even though I stuck within the time I was given.</p>

              <p>than perhaps you can ask the doctor based on your condition, what kind of jobs are suitable for you..since they know about it..they can probably show/tell you in which direction you are suited for..</p>

Promise him that you will work hard, although every week u will need at least half day off. Tell him if within 2 weeks he not satisfied with your performance, he can fire u without paying. Like that he sure hire u wan. U just perform up to standard, sure can get job. Just make sure your boss is a nice guy.</p></div>

              <p>Hi, I am a diploma holder. I was diagnose with anxiety disorder when in NS. Now still go for med appointments about once a month. I have difficulty finding a job that require little or no interaction w ppl. Tried looking for admin post like data entry but was rejected because I have no relevant experience, qualifications &amp; they mostly prefer ladies for these jobs. Some even told me that I am over-qualified because they do not need a diploma holder.</p>
              <p>Are there jobs suitable for ppl with anxiety disorder?</p>

              <p>Anxiety disorder should work alone, cos any pressure or stress on them only, they will go bersek/mad, and may whack those near him.</p>
              <p>In knowing your disorder, you need to work in those easy going job like nite security or those less crowded shopping centre information staff, if they ask for qualification, show them your PSLE one, sure employ you, then as you work, you slowly show them your O level and diploma, tell them you took partime, slowly you will be promoted. Hopefully by 50yo, your anxiety will slow down.</p>
