You will probably not have much chance to do this sort of things once you start work.<br><br>When I was in my final year in NUS, a guy approached me too. Though we hardly spoke a few words and we were not in the same tutorial class, each time he saw me outside the lecture hall waiting for our Sociology lecture, he would approach me with a cup of coffee. We never got together but 10 years on (I graduated in 1996), this still brings a smile to my face.</div>

However theres no chnace of getting to tok to her in class since she sits with her own group of friends and i sit with my own group of friends. We haven talked to each other before<br><br>I would like to know how to i get the chnace to tok to her? approaching her in class is like impossible as i do not knot her or anyone else in her group. so if i go up to talk to her everyone in the grp will be looking at me and that is quite daunting.<br><br>One way i thought of doing is thru my Uni's elearning facility. Its basically a website where you can see yr classmates who are online at the same time as well. You can then click their name n send a chat request to tok to them from there<br><br>I'm not sure if i should try to talk to her thru this way. Firstly caus i do not know how to start off since we haven talked to each other in class before. Can an of you guys gimme some guidelines as to what to msg her etc. Caus i'm thinking if thinks screw up, i still have to c her in class for the next 2 weeks although shes only in 1 class on mine per week<br><br>or is there any other way to know her??<br><br>Pls guide me alogn guys. would appreciate all your input! </div></blockquote>In my opinion....<br><br>you sound young and inexperienced. that is why you have so much concerns...<br><br>my advise is to just go up and talk to her... if she is "stuck-up", then you know for sure she is not for you.<br><br>If she is friendly, you can know her as a friend and take it from there....<br><br>either way, you will gain some knowledge approaching ladies.<br></div>
