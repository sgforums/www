            <div class='col-md body'>I believe face to face introduction is the best move. ELearning may give you shit, but if you are really too shy to approach her, it is up to you whether to utilize it or not. But i dont recommend this move, if you are trying to date her through this, as she hadn't seen you before and may thought that you are someone who prey on girls. Hmm, you may try this ; pretend to ask her something which you do not know about , say questions about the subjects that you had learnt earlier on in class. Orh you may try to introduce yourself to her, say " Erm hi, u are in my class for quite some time but arh...... i didn't got to know you. I just would like to know more bout you so that we can be friends right?" ( Of cuz u muz be friends with her before starting any relationship right?) I cannot garantee you that my methods might be successful for you, but give it a shot!<br><br>Good luck dude! ~smiles~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by scuderiaboy:</div><div class="quote_body">Heylo ppl... i have recently gotten attracted to this girl in my class in UNi. However theres no chnace of getting to tok to her in class since she sits with her own group of friends and i sit with my own group of friends. We haven talked to each other before<br><br>I would like to know how to i get the chnace to tok to her? approaching her in class is like impossible as i do not knot her or anyone else in her group. so if i go up to talk to her everyone in the grp will be looking at me and that is quite daunting.<br><br>One way i thought of doing is thru my Uni's elearning facility. Its basically a website where you can see yr classmates who are online at the same time as well. You can then click their name n send a chat request to tok to them from there<br><br>I'm not sure if i should try to talk to her thru this way. Firstly caus i do not know how to start off since we haven talked to each other in class before. Can an of you guys gimme some guidelines as to what to msg her etc. Caus i'm thinking if thinks screw up, i still have to c her in class for the next 2 weeks although shes only in 1 class on mine per week<br><br>or is there any other way to know her??<br><br>Pls guide me alogn guys. would appreciate all your input! </div></blockquote>For ur case, it will be best if you just go up to her while waiting for bus or what, and say 'hi'. talk for a while(and pray the stupid bus comes MUCH MUCH LATER), and you are on ur way. For the next few days, whenever u are in class, pretend to walk past her, and say hi. Continue the bus-routine for a few days, and then go get her MSN. Just say so that can facilitate u ask about schoolwork etc. After a while, u will know when 2 ask for her telephone number naturally.</div>
