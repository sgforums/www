However theres no chnace of getting to tok to her in class since she sits with her own group of friends and i sit with my own group of friends.

Its basically a website where you can see yr classmates who are online at the same time as well. You can then click their name n send a chat request to tok to them from there<br><br>I'm not sure if i should try to talk to her thru this way. Firstly caus i do not know how to start off since we haven talked to each other in class before. Can an of you guys gimme some guidelines as to what to msg her etc. Caus i'm thinking if thinks screw up, i still have to c her in class for the next 2 weeks although shes only in 1 class on mine per week<br><br>or is there any other way to know her??<br><br>Pls guide me alogn guys. would appreciate all your input!</div>

To suceed you need to visualise sucess. For example, all your reasons for not approaching her in class really screams of excuses for not approach her. I bet a million bucks you have 10 other reasons why u can't approach her in the canteen another 10 for not doing it at the bus stop and another 10 for why u cant do it in the toilet.<br><br>So stop all the procrastination, make a commitment to yourself to do the following the very next time you see her, and I mean the very next time even if its like 5 minutes from now (irregardless of time and place, with/without friends). If you fail to do this commit to perish the thought of getting in her pants, as you haven't even the balls to approach her.<br><br>i)    establish eye-contact,<br>ii)   then flash her a bright smile,<br>iii)  if she returns your smile say Hi!... (what ever happens after that either happens or don't its ok)<br><br>Simple and inocous right, thats all you do.<br><br>If you can't even do this, don't bother.<br><br>if you have achieved that, again commit to do a little more the next time u see her again, but always :<br><br>i) establish eye contact<br>ii) smile<br>iii) use imagination<br><br>Comes a point when it will be natural for either you to talk to her or for her to talk to you.<br><br>Good luck bro.<br></div>
