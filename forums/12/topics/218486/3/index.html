To be frank, I was experimenting if it was possible for her to escape out via self will, so I gave a generous period of time for her to fend for herself, but she was still suffering the same torment after the time frame.

I remember one close friend who went emotionally insane and started bedding any guys that came into her path. I tried to stop her insanity, but her Scorpio-extremist traits were too formidable to dispel.<br><br>I told her 'You are not well now and when you recovered emotionally, you will regret your action.'<br><br>She replied 'I know I will regret... currently, I just don't care...'<br><br>This is the apex of karmic struggle - nothing anyone can do about it.

            <div class='col-md body'>For the passed week, i have thought thru many of your comments and advices, i am seriously considering that i should give up on this hope.  I was in fact thinking of giving one of my suitors whom i do have chemistry with a chance.  Last weekend we had a good time during our date.<br><br>But somehow, this week, my ex suddenly treat me differently.  All along he does treat me nicely. EG im staying in his apartment which he used to rent out untill half a year ago, i need a roof over my head and i thinkin of renting, he offered me his apt as the tenancy agreement was about to end.<br><br>This week, he has really been nice to me.  EG i went for a interiview in a job, which i need to go to places like vietnam, and he suggested that since it is dangerous, he can company me there if i need to go there.  Another incident, we are meeting our friends for drinks in orchard.  we both decided we are not driving, he offered to fetch me with a cab from his place to my place then to drinks place.    note that we are staying in opp direction from him (eg i stay in bkt timah and his stays in katong).<br><br>why he treats me nice?  now im confused again.</div>
