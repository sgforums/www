You may eliminate the body, the spirit still thrives. The reason why we are unable to banish that love is because it is tied with our memories (Negative relationship that causes unhappiness, miseries and sufferings; the 'spirit' often manifest as fear).

Just how long are you going to wait? Five years relationship... two-half years roundabout... thirty three now and you are still wondering... waiting and feeling lost.<br><br>Love and relationship are two separate entities; you may think that you love him very much, but if the relationship doesn't work out, perhaps we should not force a piece into the puzzle because it just doesn't look pretty that way.<br><br>You are still mourning over your lost.<br><br>Learn acceptance - because if you continue to feed your past, you are denying yourself having a fulfilling relationship with someone else.

I can still feel it but I feel more the love and longing more intensely than pain over the years. As time went by, the pain became less, the miss-her feeling became more. Back then, it was really hard to get it over. Twenty years since U.  Was the happiest but most painful days of my life.  She moved on and I thought I did. The after-effects still show up every now and then. Unattached now but will attach when the right love appears.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">So ideally, we should look for people who focus on the same type of love as we do?</div></blockquote>The couple who focus more on certain &amp; similar love styles tend to stay together as lovers blissfully. It's heart-wrenching to fall in love that's mismatched and subsequently suffer sadness and misery. There are lasting couples and lovers out there and I believe the key lies with having similar love styles.<br><br>If you've not cried, go ahead - you'll feel much better to accept your situation than struggle within.<br><br>If music means alot to you and it can speak to (and relief) your heart (and hurt), check out my radio blog:<br><br>http://www.radioblogclub.com/fav/0/1332009/0<br><br>See that you have a tissue box next to you when you're listening.<br><br></div>
