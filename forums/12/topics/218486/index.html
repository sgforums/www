Finally we couldnt take it , and we called it off.<br><br>It has been more than 2.5 years since we parted.  I had 2 bfs after that, which didnt work out.  but somehow, i feel that there is still this feeling i have for him, this deep feeling, that sometimes i feel severe pain in my heart.  I feel that im waiting for him, but im not so sure.  Im juz so confused about this feeling.<br><br>Is this love?  Do i still love him?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes. You still love him.  But this love wont be strong enough to be actually attracted to him.  In other words to be together with him again. Unless of course both of you starts to spend time together again.<br><br>Its normal la. 5 years together. u wont forget him so easily. too many memories together.<br><br>and ur 2 ex's is not even half the amount of time spent with ur 5 years one. so it will make u think...whether the 5 years one is the one for you...<br><br>well..in short... yes. u still love him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
