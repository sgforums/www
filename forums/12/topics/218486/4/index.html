I was in fact thinking of giving one of my suitors whom i do have chemistry with a chance.  Last weekend we had a good time during our date.<br><br>But somehow, this week, my ex suddenly treat me differently.  All along he does treat me nicely. EG im staying in his apartment which he used to rent out untill half a year ago, i need a roof over my head and i thinkin of renting, he offered me his apt as the tenancy agreement was about to end.<br><br>This week, he has really been nice to me.  EG i went for a interiview in a job, which i need to go to places like vietnam, and he suggested that since it is dangerous, he can company me there if i need to go there.  Another incident, we are meeting our friends for drinks in orchard.  we both decided we are not driving, he offered to fetch me with a cab from his place to my place then to drinks place.    note that we are staying in opp direction from him (eg i stay in bkt timah and his stays in katong).<br><br>why he treats me nice?  now im confused again.</div></blockquote>He is your ex and you two still have dates?<br><br>Seems like you still cannot forget him as well as he cannot forget you.<br><br>Why don't you ask him what is his agenda for treating you so nice?

Something is not right here.<br><br>He is not attached to you and neither are you. In other words, he is free to see anyone and so are you. So what if he is updating? Maybe he is being kaypoh. Could be his ego and not real feelings for you playing with him here. See, the problem is he wants to settle down next year but he doesn't want to be attached to you? You see the contradiction? And he is not sure when he wants to settle down with the word "maybe"?

Is he afraid that getting attached will disrupt his business?<br><br>5 years is a long time for you to get along with him. And it ended up like nothing. You should know a lot of things about him. Subconsciously, you already know the answer whether you two can get along.<br><br>5 years is a long time and it could be you still have feelings for him because of the bond and also because you really love him. It is due to the long period of time that you put a lot of effort to the r/s.<br><br>doko<br><br></div></blockquote>yes, 5 year is a long time to know if we can get along.

Not all men desire to settle down. Most do. My guess is, this guy, he places priority in career over relationship issues. Without an established career, he can't have a fulfilling relationship. When he does have an established career, he will consider settling down. The fact he does so many things to put himself in your radar shows he still has you in his heart but at the same time, he feels that attachment is giving him a burden especially to his business. He wants you back too but he is afraid and it all starts way back 5 years ago. Something must have happened along the way. Were you too clingy ?<br><br>doko</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi galfriend,<br><br>Does wild and free mean he's got or open to other relationships similar to yours? Could he have said the same thing to other girls? How do you feel of his other relationships before and after marriage?<br><br>Imho, his wild-n-free ways can bring problems into a marriage.<br><br>Will he really settle down after marriage?<br>Will he stop being wild and free after marriage?<br>Being wild and free, are you sure you're his only one now? later?<br>Will you still be the one after his business takes off or after marriage?<br>Will there be another one after you when he's successful?<br>Will he get along with you even better or worse after his business takes off or after marriage?<br><br>If the man cannot lose and live without you, he'll ask for your hand now when you're seeing other suitors even if it means putting his business on halt. Only true, genuine (agape) love can move the man to do so and make him change permanently for you. He'll only want to be with you everyday of his life (not keeping you by his side as lovers). It appears to me his love is like ludus - he's attentive because of other suitors or just big bro phileo love.<br><br>I'm sorry if my words cut deep but experiencing short-sharp pain is better than long-torturing agony.<br><br></div>
