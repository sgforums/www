Never reject a parental meet-up, however, it is best to PLAN it instead of LEAVING it to nature.<br><br>Reason being Insurance - a significant percentage of relationship wouldn't even make it to the one year mark, so the meet-the-parents-session (MTPS) is pretty unnecessary, unless you foresee this relationship, very strongly, beyond the first year. Next thing: does it matters whether MTPS is held within the first year or not? Objectivity speaking, it's more like a customary approach, which would be executed naturally when a relationship attains certain 'level'. However, two weeks relationship to me is still far too raw.<br><br>Although, nothing wrong at all but I would prefer to plan it on a latter schedule, to set more important priorities first, like settling down for a new relationship with a new person, adapting to new personality, enjoy honeymoon period, etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
