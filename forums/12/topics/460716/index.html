              <p>Despite being one of the most common mental disorders, depression is 
                      often misunderstood. These myths and misconceptions may contribute to 
                      the stigma attached to depression, discouraging those affected to talk 
                      about their symptoms or seek help and treatment.</p>
              <p>Here is a list of myths and commonly held misconceptions about depression, and the corresponding facts.</p>
              <p><strong>MYTH: Depression is rare and will not happen to me.<br>FACT:</strong> Depression can happen to anyone, regardless of sex, race or age. It affects 121 million people worldwide<sup>1</sup> and is one of the most common mental health problems. The World Health 
                      Organization estimates that 5     10% of people may need help for 
                      depression at any time and as many as 8     20% of people carry the risk
                       of developing depression during their lifetime<sup>2</sup>.</p>
              <p><strong>MYTH: Depression is about feeling sad.<br>FACT:</strong> Depression is more than feeling sad. Persistent feelings of sadness is 
                      one of the symptoms of depression. However, depression also involves 
                      physical symptoms such as changes in appetite and quality of sleep, 
                      emotional symptoms such as feelings of worthlessness and changes in 
                      behaviour such as the loss of interest in our usual activities. For 
                      people experiencing depression, these symptoms continue for more than 
                      two weeks.</p>
              <p>See the full list of depression symptoms  <a title="here" href="http://hpb.gov.sg/HOPPortal/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pages/HealthTopics/ArticlePage/ArticlePage.jspx?dDocName=340&amp;topicName=Mental%20Health"><span style="color: #0066cc;">here</span></a>.</p>
              <p><strong>MYTH: Depression is a sign of weakness.<br>FACT:</strong> Depression is unrelated to the strength of someone   s character; it is
                       a serious medical condition like asthma or diabetes.   Depression is 
                      often triggered by major life events that may be challenging to cope 
                      with, e.g., the loss of a loved one, loss of job, etc.</p>
              <p><strong>MYTH: Depression is temporary and will go away by itself.<br>FACT:</strong> Depression will not go away by itself. It is a medical condition that 
                      requires treatment and support. In fact, the symptoms of depression are 
                      likely to get worse if left untreated. Thus, it is important to seek 
                      help early to prevent depressive symptoms from getting worse.</p>
              <p><br><strong>MYTH: Depression cannot be treated.<br>FACT:</strong> Depression is among the most treatable of all mental health conditions.
                       The World Health Organization reported that 60- 80% of individuals 
                      positively respond to a combination of medication and psychotherapy 
                      treatments<sup>3</sup>. Nevertheless, it is important to understand that treatment for depression takes time and that recovery may take many months.</p>
              <p><strong>MYTH: Depression can only be treated by medication.<br>FACT:</strong> Medication is only one of the available options for treatment of 
                      depression. Depression may also be treated using psychological 
                      intervention or counselling, lifestyle changes etc. The treatment needs 
                      of each individual may be different. Some people may find medication 
                      most effective, for others psychological intervention may be most 
                      helpful; a combination of treatments may work best for others. Thus, it 
                      is best to approach a mental health professional to find out more about 
                      different types of treatment and to develop an individualised support 
                      plan.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong><a href="http://www.hpb.gov.sg/HOPPortal/health-article/340">http://www.hpb.gov.sg/HOPPortal/health-article/340</a></strong></em></span></p>
              <p>In some people, depression can be so severe that it dominates their 
                      lives, preventing them from coping as they used to, and losing interest 
                      in things that they used to enjoy. Depression of this degree is an 
                      illness and needs treatment.</p>
              <p>Depression is a medical illness. It is not due to moral weakness or a character flaw. It cannot be willed or wished away.</p>
              <h2>What are the types of depression?</h2>
              <p><strong>Major depression</strong> is manifested by a combination of symptoms that affect our work, 
                      interests and feelings towards family and friends. These disabling 
                      episodes can occur twice or several times in a lifetime.</p>
              <p><strong>Dysthymia</strong> is a less severe type of depression. People with dysthymia have 
                      long-term depressive symptoms and it prevents them from functioning at 
                      an optimal level.</p>
              <h2>Symptoms of depression</h2>
              <p>Certain characteristic symptoms can give you or your family a clue that you are depressed:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Depressed or low mood</li>
              <li>A loss of interest and enjoyment in life</li>
              <li>A lack of drive or motivation that makes even simple tasks or decisions difficult or impossible</li>
              <li>Feeling tired all the time</li>
              <li>Agitation or restlessness</li>
              <li>Loss or gain in appetite with loss or gain in weight</li>
              <li>Sleeplessness or excessive sleeping</li>
              <li>Loss of self confidence, avoiding people</li>
              <li>Feeling useless, inadequate, helpless or hopeless</li>
              <li>Feeling guilty or worthless</li>
              <li>Thoughts of suicide</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>What are the causes of depression?</h2>
              <p>Some
                       types of depression run in families, indicating hereditary or genetic 
                      factors in the transmission of depressive disorders. In some families, 
                      major depression seems to occur generation after generation.</p>
              <p>Studies
                       have also suggested some biological component in depression. It may be 
                      associated with having too little or too much chemicals in the brain. 
                      Certain medications have mood altering properties. Antidepressant 
                      medication act by altering and normalizing the biochemical imbalances in
                       the brain.</p>
              <p>Life events such as loss of a job, retirement, 
                      divorce, death of a loved one or moving to a new house can precipitate a
                       depressive illness. Social circumstances also play a part. If we are 
                      alone, have few or no friends, suffer from a chronic illness, then we 
                      may be more vulnerable to depression.</p>
              <p>People with life threatening
                       or long-term physical illness such as cancer, stroke, arthritis or 
                      heart disease are also more vulnerable to depression. Personality may 
                      also play a part in depression. Some of us are more vulnerable than 
                      others because of the individual make-up or early life experiences.</p>
              <p>Very often, a combination of genetic, psychological and environmental factors is involved in the onset of depression.</p>
              <p>The good news is that whatever the cause, depression is treatable.</p>
              <h2>How is depression treated?</h2>
              <p>Treatment
                       for depression is well established. 85% of people with major depression
                       have fairly good treatment outcome. Treatment consists of drug 
                      (antidepressant medication) and non-drug therapy. Usually, a combined 
                      treatment is best: medication to gain relatively quick relief and 
                      psychotherapy to learn more effective ways to deal with life stresses.</p>

              <p>Of the various mental disorders, depression is one of the most 
                      treatable. The World Health Organization estimates that treatment is 
                      effective for 60-80% of those affected<sup>1</sup>.</p>
              <p>Depression can be managed using a range of different strategies 
                      including medication, counselling or psychological intervention and 
                      lifestyle changes. Treatment plans may differ, depending on the 
                      individual's symptoms and personal and medical history. As depression 
                      presents a range of symptoms that relate to our physical functioning, 
                      thinking, feelings and behavior, a combination of strategies are often 
                      employed to address these different aspects.</p>
              <p>Medications 
                      used to treat depression are known as antidepressants. They help to 
                      regulate mood and can only be prescribed by a doctor. On average, 
                      antidepressants require three to four weeks of regular dosages before 
                      the full treatment benefit will be experienced. Even when used 
                      regularly, antidepressants are not addictive.</p>
              <p>Counselling
                       or psychological intervention can also help individuals cope with life 
                      stressors and reduce the symptoms of depression. These sessions focus on
                       teaching positive styles of thinking, managing our emotions and how to 
                      deal with the symptoms of depression and day-to-day challenges. 
                      Counselling and psychological interventions may also equip people with 
                      the knowledge and skills to optimise their mental well-being, identify 
                      the early warning signs of depression and prevent further periods of 
                      depression.</p>

              <p>There are many treatment and support options available for people 
                      who may be suffering from depression. It is recommended that you seek 
                      help once the symptoms begin to interfere with one or more aspects of 
                      your life (e.g. withdrawal from friends and social activities, decreased
                       ability to concentrate and make decisions at work etc).</p>
              <p>Depression is highly treatable and is most effectively managed through 
                      early detection and treatment. The earlier you seek treatment the more 
                      effective the treatment will be. Thus, it is preferable to approach your
                       general practitioner once you experience symptoms that concern you, 
                      even if you are unsure. If you think that someone close to you may be 
                      showing signs of depression, you could speak to the person and encourage
                       him or her to see a doctor.<br> With early detection and help, you can beat the blues.</p>
