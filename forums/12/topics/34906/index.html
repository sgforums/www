I mean... 1 year is not a very long time nor is it a short time for a relationship (most important of all, relationships can be independent of time...)... There're certainly other kinda relationships out there... (though it's no guarantee that you'll get what you want...)<br><br>Be HONEST to yourself... Though she could have been the one whom you've always wanted (you courted her before...) and within this 1 year there're bound to be feelings involved in your case... But DO YOU THINK she's truly the one for you...? Never mind you're the one who went for her... Never mind what you've promised her (which you probably won't be able to keep up to as things get out of hands for both of you...)....<br><br>WHAT you want? And ask again... WHAT you THINK she wants...?<br><br>Personally, from a SURFACE (shallow...) opinion... There is quite a likely chance that all this could be just an ILLUSION.... You're just there for the sake of being there in this relationship.... And she's just there to make the story complete....<br><br>That's all I can say from my point of view and whatever information you've provided.... When in doubt, I would advice... Go discover yourself..? Ask yourself what you want....? Your DREAM or the REALITY....?<br></div>
