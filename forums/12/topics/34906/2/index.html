            <div class='col-md body'>this will be a BIG test.<br><br>try to sit down and talk about it.  what is important in a long term relationship is how happy both parties r when they r together.<br>don't avoid the problem!!  Discussion will probably help u with your decision.<br><br>1)  Ask her if she see any problem in the relationship since there have been frequent arguements/quarrel.<br><br>2)  discuss what trigger this arguement.  If this discussion is gonna start any fight, then u have to 'time out' and stop its process.  This will also indicate that PEACE will be difficult to achieve in future.<br><br>3)  if can really sit down to talk about the prev the cause of the prev fights, then see if any way to resolve.  Can either party change for the better?  Is it very tough to give way??  Is it possible to re-live good old days when u juz started instead of fighting?<br><br>Have u walk in a pair of shoes that is 1 size too small.  No matter how nice it looks and how much u spent, it hurt to keep wearing it.  U must accpt it that your feet r not going to be smaller and the shoes will still hurt till the day u throw it away.<br></div>
