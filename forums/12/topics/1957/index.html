            <div class='col-md body'>Try your last shot at working things out with him lor. He should at least be told that the r/ship is on the rocks and he should make a conscious effort to change. Tell him you need more time for yourself and your friends, and that he is being quite possesive lately. Tell him if he wants this r/ship to work out, he has to give you more space to breathe. See what his response. He either gets the hint and forces himself to give your more space to breathe, or he takes the hint wrongly and thinks you are trying to break up with him. Either way is advantageous to you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well i guess IF you have ALREADY made up your mind, then there is no point in dragging this on much longer. 2 years is already a long time and the longer it goes on, the harder it will be to let go and it will hardly do any justice to both of you. then both of you will juz be in the relationship for fear of hurting each other and not for each other's happiness, which is truly a sad thing. be honest, and though he will be deeply hurt from wat you described, he will be better off with someone who shares his ideals.<br>unless, u still wanna give him another shot, u must be prepared to make sacrifices, juz as he will have to do the same. u 2 will need to have a talk on wat u expect out of this and it will not be easy, often hurtful and emotional. but if you 2 do decide to make sacrifices for each other, it might juz bring the relationship to a whole new level which may make it more stronger than it ever was.<br>either way it is up to u, but it won't be easy, and you have to be mentally prepared for that.</div>
