            <div class='col-md body'>personally i feel at perhaos a third party to help n a short sepeartoon will be nice if u still wan salvage the r/s. For me, my bf n i was having tis communication problem At first we tot is due to spenmding a lot of time and suffocating or things like tat. However, we talk to a mutual fren. She help us to understand each other in different perspective and to sort all misunderstanding out. right now, we r going thro a know-you-better stage. Tat is to say, we r now temporary not together. in this period, we r putting the r/s to a big test to c if it can withstand hardship n obstacles. Meanwhile, we will be thinking thro the past r/s we had n to talk abt wat unhappy and wat we expect from a r/s n wat we r thinking n doing. In short, we have to be frank wif each other so as to improve the r/s in future. Also take tis time to communicate wif yr bf and to understand each other n how to improve the r/s.<br><br>Hope these tips help.</div>

I had a fren who was still deeply in love with her first love, and she was so tortured by it that it caused a lot of problems in her current relationship. But one day she picked up her courage and told her bf her true feeling, and afterthat, she was so relieved with her burden that both of them decided to give their relationship another shot (with each trying to change for the better).<br><br>your bf sounds like a really emotional guy so i really dunno how to advise u on how to break up with him, cos i myself had a similar experience and my relationship lasted 4 years! Whatever it is, dun stay on just because you are feeling guilty or worried that he would do silly things, guys like him need to be on their own and learn to be independent... otherwise, it would only make him a worse person...<br><br>do take care and i hope things work out..</div>
