It can be passive or proactive.  By passive, i mean,  one knows another is generous and 'allow' that to happen.  In the case of the ''offer to return the money", i doubt there was much sincerity in it, as the conversation went like:<br><br>Friend: wow, you lost so much money.  you still have some money with me you know<br>BF:  oh, you win hor?<br>Friend: ya, but i spent all of them shopping already<br>BF: it is ok, forget it<br></div>
