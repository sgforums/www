            <div class='col-md body'>I still think asking him for money for something and then secretly saving for him is a rather good idea. Instead of other people taking advantage of his generosity, why not you, in a good way? Perhaps u can also get him to embark on a savings plan which he is forced to put aside some money per month. This way he will have less available money to be that "generous", and yet have enough money in the future.<br><br>Open another joint acct only much later.<br><br>As for "rewarding" him... might work at the spur of the moment, but will most likely be forgotten later.<br><br>Just my 2 cents, for I'm the stingier type of guy who only splurges on my gf.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually dont assume he has less money he will be less generous<br>Attitude towards money comes from a value system<br>it is how he sees money in relation to other things in his life<br>he feels he does not need to calculate 'small amount' because in return from these people, he may feel he gets what more money can offer<br>Also perhaps when u not around, his friends too are not that calculative about money?<br><br>However, I do feel that if value system and attitude towards money is too different between a couple, this will become a very big issue because money has a lot to do with our daily lives. It is not HOW much you've got, and how it is used that will make the difference.<br><br>If both cannot compromise how money should be used, I think you should consider deeply about a long term relationship. Because in times of need, if both cannot understand each other priorities, they cannot stand by each other.</div>

If it is seen as lying, perhaps they can start a bank acct, in which TS can demand a certain sum of money to be put in it every month. There should be an agreement that this money should not be touched. It wouldn't be lying then.</div>

Some guys wouldn't like it at all.<br><br>But it would be better if the guy can save on his own rather than being forced by the gf. It should be him saving with the thought that "I want to save because I want a good future for me and this woman whom I love. Not because she wants me to, it is because I want to."<br><br>There is a difference <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Perhaps u can also get him to embark on a savings plan which he is forced to put aside some money per month. This way he will have less available money to be that "generous", and yet have enough money in the future.<br><br>Open another joint acct only much later.<br><br>As for "rewarding" him... might work at the spur of the moment, but will most likely be forgotten later.<br><br>Just my 2 cents, for I'm the stingier type of guy who only splurges on my gf.</div></blockquote>Its a good idea but then again TS will have to think of different reasons each time she wants to ask for money from her b/f and that is not going to be something easy. She has also mention that she prefers not to spend her b/f's money so her sudden change of attitude might back fired on their relationship.<br><br>It may even be worst if her b/f finds out the truth. It'll be better if she is able to convience him to start saving on his own rather than lying to him.<br><br></div>
