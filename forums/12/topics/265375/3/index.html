            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, reminds me of my bf. He is very generous as well, both to his friends and also to me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> He used to like to pay for his friends first, although I have told him this is not a good idea, because it will make you feel like a loanshark later, because you have to chase the friends for payment. But I guess this is already part of his nature and yea I do notice some people tend to take advantage of it...<br><br>My bf tends to spend a lot of his interests and hobbies, I don't really tell him that he has to stop doing that because I know everyone spends on their own interests (like how I can spend a lot buying my books) but I have always told him that he needs to know how to control and limit himself. I told him to think about the plans that we are going to have for our future, and I am glad he understands that it is not cheap when it comes to settling down. I have also told him to spend less on me so that he can save more for our future.<br><br>I have thought about the joint account thing but I have not broached it to him yet as I am afraid he will think that I am trying to control his money too much and do not have enough trust in him. For now I just focus on reminding him of the importance of saving for the future, because without savings, we will really go nowhere...Just tell this to him and see how he react I guess. As for my bf, he admits that he needs to curb his spending more now because he has had more commitments ever since we started to date  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

He always buys friends drinks.  it can be like one or 2 bottles of hard liquor a week, and when his sister has problems, he will pass her few hundred dollars to buy things to make her happy.  and at times, he will sponsor her to go for trips.  i think rendering support to sister is good, but think he tends to go overboard when he is being so generous with money all the time especially when we are not rich people.<br><br>recently we went genting with friends.  he even go to the extend of giving chips (ie money to a friend).  to note, at the end of the trip, this friend won money and he lost and the friend sought of said "hey, you still got money with me"  he said "it is ok, forget it."<br><br>and when we came back from the trip, he overpaid the organiser of the trip &gt;$100, organiser said wanna transfer the money back to him.  he said never mind lah, next trip then say.  but ther is no trip in the foreseeable future, so it is as good as giving money again.<br><br>i really think his generosity is excessive.  how should i communicate with him?  or am i the petty one?</div></blockquote>generous also a problem??? is good mah if you see many people so petty... you can help him save then. some people habit very hard to change... let say every month u ask him for $100 for some reason. like i see something i like ... can buy for me. then u say i will buy myself. then next month improve $150-200 haha... seem he so generous.</div>
