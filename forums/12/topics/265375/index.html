            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by galfriend:</div><div class="quote_body">My boyfriend is pretty generous with everyone.  He always buys friends drinks.  it can be like one or 2 bottles of hard liquor a week, and when his sister has problems, he will pass her few hundred dollars to buy things to make her happy.  and at times, he will sponsor her to go for trips.  i think rendering support to sister is good, but think he tends to go overboard when he is being so generous with money all the time especially when we are not rich people.<br><br>recently we went genting with friends.  he even go to the extend of giving chips (ie money to a friend).  to note, at the end of the trip, this friend won money and he lost and the friend sought of said "hey, you still got money with me"  he said "it is ok, forget it."<br><br>and when we came back from the trip, he overpaid the organiser of the trip &gt;$100, organiser said wanna transfer the money back to him.  he said never mind lah, next trip then say.  but ther is no trip in the foreseeable future, so it is as good as giving money again.<br><br>i really think his generosity is excessive.  how should i communicate with him?  or am i the petty one?</div></blockquote>why not open a joint account with him?u can let him spend all he wants but just make sure that there are money inside the account every month by both of you.i'm sure he will listen to you.<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No matter how simple the wedding is, it will still be expensive. Things like taking bridal photos, booking of wedding tables etc, no matter how "budget", is still a considerable amt. Like someone here suggested, show him the accounts. Tell him gently that there may be a slight problem in raising enough money if he doesn't curb being generous.<br><br></div>
