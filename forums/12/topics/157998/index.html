In your mind, you probably think that your chance may be ruin if you don't employ enough haste, thus your expression.<br><br>In all likelihood, she probably knew that you liked her even before your expression, which is why she opt to avoid/send you cold messages because she has an unrequited love from some other guy.<br><br>In simple words: you took uncalculated risk and lost much of your unused chips.<br><br>She seemed defensive when dealing with you; it would be a hard nut to crack if you wish to explore her emotional realm.<br><br>IMHO, I think you have lost much of this battle. Reason being the way you handle her. You could attempt to reverse this trend, but do exercise enough caution to avoid becoming an irritant in impression. You see, people don't treat someone coldly for no rhythm or reason; it just so happen that you don't know the reason behind. There are a number of possibilities - so instead of trying to force it out of her, you could try to source it from people around her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
