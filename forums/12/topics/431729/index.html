              <p>of cors got other ways lah.</p>
              <p>You are enabling his behavior towards you when you let him step all over you.</p>
              <p>He ask you to jump , you jump, he ask you to shit you shit.</p>
              <p>If I am him.. I also bully you.</p>
              <p>Learn to say "no" nicely.</p>
              <p>Know how to differentiate jobs that are just thrown at you due to his own laziness.. vs jobs that only you can do aka a favor.</p>
              <p>Stop be such a push over.. then people will not likely try to take advantage of you.</p>
              <p>Remember.. bullies are cowards.. they only pick on those they perceived as weaker than themselves.</p>

              <p>If your post is an accurate reflection of the situation, then you already know you're much wiser and matured in your thinking compared to his... That in itself is already a sweet revenge, don't you think so?</p>
              <p>There are reasons why people act in a certain ways. Some of the things you said reflects an insecurity in his life, that's why he's putting you down. He's feeling inferior deep down but he dare not say, instead he use ways to put you down so you feel inferior to him. Come to think of it, he did succeed to a certain extent because you're affected by it.</p>
              <p>My advise is, there's nothing much you can do about another person's life if they do not want to change. But there's alot you can do about your own life, so continue to focus on your own life instead of caring about what he's trying to do to your life.</p>
              <p>If someone stolen my things, it's easier for me to focus on my side and secure my things so next time it won't happen again. It won't help if we keep pointing fingers and ends up still anyhow put valuables around and then it get stolen again and again.</p>
              <p>I think you have a smart matured personality so keep it up. It's your life, you have full control over it. Other people's life, not much you can do, but over time, they may grow up, hopefully so.</p>

              <p>Is it something wrong with me ...? I feel really irritated about this same old problem. When i get back my examination results , i will always report and share with my parents. If it is good , he will always say " aiya , people go university one mah" when i score bad results, he will laugh at me and stuffs like that... I really cannot stand his selfish character after he broke up with his girlfriend -.- yesterday, he told me to buy this Toner catridge for my house printer so today i went to harvey norman to purchase it. He paid me 25 dollars to run this errand, but in the end the toner costs $88. So i just use nets and paid for him.. So when i reached home, he ask me how much it costs, i say $88 and he replied me "HUH" and he walked away so i just ignored him... Then he told me to withdraw him his 35 dollars as his friend returned $$$ to him but he told him to deposit into my account.. I am just back home and i went back to this harvey norman TWICE as the toner has some problem... So i went back to exchange. Can he spare me -.- can he stop using this kind of freaking tone.... like i will never return his 35 dollars.... Can he dun be so uptight when my parents told him to go out less often.... Can he stop acting like some hooligans, and start to throw tantrums at us when my parents told him to come back earlier as he always stay out at his friends house or clubbing. And oftenly he will criticised me..... There was once i was in bus sitting beside him, then there is a cute girl standing infront of us.. And he asked me the girl cute mah , so i just nodded . Then he tell me go jio her... Thn i say siao ... i dun even know her.... Then he insulted me u gay isit...  I really dun understand him ...... I didn't even disturb him can he stop irritating me.... Everything i do he comment, yapping and yapping like nobody business.. When his results nt that gd , i also never laugh at him and comment.... WTF he wants from me.... Just because i am quiet and introvert, i do have emotions .... I tolerate him for quite a long time already .. i thought this will stop once i reach 16 but now i am already 17 ... This still continues.... Can someone tell me what to do ?</p>

              <p>Just the facts....</p>
              <p>1.  You and your brother are not close to each other.... (common)</p>
              <p>2.  He may be maturing slower than you.... (so bear with him)</p>
              <p>3.  He may be selfish but that's not a crime....</p>
              <p>4.  You expect tooo much from your brother....(He bochup u and u can do the same)</p>
