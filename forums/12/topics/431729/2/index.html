              <p>you might be overly sensitive to your brother's comment on you. some people do not mean to harm others but they may sound bad towards people. so dont get too worked up.sometimes thats just the way they talk?</p>
              <p>maybe you can show more care to him, ask about his life etc,. . i suppose you and your brother lacks communication with each other.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>My older brother use to criticise me, saying that I am spoilt and no use, so i used to complaint to my grandma, but never in a public forum, cos after all, he aint heavy, he is my brother. And then my granny told me to take the critics with open heart, look at it, if it is true, improve on it and show it to him. I did that, and now I am quite successful, hardworking and no more a spoil kid, somehow, I just like to thanks my brother for all his suans and critics, think of it, he actually wanted me to improve thru anger therapy.</p></div>
