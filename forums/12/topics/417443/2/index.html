              <p>He will chat over msn with her at night, so i know he's talking
                  to her. I have talked to him about it, said i was fine if he talked
                  to her like few days a week but everyday is really too much for me.
                  He said it was just a phase and it was nothing. </p>
              <p>At first, I accepted what he said and I trained myself to accept
                  it. But later on, i found out some things which showed me that he
                  was very attached to her emotionally...i suppose it's more of an
                  emotional affair than physical affair.</p>
              <p>Our relationship is okay i guess...just that sometimes there's

              <p>How about some outdoor activities that would be interesting to both of you; doesn't matter what it is, be it a romantic movie outing or some kayaking under the hot sun.</p>
              <p>Prepare two cups of his favourite drink, one for each of you and begin by asking about whether he's free at a particular time which you're pretty sure he's available on. Then, tell him that you would like to go out with him and follow up with the outing suggestion. Be insistent on it, but do not turn aggressive if he rejects the idea. Instead, suggest another activity that would be less demanding on time and energy.</p>
              <p>If he still doesn't give in, using an i-am-not-irritated-even-though-you-have-rejected-my-ideas-twice tone, gently ask him if he has anything in mind. Make sure to finish your cup by now, and offer to refill his. Take the cups, go to the kitchen, give him about 2-3 minutes to think about it, and pray that he would suggest something once you return.</p>
              <p>Once you can get him out with you, you can take that entire time to understand more about what's going on in his life. Treat it like a date before your marriage and make sure both of you enjoy yourselves. Once the outing ends, ask him if he would like to go out next week or on the one after. Keep this going for a couple of times and you will find out whether you're still in his heart.</p>

              <p>Hi, I'd just like to get some views from u guys. Do u all think
              it's normal and okay for a married man to be in contact with a
              female ex-colleague everyday (through whatsapp, sms, and msn)?</p>
              <p>He worked in his previous company for about 2 years plus, and
              all the while he has been talking to her on msn and sms everyday.
              Even until now, when he has left the company, they are still
              carrying on. It's a long story...but just like to get your views on
              the topic above and see whether it is normal...thanks! :)</p>

              <p>Chat with her everyday ? Wow, that just shows how BORING your marriage is.</p>
              <p>He must be bored out of his mind and have too much time on hand to be able to do such things with her.</p>
              <p>"Keep your friends close, your enemy closer.".</p>
              <p>Have you ever met her before ? Have you try to be part of his social circle at all ?</p>
              <p>What are you doing to keep your marriage INTERESTING or do you simply go home to each other because you have to ?</p>
              <p>Your marriage is "sick", needs some work to keep it alive.</p>
              <p>And no, he chatting with that woman is not normal, it is a SYMPTOM that something is not right in your marriage.</p>
              <p>Good luck and be strong.</p>

              <p>Hmm...</p>
              <p>Try to see what they are saying in MSN.....</p>
              <p>Use some tactic to peep.</p>
              <p>If they are not having any kind of flirtings, then at least it hasnt gone into a bad stage.</p>
              <p>However it is indeed possible he may be "emotionally" having an affair.</p>
              <p>But this also need to be determined first.</p>
              <p>Because he just left recently.</p>
              <p>If he continues to chat to her, then it is unusual. If this tapers off after some time, then it's ok.</p>
              <p>Does he like to chat in MSN with girls generally?</p>
              <p>Because this is also another separate issue, which may be his real issue.</p>

              <p>It is not a phase, it is an addiction.</p>
              <p>Get him to stop all of a sudden and he'll yearn for that chat.</p>
              <p>Tell him he need not stop, but can chat with the ex-colleague like every Wednesday, or some other arrangements. Like this he won't feel deprived as he know he can still talk to that ex.</p>
              <p>Hopefully they would soon lose their dependency.</p>

              <p>Well you can try to read this article about people commenting on a well-known expert on relationship.</p>
              <p><a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?The-4-Phases-of-an-Affair---Recognize-Where-His-Affair-is-Today-and-Possibly-Prevent-It&amp;id=3545299">http://ezinearticles.com/?The-4-Phases-of-an-Affair---Recognize-Where-His-Affair-is-Today-and-Possibly-Prevent-It&amp;id=3545299</a></p>
              <p>What can you do is simple...when he is in bath or sleep go and check the sms...figure out the nature of the conversation. remember they may chat in codes. </p>
              <p>Make sure he does not know you are checking his sms, if there is sign of flirting ask him nicely first without revealing that you have checked him, the nature of his convo with ex-colleague. If he becomes defensive and lying, well call marriage counselor or lawyer. :(</p>
