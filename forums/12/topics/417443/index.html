              <p>Hi, I'd just like to get some views from u guys. Do u all think it's normal and okay for a married man to be in contact with a female ex-colleague everyday (through whatsapp, sms, and msn)?</p>
              <p>He worked in his previous company for about 2 years plus, and all the while he has been talking to her on msn and sms everyday. Even until now, when he has left the company, they are still carrying on. It's a long story...but just like to get your views on the topic above and see whether it is normal...thanks! :)</p>

              <p>He will chat over msn with her at night, so i know he's talking to her. I have talked to him about it, said i was fine if he talked to her like few days a week but everyday is really too much for me. He said it was just a phase and it was nothing. </p>
              <p>At first, I accepted what he said and I trained myself to accept it. But later on, i found out some things which showed me that he was very attached to her emotionally...i suppose it's more of an emotional affair than physical affair.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Ask him can he let me see what you smses? And if he's willing to let you see, probably it is just a friendship relationship, nothing much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If he feel uncomfortable, then something fishy going on.</p>

              <p>He will chat over msn with her at night, so i know he's talking
              to her. I have talked to him about it, said i was fine if he talked
              to her like few days a week but everyday is really too much for me.
              He said it was just a phase and it was nothing. </p>
              <p>At first, I accepted what he said and I trained myself to accept
              it. But later on, i found out some things which showed me that he
              was very attached to her emotionally...i suppose it's more of an
              emotional affair than physical affair.</p>
              <p>Our relationship is okay i guess...just that sometimes there's
              nothing to say when we are both at home after work. </p>

              <p>Hi, I'd just like to get some views from u guys. Do u all think
              it's normal and okay for a married man to be in contact with a
              female ex-colleague everyday (through whatsapp, sms, and msn)?</p>
              <p>He worked in his previous company for about 2 years plus, and
              all the while he has been talking to her on msn and sms everyday.
              Even until now, when he has left the company, they are still
              carrying on. It's a long story...but just like to get your views on
              the topic above and see whether it is normal...thanks! :)</p>

              <p>Nothing you can do about it. Takes two hands to clap.</p>
              <p>If you want to be possessive about it, he will feels even more distant away from you and it's not like he will suddenly feel bad and regretful over what he have done.</p>
              <p>He knows what he is doing, so you can only believe that their relationship is purely based on friendship. Even if it's not, it's also not your fault because you cannot be the person who is policing the marriage. But let him be very aware of the CONSEQUENCES.</p>
              <p>You can also contact your guy friends and socialise with them if you like.</p>
