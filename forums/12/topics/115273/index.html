            <div class='col-md body'>People look for an easier way out because they have no confidence in themselves. Local men (LM) think that they are unworthy of local girls (LG).

They are mostly low class wage earners in their 40's to 50's earning less than 1.8k a month. They just dunch have the time and money to court a singaporean girl of child bearing age that is late 20's to 30s. Hence, the demand for cheap overseas wivies from vietnam or indonesia!<br><br>To me, as a classical economist, I say go ahead! Heck, it means more babies for Singapore!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know why this topic is brought up again as it has been 'talked to death'<br><br>It is a problem which is common in ANY developed country, not only Singapore!<br><br>What I can say is that, put a young Vietnamese girl in Singapore. Give her equal opportunities that SG girls have. She will turn out like the SG girls you keep complaining about.<br><br>If you are so unhappy about SG girls, just go marry a China/Vietnam or whatever girl that makes you feel better.<br><br>It is not about the nationality or race, but how you adapt to survive and succeed in your environment.<br><br>As for some Sg guys, with their education and success, I do not understand why they want a 'little' woman. I believe that in a relationship, responsibilities has to be shared. Won't you want someone who can help you with your decision making instead of pushing everything to you? Might as well as a robot who serves you hand and foot.<br><br>Also, there are expectations from the environment. If you compare the standard of living in Singapore and other neighbouring countries there will be certain set expectations. For a girl who grew up having to work from dawn till dusk and sleeping on the floor. A HDB flat with a bed is a very comfortable life just looking after the house. If you want a SG girl to downgrade from what she has with her parents, that will be a little more difficult unless she is so much in love that she is willing to sacrifice all. I mean let's face it. That's the facts of life.<br><br>The thing is that, the media keeps highlighting the plight of blue collar workers and comparing it with the educated females. Of course there will not be a match! I mean hello~ ANY logical person will know where the problem lies.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A local girl will be able to contribute to the family income cos she is educated. When U marry a uneducated foreign wife, u will be the sole breadwinner.<br>What happens when u get retrenched?<br>My advise to the local guys is to upgrade so they don't draw low pay.<br>No parents will want their daughters to suffer after marriage.</div>

A nice partner to understand and respect me for who I am is what I want - not some power game of who serve who.<br><br>Did I condemned local guys as unwanted?<br>I was actually referring to all comments YOU made.  If you want to marry a bride from a third world country to control her, then you are seriously in a control game - control everything when in actuality you have nothing. No one is to be anyone's slave even if they are impoverished.<br><br>There are plenty of intelligent women in vietnam and china - if they have to marry you to step out of poverty and their countries - why not? Just tolerate a loser's attitude until they meet a better partner and ditch you . By then you might lost your property and everything.  I might just get a good laugh when I see the topic about foreign girls using men to get what they want.</div>
