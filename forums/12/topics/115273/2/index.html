Yes I have everything I need. I don't need a guy to provide for me. A nice partner to understand and respect me for who I am is what I want - not some power game of who serve who.<br>....<br>....<br>....<br>There are plenty of intelligent women in vietnam and china - if they have to marry you to step out of poverty and their countries - why not? Just tolerate a loser's attitude until they meet a better partner and ditch you . By then you might lost your property and everything.  I might just get a good laugh when I see the topic about foreign girls using men to get what they want.</div></blockquote>Exactly!<br><br>Those losers they just want a slave. Put yourself into such position, how would you feel?<br>Don't use gentle as an excuse.<br><br>In fact you don't need to wait, there are already plenty of such cases where the wife run away. Not difficult to see such news like Â“foreign wife run away with all their moneyÂ” on the papers.<br><br>Another example is, they already have a lover at their hometown. Life over there is tough, so they come out with a plan. Since guy is a bit hard to make big money for their future, what can they expect if the guy work as construction worker? How much can they earn? Usually the girl can earn easy and fast money. So, some might just come here to sell their body, after they earn enough, they just go back to their country and start a family with their lover.<br><br>Some might just marry to a foreign guy (e.g. Singaporean), and when she saves enough money, she will just run away and back to their country, happily married with their lover.<br><br>What is the difference between selling themselves to one guy (so-called husband), and serving many guys? What is the difference between letting 1 ugly loser touching them every night compare to touching by many ugly ah-peh? Well, virginity can exchange a better future life, it's worth it, at least for them.<br><br>So, loser, the so-called "wife" that you are hugging, or f-king might imagining their lover at their hometown. They just close their eyes and let the big-fat-pig-ugly-loser to do it to them, while imagining a bright future life with their lover.<br><br>I had seen such case in real life.<br><br>So, let see who has the last laugh. Our lovely local girls? The ugly loser? Or their slave (or so-called wife)?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think its a knee jerk reaction to the rising divorce rates and the broken-up families in countries such as the US. Men realise that perhaps 'modern' women are not the best choice and thus turn their attention to more 'traditional' women.<br><br>It's sad that the more modern a women is, the less chances of her getting married. But I guess that is just how it is. There is no equality in sexes. Men are still doing the asking( Will you marry me? ). Perhaps, if the latter was not true, there would be a more social balance.<br><br>For now, there is no real motivation for men to meet up to local women's expectations. 'Modern' women are perhaps nice to have but not very practical or are too expensive when the alternatives are just as good. The 'rewards' isn't very clear.<br><br>Is moral obligation and social pressure the only reason why local men should marry local women? It's the right thing to do. Only losers would marry overseas women. Overseas women are more than likely to run away when they have enough.<br><br>I think local men are smart enough to see through these stereotypes. That's why they are frustated that articles on low-income men marrying 'non-intellectual' overseas women are repeatedly published when the fact that the average men do marry overseas too and they are not necessarily 'non-intellectual'. They know that 'traditional' does not equate to 'non-intellectual' or 'slaves'. Why should society deem what is best for men?<br><br>So I guess the 'traditional' local women are still the most sought after. Unless the government start a 'Marry Local Women' campaign..Haha..I hope that never happens.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another thread bashing SGrean women.  Lemme share wif u why I'm wif someone who's Not local (Not angmoh, juz Not local).<br><br>SG men r prettie much chauvanistic, they still haf the same thinking as urs.  They believe women shd be submissive outta tradition, &amp; Not giving in cosh of love.<br><br>Their egos r so bloated tt they can't stand the thot of women doing better, all in the name of contributing to household expenses &amp; to the future.  They seek to bring the women down, &amp; to destroy her self-confidence, &amp; induce guilt for doing better.<br><br>Wat haf I gained wif a non-local?<br><br>1.  Support for my career.  He celebrates whenever I get promoted, or do well in my work, &amp; he gives me little gifts to encourage me.<br><br>2.  Plenty of affection.  We dun make out fully in public, but I do get a gentle caress on my cheek now &amp; then.<br><br>3.  A best fren.  Someone who doesn't make me feel guilty for doing better than him.  He watches my achievements wif pride &amp; happiness.  He encourages me to tok abt my frustrations @ work, &amp; sometimes tries to provide solutions.<br><br>Overall, he's Not demanding nor expects me to kowtow to him.  He understands tt whenever I give in, it's cosh I love him &amp; appreciates the gesture.

Jews are particular about jewish origin - mom must be a rightfully born jew to beget a jewish child.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Caramon,<br><br>Seriously, do u think all foreign brides dedicate their lives to their families?  And do they all do it due to love?  Wat's wrong wif SGrean women who wanna work &amp; contribute to household expenses?  And wat makes u think they're any less dedicated to their families?<br><br>Are u totally convinced tt it's only the local women who care abt social status?  I can think of worse.  And r u sure tt SG men r only looking for women to love them, or r they looking for a wifey they can boast abt?  I noe many SG guys who're chasing after "social status" too.<br><br>It's oso Not degrading for a man to peel prawns for his wifey.  In fact, it probably differentiates him from the petty-minded guys who feel it's their RIGHT to demand their wifeys be subservient to them.  It shows his love &amp; dedication to his family members too.<br><br>However, it's ur choice, of cosh.  Nobody's forcing u to take on a local &amp; capable woman.  If u wan a free servant, then by all means, choose as u will.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by caramon:</div><div class="quote_body">The fact that a foreign bride is ready to dedicate her life to her family (ie her husband and her family) is already an indicator that those foreign bride is of a higher social status than most singaporean women..<br><br>It's pretty obvious that local women care only about "social status"..

Anyway what has dedication to the family got to do with social status?

The guy will also have to peel the prawn for the lady. The problem is that the guys who complain are the ones who want the woman to peel prawns for them only.</div>
