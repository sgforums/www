            <div class='col-md body'>Hello again pple. This chapter may be the longest yet. Thnx 4 reading. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Chapter 6: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Bizarre Love Triangle. </span><br><br>The following dayÂ…<br><br>The moment I woke up, thoughts of last night automatically pieced together like jigsaw puzzles in my mind. I felt positively charged for today, or rather tonight. I checked my handphone for messages. I received one from Matt, apparently he wanted me to give him a call to update him about the previous night. The other was from Mint, it was a good morning greeting. I beamed with pride, and saved it. I picked up the phone to call Matt.<br><br>"Hello Matt." I greeted cheerily.<br>"Hey buddy. So what's the good news?" Matt spoke eagerly.<br>I then related the details to him.<br>"Wow, awesome night eh?" He gasped in surprise. "But are you ready for tonight?"<br>I wasn't too sure of myself, but I said yes.<br>"Oh yeah, don't go empty handed leh. Buy a present or something."<br>"Buy a present?" I echoed.<br>"But what can I buy for her?" I said, scratching my head.<br>"I don't know. Girls luurrrve surprises." He said trying to emphasise his point.<br>By now I was cracking my head trying to come up with something.<br>"You gotta take initiative also what. Don't hang around expecting her to reveal her feelings for you." His words struck a chord in my heart. It made sense after all.<br>"Thanks. I owe you one." With that I hung up.<br>Next, I set my brain on search mode...<br><br>For the next hour or so, I rummaged through my cupboard looking for something presentable to wear. It took me a long time trying to even decide what to wear. I'm going to look my best, I told myself. Ah, some cologne would do just nice.<br><br>Eventually, I arrived at Mint's place on time. I got ready my bouquet of roses and rang the doorbell. I wasn't sure what her reaction would be, but I certainly hoped it'll be good.<br>Even though I was quite acquainted with Mint, my heart still skipped the occasional beat. Just holding this bouquet reminds me of my cousin's wedding some months back.<br>I still recall how the guys got stuck at the door of the bride's (my cousin) flat, having to cater to the whims and fancies of the bridesmaids before the groom and was even allowed to enter the flat.<br><br>I could hear the faint sound of chatter and laughter coming from behind the door.<br>I heard the shuffling of feet, then the door opened. It was Mint, she looked different, perhaps it's because her hair is tied up, elegant as ever.<br><br>"Hello." I cooed pleasantly. Her eyes were fixed on the bouquet.<br>"Hi. Been waiting long?" She asked.<br>"Nope. Anyway this is for you." I handed her the flowers. A smile spread across her beautiful face. I was pleased she liked it. Anyhow, no matter the price paid it's worth it, as long as it's done willingly for that special someone.<br>"Thanks Clint. This way please." She gestured as if I was a distinguished guest. She gave me an amused look, I smiled.<br><br>The thing that caught my attention was the interior design of her home. I gasped in awe. It was gorgeous! It looked like those dream homes. Well, her home is a condo after all. A piano in one corner, a plasma TV and an inviting looking sofa greeted me on entrance.<br><br>The flooring was a glossy parquet one, it felt almost warm to touch. A wall mounted light attached added extra atmosphere to the place. A chandelier hung from the ceiling of the living room, coupled with the soothing sound of a mock waterfall in the corner, this place gave me a warm cosy feeling.<br><br>I noticed that Mint was wearing a pair of shorts, this brought her legs to my attention. I let my fantasies frolick back and forth in my mind awhile. Wait a minute, I jammed the brakes, this isn't right, I shouldn't be harbouring such thoughts in the first place...Too late, I already let the little devils come out and play. I'm guilty as charged. My train of thoughts was interrupted in time by Mint.<br><br>"Let me introduce you to my friends." Mint led me by the arm. I was surprised by her gesture, but I played along.<br><br>When I took a glance at her friends, I instantly recognised the two girls, they were also at the pool hall last night. The more reserved and quiet one was Ruby. She was tall and slim, quite a cutie. The other was Pepper, she wore funky red framed spectacles and her hair was dyed copper brown. Among the two, she looked like the one who was more apt to do crazy things.<br><br>And there were also 2 other guys. Ace was your average looking guy with spiky hair, however his attitude impressed me most. He was a lively person and kept cracking jokes he was also the friendliest among them. It was almost as if we were old friends, because we seemed to get on pretty well.<br><br>Lastly, there was Luis. I don't know why, but my first impression of him just wasn't good. To me, he seemed like a rival in love. He seemed to be showering Mint with much attention. Argh, a wolf in sheep's clothing, wonder how to get rid of him? I got to find a way to score points with Mint and not lose to this creep.<br>Jealousy coursed through my veins, poisoning my mind with corrupt thoughts.<br><br>"How long have you known them for?" I whispered into Mint's ear.<br>"Oh, aboutÂ…" She began counting with her fingers. "About 8 years?" My eyes widened in amazement, now that's long.<br>"Since secondary school till now. Don't worry lah, they're very nice people." She assured me. And I was afraid of feeling left out.<br><br>My nose caught the aroma of cooked food coming from the kitchen. Smells likeÂ…<br>"Hey guys! Time to eat." Luis yelled from the kitchen in his American-accented voice.<br>Ah, steamboat, haven't had one in a long time. Everyone talked and joked about many things, it was a fine time. I was only half enjoying the fun, thanks to Mr. Nice Guy. I just couldn't stand the way he treated Mint. As the Chinese put it: angry until full already (direct translation), qi dou qi bao le.<br><br>"Clint." Pepper waved her hand in front of my face. "Why you look so stun like that?" I wasn't in much of a mood by now. I merely gave a weak smile and shook my head.<br>"I'm fine."<br><br>Yup, that's it for now, more to come.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry to keep you guys waiting so long everytime.Cracking brain to come up with some ideas ain't easy.So pls bear with it.Thanks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Chapter 7:<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Revelation</span><br><br>As we cleared away the dishes, I decided to help Mint with the washing up.<br>"So what's with the dazed look?" Mint asked as she rinsed a plate. I was taken aback by her question.<br><br>A dish slipped from my grasp. It crashed to the floor with a screeching smash. Ruby dashed into the kitchen, greeted by pieces of broken glass. Stunned, all I could do was stand there.<br>My ears flushed red when I realised the mess I had created.<br><br>"Are you alright?" Ruby asked with concern.<br>"IÂ…I'm fine" I stammered, slowly regaining my composure.<br>"Why don't you take a rest after clearing up, I'll help you with the dishes." She soothed.<br>I muttered my thanks before retreating quickly.<br><br>After cleaning up, I went to the living room, the expression on the others faces I will not forget. I'm sure that Luis gave me a sneering look. While the rest looked with concern.<br><br>I slumped down onto the sofa feeling disheartened. Ace tried cheering me up.<br>"Hey, relax lah. It's not the end of the world yet man." He nudged me. I wasn't really in much of a mood to talk. He continued.<br>"Come on, you won't look handsome if you carry such a gloomy look right? You should loosened up alittle." His words lifted my spirits abit.<br><br>Ace beckoned to me to join him in having a game of Winning Eleven. I trudged over to have a go. In fact, I wasn't really in much of a mood but played anyway. It diverted my attention away from the problem. Soon I forgot all about my discomfort.<br><br>Later, he suggested that we gather the others to play 'Truth or Dare'.<br>I watched safely from my 'haven' as some of us were made to do ridiculous poses or actions, prompting laughter and teasing. While some of us were made to reveal our darkest secrets.<br><br>Finally, my turn came, I decided to choose 'truth'. Pepper was the one who shot the question across. She seemed well prepared for this one. I suspected that the 3 girls probably thought this one up.<br><br>"Ok, the question goes like this." She began mysteriously, suspense lingering for a few seconds. "Among the 3 of us, who do you fancy, and why?" She gestured pointing to Mint, Ruby and herself.<br>I held my breath as she ended. My lips parted slightly in shock. Should I speak my mind? Should I twist the truth? Oh my goodness, this must be some kind of sick joke. It was clear that Pepper knew whom I liked and she was just trying to get things under the light.<br><br>I could also easily get away with a lie. But I'd rather see this as a chance for me to show my feelings for Mint. I thought that I could drop a hint or two, as she was sitted on my right.<br><br>"She's sitting on my right." I blurted out. Pepper was quick to respond.<br>"So it's Mint!"<br>Mint snapped into action, facial expression changing from curious to awkward.<br>"Ok, so tell us what you like about her?" As if things were getting any better, now this. I braced myself and spoke without delay, this time, the words came smooth and easy. Words spoken from the heart needs no pondering.<br><br>One revelation after the other flowed forth.<br>"Because she's charming, lively, cute and errr...pretty." I listed it in a single breath.<br>Ace gave me a thumbs up sign while Pepper and Ruby winked at me. As for Luis, he remained unmoved by it and sat there like nothing had happened at all. Mint was looking at the floor, maybe she's trying to avoid eye contact with me? All this time, my heart raced, till now even as I think of what I would say to Mint later on.<br><br>As we continued playing, it just felt different than before. Mint and I hardly spoke. Until it was time for us to leave.<br>All of us bundled out of her home, including Mint. We headed towards the nearest bus stop. We weren't exactly walking together as a group. The 2 guys were behind, while I was beside Ruby and Pepper who were happily chatting about shopping and stuff. I noticed Mint walking alone in front.<br><br>I was deep in thought, at the prospect of going steady with Mint. Slowly, the past raked up within me.<br><br>I still remember Eve initiating the break up that very day. From that point on, I was wary of 2 things, relationships and commitment.<br>She stated reasons like, "I'm not good enough for you" and a whole lot of other reasons.<br><br>Deep inside, I was scared that this scene would replay itself in the present situation if Mint and I were to enter a relationship. It cut like a knife, I recall those vivid images of Eve's sad face. Was it something I lacked or maybe it's a bad habit. Whatever it was, Eve stuck stubbornly to her reasons. She gave me a peck on the cheek and we parted waysÂ…<br><br>Days later, she revealed her reasons via SMS. Apparently, her family was migrating to Australia and she didn't want me to worry about her. Before ending the message, she also said that she'd love me always.<br>It took me months to get over it, eventually when I had fully recovered, another gem came along, by the name of Mint. These emotional scars are still with me, perhaps there is a way to overcome them? Suddenly, I jolted back to reality as Ruby spoke up.<br><br>"Clint, go accompany Mint lah." She encouraged.<br>"Yeah, you have our support." Pepper chipped in. Their kind words were pleasant to the ears.<br>"But..." Before I could finish Ruby interrupted me.<br>"Aiya, no buts." She said. "It's either you go or you don't. I can tell she's confused right now. You got to show your sincerity."<br>"How do you know?" I asked.<br>"Of course we do." Pepper said, cocking her head to one side confidently. "Mint's like our sister. Whenever one of us is like this, we can sense it." Ruby nodded in agreement.<br><br>Not much of a logic in her explanation. Maybe it's what people call 'a woman's intuition.'<br><br>"Go lah." They said in unison. Before I could react, they gave me a timely shove and I was beside MintÂ…<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
