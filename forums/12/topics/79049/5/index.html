I asked.<br>"No, it's nothing." She shook her head. At that instant, I knew that there was something, but she just didn't want to tell me. I turned back to look at the 2 girls. They gestured to me to talk to Mint somemore.<br><br>"Thanks for inviting me tonight." I said, trying to get her attention onto something else. She looked at me and smiled.<br>"You're welcome." She said in a soft voice. I decided to take this as the topic to divert her mind away.<br>"Your friends have been very nice to me." I complimented. "Especially, the girls." At the sound of this, Mint shot a petrifying glare at me.<br>It could have turned even the bravest of guys to stone. Obviously I had said something wrong. But I was clueless as to what.<br><br>"ErrÂ…" I struggled to remedy the situation.<br>"If you like them so much, why don't you go talk to them instead?" Mint's outburst shocked my senses. Luckily, the others didn't hear her.<br>"I...I'm sorry Mint. I didn't mean it that way." I tried to appease her. She didn't say anything.<br>"I mean I treat them as friends only." I explained. "Please don't get me wrong."<br>At this, she cooled down.<br><br>"Could you leave me alone for awhile? I just need to take some time off." She mumbled. I nodded and left to join the others.<br>Compared to yesterday, today shows a completely different side of her. Can't help but wonder why can't we be ourselves like yesterday?<br><br>By now, everyone including the guys had crowded round me to get my 'live' report. Slowly, in bits and pieces I related what had just happened.<br><br>"She's jealous?" Ace wondered aloud.<br>"But why?" Luis questioned.<br>"This question is best left to the pros." Ace concluded and turned to the girls. All eyes turned to Pepper; she seemed to have alot of experience in relationships.<br>"The reason why she's behaving like that." She said after thinking abit. "Is because she has feelings for you. After all, if you mean nothing to her, why would she be so agitated over such a small matter?" Her question left me contemplating awhile.<br><br>"Come on man! You got to get a slice of the pie, a piece of the meat, a...a." His voice began trailing off,  as everybody glared at him.<br>"Heh heh." He laughed sheepishly. "Just a joke. Don't take it so seriously."<br><br>Each person offered advice, encouragement and told me more about Mint's character. Luis even surprised me by encouraging me. Perhaps I had been wrong about him all this while? Guilt began creeping in slowly, as I realised that I had misunderstood him all along. Perhaps he treats Mint like a sister only?<br><br>By then, we had already reached the bus stop. I watched as each of them, boarded their buses. Leaving only Mint and I left.<br><br>My bus screeched to a halt 5 minutes later. I took a last wistful glance at her.<br><br>As Mint walked off, I turned to board the bus. Suddenly, I heard a cry.<br>"Ouch!" She laid on the ground, clutching her ankle and wincing in pain. I whirled around and rushed over to her side.<br><br>"Are you ok?" I spoke gently, bending on one knee.<br>"I think I just sprained my ankle." She moaned. "Tripped over that stupid rock."<br>"You better see a doctor." I advised.<br>"But I can't walk." I really sympathised with her. So I offered to carry her piggyback. (Remember chapter 4?)<br><br>I gestured to her to climb on.<br>"Err...I think I can manage." She said, looking shyly at me. Obviously she couldn't manage right?<br>"Aiya, it's going to get worse if you don't let me take you to see a doctor." Finally, she relented. I felt sheer exhilaration energise me. This is the first time I'm this close to Mint. Better not get any funny ideas, I told myself.<br><br>There was a 24-hour clinic nearby. As it was getting late, naturally there weren't many patients. As I sat down to wait for her, I began recollecting her friends' encouragement, Eve, and everything else that had happened.<br><br>I thought it through and decided that it was time to let go and move on. Why cling onto something of the past? I should be living for tomorrow, not for yesterday.<br><br>But will I able to muster up the courage to tell Mint I like her?<br><br>15 minutes later, the door swung open and Mint came out looking positively better, her ankle was bandaged and she had difficulty walking. After taking some medication, I offered to see or rather carry her home.<br><br>"I was thinking about the game just now Clint." Mint said, while we were halfway home. "All the things you said, did you mean it?"<br>This question came even more suddenly than I had expected. As her hand was neatly placed over my chest, I wondered if she could feel my heart beating faster than ever.<br>What will happen if I tell her my heart's desire? Will I get rejected? I mentally prepared myself for rejection, and prayed for success. I braced myself and made my intentions clear.<br><br>"Yes." I spoke trying to stay calm. "It comes from the heart." By now, I was sure she could feel my heart racing. Her grip tightened after I had told her my feelings. She propped her chin on my shoulder and whispered into my ear.<br>"Me too." My eyes widened in disbelief. The feeling is mutual? I couldn't believe my ears. A wide smile spread across my face.<br><br>We basked in the warm light of each other's newfound companionship, whispering sweet nothings, as I trudged along.<br><br>Just then I realised that I had missed the last bus.<br>"I thinkÂ… I just missed the last bus home." I said slowly. Mint chuckled at my blur expression.<br>"Why don't you stay over at my house?" Without hesitating I quickly say yes.<br>"Would your parents mind?" I asked.<br>"Nah, they don't even know, because they're overseas." She revealed.<br><br>Maybe I should have headed to 7-Eleven to buy that thingy...who knows, maybe we'll... Hey! I had to consciously stop myself from thinking so far ahead.<br><br>"I know what are you thinking of." Mint teased. What the?! How did she know what's up my mind? A woman's intuition?<br>"Sorry." I apologised. She simply gave me a light knock on the head and laughed it off.<br>"Hey you're pretty heavy." I remarked, panting under the weight.<br>"Then hurry up and let's get home!" She ruffled up my hair while I walked on helplessly. She grinned at my new hairstyle.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
