            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry I took so long to post. Euro fever caught up wiv me so had to take mc  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> Anyway, here goes the next chapter.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">Chapter 9: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Just The Two of Us </span><br><br>"So where do I sleep tonight?" I asked innocently. Mint looked at me and frowned, as if it wasn't obvious enough.<br>"In my room..." Her voice trailed. "Not!" She laughed at my stunned expression.<br>"You can use my brother's room for the night. He won't be back until tomorrow." I was glad that at least I didn't have to sleep on the sofa.<br><br>After freshening up, we cuddled together to catch a horror movie. I loved the way Mint got so excited just to watch one, but at the same time, it was hilarious when she got so timid. When the suspenseful part came on, she gripped my arm so tightly, I could feel my blood draining.<br><br>I recall watching horror movies with my elder brother when I was small and I'll hide behind the pillow when the gory scenes came.<br>I'd go weak in the knees whenever I saw pools of blood in the show. My brother would just tease me for been such a baby.<br><br>The next morningÂ…<br><br>OK, don't think for a moment that we did 'it'. Nothing of that sort happened. If you know what 'it' means.<br><br>A whiff of fried eggs stirred me up, walking slightly unsteadily, quite exhausted from last night.<br>I made my way to the kitchen. It was Mint. She was up early. She was decked in an apron, her hair was neatly tied up. Your typical housewife, I chuckled at that passing thought.<br><br>As we settled down to eat, I could sense that Mint wasn't herself even though she looked and behaved perfectly fine. It was as if something was troubling her.<br><br>"How did you learn to cook?" I asked, mouth half full.<br>"Oh, my dad taught me abit here and there. It's nothing much lah. Just simple dishes." She replied modestly.<br>"There's something on the side of your mouth." Mint smiled, I must have looked very silly with a morsel of food on my face. She took a piece of tissue and wiped it off gently.<br><br>After that, I collected my belongings and prepared to leave her home. As I stood by the doorway, without saying much she thrust an envelope into my hands.<br><br>"Don't read it until you leave." She said solemnly. Curiosity was killing me by now, as we chatted abit more before I left.<br>Whatever this envelope contained, I doubt it was good news. As a little saying goes, "No news is good news."<br><br>When I entered the lift, I tore open the envelope hastily, in the process almost ripping its contents. It was a letter.<br><br>Dear Clint,<br><br>It took me alot of thinking last night before I've decided to tell you that I'm leaving in 3 days. Please don't blame me for not telling you face to face. I didn't know how to break the news to you that's why I'm writing this letter. My mum wants me to study abroad. She has already enrolled me in a university in Australia.<br>It's not only because of that reason I'm leaving, my family is also there, so I think it would be best for me and my family if I moved there.<br>I'm really sorry to disappoint you Clint. But I think that our relationship cannot continue any further. I really like you alot, but circumstances do not allow us to be together for long.<br>I realised that you have a life of your own to lead, do not waste it on me. Neither convince me to stay, nor wait for me, for there are much better girls out there waiting for you. I'm sorry if I have led you to misunderstand me in any way. I really treasure the times we spent together.<br><br>Love always,<br>Mint.<br><br>My heart sank when I'd finished reading it. The feeling was indescribable. A tide of emotions hit me wave after wave. A cloud of despair. The agony of sadness. The pain of misery. Surely, Mint did not mean to leave me just like that did she?<br>I felt so lost, that I didn't know whether to head back up or to just take this lying down. I took a seat at a bench to think about it.<br><br>All this while, I had worked so hard to get to know her, and now this has to happen? This isn't fair! Not after all the fear and procrastination I had to overcome. I was determined not to give up on Mint.<br><br>I rang the doorbell and waited impatiently. After awhile, no one answered the door. Strange, isn't Mint supposed to be at home?<br>I pressed my ear to the door and listened intently for any activity. I could hear a sobbing sound coming from behind the door.<br><br>"Mint? Is that you?" I knocked on the door. "If there's anything, can we talk after you open up?"<br>"G...Go home. Don't bother yourself with me." She choked in between tears.<br>"No." I replied adamantly.<br>"Just go." Her voice sounded shaky.<br>"I know how you feel. But we got to give each other a chance." I said.<br>"It's no use." She said disheartenedly. "My mum is a very insistent person, we won't be able to change her mind."<br>"Can we just talk when you open up first?" I reasoned.<br><br>Slowly, the door creaked open. And there she was her eyes red from the crying. Tears rolled down her beautiful face, I felt my heart softened at the sight of it. I went up to her and gave her a reassuring hug.<br><br>"It's ok Mint. Calm down." I soothed. "We're in this together, and we'll bear anything that comes...together."<br><br>I managed to convince Mint to try talking to her mum. After all, I don't believe that her mum would be that unreasonable. I was really worried that our efforts would be in vain. I had to try my best to think positive, not like it guaranteed success, at least it offered us the best chances of success.<br><br>"My parents will be back later to check up on me. See whether I've packed up and ready to leave." Mint said, while looking at an empty luggage bag.<br>"Then, it's your only chance to explain everything." I said. She simply nodded, eyes fixed on a brochure of her university.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

After all, it's not like everybody gets the chance to attend university. If I convinced her to stay, I'll be happy, but at the same time guilty.<br>If she left, I can only hope she succeeds in her studies, but I'll feel sad. So you see, I have to make a very difficult choice here.<br><br>I heard the ringing sound of keys, my heart jumped for a moment thinking it was Mint's parents. But it turned to be her brother instead, what a scare.<br>Her brother was probably in his late 20's. He was a well-mannered, bespectacled guy.<br>"Hi." I smiled at her brother.<br>"Oh hello, you must be Mint's boyfriend." He extended his hand to shake mine.<br>"Yeah, that's right." I beamed proudly at my newfound status.<br>"My little sis has told me all about you." He put his hand on Mint's shoulder. "Quite an interesting encounter you guys had."<br>"Come to think of it, I never imagined things would turn out like this." I replied, rubbing my chin thoughtfully.<br>"Well, take care of my baby sis for me. You know she gets kind of pesky sometimes." He said softly as he walked past me.<br>"Hey! I heard that." She gave a slap on her brother's back.<br>"Ouch." He tried fending off Mint repeated advances. "Ok, ok you win. I'll buy dinner tonight." He relented.<br>"That's better." Mint smiled triumphantly.<br><br>We waited uneasily for about an hour, before her parents came back. Mint let out a sigh, I didn't have to ask what was it for.<br>Probably the burden of trying to sway her parents over to her side.<br><br>"Hi mum, hi dad." Mint greeted her parents. They looked pretty much like busy people to me, the formal attire and all. I greeted her parents, I got a cold stare from her mum, while I received a warm smile from her dad. How odd, hot and cold.<br>"Have you prepared everything yet?" Her mum reminded her. Mint gave me a sideways glance, I nodded.<br>"Err...can we talk about my studies?" Mint started, unsure of herself.<br>"Ok, what about it?" Her dad chipped in.<br>"Can I attend a local university instead of going overÂ…" Her voice trailed off when she saw her mum's face seethe with rage. It was an obvious no coming from her.<br><br>"I think Mint's old enough to decide for herself." Her dad turned to Mint. She quickly nodded in agreement.<br><br>"Why don't we hear what they have to say?" Her brother cut in. Mint gave me a nudge. That was my cue to speak up.<br>"I think that you should allow Mint to make her own decisions." I said. "If you really wish for her to be happy, forcing her to do things against her will isn't right."<br><br>"I disagree." The 'empress' spoke up firmly, rising from her seat. "A overseas degree is still better than a local one."<br>"But mum!" Mint pleaded. It became clear to me that mother and daughter had quite a strained relationship.<br>"No buts! My say is final."<br>"Can you please respect my wishes like dad?" She retorted.<br>"Oh, so you've grown up huh? Can do as you please." Her mum replied sarcastically. Tension filled the air, as I stood there not wanting to meddle in family affairs.<br><br>"It must be this boyfriend of yours who's influencing you." She pointed a finger at me accusingly.<br>"Look, don't get Clint involved ok?" Mint flared up. "I think I deserve some right to make my own choices. If dad is willing to accommodate me why can't you?"<br>"I'm doing this for your own good." Her mum replied.<br>"For my own good?" Scoffed Mint, head turning to another direction. "Speak for yourself." Came the defiant reply.<br>"Come on Clint." She grabbed my hand. "Let's get out of here, I've got nothing more to say to her."<br>"Fine, once you step out of this house, don't expect to come back again!" Her mum screamed from behind.<br><br>It seemed like eternity for the lift to reach the first floor. I kept silent, for fear of saying the wrong things. And possibly agitating Mint further. As the lift door opened, she walked over to the nearest bench and plonked herself there. Not a single word exchanged. I decided it would be best if I left her to her own thoughts for awhile. After about 10 minutes, I couldn't contain myself, I had to say something.<br><br>"Hey, are you alright?" I said. She wiped away the tears from her eyes.<br>"Don't worry, I'm ok." She replied.<br>I can't help but wonder why people always say that they're fine, when in fact they are not.<br>"I don't think I'm going back home today." She said somewhat sore from her scolding.<br>"You could come over to my place." I offered.<br>"That wouldn't be very nice..." She said.<br>"What?" I was surprised by her reply. "Aiya never mind lah. You're my girlfriend, can't expect me to just leave you right?" I remarked casually.<br>"Thanks." She held my hand tightly, as a sign of assurance perhaps.<br><br>I thought about how my family would take to Mint. My older brother and my little sister would probably welcome her. As for my parents...status unknown. I didn't want her to feel out of place either. As a little saying goes "treat others, as you would like them to treat you."<br><br>I promise myself that I would never let Mint slip through my fingers. Never like Eve did.<br><br>"My mum's a great cook, she would be more than willing to meet her future daughter-in-law." I joked. She gave a pleasant smile.<br>"Who's your mum's daughter-in-law." Mint feigned ignorance.<br>"None other than you darling." I replied. She nudged me in the side, sending me reeling.<br>"Well? What are we waiting for?" Coolly, she sauntered ahead of me, as I recovered from the tickling sensationÂ…<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
