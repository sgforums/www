            <div class='col-md body'>At least u guys didn't have to wait for 8 days. Anyway read on to find out. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Chapter 11:<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Black Dream.</span><br><br>I had my hands full trying to fill everyone in on the reason behind Mint's 'surprise' visit. Lucky for her, my family was accommodating. Especially Kate, my little sis, she hit off with Mint as if they were old pals. Never mind the age gap, Kate took to Mint like she was the elder sister. Even I was surprised by their display of affection for each other.<br><br>Usually I would treat Kate like a pest, full of questions. Her curiosity drove me crazy sometimes. But Mint's patience was commendable, indeed she had a special way with children. Perhaps they just have an affinity for each other.<br><br>Coincidentally, the both had a common passion, the colour pink. They could chat non-stop about it, practically getting lost in a world of their own.<br><br>During dinner, Mint was treated like the guest of honour. She had her plate full of ingredients, thanks to my mum. Much attention was showered on her. Even my dad, who usually doesn't have much to say, joined in the conversation.<br>Overall, I was proud. Proud of my family and Mint, due to the fact that they got along so well. Just like that, good rapport was established over a simple dinner.<br><br>It was decided that Mint would share a room with Kate. I went over to help them with the tidying up. The soothing smell of peach awaken my senses as I stepped into her room. I sighed as I took out a fresh bedsheet, pink again. Furthermore, it was a 'Hello Kitty' one. I was getting quite sick of this colour, honestly it made me feel nauseous. After doing my part, I made a hasty exit.<br>I wonder what Ma thinks of Mint? I saw my mum hanging up the clothes to dry, and went over to ask her.<br>"Ma, what do you think of Mint?" I asked out of the blue. Looking at me for a few moments, she paused to think.<br>"Very polite." She said.<br>"Just that?" In my eagerness to know, I didn't allow her to continue.<br>"Wait, still got more." She interrupted. "She's quite a nice person, sweet smile, friendly personality. I liked the way she offered to help me with the dishes. It shows her caring attitude."<br>Wow, I was taken aback by her warm response. Just then a thought crossed my mind.<br><br>"Then wouldn't you like her to be your daughter-in-law?" A mischievous smile spread across my face. My mum looked at me with raised eyebrows.<br>"But of course my dear." She nodded her head in affirmation. "So when can I start to carry my grandchildren? She joked.<br>"Hopefully lah." I replied smiling. "But you're not serious are you?" My mum merely gave a smile, leaving me stumped. Was that a smile of approval? I knew that I was just thinking too far, so I left that idea at the back of my mind.<br><br>As I turned to leave the kitchen, my mum spoke up.<br>"I might consider it." She said.<br>"Really? That's great! Thanks Ma." I gave her a affectionate bear hug and a kiss on the cheek.<br>"And don't go around doing silly things. Things you shouldn't be doing before marriage." She warned.<br><br>I went back to Kate's room to check up on Mint.<br>"Feeling comfortable?" I cuddled up to her. She looked at me awkwardly, at the same time hinting by use of eye contact the presence of Kate.<br>"Yeah. Don't worry the company of your cute sister will be more than I need." Kate smiled her signature megawatt smile.<br>Before leaving, Mint blew a flying kiss at me, which resulted in a flurry of hacking and coughing sounds from Kate. I felt all warm and fuzzy by Mint's unexpected gesture.<br><br>That fateful night, I tossed and turned in bed, my mind was preoccupied with thoughts of Mint. You could say that I worry too much, well who wouldn't? After all that I had gone through, it wasn't easy to simply shut off and don't worry. Many 'what if' questions flooded my thoughts, mainly bordering on the negative. Slowly, my eyes couldn't take it, I closed my eyes and I<br>drifted into dreamland.<br><br>I had the most vividly horrible dream, I dreamt that Mint had left me just like Eve. Never to come back again, the feeling upon opening eyes was too much to bear. Drops of tears rolled down as I regained my composure. Even though it was just a dream, that feeling... it was SO real.<br><br>I remember entering Kate's room to find a note written by Mint. After reading it, my heart sank. Next, I recall rushing all the way to the airport,  I felt so lost at that point of time. Even though I didn't have a clue which flight Mint would be on, I simply walked on. Hoping to at least speak to her one last time.<br>As I turned around, I saw a distinct figure walking away. Even though separated by a glass panel, I was very sure it was Mint!<br><br>She was quite far away from me. As she turned her head, she took a look at me. That look in her eyes, I will never forget. A look of sadness.<br>The next thing I knew, I'm lying on my bed. I shuddered just thinking of the moment of our departing. The sorrow of parting was undeniably real.<br><br>Not fully able to differentiate dreams from reality, I decided to let myself do the judging.<br>As I went over to Kate's room, I saw that the door was half-open. Pushing slightly, I took a peek inside, half expecting my dream to come true.<br>When I saw her on the phone, my fears began to feed on my imagination.<br><br>Who's she talking to? Were the fears in my dream beginning to slowly manifest itself in reality? Surely my dream was trying to warn me of something?<br><br>***NOTE*** This little story of mine draws to a close soon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
