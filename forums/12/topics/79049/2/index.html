            <div class='col-md body'>And so the story goes di da di di da di.... anyways sorry I took soooo damn long.Kindda busy lately. w/o delay, it continues here.<br><br>Chapter 3! :Voice That I Heard On The Phone<br><br>"Hello?" Oh my, Mint sounded sweet on the phone.<br>"Err...." I was almost at a loss for words.<br>"Who's this?" Mint asked from what sounded like a noisy background of cars on the busy street.<br>"This is Clint." I paused to wet my lips. "I found your IC in my wallet and thought maybe our IC's got mixed up while playing pool just now." I said it all in one breath quickly.<br>Mint sounded like she fumbled for awhile before replying, probably looking at my IC.<br>"Oh ya. Clint right? Let's meet outside HMV in an hourÂ…"<br>Before I could reply the line got cut off. I tried calling back but to no avail. Phone network must be very busy on a night like this. Oh well, might as well go meet her. Who knows? Maybe something unexpected might happen.<br><br>Somehow, Mint reminded me of Eve my ex. Ironically, it was also on this day some year's back that I met Eve.<br>Memories of her filled my thoughts; I began to reminisce the days we spent together. To be honest, I'm somewhat cautious of relationships after the one with Eve. Probably because I'm afraid that if I commit myself to one, I won't be able to cope with a break up again if it ever happens.<br><br>I don't know what came over me, but I felt a warm tingling sensation. Could it be love? I wasn't on that frequency for now. I took a glance at my watch. Still early. So I decided to meet up with my friends to hang out until the sacred hour drew near.<br><br>I walked back to the food court feeling more positive than I was before. The guys were crapping as usual and I joined in.<br>"Hey, I managed to call her." I said. "Her name's Mint and we're meeting later on."<br>"Really? That's great bro. Anyway James knows of somewhere we can just sit down and while away the time." Matt declared.<br>Then James spoke up. "Where did you say you were meeting her? Outside HMV right?" He winked at me. "No problem, I know of a spot that is good enough to catch a glimpse of your dream date." I didn't know what to say either it was a good idea or it wasn't. But whatever it was, I wasn't going to let it ruin our night out on Christmas Eve.<br><br>We headed out onto the streets it was really crowded. Everyone will certainly have a smiling face when it's the festive season. I admired the dazzling lights of Orchard Road and wished that it would snow in Singapore. That way, it would make the place look so beautiful like in the movies. We dodged crowds of people before arriving at our spot. It was alittle out of the way from the main street. There were a few couples stealing precious moments away from the crowd. We chose a "scenic" spot and settled down.<br><br>"You're on your own later man." Leon suggested.<br>"Huh? Why?" I protested.<br>"We'll creating an opportunity for you to get to know her better what." Leon gave me a slap on the back, as a form of encouragement. The others nodded in agreement. Somehow I knew that they were right. A thousand 'what ifs' filled my mind. As my friends were chatting away happily, I was deep in thought. They knew exactly how I felt, so they tried talking about their own experiences to give me a rough idea of what to do.<br><br>Soon, the hour was almost up. I stood up shakingly, spurred by the encouragement of my pals; I slowly made my way towards the place, which was a stone's throw away. I was early of course, I was going to give her a good first impression after all. I combed my hair, straightened my posture and evened out the fabric of my shirt before finding a spot to wait. I was so painfully shy that I tried to pick an inconspicuous one. Heck, it's not like she's got sharp teeth and claws. So what was I so afraid of? And it's not like we'll going for a date. Just simply pass her back her IC, get back mine and voila we'll be walking our own ways. This seems simple enough, but actions always contradict my thoughts...<br><br>Stay Tuned 4 more k?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>grimR, just my own opinion:<br><br>the story u are writing would be considered a short story. as in most short storys, each chapter must pack a punch to retain the reader's interest. personally, i feel that the flow of your story is somewhat slow, and lacks ingredient in each chapter.<br><br>for e.g. from chapter 2 to 3 it can be summed by simply clint looking for mint. even at the end of chapter 3, clint still has not gotten to meet mint! i feel that the "meet-up process" doesn't command the space of 2 chapters to depict out.<br><br>thus, to me, each chapter is now like a plate of delicious chicken rice which smells great. however, the plate is filled up mostly with rice and cucumbers, with only one or two pieces of chicken meat. wierd analogy right?<br><br>the above is just my humble opinion. it was never meant to criticize. overall, your effort is still laudable and i look forward to the next chapter  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for yr encouragement guys.Well, here goes the next chapter.<br><br>Chapter 4: Girl You Leave Me Breathless<br><br>I paced nervously up and down and kept looking at my watch. She was late. But that doesn't matter, what's pressing now is that I'm going to be meeting her! Will I say something wrong? Do I look fine? My mind was jumbling up all the positive words I had worked so hard to drill into my thick skull. My eyes darted around hoping to spot her first, but did not see her. I put my hand to my chest to feel my heart rate. Oh boy, it was racing alright. A slight breeze blew and I shivered. It made me feel all the more anxious. From the corner of my eye I could see my friends huddled at a nearby pillar. I relaxed alittle knowing I had their support.<br><br>Then out of the blue, I noticed the familiar figure of the someone I so wanted to see. My eyes were fixed on Mint, I didn't know how to react. My heart beat furiously, my breathing became heavier, I felt so afraid. Come on dude! You can do this! I tried to appear composed, on the surface I looked perfectly fine, but a battle was going on inside of me. Ah, I think I'll just go for it. Well, here goes nothing.<br>I took a deep breath and approached her.<br><br>"Errrm...Hi." I managed to voice the words out. Mint looked at me for a few seconds with a surprised look on her face.<br>"I'm Clint. Nice to meet you." I tried speaking as calmly as I could.<br>"Oh hi." Mint smiled, it set my heart on fire at the sight of it. "You're Clint? Nice to meet you." I simply nodded and smiled. Yes this was it, the first time we made actual eye contact. I felt happy but at the same time kind of awkward.<br>"Where are your friends?" I asked.<br>"I sort of got separated from my friends and the phone network's down." She paused for a breath, while I nodded in acknowledgement.<br>"So I'm wondering if you would mind if I tag along with you?" Mint's question was really unexpected. But how could I refuse?<br>"For you? No problem." I replied with my best smile.<br>"Thanks Clint!" Mint sort of got alittle excited, I don't know why. But I could feel a rush of joy pulsating through my veins too.<br>"But my feet are killing me now, can we go somewhere to rest?"<br><br>Mint's request seemed like a good chance for me to carry her piggyback or something like that, but we've only known each other for like 5 minutes... I decided not to voice out my thoughts. Before we left, I took one last look at my dear friends, James gave me a thumbs up gesture. I wanted to flash a 'victory' gesture back, but I held back my excitement...<br><br>More to come I promise.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
