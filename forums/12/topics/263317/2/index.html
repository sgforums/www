I worry for u if u r going to NS with a gf attached ... &gt;&lt;<br>Haha... Most guy will go sniff sniff when their gf is having mood swings... But in actual fact, when yr gf is having mood swings and she blah blah, it is a good time to understand her character and everything... And of coz, u cant take 100% of what she say into consideration...<br><br>When she rejected a kiss from u, u can always ask her y using body language... Like pretend to be upset.<br><br>When she get pissed off with the fomular book, u can always say " Love gf is bf's duty wat"... And see what she say lor... U dont say anything... it is full stop liao...<br><br>When she hinted u to break off, u can always jokingly ask her y... Errr... maybe, this requires skill lah...<br><br>lol... a female's heart is deep on the bed of the ocean... Very difficult to tells what she is thinking... U have to ask her or communicate with her diplomaticly... Whatever answer she gave u, u have to accept it as her opinion... U cant use yr opinion to judge her love...</div>
