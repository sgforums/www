              <p>The last time I celebrated my birthday with friends
              was anout 5 years ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After that every year my birthday will be like any ordinary day.
              In fact, no one except my parents know that it is my birthday.</p>

              <p>My friends who celebrated my birthday with me 5 years ago were
              my poly friends who have lost contact already. In fact, they
              changed their hp number and did not even bother to tell me until I
              call their hp number than realise that it is no longer in use. When
              I email them asking for their hp number, they did not even
              reply.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And I never even do anything to offend them. Just that after
              poly I went ns while they are girls so they started working. During
              the 2 years we seldom contact because each of us have our own life
              and than they just changed their hp number without telling me.</p>

              <p>My parents although they know its my birthday but they also
              never celebrate. They just give me $200 for birthday present all
              the way until I completed ns and start working than every year they
              don't even give me anything at all.</p>

              yourself and nobody even knows that it is your birthday and that
              day just went by like any other day?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Of course it is not pathetic. You are now considered a grown-up, and you don't see your grandparents celebrating your parents' birthday, do you?</p>
              <p>Join the guys at Club 30, they won't mind you joining them for their outings, and you could try making friends with them.If you got the spare time, you could also go for volunteer work, and make lots of new friends there.</p>
              <p>As for your friends, perhaps they have also changed their e-mail, and thus didn't receive your emails. I know of at least one forummer here who often changes his active email.</p>
              <p>All in all, just start a thread here on your birthday and most of the forummers wil wish you a happy birthday. With no Ang Pao though.</p>

              <p>I definitely find you pathetic.</p>
              <p>You blame your classmates for losing contact with them when you are the one who did not place in effort in the first place.</p>
              <p>You expect people, even your parents to give you something on your birthday when it is supposed to be you who should give them something for bringing you into the world.</p>
              <p>It is not pathetic to spend birthdays alone. Some people actually take it as a blessing to be alone for just that day. But it is pathetic when you actually wanted company but still end up alone cos no one want to spend it with you.</p>

              <p>same here..infact i find that my mum and godparents tend to overemphasize my bday..i dun like parties XD</p>
              <p>but i feel if you want to celebrate ur bday, just let your parents know. its not tough, since they are your parents. as for your poly friends, just forget about them.</p>
