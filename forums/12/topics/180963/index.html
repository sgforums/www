The resemblance of my relationship and yours are quite similar but I don't think its as bad as what yours but nevertheless, from the guy point of view, hope it helps. I don't know about other guys but I don't actually like talking on the phone(with the gf).

At first it affects her, but eventually she had learnt to understand and its no longer an issue.<br>I would be eager to meet my gf too but whenever we met up there's nothing to do. Actually quite a lot to do but because money is an issue, it ends up nothing to do. So its really quite dry everytime we go out. So sometimes I feel that its really a waste of her money and mine if we meet up but nothing to do but at the same time I feel that nothing is a waste of money just to see her face and have her presence is worth so much more than just monetory value. Eventually, I feel that the quote, "Absence makes the heart grows fonder" is really true. So don't hesitate to have a heart to heart talk with him. Talk things out. Do not hold on to the promises he will give you because anyone can promise you anything. Hold on to his willingness to do some adaptations to both your characters and I believe you should to. Characters are hard to change and habits die hard. Do some discussion with him. Might worth a shot.<br>Sorry if I'm long winded.. =p</div>

Do, I just take it from the boyfriend's pov first.<br><br>1) cost of transport, to and fro. Imagine the cab fare from sengkang to Yishun and vice versa<br><br>2) Sports day, activity day. Does your bf do a certain sport or activity? Do you understand it or can try to participate in it?<br><br>3) Lack of communication. You might give him hints, but he might not detect. I know I am one.<br><br>I suggest doing something he likes and enjoys. Also, try not to hint, and do not try to command, what you 2 can do. Like taking a new thing, roller blading for example. Both can learn to fall and fall to learn together if both are noobs.<br><br>Plan to do something. Something interesting that both can enjoy.

            <div class='col-md body'>(1) If you two dunno where to go then you have to shoulder part of the responsibility too.  Even though he is a guy it is not his job to come up with ideas to entertain you all the time.  If the essential thing is to spend time together as a couple, then learn to enjoy doing the mundane stuff or doing nothing together, like just hang out at each other's house and watch tv. That is still better than spending time apart.  After some time it's not possible  for every date to be an exciting one.<br><br>(2)  It is obvious that YOUR definition of "missing-you" actions is different from HIS definition of "missing-you" actions.  Having different definitions is expected when you have two different people - you can't read each other's minds, you're not clones.<br><br>With everything you should try to reach a compromise.  Let him know YOUR definitions and ask that he does some.  But it is also important for you to recognise HIS definitions and appreciate them when he does it his way.<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by smallcloud:</div><div class="quote_body">(1) he tells u the night b4 to wake him up so that he'll be coming over to meet u and so eager to see u etc. but the next day, u 2 duno where to go(no programs), end up he stay home, u stay home.<br><br>(2) he claims he misses u, but juz never seems to comply to your definition of "missing-you" actions.<br><br>how... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote></div>

Maybe both of you can go nowhere but just sit down and have a leisure chat for a while...? Sounds like to me you both lack much communications for a good foundation.... Don't bother about the 'who is right/ who is wrong' thingy.. Just casual talks to speak out each other's minds without a motive to convince the other party or 'win' anything...<br><br>And both of you should really be getting your own lives... Friends...
