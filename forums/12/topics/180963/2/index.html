Even though he is a guy it is not his job to come up with ideas to entertain you all the time.  If the essential thing is to spend time together as a couple, then learn to enjoy doing the mundane stuff or doing nothing together, like just hang out at each other's house and watch tv. That is still better than spending time apart.  After some time it's not possible  for every date to be an exciting one.<br></div></blockquote>i don't mind not doing anything.. i don't mind juz rotting together at home, either of our homes. but usually its the guy who gets bored.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by choco B:</div><div class="quote_body">(2)  It is obvious that YOUR definition of "missing-you" actions is different from HIS definition of "missing-you" actions.  Having different definitions is expected when you have two different people - you can't read each other's minds, you're not clones.<br><br>With everything you should try to reach a compromise.  Let him know YOUR definitions and ask that he does some.  But it is also important for you to recognise HIS definitions and appreciate them when he does it his way.<br></div></blockquote>this i agree. prolly its about mismatched expectations.. will work on that. thanks.<br><br></div>

When she is stressed up or anything, she would love to have me around her, let her hug tight tight like teddy bear... New nick name: Big Bad Bear.. But I can't, cos travelling from kallang to Yishun at 1am is damn bombastic to my wallet.... Emptying every coin that might be needed<br><br>Sadly.. it's really yr bf that is having MAJOR problems. I feel it might be that he is starting to take you for granted. If this goes on, he will really take you for granted, or cease to exist. Might be a good time to start talking about the topics of neglect. I only knew that my gf felt neglected after a lecture from her and my buddies.<br><br>Or, alternately, possible to pass the message to him from a friend? A buddy even? Or the games he play online. Do not drop hints. But start off with a little question and get rolling from there.<br><br>1.5 cents<br><br></div>
