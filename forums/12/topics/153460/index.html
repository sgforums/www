            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with papercut87.............his attitude and behaviour show heck care towards u le so think u shld move on and find much better guys than him loh, no point holding onto him and let this relationship to keep dragging and u will get hurt the most.........seems tat both of u are juz used to each other le or maybe nobody wanna initiate the breakup yet bt actually is very obvious tat he dun wan to put any effort in this relationship anymore le............i believe if a guy treasures and truly loves u, he will spend his time with u and with his family and if there is anything going wrong he will change or try to make amends for neglecting u.........no point being with such guy when the facts tat u feel much happier with ur friends than him loh............i believe one dae u will meet ur right ones............ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
