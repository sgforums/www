            <div class='col-md body'>I wouldn't suggest a break up, but I would ask you to think about your future. Are you willing to spend the rest of your life like this? Because this is how he is, his character is like that. He is the passive kinda guy, kinda selfish too, correct me if i am wrong. If you love him, which i think you are, then you should change your entire lifestyle for him, no choice. But, if you think its not worth the change, then move on and look for someone else who is more suitable to your lifestyle.</div>

What I'm afraid of... Anyway....<br><br>Though he's not those TOTALLY OUTGOING type... He can be 'cultivated' for a more 'outward bound' life-style... Not something to the EXTREMES... But pubbing and such should be quite ok... He just needs a little 'warming up' and persuading in the right way... Try not to reprimand him but instead to let him know how ya feel (as in you wish he could spend more time doing ROMANTIC things together...) etc. He can be quite an understanding and romantic guy by nature. WORK on that.<br><br>And DO NOT express ANGER and SUCH in his face unless it is REALLY NECESSARY... Especially of smaller matters.. Getting him 'SWITCHED OFF' would simply make him turn himself away from you and whatever you're hoping for...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
