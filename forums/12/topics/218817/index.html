            <div class='col-md body'>You may choose to stay with ur mom for this time being after marriage as you may not have the financial capability to get a new apartment. My advice is do get an apartment soon.<br><br>When staying with your mom and wife, do make it clear that your wife is your first priority. And your mother should respect her as your wife, despite how difficult she may find getting along with your wife.<br><br>As the saying goes, when a man and woman are married, they become one flesh. And both shall live together as one. If your mother doesn't take the initiative to accept your wife's faults and all, she doesn't loves you. In short, if she loves and accept you, she'll love and accept your wife. But bear in mind that whatever happens, your wife is still your number one priority above your folks, your friends and your other relatives. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Like children and subordinates, parents needs to be managed too.
