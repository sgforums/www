It seems unlikely that she's pregnant... But do remind your friend again that if he's afraid that he might get his gf pregnant, please take the neccesary precautions.... By the way, 17's not even the legal age for his gf to have sex on her own will....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Regards....</div>
