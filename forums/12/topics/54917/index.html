            <div class='col-md body'>One of my close friend just told me of his problem.. it goes like this.<br><br>His father have been having an affair with a prostitute in Batam. They have already married and the girl is having his baby. Now my friend and his family just got to know when the gal called his mom and told her that she was being forced into the marriage and that his father had been very violent to her. My friend, his brother and mom just confronted him today.. His father is incorrigible and very bad tempered,totally unreasonable. My friend's mom wont accept him into the family already, ask him to go over to batam where he is wanted by the police. His father also admitted to liking the girl there more than his family here. Now he wants to sell the house (4rm hdb). The flat is paid by him but the owners name are his parents. So if they sell the house now what will happen? who will get the money and where will it go? my friend just started work and he is paying by cpf, his parents cpf already depleted.. sometimes pay by cash.. I dunno how to advice him so seeking help her..<br><br>Any kind souls have any advice?</div>

They however should not in any way replace standard legal advice. To clarify matters further, I would suggest your friend go to Legal Aid for a $1 consultation or some other proper channel (there's free legal advice situated in Singapore, though these places can be quite packed.).</span><br><br>By STRAIGHTFORWARD legal means...  The house once sold, the assets should belongs to his parents as the flat belongs to his parents. He can however try to fight for the flat with related documents. The outcome which I would not be certain at all. My GUESS is, his parents would still have the upper hand.<br><br>A few factors to consider. Have the flat been fully paid up? Or is it still on installment support? If the payment for house has not been made, the main factor HDB would consider probably is WHO can afford the rest of the downpayment.<br><br>I'm not quite sure what you meant when you said your friend is paying sometimes by cpf and sometimes by cash? You mean for the flat?<br><br>If your friend's grandparents are not supportive of your friend's father and are willing to, they can try transfering the name of the flat to someone who can support the flat if payment is not made up. Might have slight advantage to the situation.<br><br>Sorry, time's up. Got to logout. Come back to you again some other day?<br><br>~Good luck to your friend?</div>

Its actually retribution to him cos just a year ago, he chased his own father (i.e. my friend's grandfather out of the house accusing him of the very same thing he is guilty of now.. having an affair outside. The accusation is just to blind us from the truth as the grandfather lent him a lot of money to buy flat and now he just wants the father to return some.

Flat payment still ongoing.<br>2. Your friend's father has been paying for the flat before your friend starts work.<br>3. Your friend's father has chased your friend's grandpa out of the house because the latter has accused him of adultery.<br>4. Your friend is currently the sole contributer for the flat.<br><br><strong>Advice :</strong><br><br>Is your friend's grandpa who is being chased out the fresh blood father of your friend's father? From what I can understand, he has been treated quite unkind by his own son. Would he be standing on your friend's side instead of his son's side? If he can, it's a bonus for proceed.<br><br>Little has been mentioned of your friend's grandma. Is she with your friend's grandpa or speaking in defence for her son? You've mentioned that the flat is owned by your friend's grand parents. Current situation would deem favourable to the just mentioned. In case either of the grand parents might decide to side their own son, we need to know who's the primary owner of the flat and who's second in name (if that's the case).<br><br>The case in Batam, has it been confirmed? Not sure about whether the legal forces in Batam can proceed after this case in Singapore. If the answer is 'yes', it's an advantage for your friend and disadvantage for your friend's father. <span style="color: blue;">There're some things which I shall put on HOLD for now.</span><br><br>For now, I shall request of some things from you in return if you want me to proceed further...<br><br>1. Zodiac of your friend.<br>2. Zodiac of your friend's father.<br>3. Zodiac of your friend's mother.<br>4. Zodiac of your friend's grandpa.<br><br>And age or rough age group of the above mentioned for the older individual(s).<br><br>Regards.</div>

Good that we've finally got our facts right. It's funny how you could have actually missed out one of the most important things?<br><br>Since both his grandparents are not around, their zodiac would probably be quite irrelevant for now. But it's an IMPORTANT point. Was it stated in any will who the flat should belong to? Since the last person to pass away was his grandpa and it was a suicidal case, I would expect that he has probably written a will (and likelihood not in favour of his son). He could have given that will a miss too? In that case, your friend's father is indeed not that simple. However, that part of history is beyond our scope of discussion for now.<br><br>The next important point to make, Will or no will, <span style="color: blue;">the flat should now be named under either one person or two</span>... Legally in black and white. That's the important issue. Does your friend knows? He has to find out... Then he can decide what to do next.<br><br>What the lady in Batam told them... Could very well have been a lie. Either that, or your friend's father has managed to work a way out....<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Is your friend's mother still around? </span>I hope she is? You still have not told me their respective age, which can also be quite important..?<br><br>Your friend is probably a WEAK opponent for his father. He himself probably is someone who can be quite feeble minded and quite easily lost in too lengthy a string of thoughts. He might feel that there's so much he wants to do, but ability limited. Probably making him a constant despair. Being at a relatively young age probably make things worse. Important factor is how fast he matures in his life to overcome himself.<br><br>His father on the other hand is more IN CONTROL type of person. His immediate concern now should be to wind up everything and just disappear. He knows very well what he wants and is gonna FIGHT for it. He might has just a slight disadvantage we might be able to make use of.<br><br>But I would need to know the facts to some of the questions mentioned above before I can decide what approach your friend should take? (I would highlight the V. IMPORTANT questions is BLUE)<br><br>Regards.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok maybe i will answer some of the more impt questions first:<br><br>This flat is now owned by 3 names according to hdb, namely my friend's fathes, his mom and himself he just added his name in to pay for the flat using his cpf account (after he started work). So the original 2 owners is my friends parents. they went to seek advice from hdb and the hdb pple say that there is no way that any 2 person can succeed in selling the house.

When they were trying to get the second flat, my friend's dad borrowed a huge some from my friend's granfather (i.e. his own dad) And then never returned the sum, even after repeated attempt from the old man to get some money back to buy some medication. But the father always sidestep the issue and brings back old history abt the grandfather commintting adultery and then eventually abt the same time last year, the grandfather out of desparation attempted to stab him, the case was reported and the old man was forced out of the house.

I think his father is the sort that will lose himself in any logical argument. My friend said that there is no way that the family can get down to discuss things with him and before long his father will rattle onto some very irrelevant topics and sidestep the issue althogether and shift the blame onto someone else. So on that friday nite when they discuss things the father really lost it and got violent and started to make threats. They seldom dare to raise their voice or opinions in the family cos it will just be debunked by the father and so that time was the first time when both sides lost it and got into the major argument.<br><br></div>

The selling of the flat won't take place unless all 3 of them are agreeable to it OR one of them decides to buy over the flat in legal terms. So I don't see an issue with the father wanting to sell the house now?<br><br><strong><br>Yes him mom is also around and has went to apply for a protection order from the family court after his father left home.</strong><br><br>Why the protection order? Was there previous reports of physical abuse on her? Still, you haven't told me... What is his mum's zodiac?<br><br>Since his father is one of the owners of the house, he has every rights to return despite the protection order. UNLESS, he does extreme things to break the order.<br><br><strong><br>My friend is 23, his mom 50 and his dad 49.<br><br>His grandfather was not an owner of the flat, he used to own the first flat and the second one but now the thrid one that they live in my friend's father managed to exclude his name from it.

There shall be no discussions then? I don't see an issue about that? In legal terms, he has no rights to sell the flat. If he decides to resort to threats, there is protection order against him and they (your friend and his mother) can file a police report and issue a warning against him.<br><br>Regards.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote></div>
