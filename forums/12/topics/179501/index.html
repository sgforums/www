My secondary 3 and 4 class was quite small and people there are not so motivated and worst of all, there's nobody in the class i can clique with at all, or simply no friends. at that time my life was quite dull, my social life surrounds my school only so all my friends are limited to people i can find in school. i am not active in ECA also.<br>my friends i got along so well with in sec 1 n 2 found new friends from their class so because we hardly contact due to school work, we kind of slowly lose contact, only say hello at times when we meet along common corridors. i was quite lonely then. go to school really a misery, one whole day need not open mouth to talk to anybody, after school, i will be among the first to take the first bus home. then at home will spend most of my time day dreaming, dreaming of those happy times when i still have a good friends as classmates.<br>it was a really miserable 2 years on the whole and after the O levels, i never contact anyone of my classmate from my secondary school anymore.<br>it i simply a part of my life i want to erase from my memory yet so unforgettable.<br><br>i wonder whether anyone out there has similiar experience?<br>i am a grown up adult now and i think that has to be one big regret of mine, not doing well in my maths for my secondary 2 exam and have to suffer a miserable for 2 years. It was a shame, i could have done well for my maths in sec 2 just that i didn't focus too much attention in maths and science which will enable me to go to a better class.<br><br></div>

I cried really badly when he passed away too.<br><br>how i wish i had your kind of best and most carefree childhood during the years you stayed with your grandfather. I was the complete opposite, i was<br>a torn in the eye of my grandfather. i suffered years of intense verbal assults from him as a kid. everytime he open his mouth to verbally  assult me, it's going to be some really nasty words that rips my pride, moral and sense of self worth apart. think the most nasty things people ever want to hear. everyday live in fear, facing discrimination, humiliated in public, being terrorized<br>. too bad i was a torn in his eyes where as he doted on my brother and sister the way your grandfather doted on you. he is a hot tempered fellow so i was a target punching bag for him to vent his anger and fustration on whenever he feels like it.<br><br>i am not angry with anyone including my grandfather cos everything is in the past. after so many yrs, i am still going for counselling sessions to get over those traumas..<br>well anyway, think those are in the past, we just have to move ahead.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, I've had a wonderful childhood thanks to Granddad : )  He was the centre of my world until I was 16, &amp; I was the apple of his eye.  How I miss him up to this day, &amp; how I wish he could see my own personal achievements!  I never got to share them with him, though when I "visit" him, I'll whisper to him under my breath.  I know it sounds crazy, but to me, Granddad still seems very much alive in my heart.<br><br>I'm sorry to hear of your granddad.  It must've been a traumatic experience for you when the person who's supposed to love you, chooses to demoralise you as a kid instead.  I hope during that period, your grandma &amp; parents were a good support for you.<br><br>Otherwise, the scars may stay for life  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gunyandao:</div><div class="quote_body">you really miss your grandpa dearly.....u must have a very sweet childhood...<br>well, the saddest thing i feel is seeing people dying of pain, suffering from illness and how i wish there's no pain, no illness in this world.<br><br>hmm...for me, my case is really very extraordinary and my situation and what i went through during my childhood is completely different from yours. I don't bear any grudges against my grandfather and have forgiven him. I cried really badly when he passed away too.<br><br>how i wish i had your kind of best and most carefree childhood during the years you stayed with your grandfather. I was the complete opposite, i was<br>a torn in the eye of my grandfather. i suffered years of intense verbal assults from him as a kid. everytime he open his mouth to verbally  assult me, it's going to be some really nasty words that rips my pride, moral and sense of self worth apart. think the most nasty things people ever want to hear. everyday live in fear, facing discrimination, humiliated in public, being terrorized<br>. too bad i was a torn in his eyes where as he doted on my brother and sister the way your grandfather doted on you. he is a hot tempered fellow so i was a target punching bag for him to vent his anger and fustration on whenever he feels like it.<br><br>i am not angry with anyone including my grandfather cos everything is in the past. after so many yrs, i am still going for counselling sessions to get over those traumas..<br>well anyway, think those are in the past, we just have to move ahead.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with you, we all have to learn to accept the death &amp; move on with our lives.  I'm sorry to hear about you Not being able to say goodbye to your mum too.  It's somehow harder to accept deaths where you weren't able to say goodbye...  I can understand how you feel.<br><br>Although I've since moved on with my life, I've just never fully gotten over Granddad's death.

My secondary 3 and 4 class was quite small and people there are not so motivated and worst of all, there's nobody in the class i can clique with at all, or simply no friends. at that time my life was quite dull, my social life surrounds my school only so all my friends are limited to people i can find in school. i am not active in ECA also.<br>my friends i got along so well with in sec 1 n 2 found new friends from their class so because we hardly contact due to school work, we kind of slowly lose contact, only say hello at times when we meet along common corridors. i was quite lonely then. go to school really a misery, one whole day need not open mouth to talk to anybody, after school, i will be among the first to take the first bus home. then at home will spend most of my time day dreaming, dreaming of those happy times when i still have a good friends as classmates.<br>it was a really miserable 2 years on the whole and after the O levels, i never contact anyone of my classmate from my secondary school anymore.<br>it i simply a part of my life i want to erase from my memory yet so unforgettable.<br><br>i wonder whether anyone out there has similiar experience?<br>i am a grown up adult now and i think that has to be one big regret of mine, not doing well in my maths for my secondary 2 exam and have to suffer a miserable for 2 years. It was a shame, i could have done well for my maths in sec 2 just that i didn't focus too much attention in maths and science which will enable me to go to a better class.<br><br></div></blockquote>My dad passed away when i was 18 years old. I became a man of the house as my elder bro was always in camp during NS. Not that i had to support my family financially as my mum was capable of doing so but had to be an emotional pillar for my mum. Probably the most miserable period was the months before he died... see him suffering.</div>
