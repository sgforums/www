How I miss him up to this day, &amp; how I wish he could see my own personal achievements!  I never got to share them with him, though when I "visit" him, I'll whisper to him under my breath.  I know it sounds crazy, but to me, Granddad still seems very much alive in my heart.<br><br>I'm sorry to hear of your granddad.  It must've been a traumatic experience for you when the person who's supposed to love you, chooses to demoralise you as a kid instead.  I hope during that period, your grandma &amp; parents were a good support for you.<br><br>Otherwise, the scars may stay for life  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>FeowFeow<br><br></div></blockquote>hmm...how sweet...he was a great source of motivation in your life indeed..i believe you are a successful and happy individual yourself now and I am very sure that's what he wanted to see.<br><br>as for me, Oh...oh..no...throughout my childhood my parents are not of help<br>at all. they use typical asian methods of bringing up kids on me . they like to use scarcastic remarks on me and pour cold water on me and my mother would just rub salt to wound, in front of relatives, i would once again hear those condemning words. it wasn't at all serious compared to those treatment i received from my grandfather.  as a kid, i never confide in anybody my problems and i am never disclose my problems to my parents because it's no use. i was never close to my parents and i keep everything to myself, i grew up believing this world is cold, dangerous. I was very very quiet as a kid.<br>as a person, psychologically i grew up base on those kinds of words and definition my grandfather and parents used on me.<br>retarded, hopeless, good for nothing, never amount to anything blablabla<br><br>I am an adult now but i have to suffer the horrendous outcome of those traumas<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Very typical of Asian parents during that generation.  And they wonder why Asian people grow up to be less confident than our western counterparts <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  On the 1 hand, they don't encourage, &amp; only know how to put down their own children.<br><br>My parents used to do that, but years later, I finally told them how I felt.  1 had a positive reaction &amp; was understanding.  The other... the less said the better.  Suffice to say, when Granddad died, I lost the 1 person I confided everything in because he would understand the pressure I was under.<br><br>Perhaps 1 day you could tell your parents how they made you feel.  And let them know that under No circumstances are you taking care of them because you're obligated to, because based on how they treated you, they don't deserve it.<br><br>But you're taking care of them because you're a good person.
