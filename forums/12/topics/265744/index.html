            <div class='col-md body'>Treat her <strong>more than a goddess</strong>??  Gawd, no wonder she's dissing you.  Never grovel / lower yourself.  We girls don't like to feel sorry for our guys (aka see them as a Loser), once that happens we lose interest and it's seldom reversible.  Have more self-respect.. mirror her commitment level, maybe dangle a carrot to intrigue her once in a while, but no more.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The girl is rying to test you to see how far she can get from you in that she's trying to determine her own position with you. Give her too much priority and she finds you a wussy. Give her too little significance and she deems that you don't like her enough......... Sigh! Girls do this all the time, don't they?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>I know the temptation to just call it quits since it's only been 1 month and the loss may not be too much to bear. But it's better to face it and deal with it than to run because chances are the next girl in your life will put you through the same kind of shit test.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

However, she hardly use the 'love' word on me anymore. And she's keep getting colder and colder to me, mood swings come easily. Worse, she would sometimes insult me (like how not to her expectations I look) and said that we might be close friends in future, but will not be together to start a family. She also said that I'm not that type of guy she really wanna be with, however, we're still together..<br><br>Dunno why, but I seem to have lost the love from her as well as the respect she once given me. Why is this so? Have I been like caring for her till much that she's taking me for granted? Why do you like to put our relationship on the line so much?<br><br>I really wanna know if she still have got me in her heart. But I dare not ask her directly as I might be seen as doubting her. Any ways too to find out whether she still treats me as her bf or I have been 'demoted' to a normal friend?<br><br>It's really getting more tiring and tiring day by day trying to endure with her attitude towards me. Also, once during her mood swings, she said, "if you dont wanna be with me. Fine. I dont really care anyway." But the next morning, everything was fine.<br><br>And NO, NOT PMS.</div></blockquote>Live one day at a time bah....</div>
