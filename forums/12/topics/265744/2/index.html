Did she use it often when you were courting her? How long was the courtship?<br><br>Might be close friends in the future, but will not be together to start a family?? That is pretty hurtful. This shows a lack of faith in the relationship, a serious lack of faith.</span><br><br><strong>Dunno why, but I seem to have lost the love from her as well as the respect she once given me.

Why do you like to put our relationship on the line so much? </strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">You said (later on)you treated her like a goddess. While its thought that most people would like to be treated like kings or queens, relationships fail very easily is one side is put on a pedestal and 'worshiped'. Things usually start to be one-sided from there.</span><br><br><strong>I really wanna know if she still have got me in her heart. But I dare not ask her directly as I might be seen as doubting her. Any ways too to find out whether she still treats me as her bf or I have been 'demoted' to a normal friend?</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">There's a very big problem. How do you want to solve it? Subtly by yourself? Or put it out in the open and analyze it together with her? The only way to know if you have been demoted is to ask.</span><br><br><strong>It's really getting more tiring and tiring day by day trying to endure with her attitude towards me.

But the next morning, everything was fine.<br><br>And NO, NOT PMS.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Does she have mood swings very often? Or does it manifest itself only when you're together with her? Or when the relationship started? If its the latter, then the relationship is affecting her in ways that you don't know. You need to ask And know what's wrong.<br><br>And please don't worship your girlfriend. Or anyone other than God. It doesn't work that way. Treat them too nice and they'll either walk away or run, or take more and more and run later.</span><br><br>Cheers man, may your relationship problem end soon~<br>Aaron</div>

It's just that she think ahead too much and already thinking about the future break already.<br>She don't want you to love her so deep that when both of you eventually ends, you get hurt a lot.<br><br>But still, you both may carry on.
