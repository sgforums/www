Is he married or working? Maybe your brother is in dire straits financially and he needs the money. Did this happen before or occured only regarding the hp issue? Besides, why would u parents need a hp unless they still work?<br><br>One important point is : Have ur brother been contributing to ur parents from the beginning? Anyway, i think ur the sister and as a sister, i think this dispute should be settled between u and ur brother. Only the females are capable of such temperament  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> So, as a sister, its ur family and moral duty to prevent any arguments from blowing up and thus, creating a rift between ur mum and ur brother. If you have moments when you do get along then you should take one of those moments as an opportunity to tell him how you feel. Let him know that you don't want to argue with him anymore and let him know how it makes you feel when he is unwillling to contribute financially to the house after pains of bringing him up.<br><br>A possible reason is that he may be young and he may not be willing to hear you out. So you will have to use your judgement in deciding when it will be a good time to confront him. Also when you do speak to him don't argue but tell him how you feel. Also, is there anyone else in the family that you both trust who might be able to act as a mediator between the two of you? It might be helpful if you did.<br><br>If all else fails and there is nothing else can do. This may be the last resort. <strong>Warning</strong> <span style="color: red;">This is to be done when they are no other ways other than mediation</span>.  Give him the cold shoulder. Ignore him in any other way. Sooner or later, he will realise how less important he is in this family and how much he needs u all. By now, he would be feeling calm and sassy about the whole situation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Then, u can squeeze any amount of money from him <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well....from my point of view, have you ever discuss with your brother about how both of you are going about to help with the family contributions.

It's no point kicking up a scene, he will get annoyed and feel challenged which makes thing worse. Try to talk to him nicely and get his understanding.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Master -_-:<br><strong><br><br>Dear Thumbup,<br><br>First of all, u never mentioned how old your brother is and his status. Is he married or working? Maybe your brother is in dire straits financially and he needs the money. Did this happen before or occured only regarding the hp issue? Besides, why would u parents need a hp unless they still work?<br><br>One important point is : Have ur brother been contributing to ur parents from the beginning? Anyway, i think ur the sister and as a sister, i think this dispute should be settled between u and ur brother. Only the females are capable of such temperament  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> So, as a sister, its ur family and moral duty to prevent any arguments from blowing up and thus, creating a rift between ur mum and ur brother. If you have moments when you do get along then you should take one of those moments as an opportunity to tell him how you feel. Let him know that you don't want to argue with him anymore and let him know how it makes you feel when he is unwillling to contribute financially to the house after pains of bringing him up.<br><br>A possible reason is that he may be young and he may not be willing to hear you out. So you will have to use your judgement in deciding when it will be a good time to confront him. Also when you do speak to him don't argue but tell him how you feel. Also, is there anyone else in the family that you both trust who might be able to act as a mediator between the two of you? It might be helpful if you did.<br><br>If all else fails and there is nothing else can do. This may be the last resort. [b]Warning</strong> <span style="color: red;">This is to be done when they are no other ways other than mediation</span>.  Give him the cold shoulder. Ignore him in any other way. Sooner or later, he will realise how less important he is in this family and how much he needs u all. By now, he would be feeling calm and sassy about the whole situation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Then, u can squeeze any amount of money from him <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers[/b][/b]</blockquote>really appreciated ur reply..<br>my bro started work a yr b4 me..<br>the yr b4 i started work, he did not contribute at all...he has a good job and is earning more than me...plus he has cleared all his commitments already..no more...he is still single without a gf..no commitments..<br><br>eversince i started work, i feel that as children of my parents, i should at least contribute to the family..altho i am earning much lesser than my bro &amp; have lot of commitments to meet...i am trying to make ends meet...managed to squeeze a little for them...<br><br>i suggested to my bro that he can try contributing more but he refused and decided to contribute to any amount that i am going to contribute..<br>but sad to say, he failed to even contribute to that minimal amount..<br><br>master, this issue has occurred b4...has discreetly made clear to him, his 'role' as the son...i have talked to him nicely before...laid out my feelings to him...tried to let him see the 'light'...<br>but it seems that no matter what i do..how i try...all methods backfired...nothing juz seems to hit into his head...<br><br>no matter what i say, he feels that he is right...and there is always a knot in his heart..he feels that my parents owe him something...that they did not meet up to his expectations in their upbringing for him...<br><br>i know i should have done it discreetly...but i have tried all that i could...<br>i was so sad &amp; boiled over the whole issue that somehow, i feel that my parents shld discipline him...<br><br>anyway, i am the younger one...so no matter what i say to him, i guess there is no weight in it...<br><br>i know i have made my parents sad...somehow i have already laid out the fact to them...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>i kept blaming myself...really dunno what i shld do...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>
