            <div class='col-md body'>I'm very open in expressing myself to my friends. i also frequently message my ger friends 'i luv u' and 'miss u' cos i think that it is very sweet to do so and will also bring our friendship even closer. So i was wondering if this guy is just like me who is also very open in expressing himself.<br>My second doubt is that if he is really interested in me, why din he tell me anything when we are chatting almost every day for so long.<br>I am just worried that i will hurt another guy's heart. But how can i tell him straight that i dun like him when he din even personally tell me that he like me. He only mention those words through messaging.
