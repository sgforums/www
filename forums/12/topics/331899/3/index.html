              <p>State your point and move on, you don't need to convince me and you're not good enough to do so anyway.

              <p>It's so true that SG Guys are not MEN, they can't tolerate other people's opinions and kind criticism. They also can't accept losing/failure in their lives. And this is why it's only a matter of them before they are brought to their knees.</p>
