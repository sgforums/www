              <p>Are you sure you cannot live without sex?</p>
              <p>Objectifying women as sex object is detrimental to both gender as apparent in this thread. Because of this "need" for sex, men are willing to put up with unhealthy tantrums and demands of a woman. Because a woman is being objectified, she is more likely to focus on her physical aspects and beat herself up (not literally) when she soon finds the guy only interested in her body, not as a person. She then gets insecure and hence all the negative emotions are brought up and she feels them to behave in an undesirable way. A relationship starting out based on sexual chemistry only tends to drift further apart as no one dares to open up to truly communicate, as the basis of understanding had not been created and it's much easier to fall back unto physical intimacy. Ironically, the initial sexually-compatible relationship deterioriates and the more focused you're on the sexual aspect of the relationship initially, the less you're going to get in the long run. Any dissatisfaction and conflicts in a relationship should be worked out and it is best to start practising by understanding one another to see if the person is a good fit for you in the first place or not.</p>
              <p>Women are human beings too, and if you treat and respect her like one, you will get what fulfills you, truly.</p>

              <p>Junior, by the looks of your posts to date, you could do an Oscar-winning impersonation of the Pope and not be intellectual.  Just because you stop using one head doesn't mean the other is automatically going to come online.</p>
              <p>By the way, in my doctorate class, most of whom graduated in 2002, 10 out of the 12 of us were actively dating, in serious relationships or married.  You've got much bigger problems than either a surfeit or deficit of sex.</p>

              <p><br>Research could only be done with the necessary knowledge in the field of the research topic. It's basically playing around with the already easily available vast amount of knowledge in a bid to discover new ways of using the existing knowledge for improvement/advancement. So research still relies heavily on the knowledge the researcher have in the field of research. That's why you see researchers are either people who have gain a good amount of exposure/experience in the field or they are the better students in their field of study.</p>

              <p>Ur weakness is not able to live without sex. That alone through sex , will be ur eventual downfall.</p>
              <p>Time management man.. time management. You cant just have women preventing your from achieving greatness. I have decided not long ago to pursue my own interest as i know women, they will be around and plentyful. But not my youth and my precious few years left to achieve what i set out to. You gotta know ur priorities. Maybe u dont know now, but hopefully u will eventually. Girls come and go.</p>
              <p>Since you know that every successful man is a woman behind him, and every downfall of great men was a woman behind it, the question should be, is the woman u have now with u, ur supporter or ur saboteur. Is she stopping u from ur greatness, or is she following in ur foot steps behind u ushering u forward.</p>
              <p>Its extremely difficult to pursue ur own personal interests when u have a partner with you. Your decisions no longer to urself but to both of yous. You choose ur fate . Its in ur hands and u got it by the balls. Carve ur identity out from nothingness , or submit urself to the hands of fate and let carry u to wherever it wishes to drop u off.</p>
