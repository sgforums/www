If you too friendly to people, u scared give people wrong impression. And then u do the avoidance stuff so as not to give the person wrong impression. But the problem is, won't a budding friendship be wasted in this case?<br><br>Sometimes, I just wonder if it is really that hard to make friends with the opposite sex.<br><br>For ur case, I would suggest that u should ask her if she's avoiding u. No use trying to guess what she's thinking. Tell her that u felt that she's avoiding u, and ask if anything's wrong. Assure her that u two are merely friends, nothing more.</div>
