              <p>If you got no luck, your best bet is to learn from your father how he did it.</p>

              <p>Guess to me, its a matter of finding a job tt u like, more than for the money.</p>
              <p>If u develop passion for ur job, even if u are a salaried employee, u will go far, as ur passion differentiates u from the rest of the crowd.</p>
              <p>      F rom there on, u can have 2 choices . The way i see it is tt 1. u can climb the corporate ladder, since u should be outstanding in ur work, be it any field as long as u have passion for the job. However, sometimes situations doesn't help u, for instance, a boss tt simply wants u to die. However much of passion is also useless. But hey, u can then jump to other coys, cos if u are tt outstanding, other pple will headhunt u.</p>
              <p>2. U can obtain watever information u need from ur job, then come out and start ur own coy. Another thing tt i noticed is tt, as long as u like ur job, eg. Teaching, u can still do part-time related to the job, (Tution) which in a sense is another form of business.</p>
              <p><br>Y i focused so much on a job tt u will like is cos, it makes a world of a difference when u smile and go to work and when u curse and swear when u go to work. Be it ur own business or working for others. The productivity level is different, the joy derived is different, ur energy level will also be different. U will accomplish more using lesser energy. Even if let's say u wanna enter into stocks, its the same case. If u like stocks, u will tend to do better in it. Cos to me, stocks is like a part-time job.</p>
              <p>Dun complain tt aiya, $2k for a grad is low. If u choose to NOT depend on ur dad, the qn i will post to u is, where will u get ur start-up captial if u refuse to work for others? Unless u wanna try something with low start-up, like internet related business. Main issue, is juz do something u like, the money will follow.</p>
              <p>And to me, its not how u save tt will make u rich, its how u spend money.</p>

              <p>the three P's - passion + perseverence = possibility. passion - money is nothing without love, without a passion for what you do you'll never put in the effort required to make it, and you'll never be able to enjoy your success. perseverence - you rarely make it big first time. You have to believe in yourself and not give up... wait for the luck and look for the breaks, and if you've put the passion in they'll come.</p>
              <p>Money =/= success though, if you open your mind to life you might find that your idea of success is different to that of your father. Success can be working 9-5 at a grocery store bringing home enough for you and your wife to live just comfortably enough, success can be travelling the world on a shoe-string budget, success can be learning everything to find out you know nothing, and yeah success can be earning more than your neighbour in the next fiscal year. But remember, even if you win that rat race - you're still a rat. make your success what you want it to be.</p>
              <p>Mines being the best damn husband I can be for my wife - taking care of her, loving her, giving her what she needs... never letting her be sad lol Might not be what you think is success but it ticks all the three Ps lol</p>

              <p>You want be be rich and wish to do something you like in uni but dont think the degree you desire will bring in the dollars in future. Well... who says fass graduates cant earn truck loads of cash? It all depends on the amount of work you put into it. J.K Rowling write  books and she is a billionair.</p>

              <p>The person that you shld outdo ... is yourself... not your dad.</p>
              <p>No matter what you choose .. all what you do .... you shld give the best and win yourself.</p>
              <p>In any religion .... nobody will be forsaken ... unless he give up on himself.</p>
              <p>REMember .... this ... you are not your father... When your father started the engineering business... because there was an opportunity for him then and he got the foresight. He overcome the problems and the company was his fruit. He did put in his efforts to have what he owned now... Maybe you are not born when he was having difficulties in his business....  but you are definitely there to share his success.......</p>
              <p>What you must learn is to have foresight experience and connections ... plus failures....</p>
              <p>Dun have foresight .... give you bill gate's microsoft company and wealth .. you also will lose it all.</p>
              <p>Honest advice dun always sound good. </p>
              <p>I think you shld go find an opportunity to work and travel in some sg government websites who support youths to do that. before they turn 27 and youths must be single to qualify for these work and travel opportunity. ( I missed it .. but I will push my children to go in the future and I want my children to have work in macdonald's experiences.. I want them to go through all the sh*t if not they will think they are very miserable  .... Rich man's son illness..... self- pity )</p>
              <p>No one will say that you are stupid.....</p>
              <p>People... those who want to curry favour your dad or try to be on good terms with you ? since they think you will inherit your father business and money...</p>
              <p>Will you go and tell your friend's son ....</p>
              <p>1. you are a <a href="mailto:!@#%24%">!@#$%</a> stupid  fool wake up ur F**kin idea</p>
