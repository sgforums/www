              <p>Okay, I know this really isn't a post of agony. If an average degree holder goes into his specialised field and earns about 2K plus a month, how does he break through this mediocre lifestyle and gets to become rich? Personally, I can't visualise the pathway of becoming rich. Property? Stocks? <br><br>Am I even supposed to be thinking about such stuff when I'm not even working yet.<br><br>So the story goes like this. My dad is relatively wealthy. He owns his own company, and has properties and stuff. How the heck am I supposed to out do him in the future? People always say I'm smarter than my dad, more intelligent and I should be able to be more successful than him. But how do people get rich?</p>
              <p>Education yes. going to university is almost definite for me, probably a local one. I don't even know what to major in. Have no interests. Law and medicine are out (I don't want to study much for Alevels), but a couple of As, and Bs are quite achievavble. I was thinking going into arts or social science. But where does that path lead to? No matter how I look at it, the future looks bleak. My dad runs an engineering business, and since young I have been hopeless in Physics (or D&amp;T in lower sec), though I still take Physics at H2 level. I don't think I want to take over his company. ( no interest ) I have to create my own career myself. <br><br>And if I'm going to settle for arts/social sciences, am I ever going to get rich? I can't see the pathway to get rich. I think I might go for business or something related to finance. But I only see university education as way to pursue my interest. In other words, I want to study something I like, something which I've been passionated about. <br><br>I'm still clueless. If you were wondering, I've always wanted to surpass my dad. I will not want to rely on my dad's money in other aspects (maybe except education). I have 3 siblings which it will be better to leave the money to them. <br><br>Seriously, I cannot visualise my life (and future family) living in a condo, let alone HDB. <br>I want to be rich. I can just take a loan from my dad, open a business, make it successful and then get rich. But I wouldn't want to do so (like I said).</p>
              <p>Or do I have to study up till masters. (if it's something I like, I wouldn't mind). My career choices are all cloudy and undecided. <br><br>After graduating from Uni, I was thinking of being a full time tuition teacher plus piano teacher (by the time I finish NS, uni), I would probably have a diploma or two. And hopefully be able to earn a decent 5-6K per month. Save the money and start my own business after a few years. It certainy beats working very hard for a science/engineering degree and starting work with a low salary for 2K+? <br><br>Would more experienced folks currently in the working world advice me?</p>

              <p>Back to your topic, first of all, I'd congratulate you if you choose to venture out on your own. You'd be one of those 20% in the world who have decided not to follow societal norms to be a salaried employee and work till your last breath.</p>
              <p>That said, life as a self-employed is filled with uncertainty - uncertain income, uncertain prospects, and definitely an uncertain future. Ask yourself if you're willing to rough it out. Are you prepared for all sorts of obstacles along the journey?</p>
              <p>Family support is very important. If your gf/wife is understanding and throws her weight behind you, all the better. But I can say that not many people will agree on your choice in life.</p>
              <p>Surround yourself with like-minded people - professionals who have also decided to follow the route less travelled. Find yourself a mentor, a role-model who can offer sound advice or simply inspiration for you to make your mark.</p>
              <p>A final word of caution - once you've chosen this (lonely) road, don't turn back or regret at all. You have only one life, and hey, you chose to live it <em>your</em> way.</p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>Ways to get rich:</p>
              <p>1) Own a business. (Stocks, property, retail...etc) Stocks are not just numbers you buy, view them as businesses.</p>
              <p>2) Be a minister in Singapore. haha... There lots of million dollar earners in the public service for all your info. eg. permanent secretaries around 100+ walking around, the ones below the minister.</p>
              <p>3) High paid employee. (CEO, CFO...etc)</p>
              <p>4) Inheritance. :D</p>
              <p>5) Struck toto.</p>
              <p>I think 1 is the easiest. :D</p>
              <p>If you say you dont like business, you will never get rich. Everything you see around you are businesses. A normal employee will never get rich. I'm sure there are more things in life other than money. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              count yourself lucky...you've got a very good platform which is your father..rather then starting from scratch, leverage on what is readily available to you, as in your father's business...
              
              since you are supposedly more intelligent than him, you should try to further the company, but remember, intelligence is not the same as having the smarts....learn from him how he draws in money, he's probably the best teacher of wealth you will come across in your life so far....
              
              this is not the same as relying on him, i know many will die for such a chance as yours....always remember this rule, leverage, rule 2 is to look at rule 1...one either leverage on others who can show you the path of success or leverage on money to work for you, i.e invest, invest and invest......if you treasure your situation, you should earn as you learn from your father........as it is said, success is a journey, not the destination..and right now you have the means and the opportunity to undertake that journey.....

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">I can tell u how Mr Sim Wong Hoo the C.E.O of Creative Tech get rich, I can also tell u how Mr Bill Gate the creator of Microsoft get rich but, if u were to follow their foot step doing what they have done then the chances of u getting rich like them are very slim.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">There are certain factor or condition that u need to have to be rich. I can name three of them that I have discover so far and there are, (1) inheriting a huge fortune, (2) gifted with special ability or Talent and (3) u are the lucky star.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Imagine u can inherit the wealth of Bill Gate I think u will be very rich and needless to say how David Beckham got rich, I think u know about it. However, if u doesn’t have the special ability of passing the ball right under the leg of the striker wont make u be as rich as him. Either do u has the luck to hit the first prize of the million dollar lucky draw.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Of cos being poor there are also certain factors which is irreverence to the topic which I will not be discussing. If u doesn’t have the rich factors that I have mentioned above then u are just like the average folks working for a living everyday, just have enough to eat and spend. However, if u have anyone of the factors above, u will become rich, and if u has all the factors above then u will become super rich. </span></p>
