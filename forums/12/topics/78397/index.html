            <div class='col-md body'>This is a story about me &amp; 2 girls, T &amp; B.  We all started off as friends.  T was a very sweet &amp; caring girl with average looks.  We both clicked very well &amp; became very good pals.  B is a very pretty &amp; sweet looking girl.  But too bad, her character doesn't really match well with her good looks.  She's the, sorta childish &amp; short tempered girl.  But I still regard her as a friend.  We 3, we're all friends.<br><br>Not long after I got to know B, I began to have a little crush on her.  And since I &amp; T were such good pals, I told her about it.  She wasn't a bit surprised, since B has lots of suitors all along.  However, it was during this period that T &amp; B started to drift apart.  B's character was stating to irritate not only T, but most of the friends around her.  Soon, they dun talk to each other as often as before.  Not to the extend of being enemies...  they still smile &amp; greet each other once in a while.<br><br>To me, I dun really like B's character as well.  I dun think she's suitable for me.  In fact, sometimes she irritates me too!  That's why I've never taken any actions to woo her.  She doesn't have feelings for me also.  But she does look for me when she faces problems.  And as a friend, I'll always try to listen to her &amp; talk to her.  I dun have any intentions at all.  I'd listen to anyone of my friends who's willing to share his/her problems.  Soon, the little feeling I had for her fades away.<br><br>Meanwhile, me &amp; T have always been very happy together, as friends.  No problems whatsoever.  Though we are friends, we actually cared quite a bit for each other.  After I lost the feeling I had for B, I begin to fall for T!  It was almost 2 years before I develope any special feeings for her.  Again, though I liked her, she is not to be touched.  She's already attached &amp; I have no intentions of breaking them up.  However, I continue to shower her with my care &amp; concern while ensuring  I dun reveal too much about how I feel to her.  I dun know if T knows or not &amp; I dun know how she felt about me.<br><br>I'm gonna leave soon.  I'm gonna leave B &amp; T and I may not be seeing them in a long long time.  Maybe never again.  Both of them knows that I'll be leaving too.  I'll really be missing T a lot.  I really felt sad having to leave her, but I have no choice.  And she's not mine anyway.  So before I leave, I've decided treat T with all the care I can give, but not telling her anything.<br><br>Recently, things starts to go wrong.  B was having problems again.  She looked up for me &amp; spend quite some time talking with me.  I didn't turned her down.  I spoke with her &amp; try to help her out.  I dunno if it's because of this, T started to give me the cold treatment.  She dun talk or joke with me anymore.  I felt devastated!  I dun get it.  I dun understand why she had to do this to me.<br><br>Why is T giving me the cold treatmet?  Do you think talking with B is the reason?  I can't think of any other reason!  She never treated me this way before!  I was only talking to B.  EVEN if I had the intention to woo B, is that the reason to treat me this way?!<br><br>What do I do now?  Anyone can give advice? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

Trust me, getting turn off by character is much worst than looks. Even though some people may not be appealing physically, but with just normal decent heart - you will get used and probably feel that she is ok or better with time. A flawed personality with good looks fades faster with time.<br><br>B is merely a friend - your did your duty as a friend when she is feeling the blues and needed someone. There is no wrong or right here.<br><br>Then come the seemingly complication. T ignore you on the basis of thinking that you still like her:<br><br>- She probably dislike B because of her personality. Since T and you are close friends, she wouldn't like the idea of you hanging around someone she detest. (A variation to this would be that she have a liking for you - which trigger much strong reaction from her)<br><br>***<br><br>Have a nice talk with her? Friends also need that reassurance that you are on 'their side' whenever situations like this happens. I learn this gradually back through my experience: <strong>'Very good friends can only hate the same person. The minute you share good to above neutral view on that hatred person - you effectively create a distance away from this very good friend.'</strong><br><br>Talk and make known is the best option out. Expressing of feelings not neccessary, but if you feel it is choking you, please do so. Don't worry, it wouldn't hurt her relationship since you got no intention to chase her and stick to original objective: to make known only. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

But I'm the only person she's giving the "special treatment".  She seems to be going with her friends as usual, talking &amp; laughing away.  To me, she wouldn't speak more than necessary.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Devil1976:</div><div class="quote_body">If you want, you can try a softer and 'gentle' approach on T to find out about the reason... </div></blockquote>I'm always very gentle to her when comes to these things.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">   I'd really wanna know why.

She's really a kind-hearted &amp; caring girl.  Before this incident, the only time she got pissed with me is when I tried to confront her to befriend B (yes, it's B again) again like in the old days.  I was still having feelings for B then.  She got irritated with me &amp; told me off a bit.  I was really stunned...  never seen her "shouting" at me before.  Great isn't it?  Now she's only ignoring me....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>I'm not worried about T.  I know she's in good hands.  I only miss her.  The thought of leaving her makes me really upset.  But...  no choice.  If I were to be worried of someone, I'd be more worried for B....  as a friend I mean.  She really have to wake up her idea.  But... that's another thing already.<br><br><blockquote><strong>now the thing u should do is to make a gd image of urself before u leave for sometime..<br>at least u`ll still be well liked by then when u come back... </strong></blockquote><br>Making a good image before I leave...  That sounds fine.  But that's not totally my intention.  I juz wanna treasure every moment with T.  I want to spend as much time with her as possible.  Be there for her as much as possible &amp; be as happy together as much as possible while there is still time.  What else can I do?  I can't make her mine anyway.  So the time I leave shall be the deadline for everything to end.  It's sad... but it's the most I can do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

But it's not like I haven't done any reassurance to her before.  I've already told her about how I agrees with her that B's character is starting to turn me off.  I'm juz worried that after talking to her, it might trigger a more uncomfortable situation when I get to see her.  Who knows, that might NOT be the true reason she's ignoring me?  (Though I can say I'm 90% sure.)  How should I go about telling her about it?<br><br>Ok, I agree on ur part that 'Very good friends can only hate the same person."  So what should I do with B?  Ignore her like T?  I've done what I can to avoid communications with B.  But B is the one who wants to talk to me all the time.  Do I turn away when she needs to talk to me?  Someone here actually trust you so much so that she'd tell you her problems.  How can I juz turn her down like that?  Well, in fact she doesn't only come to me when she needs to talk.  It can be anyone.

If she don't feel like speaking to her, for she could implicate your situations and make matter worst - let your body language do the talk.

Date her out as a friend, SMS her silly things, call to chat, etc - do the things you always want to do and react according to her the following behavior:<br><br>I) Don't mention B at all throughout any conversation if she is those sensitive type that absorb feelings through environment. You know she falls under this category IF her mood is easily govern by what negative message received by her senses.<br><br>II) You could mention B, but emphasise and focus on the fact that you really don't like to speak to her, etc. You could bridge the gap closer and draw chasm smaller.<br><br>Take time and start from there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

You'll only be getting spectaculations and guesses as 'answers'.... It in no way would necessarily reflect the truth, though some of them would seems to hold a much higher likely chance of being the truth...

How she think.... You just write her a letter... Telling her of everything... How you feel... How you think....<br><br>As you've stated, you'll be leaving Singapore anyway? So why don't you just let her know?<br><br>I'd previously thought of asking you to pass her the letter upon your last meet up with her...
