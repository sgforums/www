If can.. maybe this relationship will still go on.. but are you sure that both can maintain it well..<br><br>Fearing in falling in love.. this is jus a small lesson learnt.. there's no need to fear.. you are 16 only.. A long way for you to go.. This is jus your growing period.. and you have to handle things yourself.. of cos sometimes is pressurized.. and stressful.. But you still have to go thru..<br><br>Get her out and chat... about the r/s.. Maybe if both arent together.. you'll be happier.. let her go.. and free yourself.. why make yourself feeling so terrible..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Don't be bothered by the fact that it may offend her, because she will be more offended if you keep lying to her.<br><br>Being busy is not a valid excuse. Did you try to make time out for her, or did you just ditch her aside? Anyway, I believe that you already know that your schedule is packed <strong>before</strong> the r/s began. You know this is going to happen. So why did you still start the r/s?<br><br>You hope the something good will come out of the r/s, but you're not making any effort. Nah, I should say that you're not making <strong>enough</strong> effort. If you want to salvage this r/s, you MUST make some sacrifices. Sacrifices would mean that you would have to quit some of your posts so that you have time for her. Sounds unfair? That's called balancing between your love life and social life.<br><br>If you're unable to balance, it probably means that you're not matured enough to handle a r/s yet. Break up, concentrate on your JC life, and move on. A r/s is not just a matter of "kiss gf, hug gf, whisper sweet nothings, intimidate moments, dump her aside when you're busy, find her again when you're lonely."</div>
