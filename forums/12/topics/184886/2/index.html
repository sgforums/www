            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, thanks for your advices and some of your experiences. I have make my decision and that is to move on . A few reasons :<br><br>She is childish . Hard to communicate with her. Her mood swings come and go. I can imagine when problem comes, she will try to run away from it.  I need someone who is mature enough to handle relationship problem. Perhaps give her a few more years maybe. She is quite a spoilt child and besides needs a lot of attention. These bad points are enough for me to move on.<br><br>I think it's a good decision . I wish her all the best, since now she is going to poly , I think she will find a more suitable guy over there.<br><br></div>
