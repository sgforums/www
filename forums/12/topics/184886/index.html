Anyway, there's quite a high chance that she (or things) might change in the future.... If you're already talking about marriage and settling down at this point...

I am 26 this year and  there is this gal who is only 17 is in love with me. Her hints are pretty clear , I find her a nice companion to be with and I was thinking should I go ahead with the relationship even with her father doesnt approve of her having a relationship until she is 20 . She has already make it clear that she doesnt want to wait until 20. I was thinking if she's the one,  by the time her marriage age comes, I will be more then ready to settle down ( I am thinking for the future as well) .<br><br>What do you guys think ?<br><br></div></blockquote>17yrs old? Just started tertiary studies not long ago?????<br><br>For me, i'll give it a miss, you see, i'm 26...what i want, this girl might not be able to accomodate or watsoever...Be it s3x or understanding/mindset/maturity...etc....One thing that i think you shld note is that, aged 26, you've been in the working society for quite some times already...more or less, you know what you want....but for a 17yrs old girl..(Note: I said "girl", not "lady" or "woman") whom has yet completed her studies and i can say that girls will tend to change when they enter into the working society...To be fair, almost everyone when stepped into the working society, will change, will mature, will have a different mindset/thingking/plans...blah blah blah....<br><br>For, do you know what she want? How true does her words hold? (Frankly speaking, no one knows..)....And how far can you go with her?<br><br>As you've mentioned earlier in your previous posts, you've quite a number of ex-gfs before...so, can you TAHAN? I'll be straightforward with you in this aspect for u n i are of the same age...</div>
