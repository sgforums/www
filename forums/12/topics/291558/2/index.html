She is so sarcastic that;when I try to salvage it, I talk a chunk of stuff that we should talk things out, she just answers: Maybe. Everything I say, she just is so sarcastic or irritated. She says she is irritated of me and disgusted that I am so possessive/keep reminding her stuff.<br><br>I told her straight, I am possessive, but she takes me for granted.

It is always my fault!' and I will have to tell her relationships are shared, it is either both or nothing, we share our burden, not pushing the blame.<br><br>I want her to know I do love her and I am willing to change. But she insists that we might not work out. She sms-ed me to say she loves me but she is tired of us. What should I do? We have given ourselves time off. But what should I do to salvage the situation? It has been bothering other aspects of my life now. She is my pillar of strength, I don't know what would I do if she is gone!</div></blockquote>Are you still in poly? My advise is to you is just break off and maintain friend first la .Know her more first.There are not one girl in this world there are girls that is better than your girlfriend X100 1,slowly search why so hurry?No girlfriend you will die meh?

In fact, if you find it difficult to bring up the topic, allow me to do you the favour should you decide on this course of action.<br><br>Women who do not communicate their wishes in a straighforward manner are not ready for permanent and happy and longlasting relationships. Similarly, if you have identified yourself as being possessive but is taking positive steps to clearly identify the areas of problems and dealing with them, then you too should be on guard about where the relationship is headed towards when you find yourself clearly identifying too often and is feeling really tied down trying to deal with the problems. A gf is to make you "happie", serve you coffee or tea when you ask for it, and appease your anger when you get into a fit. In return you swear to protect her with every fibre of your being.<br><br>Feel free to disagree with me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i realised what is wrong.<br><br>when ppl r angry, they spout nonsense. she told me she was tired of us n everything, but she was angry at tt time. she admitted to me. she told me she wanted this to work out. so we have worked things out. she admits she takes me for granted sometimes and is willing to see things from my side.<br><br>yet again, hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, as a guy, you should be HER pillar of strength-compromising all the time is a definite DON'T. It shows that she is unable to rely on you 100%, and that's disconcerting for a girl. However, sometimes, you should, because a relationship is based on give and take-but as a guy, you should learn that it's alright to say no (at times), and stand by whatever it is you believe is right.<br><br>And secondly, if you keep feeling that you have to change, what's the point? Loving someone means accepting everything that they are, isn't it??</div>
