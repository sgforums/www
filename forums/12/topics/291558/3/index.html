            <div class='col-md body'>Look around you friend, all those happy couples. You see any of them being verbally abusive towards each other?<br><br>YOu have to clearly identify what you want out of a partnership. I understand that sometimes a guy and a girl come together for various reasons, but in your case I think you seem to have lost sight of the purpose of a union.<br><br>If you're looking for happiness, then ditch her, and don't take her back, cos that's exactly what she will try to do. It seems pretty obvious to me (even though I have not seen it for myself)  that she is taking you for granted, treating you like some "kai zi", "Cai tou", or whatever. You're not being appreciated, you get abused verbally, YOU THINK ANY OF THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE IN FUTURE?!<br><br>Get a new gf. When you are happily holding her hand and enjoying her company, you will think back to your soon to be exed current gf-wannabe and realise what a !@#$% she is.</div>
