            <div class='col-md body'>In general I would agree with this.  It's a man's instinct to treasure his prize that was gained through hard work and some obstacles.  The whole process is not just for show, it prompts the guy to question if he likes her enough to put some effort to win her over.<br><br>As for a girl feeling inferior, I think it's her own unhealthy mindset making trouble. If she sees herself as less worthy, nothing will convince her otherwise.<blockquote>'When a girl chase a guy, the guy will never appreciate her more than one that he chased.
