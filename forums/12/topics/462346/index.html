              whom they call each other 'darling'?
              
              Platonic friendship is very common nowadays. However, will you get too close to the opp. gender without falling in love with him/her?
              
              My spouse has a good female platonic friend and they call each other 'darling', in fact she also call another gf of her 'darling' so in a way nothing weird.
              
              But isn't it weird if my spouse whatsapp with her:
              
              she: darling, you sound bored.
              
              my spouse : darling, bla bla...
              
              Should this be something I need to be concern over? 
              
              I mean, for awhile, I can say I trust them but what about in the long run, are they going to darling here and darling there forever?

              <p>Usually a cheating partner would progressively leak out a collective bunch of signs that are mutually coherent.

              <p>From this, one would generally have two schools of thoughts: (i) you believe that if any cheating would happen, it would.

              <p>Both philosophical schools of thoughts in love are neither positive nor negative; it is merely how we are geared towards making certain resolution of conflicts in love. If you ask for my personal opinion, I would say my inclination is towards the middle way.</p>

You could approach and share it in a reasonable way that you feel uncomfortable with him doing what he is doing.</p>
              <p>Instead of assuming, being able to communicate our feelings is important to ensure that there is no elephant in the room. It is the surest way of clarifying our doubts and strengthening the relationship, if we are haunted meaninglessly but by the ghosts in our mind. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good friendship itself is nothing wrong . BUT all parties must understand their own position and marital status and do nothing that will jeopardise  the trust  that their spouses have in them . And as such  the individuals in that platonic friendship must be very clear about their  boundaries of friendship  One should never be unduely narrow-minded or concerned about the platonic friendships of one's spouse.  One way is to get to know the friend well too, so as to be able to assess  the so called platonic friendship.</div>

              <p>What is acceptable to him , may not be acceptable to you.</p>
              <p>"Darling" may be just a frivolous label to him, but that same word has deeper and intimate meaning for you. It is not wise for you to disregard your feelings in a relationship and what should be reserved only for someone deserving of such intimate status. Like between lovers/ husband and wife.</p>
              <p>You are his wife, if you feel uncomfortable with his current behavior , you should speak up because YOUR FEELINGS MATTERS in a marriage.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself why you married him. If you don't need him to regard your needs, then you really don't need him around , no ?</p>
              <p>Let him know you wish for the communication to cease. A loving husband will respect his wife wishes and ensure emotional security.</p>
              <p>A selfish man will disregard his partner's needs and focus on his own enjoyment.</p>
              <p>If they want to continue, it's time you stop being the third wheel and get out of there.</p>
              <p>Like what Princess Diana commented about her marriage prior to the fatal accident. " "There were 3 of us in the marriage".</p>
              <p>If your husband wishes to continue such scandalous behavior, the marriage will not last very long. So better you leave now than later when everything becomes more complicated.</p>
