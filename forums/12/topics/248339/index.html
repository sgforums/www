I am dead sure that your 'still-kept-in-contact' is but causal and superficial. Nothing too deep inside.<br><br>Chances are, you are not very close to her as well.<br><br>And that goes to show that you probably know next to nothing about her inner self, growth, experience and development of four years after graduation from secondary school.<br><br>Many things would have happen within this time frame and your perception of her is still the little girl at the age of sixteen. Of course there's much 'impression discrepancy' which you would need to update.<br><br>P.S: This has nothing to do with Singaporean Girls. Logically speaking, she cannot represent the entire woman folk as this is another isolated case. You may have a more prudent way of what woman should be and I am sure some woman wouldn't disagree with you, but that doesn't mean that your view is absolute to everyone.<br><br>Different people have different cosmic lesson in their life.

Just because I go clubbing doesn't make me a bad person. I do very well in school and all that and I know a lot of good people there. There ARE a lot of people you wouldn't want to mix with at clubs but there are also a lot of decent people and you shouldn't generalise.</div>
