At risk, on the edge seems to be her motto when it comes to living her life. As friends, you can only advise her so much, but I doubt she will listen. If she had learned her lesson at all previously, then she wouldn't have get drunk, and get down and dirty with guys so much times.<br><br>I would say its not that spore girls are more open nowadays. Its just that we are the MTV generation, where we see on MTV, movies, tv shows etc that its ok to have flings, its ok to have sex with your gardener even if you are married, and that liking two persons at a time is ok, as long as you choose one in the end, and just say "Sorry" to the other person who wouldn't end up with you. Even our local TV stations are showing all these nowadays, so naturally people think its ok to do all these. In the end, there's no right or wrong, its what you believe in, and how firm ur beliefs are.</div>

All she wanted was a happy family and yet her parents could not give her that. It may be for the best but she had a hard time handling it.

She may have been influenced by peers. Or like what is illustrated in BBB's comments, she may have been affected by something drastic and it caused her to behave rather differently from how you portrayed her.<br><br>No matter how good or how bad the person becomes, we must NEVER be judgemental against that person. On the contrary, we must ask the person and seek to understand further given the appropriate timing and approach.<br><br>No one wants to give their body willingly or cheapens themselves unless in special circumstances.<br><br>Be patient. If you still regards her as a friend (be it she is angelic or not), you should treat her and respect her as one. Unbiased.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>clubs are a breeding ground for vice, like smoking, drugs and what not. Most clubbers pick up smoking, girls notwithstanding. also clubs in singapore are like chimmneys, when will smoking ban be enforced?<br><br>now i go pubs only i think i too old or not suited for clubs anymore. i dont like inhaling tons of smoke, listening to pounding music, not really the dancing type and not being able to make conversation with friends.<br><br>but clubs got some places the drinks damn cheap.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) i always thought that the whole idea of clubbing is for those people who are in the vice trade, and those who want to be clients of vice. in western countries, clubbing is their folk culture, but in asia, especially singapore, clubbing is a subculture status kind of thing. i tell you, 100% decent girls and guys don't go to clubs or pubs or bars one.<br>dunno about you guys, but never in he|| would i go to bar/pub/clubs to look for girlfriends or whatever. if i want to visit bar/pub/clubs, i might as well visit Geylang.<br><br>2) where is the legendary Singapore girl???!!!!!!</div>
