Its mostly quiet, laid back, can order finger food and drinks, can talk cock, can watch soccer. Completely unlike clubs. I dont think u go pubs to pick up girls; thats for ang mohs or clubbing.<br><br>yeah got some ppl dont go clubs and pubs. actually also a good thing. save $$$. pubs is just like a more expensive coffeeshop to hang out.<br><br>yeah i also find the association of clubbers with being popular quite nonsensical. i think clubbing is a phase most ppl will tire of in their early or late 20s</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Rad:</div><div class="quote_body">Lol. Apparatly good people don't have sex.</div></blockquote>Haha..I would say that people with the right upbring would not engage in premarital sex.<br><br>With regards to this thread, I personally find that the young people of today are generally more open (to sex etc.) as compared to their older siblings. Perhaps it is caused by the exposure to the various source of media i.e. in movies and dramas (such as Desperate housewives), it is not uncommon to see parts of a sex scenes or people treating sex as a casual matter. Also these days, sex is commercialised as a product and used to sell items ("sex sells", a term always used). Go to town and you'll notice that novelty condom shops are no longer rare sights. These are some of the things that were rare and would have been made a big hoo-ha during our parents' time.<br><br>As for your friend, I'm sorry to hear that. Like others have mentioned, people do change over time. Or perhaps her breakup from her ex-boyfriend and/or some other incidents could have triggered and impacted her so much that she lost that sense of 'self-worth' at that period of time, and thus did things like sleeping around (no offence). Nevertheless, it's time to show your true friendship and lend her your support!<br><br>Regards,<br>Glen</div>
