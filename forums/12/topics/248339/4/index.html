Perhaps it is caused by the exposure to the various source of media i.e. in movies and dramas (such as Desperate housewives), it is not uncommon to see parts of a sex scenes or people treating sex as a casual matter. Also these days, sex is commercialised as a product and used to sell items ("sex sells", a term always used). Go to town and you'll notice that novelty condom shops are no longer rare sights. These are some of the things that were rare and would have been made a big hoo-ha during our parents' time.<br><br>As for your friend, I'm sorry to hear that. Like others have mentioned, people do change over time. Or perhaps her breakup from her ex-boyfriend and/or some other incidents could have triggered and impacted her so much that she lost that sense of 'self-worth' at that period of time, and thus did things like sleeping around (no offence). Nevertheless, it's time to show your true friendship and lend her your support!<br><br>Regards,<br>Glen</div></blockquote>The media has played a big part with premarital sex among youths in Singapore perhaps but it is entirely different in most western countries. Since the 70s sex has been common among teens as much as it is now but only recently has the majority of teens in Singapore been sexually active. I don't think it is anything to worry about as it is perfectly normal as most teens around the world do have sex early in their lives and I feel that Singaporeans need to stop being so uptight about the matter.</div>
