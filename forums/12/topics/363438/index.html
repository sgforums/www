              <p>Hi, this is quite uncalled for.. but i decided to share this
              out.. i am not sure but i feel rather lost at this point in
              life<br> <br> I am turning 25, just returned from aboard after my
              undergrad(accounting degree). First thing i did was to join my
              family business late last year, and on the surface, i am a young
              adult with a lot of expectation from alot of people. My family
              business is doing well.. and i am "expected" to take over one day
              they gave me 3-5 years' time. It's a private family business but
              rather well known in it's trade locally. Frankly.. most of the
              things have been planned out.. i can't say that i an't happy with
              it. but i am not sure.. i always have the "What if" moment.</p>
              <p>my social life does not exist. I mean i do have friends.. but i
              realise that it is so hard to meet new people. Everybody find it
              hard to believe that i am still single, as the typical taboo of
              "better off" people (with cars) should not have problem with
              getting hitched.</p>
              <p>I realise that after work.. i'll heead home.. just surf the
              net.. then head to bed.. the routine just keep going and going..
              sometimes i even find myself working on sundays... i have a feeling
              if this goes on.. i'll turn 30 before i know it.. and it's rather
              depressing..</p>
              <p>(Ps: i know i should be grateful for what i have.. and i
              am.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Okay, i dunno if anyone will respond..</p>

              <p>You're not working 24/7, right?? Maybe can hang out with your friends on weekends? As for gf, don't worry, you'll get one one day! :D Yay!!</p>

              <p>If anyone can help you, it's yourself.</p>
              <p>Take a leap out of your lifestyle; instead of heading home straight after work, spend like couple hours everyday (or week) to socialise. Call up friends and have them to bring someone you don't know, it's a good way to expand your social circle.</p>
