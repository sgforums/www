              <p>Oh dont get me wrong..<br> I am well aware to not have expectation.<br> Thing is, i have to adjust myself to my scope (line of work)
              quickly.. it is totally different from what i studied aboard.
              Expectation is high, especially since coming from internally.</p>
              <p>I agree, i am not rushing through things.. but just a random
              thought of how things are at the moment seem to be pushing towards
              that direction.</p>
              <p>Maxsee*<br> I drive a 5 series.It does not really matter anyway. Yes i do plan
              to get a house after awhile.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for all the reply,<br> I suppose the best solution is to start a hobby. As for finding
              friends to gather for kopi sessions.. abit hard to find within my
              circle of friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I finally understand why people say that it's harder to meet
              people after school days. The best friends that one can make are
              usually those who grow up with you. I missed that opportunity
              already. Sigh. Moving on~</p>

              <p>Hi, this is quite uncalled for.. but i decided to share this
              out.. i am not sure but i feel rather lost at this point in
              life<br> <br> I am turning 25, just returned from aboard after my
              undergrad(accounting degree). First thing i did was to join my
              family business late last year, and on the surface, i am a young
              adult with a lot of expectation from alot of people. My family
              business is doing well.. and i am "expected" to take over one day
              they gave me 3-5 years' time. It's a private family business but
              rather well known in it's trade locally. Frankly.. most of the
              things have been planned out.. i can't say that i an't happy with
              it. but i am not sure.. i always have the "What if" moment.</p>
              <p>my social life does not exist. I mean i do have friends.. but i
              realise that it is so hard to meet new people. Everybody find it
              hard to believe that i am still single, as the typical taboo of
              "better off" people (with cars) should not have problem with
              getting hitched.</p>
              <p>I realise that after work.. i'll heead home.. just surf the
              net.. then head to bed.. the routine just keep going and going..
              sometimes i even find myself working on sundays... i have a feeling
              if this goes on.. i'll turn 30 before i know it.. and it's rather
              depressing..</p>
              <p>(Ps: i know i should be grateful for what i have.. and i
              am.)</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Depends on how you see it. If you all are friends, they will be more willing to work harder since its no longer just for money. It might of course be able problematic when there are conflicts but if you can maintain a good balence, you can make many friends from there. In some of the companies i went for attachment or worked part time in, you can find groups of people going out happy hour, meals, movies etc together and sometimes that includes the managers, bosses etc.</p>

              <p>i know what you can do you can just focus all your efforts on making your family business prosper so that you can retire early and then you don't have to be weighed down by others' expectations, THEN you can do what u always want to do</p>
              <p>Your other option is to do break off now and live a happier life of your own but it will come at more risk and some problems and alot of responsibility. Your choice</p>

              <p>MeowMe Yes, indeed alot. My parents struggled hard when back then.. came to singapore to work with barely enough to survive.. we started off renting a place.. then bought our first house.. then shifted as we prosper.. so yes.. shifted alot.. i shifted even more when i studied aboard. almost once a year, sometimes 2 times  a year.<br><br>I think keeping in touch is a difficult thing especially when everyone are miles apart. It is not the same, missing out on friends' 21st birthday celebration etc.. or friends' wedding.. while apart.. point is, i difted out. and now i'm back trying to get back in. Just have to make new friends. Sad thing is, some of my close friends are leaving soon to study aboard. =(</p>

              <p>after reading what you have typed. TS,</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Your life is good , treasure it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My life. I don't have a rich family like yours, my dad don't own a company. I too, obtain a degree, B.eng) from aboard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When I come back, Economic is bad, just like what we are experiencing now. No body want fresh graduate.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My salary demand is low. I applied for more than 200 jobs. didn't got any luck.</p>
              <p>I worked 20 temp job. every place I work, people will be mocking at me saying graduate working this job. most are low educated bengs or uncles. I see them smoking, drinking, chatting nonsense and pass their time away.</p>
              <p>I was doing 3 temp job at one time. one morning, one afternoon, and one in the night, from 11pm to 6am. doing a temp servicing job for local bus interchange.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>life is better for me now. TS, for you, you just think too much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Try to treasure what you have. Be good to your parents. DON'T PRESS yourself too much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To take over the company isn't easy. You just have to set learn slowly, and get the basics.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was noobs in my jobs. all my jobs, temp, permanent jobs. Just Learn what You can.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You got GF? find one, and be nice to her. For me, I am no body, but I have got a wonderful gf. you got to have someone to love.</p>
              <p>Life is easier with someone you can share.</p>
              <p>life is not robot. you go internet correct? you can try getting a gf from there, with your status and family back ground shouldn't be hard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>life is about happiness, sadness, disappointed, joy of success, sharing with love one, vengency, to ruined another person life, to make someone happy, to make someone sad.</p>
              <p>life is wonderful, don't make it a robotic way.</p>

              <p>everyone experiences this monotony once in a while, and it's really up to us to get out of this vicious cycle. either u really take the big leap and change to a job u really like, or just make some adjustments to ur life, like how many have suggested, pick up a new hobby or develop ur hobbies and interests...</p>

              <p>Maybe at some pt of time u jus feel that life is pretty much meaningless. Most of us wud take up a sport or an activity to keep us occupied. Well personally i wud suggest to do volunteering work as not only u are doing a gd deed u get to meet all kinds of people and it wud be fun! If not, u can try looking for language exchange meet ups like what im doing now, to brush up on a language u are really keen on learning. That's another alternative.<br>Anw dun b so pessimisstic about ur life becos there are MANY ppl out there who are probably feeling the same way as u are. that's y we haf forums n online blogs etc. n that's also y ppl surf the net most of the time in search of entertainment.</p>

              <p>if you like children, volunteer at orphanages. if you like animals, help out at animal shelters such as Animal Lovers League and Noah's Ark and SPCA.</p>
