            <div class='col-md body'>...  Whatever you feel unhappy about a person's comments, pls try to voice out in the person's thread... Starting a new thread (with pointing of finger to a specific someone) is usually very suggestive of a <span style="color: red;">flame thread</span>....<br><br>This is probably your point of view in a sort? (maybe you would like to confirm this?) Since someone can just start a thread to shoot up on the guys... The guys could do the SAME... (Fair stand) As much as I would agree to this mentality of yours <strong>to a certain extent</strong>... I would also very much like you to understand that AA is a place where people mainly seek advices... Occassionally speaks up about their dismays and agony... Occassionally chats... Non-contructive thread(s) are not encouraged.. The last thing I wish to see is AA turning into a 'name shooting battleground'....<br><br>Pls understand that there're all sorts of people in this world... And you simply can't stop them from thinking... Ice_princess is just stating her own point of view and does not necessarily represents the thinking of majority of the females... Shouldn't get too agitated over that.<br><br>By displaying unappropriate as such would only let people come out with maybe another topic like "Y guys are so hot-tempered?"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Please...
