              i'm in my early 20's a student working part time. i splurge a lot of money on clothes and skin care products every month basically most of my salary goes there. i went through a period thinking i was bisexual but now, i'm very sure that i'm straight. i had several gf's in the past but most of they are not supportive of what i do, my spending habits although i still spend lavishly on them. 
              
              i used to keep a jap style haircut which need to be styled by wax. now it's quite long and i regularly spend on coloring, hair treatments. i also spent a few k's removing my deep eyebags. as for my face, i would not say it's flawless but i spend a great deal of time maintaining it as i have a morning, afternoon and night routine. i use many skin care products including pore minimizers, concealer, bb creams and some others. so normally i will take more than an hour to get ready to go out, this makes some of my ex's very pissed. 
              
              i was a model in the past but due to parent's objections i had to quit and find other jobs. i am often admired by many girls but unsure if they fancy a kind of guy like me to be their bf.

              <p>Make it simple, just use one product, like me SK III can liao, just go watson have already, so not much headache, and try not to do much on your hair, later you may get premature baldness, especially for pple of your type.</p>
              <p>One thing you can do is break all the mirror in yr house, then slowly you will become a perfect macho man.</p>

              <p><br>Got, thru the net, you can order from Japan, SK II is mend only for singapore tropical areas, whereas SK III is for colder places.</p>
              <p>Wearing skinny jean, you need to hv long legs and nice lift up butts, some gals short short with big butt wear already looks orbid, like mother chicken going around. Grooming is a personal issue, it is good to keep up, stay good and feel good, unlike some guys, never wash their face or care for their skin, so end up with lots of problem, from dementis to hair loss problem, to oily and pimpled face.</p>
              <p>Piercing is normal lah, me olso got belly here and there..</p>
