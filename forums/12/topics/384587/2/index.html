Don't forget you're responsible for choosing to be with him in a relationship and you can choose otherwise. If there are other aspects of him that are worth you bearing his quirky immaturity then you'll just have to learn to accept the way he is and maybe focus on whats good in him.. Otherwise i dont see a reason for u to remain in the relationship.

              <p>Don't think that  # age = maturity level. There are plenty
              of 50 year old who still behaves like a baby. AKA adult kids.</p>
              <p>Maturity is gained through pain and exposures to
              adversities.</p>
              <p>If your man grew up in a sheltered environment and mommy-ed his
              whole life... there's 90% he's an ADULT KID.</p>
              <p>His professional status does not equate to high level of
              maturity. Even a VP will stomp out of a meeting like a little boy
              who didn't get his way.</p>

              <p>TS, I can't help laughing at the rolling on the floor part....haha!</p>
              <p>Did he ever roll while you were dating? Anyway, I agree to jojobeach on certain points.</p>
              <p>But your post did not mention him wanting to leave as well, so it's more one-sided than both. I think nobody here will really advocate splitting, unless it's really terrible.</p>
              <p>Sadly, a man will probably remain how he is most of his life. You can try to change, but it's all superficial. An unfaithful person will always hunt for mistresses, a gambler will always gamble, a suicidal person will...well, you get the idea. It takes a lot of effort or a major incident to 'wake' a person up.</p>
              <p>At the very least, both of you agree to counselling. I hope it works out for both of you. Lastly, remember to keep a first aid box at home, in case he rolls onto a thumb tack.</p>

              <p>I tried to leave several times, but he is very persistent and will come to my office, knock at my house door.

It is hard to switch to that intense mode and it's tiring trying to explain or even walking away seems like a lot of effort as he will follow me all the way till I get home. The longest record I have lasted is a month. He will usually cry and whine when I get really firm on that few occasions. It's scary! </p>

              <p>Wow... seems like he's really a nutcase. If he wanna stay extreme in his own ways, ie. keep following you home everyday, you can try calling the police. This is considered harassment, especially when you don't wanna have anything to do with him anymore. Calling IMH is also another good option. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>There's really no point in staying just because you fear him.</p>
              <p>The only way to end his obsession with you, is to have another guy escort you home everyday.</p>
              <p>If you have a very good male friend or male relative whom he has never met, get the favor and explain you need a temporary male escort so that you may end this sticky relationship. There are risks involved, but it is better now or never.</p>

              <p>Hi there, </p>
              <p>Have you been with a guy who is older than you, but you feel
              like he is really just a boy inside in terms of mentality,
              behaviour, etc? It is tiring because you find yourself teaching him
              things, tolerating him, and even have to take care of his
              ego! </p>
              <p>I am 27. He is 30. We are of a marriage age, but we can't
              because he is not 'old' enough to plan and action. What worst is he
              will fight with me constantly even in public. I am tortured
              mentally, as I am so afraid to be humiliated by him in public, at
              home in front of my family (I dun wan my family to worry about me)
              and I have to keep things in my heart. </p>
              <p>On the extreme side, he messed things up when he is pissed,
              rolled on the floor when he lost control and do all kind of
              ridiculous actions to get your attention? </p>

              <p>Thank you guys so much for all your advices. I get the point,
              all of it. </p>
              <p>I tried to leave several times, but he is very persistent and
              will come to my office, knock at my house door. I became submissive
              now as I fear very much he will cause a scene at my work place or
              house. It is really embarrassing as he will suddenly shout or walk
              very fast attracting attention from passer by. </p>
              <p>Till now, my heart seems dead. It does not beat for this man
              anymore. But I can't leave as he wouldn't let go. I have tried like
              not talking or communicating for a month. But every single day he
              will wait downstair my office. It is hard to switch to that intense
              mode and it's tiring trying to explain or even walking away seems
              like a lot of effort as he will follow me all the way till I get
              home. The longest record I have lasted is a month. He will usually
              cry and whine when I get really firm on that few occasions. It's
              scary! </p>

              <p>Hi Little Red Book,</p>
              <p>Have some friends accompany you and make it very clear to him that you do not want to have anything to do with him anymore. Walk away and ignore him if he attempts to throw a tantrum. If he starts to get physically aggressive, have your friends come together as a group with yourself in order to deter him from trying anything.</p>
              <p>In the case where he choose to continue ignoring what you have said and attempt to cause a scene at your office or your house, you may wish to consider calling in the police to deal with him.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi Little Red Book,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sorry for the late response. To keep things short its because my wife does not like it when i'm serious. When i'm serious we end up quarrelling alot. So i thought of this idea to act like a kid "rolling on the floor" to get my wife...its similar to my wife's "sha jiao" to get the things she wants. The chances of getting what i want is higher and the risk off breaking into a argument is slimmer.</p>
              <p>As for how I "roll on the floor" that is for me to know and not for you to find out lol.... surmise to say my in-laws saw it once and asked my wife if i was "chao lian dai".</p>
              <p>Kind Regards</p>
