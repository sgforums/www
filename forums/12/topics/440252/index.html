              <p>Cut things short; I am stupid to be too nice.</p>
              <p>Anyway; I help a friend to sign a contract line from Starhub; since he unable to sign up for one as he claim that his line is being used by his family members.<br>I did it w/o having a 2nd though. And also; help him pay total $200++ in advance 1st since he didn't have enough cash. [No IOU note; and I thinking of getting him to sign one the moment I get to him]</p>
              <p>Anyway; fast forward to now. He didn't pay the bills amounting to over $300; and reject my call and sms.</p>
              <p>What can I do to this situation? I don't want things to turn ugly mainly because of the money issues. I currently studying and no way I be able to pay that bill and absorb the debt he owe me. The bills alone can take me at least 6months to clear.</p>
              <p>The line is currently being suspended due to non-payment. So is there anyway I can get out of this Starhub problem 1st; mainly because is under my name and owe to company; and causing me stress.</p>
              <p>Should I go up his doors and ask for him to explain himself for the debt he cause if he con't not to reply my sms or receive my call?</p>
              <p>Also; does the period of contract include the time when the line got suspended?</p>
              <p><br>Thanks for good advice in advance.</p>
              <p>If going to flame me for being stupid; don't bother cause I know I am.</p>

              <p>Pay up everything and call it an expensive lesson learnt.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, as much as i feel for the ts, he should bare part of the blame. If the line is under him, shouldn't he receive the bills monthly, and should he not inform his friend?</p>
              <p>And è¿™ä¸ªæœ‹å�‹å•Š .. if have difficulities paying should at least take the liberty to inform his friends.. month after month and not try to hide and act as though nothing has happened. </p>
              <p>Probably like what you have said. Ts friend will use the same excuse that he said to Ts to get another line. </p>

              <p>What I can say is this:</p>
              <p>Cancel the line and pay the bills and all related charges; it's under your name, so you are legally obliged to pay for it.</p>
              <p>Then call him, shout all manner of Hokkien/Malay/Tamil/German/French vulgarities at him, and tell him to fark a spider. If he doesn't take your call, then send him a letter.</p>
              <p>Then tell all your friends about him and what he did, and tell them to break off all ties with him.</p>
              <p>It's not going to come cheap for you, but let it be a lesson about being too trusting with people.</p>

              <p>Last time edmw pulled its csi team resources to hunt down a paypal scammer. The victim wants to give the scammer a chance to admit his mistake, but the scammer just won't admit it and push blames to others. The case was reported to the police.</p>

              yah lah, i also nice to friend, help him sign a line, end up starhub called me say more than 10 months never pay the bill and the line is under my name... WTF... i dun mind paying but as far as the friendship, the trust is gone, he still dare to lie and give excuses, lol... really amazing... he thinks other people are stupid to believe his lies...
              
              But if you want to make things difficult, can find a lawyer sue him.. because if he lose, he has to incur the lawyer fee as well, so make his life even more difficult for the same way he made urs difficult... at his age, he can't siam the debts one, because he still have so many years to live, they will keep pursuing him non-stop...

              <p>Your money is as good as gone. Find some way to cancel your account. Worse case scenario is that you may get blacklisted by Singtel, you may never get another line from them again.</p>
              <p>As for your "friend", he has already shitted you, so its time you repay his "kindness". Talk bad about him to everybody that knows him, bad mouth him to his parents.</p>

              <p>Good move.</p>
              <p>Enlist his parents as your allies; they will probably have the greatest effect on him.</p>
              <p>With any luck, they can force him to pay all the bills. Even if he does clear the bills though, please cancel the line once the bills are cleared and tell him to go fark a spider. Do not ever be friends with him again, and warn everyone who knows him to not trust him.</p>
              <p>No, seriously. He burnt you once, he can burn you again. Some people just cannot be trusted; no point taking a chance on this idiot.</p>
