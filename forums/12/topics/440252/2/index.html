              <p>But if you want to make things difficult, can find a lawyer sue him.. because if he lose, he has to incur the lawyer fee as well, so make his life even more difficult for the same way he made urs difficult… at his age, he can’t siam the debts one, because he still have so many years to live, they will keep pursuing him non-stop…</p>
