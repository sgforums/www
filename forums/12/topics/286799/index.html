            <div class='col-md body'>ok about my sec 3 younger sister who is younger than me by 3 years, once again<br><br>ok u see, on this fine saturday morning, i woke up at about 10am+. my sis is already awake n watching TV. parents working.<br><br>so i went to the kitchen to fix breakfast. i had cup noodles n when i opened the bin to throw the cup after finishing, i see 2 burnt toast. ok so i guess my sis must have burnt the toasts in the oven while making breakfast again. n i notice the toast were only slightly burnt. not like the whole toast black like charcoal. if i were her i would just scrape off the burnt part with a butter knife n the toasts is still edible.<br><br>so i go n ask her nicely, hey *hername*, did u burnt the toasts again? she answered me rudely 'yeah so what?'.<br><br>ok i guess she was not paying attention to the oven as usual. Coz for our oven, u have to flip the bread while toasting, if not one side will be burnt n the other not toasted. so i presume she simply throw the 2 burnt toasts away n makes another 2 toasts. For me i never burnt the toast when i toast bread coz i will always keep watch on the oven.<br><br>this is not the first time she burnt the toast. that time i told her not to waste food. if u burnt the toast slightly, u can just use a butter knife n scrape away the burnt part, n the toast can still be eaten. i told my mum that time n she agreed with me that my sis should do that, coz its bad to waste food. furthermore my family isn't very well off, we shouldn't be wasteful.<br><br>ok, so i tell her nicely 'why u waste food? didn't i n mum told u before if u burnt the toast u can just scrape away the burnt part n the toast still can eat?'<br><br>she ignores me n tells me in a pissed off tone 'shut up lah, why u care so much? the bread also not u buy one. don't think u r so great lah.... n stop telling me what to do... u r such a farking nag...just like mum'<br><br>then she on the TV louder n my blood boil already, then i think, forget it lah...no point quarrelling with her. if she's so quarrellsome n rebellious let her be. so i go back into my room n slammed the door hard. then i think she got pissed by that n turned up the TV volume to the maximum. i could hear the TV from outside. so i went out again n told her to lower the volume if not neighbours will complain but she ignores me n so i gave up n went back to my room n on my radio to drown out the TV noises. then i think later on she lowered the volume 15 minutes later.... wah lan<br><br>ok now u people tell me, is it my fault? i was just trying to tell her not to waste food n she gets mad at me for that? What i had told her is correct, even my mum agreed with me the other time. Furthermore i n mum already told her before last time. Ok i understand if my family is rich such things wouldn't matter, but our family isn't. my dad is just a taxi driver n my mum is a dispenser at a clinic. we have bills to pay n my dad even has to contribute money to pay for my grandma's medical bills every month which is quite a lot.<br><br>ok n if u people think that getting worked up over 2 pieces of insignificant bread which probably costs only a few cents is stupid....GO AHEAD N LAUGH AT ME.<br><br>i don't understand why do i have such a sucky sister...we always seem to be quarrelling.<br><br></div>
