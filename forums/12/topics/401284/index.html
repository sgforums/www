              <p>My suggestion is do some indepth study on what Buddhism and 
                              Buddhist practice is about, then decide for yourself what you want when 
                              you have a clearer picture.</p>
              <p>Here's something my moderator Longchen wrote which I feel needs to be emphasized about the difference between folk ritual/superstition, and true Buddhism.</p>
              <div id="post-body-9792077" class="body">
              <p><strong>Hi Vexteen,</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Just a sharing.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The main difference (to me) about 
                                          superstition and the real
                                                                  practice is that the emphasis is entirely 
                                          different.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Folk ritual is mainly about seeking 
                                          protection from Gods and
                                                                  Boddhisatvas. In fact, to most people, this is 
                                          their main concern.
                                                                  They are not interested in helping themselves.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>For the real spiritual practice, it is about 
                                          helping ourself,
                                                                  not seeking protection from deities. In fact, 
                                          one's life may be
                                                                  even worst (on the conventional sense) when one 
                                          is on the real
                                                                  path... that has been my own experience... at 
                                          least. This is

                                          life.</strong></p>

                                      backslide.  The teacher can hammer us into 
              shape, but he/she
                                      is not around always... we have to have a very 
              very strong
                                      mind.  There is so much suffering always, in all
               aspects of
                                      life, for oneself and for others, such 
              incredible suffering.
                                      Sometimes, one wonders why samsara is so 
              exceedingly painful. 
                                      everyone is going thru their share of 
              suffering... if we really see
                                      the pain, we can develop renunciation, it 
              becomes a source of
                                      strength to further pick ourselves up again and 
              again, over and
                                      over and then to walk on.  Actually, there is no
               other choice,
                                      one has to complete the journey by oneself, 
              opting out is not an
                                      option. Seeing this deeply for oneself, it is a 
              endless cause for
                                      compassion for others too...  the more one sees 
              it for
                                      oneself, the more sadness one has for others 
              too.</p>

              <p><strong>To me, the more i walk the path, the clearer i
               see that there is
                                      no way to prevent difficulties in life. There 
              will come a point
                                      when you just let go...</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rather than fight with reality, see through 
              its illusionary
                                      nature... There is no self there in all the 
              happenings... Self is
                                      the reaction to the happening... that is 
              manifesting spontaneously.
                                      Even the anger, emotions, etc have no 
              self-agent...</strong></p>
              <p><strong>From my experience, it is very hard to see 
              the illusionary
                                      nature in the midst of pain. The pain is too 
              real to be
                                      illusionary...</strong></p>

The articles are easy to understand. My Master (Ven Shen Kai) was once a Christian pastor, but he converted to a Buddhist monk after doing indepth study of Buddhism which totally changed his perspective and understanding about what Buddhism is about.</p>

              <p class="ecxMsoNormal"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Life is truly perplexing; but among many of these deep questions, the point of existence often worries men the most. In our respective ways, we always try to make sense of the world we live in. Hence we will attempt to provide meaning to our experience, being part of our process to decipher the code of life, through the paradigm we chose to view from.  </p>
              <p class="ecxMsoNormal">Since you have posted in AA, I would take it that you probably want a secular response since it’s mundane to talk about any particular faith here in AA. Hence, allow me to share about the philosophical aspect of your question.</p>
              <p class="ecxMsoNormal">Because looking through the religion’s paradigm is one of the perspectives we could employ to make meaning to our experience and reveal (in some sense) the point of our individual existence - surely, one’s understanding of what’s life and the point of existence will definitely differ from others. But why should it stop us from trying to find the answers we need to appease our insatiable spiritual hunger?</p>
              <p class="ecxMsoNormal">All religion claims that they hold the ultimate truth, but in reality, like what Protagoras said: man is the measure of all things.</p>
              <p class="ecxMsoNormal">Therefore, depending on the nature of your spiritual dissatisfaction, you might not actually need to do a ‘either or’ selection; like between religion X or religion Y.</p>
              <p class="ecxMsoNormal">Understand the nature of your dissonance and what exactly you are disturbed about your present belief would help you to decide what you really want.</p>
              <p class="ecxMsoNormal">Because at the end of the day, we want to choose a religion that is relevant to our life - since the definition of relevance is relative to us.</p>
              <p class="ecxMsoNormal">Aside to TS: if you need to clarify religious beliefs, values, thoughts, question, perspective, etc, please do so in the respective forum/s - AA is secular. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>Instead of immediately thinking of a religion as the answer to your current state of mind, why not spend <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">some quiet time on your own</span></strong>, with no one else to influence your thoughts. Go somewhere peaceful and quiet, where you can be relaxed. Personally, I would recommend meditation to help relax your mind, to think better. (<em>Meditation is not exclusive to any religion, regardless of what anyone says. It can be used purely as a non-religious relaxation technique.) </em>Think about what sort of life you want to lead, and what will make you truly happiest and most fulfilled in life? Think long-term, not short-term.</p>
              <p><em>Since you didn't mention what your current "life issue" is, I presume you're thinking more deeply into your own life. If you're currently perplexed because you just broke up with bf/gf, quarrelled with parents/friends/colleagues, pet died, or you currently can't afford to buy some fancy gadget or car, then you'll <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">really</span></strong> need to reflect even deeper into what you want in life to feel fulfilled, as these are just temporary events. :)</em></p>
              <p>Once you've sorted out your thoughts, then consider how you can make what you want happen, on your own, with your own abilities and strengths. Identify and eliminate your weaknesses, so that you have even more strength within you. You can do it, if you believe in yourself, then you'll be more confident to face your future. :) Too many people look to a religion for the wrong reasons.</p>

              <p>Anyway, if you face difficulties in life, praying only provides momentarily comfort. It is your own effort and actions that will ultimately pull you through. Do not entirely shift the blame onto these spiritual assistance. What about your family members and friends? These people are not god, but they can provide equally good encouragement too. =) </p>
