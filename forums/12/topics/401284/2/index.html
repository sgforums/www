              <p>My suggestion is do some indepth study on what Buddhism and
              Buddhist practice is about, then decide for yourself what you want
              when you have a clearer picture.</p>
              <p>Here's something my moderator Longchen wrote which I feel needs
              to be emphasized about the difference between folk
              ritual/superstition, and true Buddhism.</p>
              <div>
              <p><strong>Hi Vexteen,</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Just a sharing.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The main difference (to me) about superstition and the
              real practice is that the emphasis is entirely
              different.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Folk ritual is mainly about seeking protection from Gods
              and Boddhisatvas. In fact, to most people, this is their main
              concern. They are not interested in helping
              themselves.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>For the real spiritual practice, it is about helping
              ourself, not seeking protection from deities. In fact, one's life
              may be even worst (on the conventional sense) when one is on the
              real path... that has been my own experience... at least. This is
              neccessary to break through the way we percieve life.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Hope this sums up things. :)</strong></p>
              <p><strong>.........</strong></p>
              <div class="quote_body" style="display: none;">
              <p>hi geis,</p>
              <p>thanks for your candour... anyway, in my own journey too, i go
              thru countless ups and downs and it will continue... i think it is
              happening for all of us... it is always harder to improve than to
              backslide.  The teacher can hammer us into shape, but he/she
              is not around always... we have to have a very very strong
              mind.  There is so much suffering always, in all aspects of
              life, for oneself and for others, such incredible suffering.
              Sometimes, one wonders why samsara is so exceedingly painful. 
              everyone is going thru their share of suffering... if we really see
              the pain, we can develop renunciation, it becomes a source of
              strength to further pick ourselves up again and again, over and
              over and then to walk on.  Actually, there is no other choice,
              one has to complete the journey by oneself, opting out is not an
              option. Seeing this deeply for oneself, it is a endless cause for
              compassion for others too...  the more one sees it for
              oneself, the more sadness one has for others too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>
              <p><strong>To me, the more i walk the path, the clearer i see that
              there is no way to prevent difficulties in life. There will come a
              point when you just let go...</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Rather than fight with reality, see through its
              illusionary nature... There is no self there in all the
              happenings... Self is the reaction to the happening... that is
              manifesting spontaneously. Even the anger, emotions, etc have no
              self-agent...</strong></p>
              <p><strong>From my experience, it is very hard to see the
              illusionary nature in the midst of pain. The pain is too real to be
              illusionary...</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>p.s. you can check out <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jenchen.org.sg/">http://www.jenchen.org.sg/</a> to find out more about
              what Buddhist practice is about. The articles are easy to
              understand. My Master (Ven Shen Kai) was once a Christian pastor,
              but he converted to a Buddhist monk after doing indepth study of
              Buddhism which totally changed his perspective and understanding
              about what Buddhism is about.</p>

              <p>i agree with you that "one's life may be worse when one is on the real path".  my troubles come when i decide to go on the path.  a spiritual teacher said that these troubles surface because one is on the path.  it's a battle between spirit (heart) and mind.  the mind will always tell you to give up and that it is useless to walk this path.  maybe i am at this stage.  too much resistance.</p>
              <p>when you face too much resistance, do you quit the path temporarily and rejoin when conditions are more conducive or persist and face the worst outcome possible ? </p>
              <p>my experience on this path has been meandering.  sometimes a detour takes me to places where i have insights.  and i come back with a fresh perspective.  other times, it was running away like quitting strenuous weight training.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Life is truly perplexing; but among
                  many of these deep questions, the point of existence often worries
                  men the most. In our respective ways, we always try to make sense
                  of the world we live in. Hence we will attempt to provide meaning
                  to our experience, being part of our process to decipher the code
                  of life, through the paradigm we chose to view
                  from.  </p>
              <p>Since you have posted in AA, I would take it that you
                  probably want a secular response since it’s mundane to talk about
                  any particular faith here in AA. Hence, allow me to share about the
                  philosophical aspect of your question.</p>
              <p>Because looking through the religion’s paradigm is one
                  of the perspectives we could employ to make meaning to our
                  experience and reveal (in some sense) the point of our individual
                  existence - surely, one’s understanding of what’s life and the
                  point of existence will definitely differ from others. But why
                  should it stop us from trying to find the answers we need to
                  appease our insatiable spiritual hunger?</p>
              <p>All religion claims that they hold the ultimate truth,
                  but in reality, like what Protagoras said: man is the measure of
                  all things.</p>
              <p>Therefore, depending on the nature of your spiritual
                  dissatisfaction, you might not actually need to do a ‘either or’
                  selection; like between religion X or religion Y.</p>
              <p>Understand the nature of your dissonance and what
                  exactly you are disturbed about your present belief would help you
                  to decide what you really want.</p>
              <p>Because at the end of the day, we want to choose a
                  religion that is relevant to our life - since the definition
                  of relevance is relative to us.</p>
              <p>Aside to TS: if you need to clarify religious
                  beliefs, values, thoughts, question, perspective, etc, please
                  do so in the respective forum/s - AA is secular. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
              <p>Cheers</p>

              <p>thanks for your comment.  i did intend to post in AA due to its secular nature.  i didn't know if i shld post in buddhism or christianity forum because currently i am speaking more as a free thinker.</p>

              <p>Instead of immediately thinking of a religion as the answer to
              your current state of mind, why not spend <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">some quiet time on your
              own</span></strong>, with no one else to influence your thoughts.
              Go somewhere peaceful and quiet, where you can be
              relaxed. Personally, I would recommend meditation to help
              relax your mind, to think better. (<em>Meditation is not
              exclusive to any religion, regardless of what anyone says. It can
              be used purely as a non-religious relaxation technique.)</em> Think about what sort of life you want to lead, and what will make
              you truly happiest and most fulfilled in life? Think long-term, not
              short-term.</p>
              <p><em>Since you didn't mention what your current "life issue" is,
              I presume you're thinking more deeply into your own life. If you're
              currently perplexed because you just broke up with bf/gf,
              quarrelled with parents/friends/colleagues, pet died, or you
              currently can't afford to buy some fancy gadget or car, then you'll
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">really</span></strong> need to
              reflect even deeper into what you want in life to feel fulfilled,
              as these are just temporary events. :)</em></p>
              <p>Once you've sorted out your thoughts, then consider how you can
              make what you want happen, on your own, with your own
              abilities and strengths. Identify and eliminate your weaknesses, so
              that you have even more strength within you. You can do it, if
              you believe in yourself, then you'll be more confident to face your
              future. :) Too many people look to a religion for the wrong
              reasons.</p>
