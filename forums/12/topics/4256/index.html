My ex broke off with me after 2 and a half years of being a loving friends. I myself enjoyed letting her see all my successes and touched by her support through my failures.<br><br>I broke off with her last month and I suffered. The pain in you is 2 times more unbearable than mine as yours was a 6 years relationship. At the moment, I can understand you are encountering problems and seriously need her support to help you go through the difficultities you are facing. There is deep emptyness in our heart and refusing to believe that it is happening. However don't forget there is your friends and family right by your side when you are in trouble. They are the ones who can provide the warmth of love.<br><br></div>

I do empathise wif u, esp when u tried all ur means to win her back but to no avail.. that's the worst blow I suppose... Even I would have come to the end of my wits if I have been thinking of ways to walk by my ex's side.<br><br>But like wat Jazmyn says life have to move on... u did wat u can for her. u did all  u can for the r/s.. u did well.. u even understand her even when she says that she wants to be alone... U give her the time and things that she wanted... that's rally very nice of u.. But have u tot for urself?? Is life going to hang there for u.. the grass will grow, and flowers will bloom, whether u r there to notice it. but I sure hope that the plants will bear fruits in the end.<br><br>In my opinion, ur gf is still not that matured in a long term r/s. Becoz in a LT r/s, a r/s will turn blend, it will be close to a marriage. things things will not be as happy and as enthusiastic as before... But show her that u care... show here that all these yrs though much have change, but ur love for her, ur care showered upon her has never dwindled... Maybe a couple of proof to show a LT r/s will happen this way, but show it to her where the destination will be... I think she needs some reassurance.. Coz 6 yrs wif out any progress will be something worrying, esp to a girl. Maybe u can birng in ur parents or haer parents into picture, saying that no matter how long they have bene together, they sill love each other. Moreover I dun think, parents will still say 'I love you' to each other nowadays.. but u can be sure of their feelings and love for each other.<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hate to admit it also but when a person had a change of heart, be it a guy or a gal, there's very slim chances of going back together.<br><br>Can understand you are going thru a rough time, cos i am going thru part of what had happened to you. Terrible yr, the yr 2000, so lets hope that 2001 will be much better. But to be frank also, there's nothing much we can do, esp since you tried in vain for the past 3 mnths to win her heart back. 6 yrs is definitely a looooong time, and i am sure it will take you mnths or a yr or 2 b4 u actually forget abt her.<br><br>Give yrself some more time to forget abt her, and at the meantime, keep yrself occupid by getting a new job and work hard. I am sure you will feel better if you are able to recover part of yr losses such as getting yrself a new car etc. It will not help totally but it can cover part of the pain you are going through now.<br><br>Regards<br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"</div>

Just to tell you are not alone in this world. Relationship can take very big turns due to many reasons like quarrels, difficult situations,tireness...etc.<br><br>Well, all I can said is that you should try to calm down and don't talk to her for a couple of days. Maybe right now, she's angry with you over some matters or just don't want to see or talk to you. Once both of you are ready to talk it out and understand the root of the problem you both are facing.<br><br>If it is turn out the same, just try to face it like a man.
