            <div class='col-md body'>Magnus, why must u say "No offense" ?<br><br>If he is indeed attracted by the simplicity of the Thai girl, it's not something to be embarassed about or offended about. I think it is a very healthy attraction, rather than, say, looks, or other superficial things. I think character-type of atttraction is deeper and should be the one people go after for.<br><br>Anyways, G6PD, at this point, more time is needed before u think about marriage, moving to another country etc. That one is later. Now u and her must develop the relationship more, first. Why think about marriage and moving when the relationship is not solid yet? Now, just work on the relationship, then later when both are u are very sure about the relationship, and financially more stable too, then the marriage plans and moving plans can be thought.<br><br>It is not easy to keep a long-distance relationship. U must find ways to overcome this so that both of u can still get to know each other better and better and make the relationship stronger, even though it is long-distance.<br><br>OK good luck<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okie, let Lingos give ya a reality check.<br>My friend has gone through this thing before... and don't be p|ssed with me for being cynical. I'm usually cynical when he comes to any relationship.<br><br>One loser (not that handsome sad job guy) goes to Thailand with his sister. Ends up meeting someone who was pretty okie. She was a student in tourism, worked in the backpacker motel/hotel that he was staying in. No sex, just conversation. He came back calling her his girlfriend. All of us, especially me was rolling my eyes.... I did tell you he was a loser. After all, how could you call her your girlfriend when 1) you've only seen her for 3 days, spoke to her like 4 sentences or something. Okie okie, relationships should not be measured by time. But... he's just a sad individual. The thing was, he was treated like top dog in Thailand so he loved it so much, within a month of corresponding to Ann in Thailand, sending pics, emails, phone calls blah blah.. he decides to go to Thailand AGAIN for another month.<br><br>This time, he goes up there to see her.. she picked him up at the airport with a girlfriend. You can guess what happened. She "breaks up with him" without a couple of days.. with a month left to kill. What happens? He goes on some drunken rampagne (why else would you go to Thailand??) with some 2 drink minimum ho' in the local dive. This girl had just been "dumped" by her Swedish Ja me like backpacker "boyfriend".. i use the word boyfriend loosely again.. as this is clearly a holiday fling. Anyway this ho' started showing him more than just Thailand if you catch my drift.....<br><br>So he comes back saying OMG i have a new "girlfriend".... so after a month of phone calls and lots of money TTed over to her... he decides to go back and see her again. Meanwhile, i'm rolling my eyes going.. you have no idea what you're getting into. But hey go for your life. Guess what.. he has some stupid ceremony that they are "together" or whatever it is.. supposedly he says that it wasn't a marriage. I'm like.. okie whatever girlfriend. He comes back after a month in Thailand...  she keeps ringing him for some more dosh. He refused, she hung up the phone and said eff off. Meanwhile, her and her posse have gone onto find some other backpacker boyfriends.<br><br>Well.. there you go.. i'm sorry about being nasty.. that is what i can say about this holiday affairs. BUt hey.. for some people it does work out. It's very hard and ya gotta be prepared for cynical friends like me rolling my eyes. Be brave if it is what you really want and believe in. I for one is still constantly fighting with my mum about this different culture boyfriend thing. But ... i'm standing my ground!</div>

She's quite fair for a thai and comes from a well to do<br>family. She has a very sweet voice, which melts me heart everytime I hear her talk.<br>We manage to go out on a few meetings and both of us express interest in each other.<br>So I tease whether she want's to come singapore with me, she said yes. We took quite<br>a few pictures together and whenever I miss her, I will look at her photos. However,<br>I have to come back to singapore and she has to continue her studies. Initially, we<br>manage to stay in contact via sms and email and I called her everynight (starting),<br>but she told me not to call her everyday as its expensive to call her, and tell me to<br>save money (incoming is free for thai mobile) and that she would always say she miss me.<br>After a few months, I couldn't contact her and felt very sad. So I thought to meself,<br>just forget it. To me surprise, a few months later, I got her sms as well as email too.<br>I called her up and found out what actually happen for the period of lost contact.<br>She also came this month with her school for a study trip and I manage to meet up with her.<br>Although its only a 3 day 2 night visit, it really brought me back to memory lane.<br>Throughout the 2 nights, I met upwith her and met her friends as well. It was really<br>and interesting experience as it's me first time with so many thais. I could only speak<br>very little thai but I guess its sufficient enough hehe. When she was her, we are like a couple<br>hold hands, sweet talk, take pics.. everythings is like a dream, only come true.<br>Anyway, after she got back, she sms me everyday and I call her up at least once a week (a few<br>minutes each time only)<br><br>I really can't bear to see her leave that day and she cried abit after checking in at the airport.<br>She is so much better that most of the sg gals I met in terms of character, and me friends told me<br>thai gers really take care of the guy, which is very true. I'm also thinking of visiting her again<br>in a few months time.<br><br>Now here's the problem, should I continue this type of relationship? A few questions often<br>raise up:<br>1) language barrier, her English is quite limited and sometimes need to help of her pda<br>dictionary<br>2) she stays in the northeast region of thailand, quite sometime to get there (200 plus km from<br>bangkok)<br>3) If we were together eventually, how will she adapt in singapore? Where can she work in singapore<br>Will she bear to leave her friends, family (she's the only child)<br>4) I asker her if she wants to be with me, she say yes but I'm not sure whether she can adapt here<br>(she once sms me that she wants me to know I belong in her life)<br>5) If I were to marry her, citizenship wise and getting a hse n all, quite tough financially.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>Dear G6PD,<br><br>You know this girl in a disco.. Went out a few times.. chatted.. How well do you know her.. All you know is that she comes from a good family.. A uni student.. what else you know about her?? Like you says.. communication is one big barrier.. Are you sure and confident to have and maintain a long distance relationship?? Not even talking about marriage..<br><br>Do remember that you won't get to see each other often... Though thailand is not far.. but how often can you go over and see.. You got to work.. She got to study.. A newly couple would want to have the company of the other always.. Are you btoh able to withstand it?? There are many problems in having a long distance relationship.. If you think you can overcome all the obstacles.. then give it a shot.. But i can tell you.. normally it wont last that long.. if you wan a stable and lasting one..<br><br>However.. if you really wan to have this r/s.. you have to talk to her about the problems that both will be facing.. make clear.. And see what's her views on it..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
