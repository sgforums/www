              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> You have already limited yourself with absolute possibilities - for the choice of one must be a sacrificial of another.</p>
              <p>Why should that always be the case?</p>
              <p>You know, in this post-modern society, we are so caught up in the concept of rationality that we literally engage this rational sense of ours in all aspects of our life and submerged ourselves in calculation of what's the most 'profitable choice' at the end of the day. Like the scenario you have presented: furthering your studies for a good future verse keeping your relationship and 'sacrifice' your future?</p>
              <p>Firstly, your future is not sacrificed even if you don't go overseas and study. This is already a gross mispresentation. It's not as if you are sentenced to sixteen years jail during your prime years and screwed up your future in that sense.</p>
              <p>The risk factor you have advocated is nothing but the existence of fear where Love absolutely cannot tolerate. Hence, it began to chip at your relationship until the cleft becomes a hole and before you realize it, you have lost the relationship to some self-generated fear, topple with adverse circumstances.</p>
              <p>In Love, so what if the relationship fails? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What's with this obsession with a failing relationship anyway?</strong></span> Have we become so rationalized with obtaining 'perfect scores' and 'good results' that we cannot have the imagination and higher understanding that there are times in love (and life)Â  when we must fall in the beginning to win later?</p>
              <p>Failure suggested growth and not degeneration - the latter often revealed an unevolved soul.</p>
              <p>The irony of Love is that why focus on the fact that a relationship would fail when one should focus on leading the relationship while it last and make the best out of it?</p>
              <p>Interestingly, you don't always lose when you have lost your relationship.</p>
              <p>Think about it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>Go where your heart takes you to.</p>
              <p>If you desire overseas, then go overseas.</p>
              <p>If not, stay and start planning and building your future.</p>

              <p>I've experiencedÂ a bad relationship after going australia for further studies last july. IMO, you need a good foundation to maintain a strong and healthy relationship, because you are not physically there for him/her when you go overseas.</p>
              <p>It is worth sacrificingÂ either the relationship or your education, but it is best not to mixÂ them together. I had aÂ terrible time when I broke off with my gf,Â plus I still have not adapt to the lifestyle and studies over there. It served as a reminder for meÂ to learn from this mistake.</p>
              <p>I would suggest that you go for overseas studies, since it is much more enriching than just being in a relationship.Â Who knows, you might find a better suitor over there.</p>

              <p>hi</p>
              <p>I am currently undertaking a 2 year course in civil engineering in UNSW, sydney.Â  I have already been here for a year...another year to go!</p>
              <p>Lifestyle wise, I would say it is very enriching. I have made friends from around the world and learned alot from their cultures and such. I hesitated before making this choice, but I am glad I chose this path.</p>
