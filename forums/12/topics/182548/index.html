If she gives subtle hints like sitting to closer to you than she usually does, talks about your relationship with her, etc... then my guess is that she still likes you. No guarantee for that, maybe she just needs comfort, which resulted in the above actions.<br><br>But as you two meet more often and if the hints got more and stronger, most likely she likes you. If those hints go off after a few meetings and she no longer wants to meet you, you are just someone whom she confides to.</div>
