              <p>My gf &amp; I have been together for almost a year. I can say i love her a lot, to the extent where the thought of her being unhappy/in pain irks me...</p>
              <p>But if there is 1 thing about her i can't stand, it's her temper. She gets angry very easily, even minor things like hot weather. I suspect she has "princess temper". I ALWAYS give in to her &amp; chase after her even when she is in the wrong. Due to this, i think, she is becoming more confident that i would go after her &amp; started to walk away from me without even turning her head to see if i'm after her...</p>
              <p>I do my responsibilities as a boyfriend as best as i can. I really do LOVE her, but sometimes, whenever she throws her temper, i tell myself: "Oh not again!". Because her throwing her temper means, very often, an hour at least of chasing after her, apologising to her &amp; making her forgive me.</p>
              <p>She always blames her temper on me: "Who ask you to do the wrong things" &amp; "Who ask you to say the wrong thing?".</p>
              <p>I am someone who is very soft-hearted. I can't bear to leave her &amp; she has a way with me. She knows how to make me feel soft. Heck, i can't even bear to walk away when she walks off away from me. I will always, without any option, chase after her to patch things back as i don't want to ruin a beautiful day.</p>
              <p>My question, most importantly, is: "Is there any way to change her temperament?". We had many talks about this &amp; she would always tell me she won't get angry so easy anymore... But time after time, she does. I'm feeling really helpless...</p>

              <p>I can tell you, if he does that, the next quarrel will start with "euu lather tok to my frens than me izit? euu dun rikes me anymore har?'" bla bla bla. I think it would be better for TS to approach her directly in a more discreet manner instead; simply remind her about her promise tactfully (eg. in a joking tone) every time she throws her tantrum.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I don't know nowadays what is the definition of love for the young people but seems to me what you are experiencing is not really love andI suspect neither is she. You're both actually in love with love the act itself. No one who is sensible enough will give way until like your case. You're just spoiling her. Perhaps deep down you feel you are more inferior to her or beneath her and feels very lucky that among all the guys she have met she chose you to be her boyfriend. So it was just natural of you to want to hang on to her becase you feel that if she hasn't chosen you, you would have still been alone. That! is not love. That! is just being feeling wanted and belonged like 'Thank God, someone finally take me. I'm not unsaleable anymore!'</p>
              <p>She, on the other hand may or may not realize it that subconsciously she can wrap you around her fingers but onething for sure is she certainly knows how to take full advantage of your weak personality to 'bully' you into submission.</p>
              <p>Right now you may feel that without her you will be miserable and even take on the blames that you were really at 'fault' here for making her angry because of fear of losing her but how about in the long run? You are still what I call in the phase of 'love' and that is why you are able to put up with her crap but as I said for long can you tolerate such irrational behavior</p>
              <p>Young man, we are all human beings with emotions and we continue to change as we aged and grow. As your thinking get more mature and as you meet more and more people especially the opposite sex you will start to compare them to your girlfriend. You may not do it consciously but it will catch you out of the blue. Believe me in that split second you will be shock in thinking 'Why did such a thought occur?' and in that split second you will began to waver in your feelings for her. You will question yourself of your so-called love for her.</p>
              <p>Ok, maybe just maybe you truly truly love her for young people nowadays love to fantasize about perfect love that is "If I love her that much I will put up with whatever she dish out to me. I will love her unconditionally no matter how unreasonable she is" But don't you think you are over spoiling her and encouraging her to bully you? In that sense you are really the one at fault for encouraging her to develop such behaviour.</p>
              <p>Your girlfriend behavior is no different from that of a child. She knows she can get away with murder so to speak if she throws a tantrum if you do not accede to her whims and fancy. She has you tightly twirl around her little finger. She knows she is very important to you thus she will not hesitate to openly show you her tantrum.</p>
              <p>It may still be fine if she do it in private with you but if you let her continue and 'encourage' her in such behaviour I won't be surprise if she will do it openly to you right in front of your friends, colleagues and even relatives and families.</p>
              <p>Anyway if you really think you really love her that much and was thinking of spending the rest of your life with her I think you should make some changes. Help her to be a better person to treat you better. Don't let her walk all over you and seriously review this relationship if it is worth your effort. Think whether you are the one that is actually at fault here for encouraging such behaviour from her and if yes try to change it, you don't want to overspoil her until where one day you cannot take it anymore only to regret about your action which by that time might be a little late as both of you may have gotten married or even worse with kids.</p>
              <p>Do think carefully.</p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>if she really loves you she wouldnt do that to you.</p>
              <p>you dont really need to break up or anything. when she throws that kind of temper again, just walk away. Be hard to get. enough is enough.</p>
              <p>Then see how the situation goes. She should to know the limit.</p>
              <p>Anyways, if you always give in to her, most likely in the long run, she would dump you.</p>

              <p>Fact is, I used to have a girlfriend like yours(mine was longer - say 2 1/2 years) spoilt her thoroughly. Same thing, however I was submissive(trust me I had to punch myself till my face swelled up just so I can take my exam in school).</p>
              <p>Brace up. You love her, she doesn't. She just needs a pet. And you are a whimpy little puppy. Smack her in the face and say "you got served, bitch".</p>

              <p>I don't know nowadays what is the definition of love for the young people but seems to me what you are experiencing is not really love andI suspect neither is she. You're both actually in love with love the act itself. No one who is sensible enough will give way until like your case. You're just spoiling her. Perhaps deep down you feel you are more inferior to her or beneath her and feels very lucky that among all the guys she have met she chose you to be her boyfriend. So it was just natural of you to want to hang on to her becase you feel that if she hasn't chosen you, you would have still been alone. That! is not love. That! is just being feeling wanted and belonged like 'Thank God, someone finally take me. I'm not unsaleable anymore!'</p>
              <p>She, on the other hand may or may not realize it that subconsciously she can wrap you around her fingers but onething for sure is she certainly knows how to take full advantage of your weak personality to 'bully' you into submission.</p>
              <p>Right now you may feel that without her you will be miserable and even take on the blames that you were really at 'fault' here for making her angry because of fear of losing her but how about in the long run? You are still what I call in the phase of 'love' and that is why you are able to put up with her crap but as I said for long can you tolerate such irrational behavior</p>
              <p>Young man, we are all human beings with emotions and we continue to change as we aged and grow. As your thinking get more mature and as you meet more and more people especially the opposite sex you will start to compare them to your girlfriend. You may not do it consciously but it will catch you out of the blue. Believe me in that split second you will be shock in thinking 'Why did such a thought occur?' and in that split second you will began to waver in your feelings for her. You will question yourself of your so-called love for her.</p>
              <p>Ok, maybe just maybe you truly truly love her for young people nowadays love to fantasize about perfect love that is "If I love her that much I will put up with whatever she dish out to me. I will love her unconditionally no matter how unreasonable she is" But don't you think you are over spoiling her and encouraging her to bully you? In that sense you are really the one at fault for encouraging her to develop such behaviour.</p>
              <p>Your girlfriend behavior is no different from that of a child. She knows she can get away with murder so to speak if she throws a tantrum if you do not accede to her whims and fancy. She has you tightly twirl around her little finger. She knows she is very important to you thus she will not hesitate to openly show you her tantrum.</p>
              <p>It may still be fine if she do it in private with you but if you let her continue and 'encourage' her in such behaviour I won't be surprise if she will do it openly to you right in front of your friends, colleagues and even relatives and families.</p>
              <p>Anyway if you really think you really love her that much and was thinking of spending the rest of your life with her I think you should make some changes. Help her to be a better person to treat you better. Don't let her walk all over you and seriously review this relationship if it is worth your effort. Think whether you are the one that is actually at fault here for encouraging such behaviour from her and if yes try to change it, you don't want to overspoil her until where one day you cannot take it anymore only to regret about your action which by that time might be a little late as both of you may have gotten married or even worse with kids.</p>
              <p>Do think carefully.</p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>My gf &amp; I have been together for almost a year. I can say i love her a lot, to the extent where the thought of her being unhappy/in pain irks me...</p>
              <p>But if there is 1 thing about her i can't stand, it's her temper. She gets angry very easily, even minor things like hot weather. I suspect she has "princess temper". I ALWAYS give in to her &amp; chase after her even when she is in the wrong. Due to this, i think, she is becoming more confident that i would go after her &amp; started to walk away from me without even turning her head to see if i'm after her...</p>
              <p>I do my responsibilities as a boyfriend as best as i can. I really do LOVE her, but sometimes, whenever she throws her temper, i tell myself: "Oh not again!". Because her throwing her temper means, very often, an hour at least of chasing after her, apologising to her &amp; making her forgive me.</p>
              <p>She always blames her temper on me: "Who ask you to do the wrong things" &amp; "Who ask you to say the wrong thing?".</p>
              <p>I am someone who is very soft-hearted. I can't bear to leave her &amp; she has a way with me. She knows how to make me feel soft. Heck, i can't even bear to walk away when she walks off away from me. I will always, without any option, chase after her to patch things back as i don't want to ruin a beautiful day.</p>
              <p>My question, most importantly, is: "Is there any way to change her temperament?". We had many talks about this &amp; she would always tell me she won't get angry so easy anymore... But time after time, she does. I'm feeling really helpless...</p>

              <p>Have you been spending time with your gf daily? If the answer is no, then maybe you have found the reason for her intolerable temper.</p>
              <p>Must spend at least 5 to 15mins of your focused time with her everyday...whether you like it or not. No girlfriends in this world would mind hearing from their boyfriends daily, and No girlfriends in this world would like to be ignored for even a single day...with exception that the love no longer exists in the relationship.</p>
              <p>Make sure your 5 to 15mins of focused time is FOCUSED on her. TALK to her, communicate, tell her how much you missed her and loved her, show concern for her well-being, be sensitive to her hints, hold her and give her a good hug to show her she is still very much important to you and you still cared, show her you still love her very much (even sometimes you don't really feel that everyday, only on those days when you are feeling horny), and most importantly...by talking to your girlfriend daily, you are actually allowing her to de-stress herself and unload/pour all her grievances on you (which we have plenty).</p>
              <p>Try it and tell me if it works, but most importantly, be sincere when you plan to do it...otherwise, if she finds out you're taking her for granted, things might just get alot worse than it is.</p>

              <p>sometimes as a guy, you need to know just when to shut up. it will save you a lot of trouble and angst, also prevent you from becoming a door mat.</p>
