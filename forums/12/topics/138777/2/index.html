            <div class='col-md body'>Hello...<br><br>I've got some thoughts to share. It's true that looks is not everything. But it's also true that looks still play a major part, at least in the beginning (impression).....So if u can improve it, just try what u can do...<br><br>Like, can u try increase ur height? If u are still young, do sports and eat, maybe even try some of those height-improvement equipments (dunno effective anot).<br><br>Other than height, get a nice haircut, sleep to remove ur panda eyes, apply some lip-stuff for ur lip problem, scrub ur face, dress up, go workout abit for ur body, etc...... Coz it all would help....not only ur height matters......<br><br>And...yeah.....talk more confidently.....I've seen too many examples of this principle with my very own eyes....definitely will help alot.....<br><br></div>
