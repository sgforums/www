            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm 18 years old nvm. But try to have a GF before 30yrs old. My SS teacher says that due to education and society, alot of people are not getting married, or married at an older age. In the past, people used to get married at around 24-26 yrs old, now is around 29.3 yrs old. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> Which is quite old larh, then my teacher also say having children at older ages is more risker. Studies have shown that if you plan to have children at older age, the danger of giving birth to a child rises sharply. Also, you risk giving birth to a deformed baby , such as down syndrome.<br><br>Alot of people dont want to have children/get married at an early age is simply because of their stupid carrier, with the stupid phrase "my carrier comes first, r/s 10 years later then talk." What i believe is that if you can balance your carrier and family, you shouldn't have problems.<br><br>But at 18 dont worry larh, if 30+ liao still haven got GF then start to worry. 18 is still very young. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Oh ya, i would like to ask you guys something.

Any guys/boys here WILL NEVER marry a girl who earns more than you, have a higher position than yours, and is richer? Anyone got such thinkings?</blockquote>Hm.<br>The same for girls as well.<br>Many girls will think twice (some never) when marrying a guy who earns less than she does, or is much lower down on the food chain (ha, food chain.) than she is.<br>Or shorter. Etc.<br><br>Reason being. It's all biological, me thinks.<br>Why do girls prefer taller guys? Because it gives her a sense of security. It gives the psychological effect that he is more dominant (thus more desirable) and stronger than shorter, stumpy guys, when she could be a sumo wrestler, shorter than him and much stronger than he is.<br>It's all in the society mindset.<br><br>When he earns less than she does and either of them don't like it.<br>Simple logic. One reason to explain this is that in ancient times, a man who can provide for his woman/women was not only larger, taller, stronger, he was also more dominant, hence he got a larger share of everything.<br>A man earning big bucks today is put in the same context, same logic. He can provide more, he gets a larger share of everything because he can afford to.<br>This equates to him being able to care for the family, the kids.<br>In the end, a woman looks at a man and can feel everything from A - Z, but she cannot deny the human evolutionary root that we humans have been living by since the dawn of human kind - that the man's worth is his ability to stay long enough to provide for her and their brood.<br>And the man, that a woman is fit enough to bear his children and carry on his genes, the more women, the better. (Even if one woman is the "main" one and the rest are all "sexual outlets".)<br><br>So...that's the low down.<br>The thing...are we strong enough to think differently, to break from these biological ties and move higher up the evolutionary ladder?<br><br></div>
