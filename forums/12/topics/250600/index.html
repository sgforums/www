            <div class='col-md body'>My friend said that i'm anti-social cos i don't foster deep bonding with them but on the other hand, im not there interested in their activites in the first place. I have other preferances but then, i haven't been purposely pursuing them yet. Different people, when come together creates different synergy and chemistry. I just found that i can't really click with them, though i have been hanging out with them for quite sometime. i'm always the wall-flower and in the shadow. These people do not really understand the real me. Lately, i have a fall-out with one of them and it is really bad. Common friends lament me and scolded me and i felt darn sad..Perhaps i haven't handle the things not very correctly but then i never intended to hurt my friend. I used to consider this friend as very good friend but now both parties feelings are hurt. I just don't feel the same anymore when i see her. Infact, seeing her remind me of there incident which was never intended to be and thus make me feel guilty.<br><br>After this incident, i have began to question the value of friendships and whether i should patch up with her. Is it my fault for laying myself in this "trouble" in the first place? Perhaps, when i know i can't really click with them, i shouldn't have hang out with them. I was thinking of being open-minded and tolerant of people who are different than me but i just found out that.. being different.. brings out alot of unfufilling unhappiness in me. It is a pity that i have to let her and some of the friends go but then im glad we aren't enemy. it is a pity cos i have spent energy, emotion, efforts and time on it. It is a pity things have to turn out there way and i'm sorry for causing it.<br><br></div>
