              <p>Anyway, quiet, alone, and do thing by yourself is ok, many peoples also DIY mah, bet it is part of your parent genes, you mom or dad must be damn quiet too. Sometime when i attend funneral, there are those so quiet ones, only a few peoples, most probably the person who passed away must be someone like you. Quietly come, quietly Go </p>

              <p>The only way to deal with your problem is to talk to someone closest to you. Do things that people tend to do or try out new stuffs, like, sports etc. You basically need to remove that feeling of shyness. Train yourself, braise yourself, try to talk to people in a different manner, watch videos about socialising etiquettes. You practically need to be a " Yes" man or woman and opportunities will come to you and you will metamorphosize into a beautiful, sociable woman who everybody wants to be with. Being reticent won't get you anywhere. If you want to be noticed, you gotta be a optimist and try to keep your conversations going.</p>
              <p>Always remember, employer or friends love a gregarious person. Anyone can be. Just gotta try get used to it. It's not too late dear.</p>

              <p>Don't worry. Work experience will teach you a valuable lesson about life. It comes with the experience, you will soon learn how to overcome this and get used to it. Work is about adapting. You cannot avoid the situation: people you think are boisterous, you cannot simpy avoid the person, you must adapt.</p>
              <p>Sometimes work experience change a person - it is survival of the fittest. Sorry to say, at some point a bad experience in life may force a person to change their personality to adapt. I have seen quiet and nice people change over the course of time due to the nature of their work. Its up you to use this experience and harness it positively rather than let it negatively affect you.</p>
              <p>About friendships, its just something that will come to past. Yes friendships may lasts but once people get married and have children, usually friendships are placed down the priority lists. Sorry to say, that is the common thing happening. You may soon lose touch with your Poly friends, only able to meet them like once every quarter, once in six months or once a year - when they progress to marriage and sometimes even get overseas placement assignments.</p>
              <p>The place that you can build friendships with, are the people at your work place. However, its tough because work conflicts may affect that friendship. Those are the challenges you need to undertake.</p>
              <p>Look to building relationships with guys, seek life partner. That is a lifelong friendship that people cherish. Of course not saying friendship not important, just that, you should not take it like its really first priority in life.</p>
              <p>You just see your parents, do they have a lot of friends around? Usually not many for a common family. Its because they spend so much time raising you and your siblings, they just don't have the time for friends. Perhaps they got some friends but not as many as schooldays and they don't spend that much emphasis with them. That is the progression in life - you may undertake.</p>

              <p>I am now working, already 2 years plus out in working force. I graduated from Poly and worked from then. I find that life is very hard, mostly because I am very reticent. Easy for people to bully me, to take advantage of me, make me do things to cover their backside etc. Especially now that I'm working. I try to be good, I do my best at my work. But, anything that goes wrong, fingers point at me, and I cannot defend myself cos I have a weak voice and I get tongue-tied if people suddenly focus their attention on me.</p>
              <p>It has been like this since I was young. Was a quiet kid. Sitting in corner reading books during big family outings. Then in Primary school I was quiet, but people liked to tease me because I would tease back, or blush. As I grow older I get more and more quiet. Because I don't know what to say, because I see the people around me don't seem to 'click' with me, as in they are too boisterous. I like to read. I don't like watching television, and even if I do, they are all 'old' shows, shows that are no longer 'in fashion' or 'popular'.</p>
              <p>How? Easy to say that to remedy it is to talk to people, but then the conversation doesn't flow <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"></p>
              <p>I'm quite content being quiet, I love my quiet time, to observe the clouds in the sky, or people-watch, see their emotions etc. But I desire friends. Friends who are like more in tune with me, not overly-boisterous. Because I have made friends who are really boisterous, but then they get bored of me soon, cos I am not the type keen to join in their "come let's get drunk and dance!" kind of fun.</p>
              <p>Does anyone else also have this experience? Of being so super quiet like me? How can I overcome it? I always feel that people find me boring, and then I also get the feel that the people avoid me, cos people who are usually alone give off this 'vibe' thing that people with normal social lives can sense.</p>

              <p><br>Let me first say Hi-5 to you. I'm also a quiet person. haha...i like people-watching too, enjoying the environment around me. But i have changed ever since i went to a new sch ,after Olevels. ..okay thats a different story.Now back to the point.</p>
              <p>you know, AngelOfDarkness, I was just like you. Afraid to speak out. Getting bullied, duno how to rebut.</p>
              <p> you have to realise this: <strong>being quiet <em>not equals to</em> cannot stand up for yourself</strong></p>
              <p>when you are bullied by others, you<strong> dont have to be afraid to speak out. Because you did nothing wrong. you also have your own rights for protecting yourself, like every other individual.</strong></p>
