              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><br>Well for most pple, when you got your bf / gf, you basically kissed all your friends goodbye. So if you already have one, you can pretty much ignore that aspect.</p>
              <p>But to survive at work, it is another skill altogether other than your work capabilities. I never ever let myself get disadvantaged at work. There are a few golden rules I think you really gotta learn especially for your predicament.</p>
              <p>Working hard doesnt cut it. The most successful worker is seldom the hardest worker, but the smartest one who falls in the good books of your boss.  </p>
              <p>NEVER EVER let anybody step over you. This is something i realized during my school days. Because if some member in your project group can be a slacker and get free marks for your group work, what is there to stop such cheapskates from repeating the same crap when they get into work life?</p>
              <p>Remember there'll always be jerks who'll backstab you,  put you in the bad light over your bosses and take credit for your hard work.</p>
              <p>I make it a point to let my bosses know that its me, Me, ME !!! that did all the work for the events / projects. I will let my boss know if somebody didnt do a shit for anything !!</p>
              <p>Now you'll probably think that in doing so i'll be making some enemies in the workplace. But hey .. thats not backstabbing. Besides, i didnt come here to work to make friends ok? I am here to earn money and advance my own career. I will do whatever it takes to get to where I want and whatever stands in front of me will be kicked away or dealt with. It is that SIMPLE.</p>
              <p>If you do not make an enemy out of someone, sooner or later someone will make an enemy out of you.. So long your boss recognizes you as a capable worker, you are an asset to him, you can get away with murder.</p>
              <p>And never ever do anything out of your jobscope. I mean NEVER. Because if you volunteer or if you allow yourself to do something that you were not originally meant to do, your bosses or co-workers will "conveniently" think that you could do it again in the future. You are merely adding extra work on your table, you still having your own work responsibilties to fulfil is one thing, not getting paid for the extra work is the worst kind of shit i despise the most.</p>
              <p>It is a dog eat dog world out there. Sometimes the only way to survive or go on is to be more cruel and vicious than what other pple can dish out. Being nice to someone is being cruel to yourself.</p>

              <p>People like to bully me. I am by nature a very quiet person, not loud at all. I get nervous around people, and then when they start to talk very loudly, I will cringe (duno mentally only or physically too, but mentally confirm have). In office always got people tell me do this and that, and my title is 'assistant'. So sometimes hard to tell when I'm not supposed to do stuff.</p>
              <p>How to not let people bully? If someone tells me to do something, I might say 'busy now, cannot help'. But then that person will 'I also very busy, help la, short while only'. I cannot say 'no'. Help!</p>
              <p>Xiaogougou, you must be very vocal...that's your nature, right?</p>

              <p>You don't have to try to be someone else.</p>
              <p>Your conversation does not flow.. is because there is nothing in common to chat about.</p>
              <p>If you have more to relate to people.. the conversation will start to flow.</p>
              <p>Some of your friends are just superficial.. they joke and make noise. At the end of the day..such "boisters" and "fun" are <strong>meaningless</strong>.</p>
              <p>Try to hangout with people with more depth. Travel around more and experience life in quality.. not just quantity.</p>

              <p>It's not that I try to be someone else, but I try to make myself appear more interesting...although most of the time I don't give a heck about what people are talking about. If not, I will be silent all the time, even more so that I am now.</p>
              <p>Because around me, many of the people just make meaningless noise...and even those who are not predisposed to do this, will start doing this too due to peer pressure. Then it is hard to differentiate the real empty vessels and those who just do so to try to fit in.</p>

              <p>If you notice a fellow loner, will you make the first move to know him/her? If not, how to find your ideal quiet buddy. All of your type repel each other.</p>
              <p>Regarding work, since you're the type that always give in, learn to make it difficult for others. If you know you're gonna end up doing the work eitherway, make faces, snide comments and give excessive excuses whenever someone approaches you to do volunteer work. That way, they'll soon find it a bother to ask you to do stuff.</p>
              <p>And since you're a girl, woah best, try re-modelling yourself, such that you wear perhaps trendier wear, apply a bit of lipgloss or something, that helps boost your confidence when you step out of the house.</p>
              <p>Lastly, even if you're quiet or have nothing to contribute to the matter at hand, it's good to be responsive and better yet, smile [Even if it's fake]. I've been around quiet people and when they start to disappear into the background, it's really a downer because if people didn't like you, they wouldn't have bothered asking you along.</p>

              <p>yo no need to be stain-mud even if youare not near mud.</p>
              <p>they jibai and arse grw at their mouth that is their problem. you don;t have their jibai and arse growing at the mouth that is not your problem. quiet poepl everywhere they go sure get bullied. from school nursery to adult work life is like that. so they all group together band together for strength and fear that they are left alone.</p>
              <p>don;t treat your work life like your home and own life. although you may spend more than 1/2 a day there, work is alwasy work. after work you should have a life elsewhere, and no one can dictate what you can or should be, be it forcefully, or softtalk.</p>
              <p>you should immediately log out and not read here anymore. weekedns after work alone go tosomewhere quiet and serene, park pr seaside. think what you can do to make your life better, short and long term goals, need not be materialistic. set a goal for yourself to ahieve and work towards it.</p>

              <p>No, i am the way i am now is because of circumstances. This is how you survive or have an edge in this concrete jungle.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Havent you heard of the saying 'äººå–„è¢«äººæ¬º ' ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What i have other than you is courage, determination, and a whole lot of pride. I will not allow any dweeb to walk over me. If someone will have to be miserable, it has to be me to effect that misery on others rather than let somebody do it to me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To excel in the workplace, you got to have the proper attitude. If you want something, you need to show others you want it bad enough, so they know well enough to stay out of your way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My advice for you is: Dont really trust anybody in the workplace, especially those who have conflicting interests with you. If it means stepping over someone to get to the place you want, so be it. Wanna blame then blame why that fellow has to stand in your way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You need to especially build up your self esteem and be courageous. It is nothing wrong to refuse pple. Learn how to say NO in a big way. I ranted and scolded the hell outta pple who wanted to push their work to me. Yeah, i made everybody see just how shameless that weasel is. Yeah, i am selfish. But thats the way how the office works. I aint coming to the office to make friends, sorry. You dont like it, you can cry me a river.</p>

              <p>It's not that I try to be someone else, but I try to make myself
                              appear more interesting...although most of the time I don't give a
                              heck about what people are talking about. If not, I will be silent
                              all the time, even more so that I am now.</p>
              <p>Because around me, many of the people just make meaningless
                              noise...and even those who are not predisposed to do this, will
                              start doing this too due to peer pressure. Then it is hard to
                              differentiate the real empty vessels and those who just do so to
                              try to fit in.</p>

              <p>When you try to "appear" more interesting.. you are trying to fit in. To become one of "them"...thinking this is the way to be accepted by your peers.</p>
              <p>However, you don't need to behave just like them..They are loud, they are noisy.. but that does not means people will "like" them.</p>
              <p>If you are a good person.. with kind heart, helpful, sincere, honest and considerate.. people will LIKE you .. and wish to be close to you.. without the need to change your characteristic.</p>
              <p>It's ok to be different.. to be unique.. yet still be liked and accepted by others around you.</p>
              <p>As for people taking advantage of you.. that happens all the time.. loud or quiet... there's nothing wrong being assertive... as long as you do it in a non-hostile way.</p>
              <p>Indeed... saying "NO".. requires plenty of practise..it's hard to break out of the "obedience" shell... especially when we were taught from young to listen and do what our parents wish.</p>
              <p>So, after so many years of repressed emotions..it will take time to get use to that new found "rebellion" as an adult.</p>
              <p>As you test your strenght and discover your weaknesses.. you'd be able to better handle your emotion and be able to assess others and how to react to them more efficiently and effectively.</p>

              overly-boisterous. Because I have made friends who are really
              boisterous, but then they get bored of me soon, cos I am not the

              <p><br>Viewing is different from thinking, you need to preceive at least a 50% of what people are thinking, you cannot ignore mind reading of others, it part and parcel of our living, from sales to relationship, you need to preceive what peoples wants, needs and future action from us or on us. We can be doing our best, but to others we can be doing the worst. The understanding of how people look and view you is critical, and these skill is not gain just by a day, it goes with experiences from the day in and day out dealing with peoples, in relationship, you can do your best, but you also need to have a sense on how the gal or the guy view on you.</p>
