              Let me first say Hi-5 to you. I'm also a quiet person. haha...i
              like people-watching too, enjoying the environment around me.
              But i have changed ever since i went to a new sch ,after Olevels.
              ..okay thats a different story.Now back to the point.</p>
              <p>you know, AngelOfDarkness, I was just like you. Afraid to speak
              out. Getting bullied, duno how to rebut.</p>
              <p> you have to realise this: <strong>being quiet <em>not
              equals to</em> cannot stand up for yourself</strong></p>
              <p>when you are bullied by others, you <strong>dont have to be
              afraid to speak out. Because you did nothing wrong. you also have
              your own rights for protecting yourself, like every other
              individual.</strong></p>
              <div class="">btw.<a href="http://sgforums.com/users/282385" rel="nofollow">AngelOfDarkness</a>, do you feel the urge to talk to
              people?</div>

              I used to be a shy guy at work too. For a start, if you see if your colleague need assistance, don't be shy to offer a helping hand. People will start noticing you and they probably will return the favor but you must have the mindset of helping because you want to and don't expect anything else from there.
              
              Learn to observe people around you. See what they usually chat about, their hobbies etc. You can say " Hey i watched that movie too! Its pretty cool, blah blah blah." Sometimes when you are too quiet people might think you are too "cool" if you know what i mean. Join them for lunch, company gathering and stuff like that. Before you know it, people will come approach you and ask you to join them for their activities.
              
              Takes a bit to get used to it and just be sincere! Cheers

                              <p>I am now working, already 2 years plus out in working force. I
              graduated from Poly and worked from then. I find that life is very
              hard, mostly because I am very reticent. Easy for people to bully
              me, to take advantage of me, make me do things to cover their
              backside etc. Especially now that I'm working. I try to be good, I
              do my best at my work. But, anything that goes wrong, fingers point
              at me, and I cannot defend myself cos I have a weak voice and I get
              tongue-tied if people suddenly focus their attention on me.</p>
              <p>It has been like this since I was young. Was a quiet kid.
              Sitting in corner reading books during big family outings. Then in
              Primary school I was quiet, but people liked to tease me because I
              would tease back, or blush. As I grow older I get more and more
              quiet. Because I don't know what to say, because I see the people
              around me don't seem to 'click' with me, as in they are too
              boisterous. I like to read. I don't like watching television, and
              even if I do, they are all 'old' shows, shows that are no longer
              'in fashion' or 'popular'.</p>
              <p>How? Easy to say that to remedy it is to talk to people, but
              then the conversation doesn't flow <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"></p>
              <p>I'm quite content being quiet, I love my quiet time, to observe
              the clouds in the sky, or people-watch, see their emotions etc. But
              I desire friends. Friends who are like more in tune with me, not
              overly-boisterous. Because I have made friends who are really
              boisterous, but then they get bored of me soon, cos I am not the
              type keen to join in their "come let's get drunk and dance!" kind
              of fun.</p>
              <p>Does anyone else also have this experience? Of being so super
              quiet like me? How can I overcome it? I always feel that people
              find me boring, and then I also get the feel that the people avoid
              me, cos people who are usually alone give off this 'vibe' thing
              that people with normal social lives can sense.</p>

              Don't hesitate to voice out your opinions/stand. Especially if its about shouldering the blame for something you didn't do. I used to be like you, but once you're out in the working force, you've got to stick to this to keep yourself from the perils. No matter how "unnice", how overwhelmingly stressful and tense the situation gets, you have to stand up for your own rights. As long as your conscience is clear, it doesn't matter whether or not, at the end of the day, whose fault it really is as you know you've clearly not done anything wrong.
              I can totally relate to how you feel "content being quiet". I too, like to be alone in quiet places. For example, I'd sit aimlessly in a park and just watch the sky, the people, close my eyes, smell the air, feel the atmosphere. People remain in your life for a reason. You don't have to change yourself for anyone. The right friends will come along someday, :).

              <p>Agree ! Perhaps this can take away the level of impersonal atmosphere at the office. Angel Of D, try to make conversation with your colleagues (when they are free - during lunch hour or after work). Of course don't try to chat when they are busy midway work. Sometimes, you may stumble upon co-workers at the pantry, chatting away about things that may strike a familiar tone to you, that is the opportunity for you to mingle and make friends.</p>
              <p>Sometimes I find this work, even when I get into work conflicts with co-workers. We may argue or disagree but after we cool down, I come over for a tea or coffee break at the pantry with the co-worker, the ice breaks after a casual chat, and we're good again. Of course this depends on the ego of the co-worker, some may forgive and forget, but beware of those who remember.</p>
              <p>Also to be a quiet person - is not a bad thing. Some people like to have their quiet time, go to a park to think and reflect. Yes, reflection is a good habit. You should have more time to reflect on the rest of your day.</p>

              Looks like you really have a problem. 
              
              BUT hey, nobody can help you, unless you are prepared to help yourself girl!  
              
              You know your problem right? So now it time to get the solution. Join some courses e.g Toastmaster course whereby you get to practise public speaking in small groups  in a friendly environment . This could help boost your self confidence. Go for some leadership and /or self improvement  courses as well.  Even a simple basic course in deportment and  grooming , could help in improving your poise, presentation and looks and thus your self -confidence. Slowly, you will begin to assert yourself  and move on or even up  in life, instead of just being a door- mat ok?
