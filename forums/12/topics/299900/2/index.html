LOTS of points. that is if ure genuinely willing to put in effort to workout.<br><br>look at all the hot chicks and look at their partners. u realise their all not very good looking actually. but they have really good character and are fun-loving and confident. this is what attracts them. if ur gona pity urself and do really foolish things like committing suicide, then its too bad for u cos u have so many years of ur life ahead of u that would look so much brighter if u did something positive as mentioned above. develop ur confidence. its extremely important. its something i severely lack in, but im at least making an effort in building up my confidence.<br><br>soon u will realise that life is not about looks. but how u live life to the fullest. enjoy life because there are many others who lost their lives so suddenly and unpredicted. im sure they would be willing to live again given the chance.<br><br>fu.ck the thought of being pathetic cos ure not. ure an able bodied guy. ure not deaf dumb and blind and limbless which is something u should already be thankful for. do something about ur life if ure really willing to change urself.<br><br>then soon the girls will come =)</div>
