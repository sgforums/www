If you want someone to talk to, you can PM me your contact number...?<br><br>Nope... 'Losing' someone is never the end of the world... The end of the world comes truly when you wish to end it.... And nope... You have not truly lost her or anybody else whom you might really be caring for until you lost yourself... Lost your life....<br><br>Hereby, I dedicate this poem to you....<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>-Dead-</strong></span><br><br>Along came misery,<br>filling up my eyes..<br>Tears, fears...<br>My face buried in my hands of wreckery....<br><br>Wandered to this building above the world beneath my feet...<br>Wondered... About the 'heaven' above us...<br>Blurrish vision which fails to calm my heart,<br>COLD is this moment distal from the WORLD...<br><br>Step by step, I took by my feet...<br>Day by day, I tried to forget...<br>Of this dream casted into nightmares by spells..<br>Spells of which used to mystify me...<br><br>And yet as I walk I can no longer help..<br>But to walk quickly as to flee...<br>Free from this world and beyond the shadows of my own...<br>Boundaries that lives to cage me...<br><br>Yet I know if I walk long enough...<br>All my tears, I shall leave behind me...<br><br>Then this leaf that dances before me...<br>In this spring which finally arrives to greet me...<br>And that warmth which radiates from your smile...<br>Beyond hopes, you deeply hold me...<br><br>And you so gladly reached out your hand...<br>Like a candle in my snowy land...<br>Though I can't make out what I've done to deserve this...<br>I just wish.... And hunger for your touch....<br><br>By this night, I slowly reach for you...<br>May the stars guide us throughout this path...<br><br>With your hand, I led you by the stream...<br>Of this tear, which I'll see once again...<br><br>From the sky, my tear has arrived...<br>On your cheek, it has cheated on mine...<br><br>Misery... Once again filled my eyes...<br>Tears and fears, rushes back once again...<br>With my hands, buried deep down beyond....<br>And my face, only a picture remains...<br><br>Oh my life, how I've gave up on you...?<br>Oh my love, I'm so sorry for you....<br><br>If only, I knew how selfish I was...<br>And yet this day,<br>what choices would remain...?</div>
