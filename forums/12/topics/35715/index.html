Imagine that she's now stuck between kinship and love...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>I can feel how she feels now... I understand that you love her a lot. Now i suppose what she needs is a moment of peace to calm herslf down.  Yes.. like what you say her mum likes her ex a lot compared to you, but don't give up on making her opinion to change. Don't ever try saying nasty things to your gf about her mum too cus she will be very painful. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Instead. maybe you can try improving ur relationship with her mum, the more she is nasty to you, the more you tolerate until one day she will realise your sincerity to her daughter. Every mum loves their kids, so she also wants the best for her daughter too isn;t that?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>therefore treat this as a test, a barrier for you and your gf. Once you two can break this barrier, you will know that happiness is not far from you yet it's coming closer...<br><br>Trust me. Nothing counts more than a <span style="color: red;">sincere heart</span>... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>

Futhermore you said only 1 month before you both *met* up. You mean you got to know her from IRC, ICQ sort of thingy? (Correct me if I am wrong).<br><br>Conclusion: You are likely to be a pawn in this game. Please be cautious and never look just at the surface.
