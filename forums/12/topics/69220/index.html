And that should make him WAK UP from his ideas... Try anything 'funny'? It's gonna be just so much EASIER the next time you 'HIT' him again.... But this method is not recommendable unless he's really going to some extremes... Just phone calls and such? Either ignore or try to change contact no. if possible?</div></blockquote>Good call, Devil.  However, depending on what he has said and done, there may be no grounds for pressing a sexual harrassment charge, although I think harrassment stands.<br><br>It's best to have an institution like the police force taking care of this, rather than handling it as an individual - should anything go wrong, you might end up being the one in trouble, and the macho/psycho crap doesn't work anyway.  Have the cops deal with this, and the bf can act as a backup.</div>

Just keep it discreet - if too many people know about it, the loss of face may set him off.<br><br>When is your boyfriend coming back?  Do you have anyone else to provide cover for you until then?  Maybe, as ditzy said, get your father to answer the call the next time he rings, and have your dad tell him to go away.</div>
