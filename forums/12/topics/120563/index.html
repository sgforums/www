You can talked to him about this.. you aren't an insercure freak.. you jus need assurance.. jus let him know thateven he cant call.. drop msg telling you how's his doing this and that..<br><br>Speak up to him. and open up.. if not this issue will continue to frow bigger and bigger until one day you couldn't take it and you erupt! You never tell him.. he'll never know.. Mostly all guys are insensitive creatures.. you need to tell them straight and direct what you want..<br><br>Don't worry gal.. Its fine..<br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

You can't expect him to be thinking of you 24 hours around the clock, as that'll be too artificial... All you really need to know is that he do love you...

At one moment you could be free and thinking of him yet he's occupied with something.. Another moment when you're busy with your work, he might be thinking of you... It's only mature to understand that someone has their own various commitments and activities... And as you've said, asking him to do something like that would probably be too superficial...
