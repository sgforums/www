            <div class='col-md body'>How do you show someone you really love them? Small gifts? Flowers? Or is there some other ways? Smses nightly just does not seem to be enough for me to express my feeling for her. She stays in Malaysia so there limited  amount of time I can spend wih her especially since I am doing part time studies while working. Most of my wage is spend on school fees and other expenses so can't really spend much on her. Can't even call her becos of the expenses. I am thinking of sending her a 'best wish' card for her new job next month. Would that be a good idea? Maybe if I tighten my belt a bit, I can even spend some flowers along with the card. Any 1 knows any places that offer this service at a good price?</div>

Do something for her by yourself.. sincerity.. That's would be the best gift.. than buying flowers which withered in a few days.. or gifts.. which you donno whether she likes anot..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
