If you have no interest in doing so together with her alone, then why do it? Girls are very emotional beings. Despite having the iron-clad stature that they possess, they crumble with every insensitivity that you may emit. Thus by going out with her and having a liking for her initially, it only goes to show that she may ultimately, have a liking for you too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In any way, you mentioned that you and that girl are subjected to teasing by your friends and that is why, that you have changed your opinion about her. Feelings gone abruptly?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> I do not think so. Do not put yourself in a juxtapose position by placing you and her with your social circle.<br><br>Think about your feelings of her? Do you want the relationship to evolve or do you want it to cease? Ask your heart for only your heart has the answer. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">*Taken from Taufiq's Theory on Relationships*</span></div>
