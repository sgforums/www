There comes to be a day where you will "wake up" and see things as better experience learned. i used to tell myself this, - "I'm gonna love this guy and won't leave him" to guys i dated and thinks who loves me too but the results always turn out disappointing.This actually taught me to be ' smarter' in a way that another guy who comes along may not end up happily ever after with me. Yeah, i mean go ahead and scout ard, oogle at pretty gals if you want, but never ever take another gal whom you set an eye on as a substitute for your ex. Let yourself take a break.

You said that with you pestering her or rather trying to get back with her, it will jeopardise her freedom.<br><br>Well, that is a sign of a little possesiveness. And I suspect that she didn't like it one bit.<br><br>Now, I think you're a little messed up now, because you don't know what to do. You want to forget her and at the same time, (because you said you really love this girl), you want to get back with her. You can only choose one. Think abt what you want to do and make sure it is better for you as well as for her.<br><br>If she is getting irritated by you, I suggest you stop. It will only make her hate you more. But if you really love this girl, you have to let go. That's the way things should be. You can't be like a little swallow having dreams of a swan. <blockquote>The first problem for all of us, men and women, is not to learn but to unlearn.</blockquote></div>
