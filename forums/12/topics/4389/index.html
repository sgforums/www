            <div class='col-md body'>Dear ApPlE_PiE,<br><br>First thing I wonder is how old are you girl?<br><br>Secondly, I am confused with what you are saying here:<br>"although my bf and i are still having some probs,i havent think of lovin someone else...and i think my ex still loved his ex gf very much..." -&gt; I assume you currently have a BF who is a different guy and can I also assume the ex-gf you refer to here is you?<br><br>Lastly I shall give you my opinion on this matter:<br><br>Girl... when you get into a relationship with someone whom you really like, it's often difficult to remove your feelings for that someone especially if you get closer physically later (after the breakup).<br><br>You needed to feel safe that night and you held his hand and maybe for that moment, it seemed real good. Warm, cosy, definitely comfortable.<br><br>However, consider now why you guys broke up in the first place. Consider also if you still really love him and still have deep feelings or if this is just a reminisence (fond memory) of the past.<br><br>Also, it does take 2 to clap hands. Both you and the guy must mutually have feelings and love each other for who you are in character.<br><br>My advise is that you continue to remain friends with him. Don't jump into anything just because you felt good holding his hands. Any girl/guy will feel good holding hands. Heh!<br><br>PS: Just remember to be careful with so much holding hands... cause holding hands become roaming hands and roaming hands never roam to the right places.<br><br>Do let me know more details to the matter and I will definitely give you more advise on this.

Since u said your ex loved his present gf very much now, u will b a third party.  U also said u r experiencing some problems with your current bf, so how serious is this problem, mayb if u resolv it asap and tell your current bf abt this, he might understd, provided he's not those super-possessive type of guy.<br>This feeling u experienced may not be actually that u wanna to get back together with your ex, but juz tt your relationship is too close in the past lor, mayb u shd ask the guy if it's ok to hold his hand so tightly that day lor..<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>

As a counsellor, I've been hearing endless boy-girl relationship problems, especially on the topic of "sexual immorality".<br><br>I've helped girls who have been used by guys to fulfill their physical desires and it's interesting to note that most guys use the "slow and steady wins the race" method.<br><br>First they HOLD hands and then it becomes ROAMING hands where the hands suddenly touch your back or any other part of your body and then the ROAMING hands never roam to the right places because (it put it bluntly), it usually ends up under your skirt.<br><br>I was addressing a typical teen issue of petting and all.

            <div class='col-md body'>lanxx, that's right. what girls sometimes don't realise is that most guys have found out the universal law - guys are physical, girls are emotional!<br><br>after counselling girls who are young (15-19) and it's just so painful sometimes to see how their "boyfriends" are treating them by physically using them as an "experiment machine", i usually ask the girls how come they are ok with the guys doing physical things. most girls just say it's in the heat of things; however, some honest girls who traced things back did realise that the guys did tell them sweet things.<br><br>bottom line for the girls and a personal advise from me is this: if a guy REALLY says he loves you, then he should respect you AND your body! he'll be patient and also (again, i say this bluntly) he'll not want to jump right into bed with you.<br><br>real love is about putting others needs above your own. so many BGR cases start off with nice dates only to end up with sexual immorality. even if it's just petting. here's another note: when you start to do this in a relationship, you make way for more quarelling. i can't explain here how this works, but i thought about this some time ago and i've found it is a theory that is quite true in many many cases.<br><br>in essence, holding hands is good. it's nice to know that someone is there to support you should you need it. in a proper love relationship, there should be mutual accountability and support. BUT girls also need to be fully aware that the "nice" guy they've just met, might just also be addicted to pornography and wanting to just get into her slow and steady. what this makes for in the end, are broken relationships, painful breakups. worst of all, it ends up in affecting the inner life of the individual. if only teens can understand the severity of this. i've seen girls hide such things even unto marriage and their marriage isn't strong - not because they don't love their husbands but because of the violated trust she had put in men before.<br><br>in closing, if a guy says "everybody's doing it", tell him "then it shouldn't be hard for you to find someone else!". if a guy says "this is how i show my love to you", tell him "he needs to start showing his love to his mother too!".<br><br>what we need today are people with integrity, not willing to compromise and follow what the world thinks is normal.<br><br>sorry for this long post.<br><br>Daniel</div>

Just like smoking. They might think that having sex is cool, esp for guys, something to boast about to their guy friends, so that they sound more matured and more knowledged. This is the age for curiosity and experimenting.<br><br>But the bottom line is that guys have DOUBLE STANDARDS. Meaning that they can have sex with other gals, but their girlfriends must be pure and be a virgin. The more innocent they are, the merrier.<br><br>Ever heard the phrase:" Once broken, considered sold"? Think about it.</div>

If you do not love the guy, you can either try to understand him better, if he is a nice guy, you can slowly learn to like him based on his good points. If you cannot really accept him then don't, no point hurting him and yourself later. there are plenty of nice guys out there, you just need to be patient to look around.<br><br>Sadly, it is true, as mission as stated. Most guys, not all, use gals to satisfy themselves. A guy that truly loves a gal will not demand too much sexual stuff from her. Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Apple_Pie :<br><br>You did what you naturally would do. There's no wrong in your actions. However, to avoid misunderstanding, i strongly suggest that you should clarify that with your ex ASAP. Just to make sure he didn't get the wrong idea(And also to set your mind at ease). There shouldn't be any more problem after this.<br><br>To Klactovak (sorry if i spelled your name wrongly) :-<br>First of all. Ask yourself. Do you really love her ? Does she really love you ? How did you get into a situation like this ? Does she do this to every other guy she meets ?<br><br>And if you still haven't convinced yourself. How old is she and how old are you ? Do you think you'll be doing the right thing by going to bed with her ?<br><br>I know your self-control is waning. That's normal for anyone. But if you really want to stop her from ... trying to seduce you, tell her straight to the face.<br><br>I hope that helps.<br>- Aaron</div>

I'm much older and she's slightly older, just that it's all a matter of principles and perhaps guilt.  Self-control waning?  Maybe, but i think will pull through.<br><br>Does she do this to every other guy?  Don't think so and absolutely hope not.  I think she's a wonderful person and beautiful too... arrrrghhh... kinda confusing.  When you're in it, one cannot see clearly.  Guess, i just go with the flow and see what happens.  Something pleasant might happen otherwise i should be able to live with the consequences just like when my pet bird flew away...  :p</div>
