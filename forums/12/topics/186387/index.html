            <div class='col-md body'>i think to alot of people, relationships are a way of testing out compatibilities and chemistry between two people. I'd like to think that way too, but somehow i reserve that for dating. A relationship, to me, would only transpire when i feel that i am ready to embrace that person for their every aspect and all their flaws. i used to wonder if i am taking it too seriously, but after hearing how easily people and youths "get together" and "break up", i hold onto my stand. Friends have told me that i'm fussy or unrealistic. But i wouldnt want to enter a relationship just to try things out, especially when the other has high expectations and truely possess feelings for me. That would be mean, wouldnt it. If a couple of months pass before i tire and say, "i seem to have lost feelings for you" when that initial spark, curiosity and interest wears off and i find that i was never truely in like of that person for what he or she is.<br><br>But different people have their own ways of viewing relationships. Theres no point in saying that others are wrong or yours is better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I never know what true happiness really means until I'm married, and then, it's too late. J/K... Relationship is good lah, humans need to socialise, please note that it's a need, not a want or don't want. As for relationship, it's another valve of having fulfiling this social need, of course you don't need just a relationship to fulfil this need, you could have plenty of friends for example. So that need to socialise is one reason why we want to get into a relationship, and able to confid your secrets or whatsoever to someone who can listen. Besides that, it feels really sweet and warm to lie on the arms of someone you love, or someone who loves you, don't you think so? And my opinion may be a little bias because I'm talking from a person who cannot stands feeling lonely even for a day or two, I always ask my friend out every week to have fun, no matter how much work I have. Nothing beats human to human bonding.</div>
