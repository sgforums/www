              <p>If you don't embrace your fear and live life as it is, you have never really lived. You may miss out on happiness just because you fear it will end badly.</p>
              <p>Anyway, you're still young so you don't really need to talk about commitment in a relationship.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Honestly, if you would to relook at what you have typed, your fear of
                   commitment has pervades every single mote of your thoughts and 
                  rationalized them into some 'linear causal fashion' as if life indeed 
                  runs in some orderly manner. Added with tint of non-related deduction 
                  like social observation from people's failing relationship is kinda bull
                   as well.</p>
              <p>I find it absurd whenever people say things like 
                  'everyone's relationship around me is failing' and they use it as a 
                  factor (no matter how minute) to deter them from engaging in possible
                   meaningful relationship. It's almost like a gambler's fallacy, when you
                   made use of factors that makes no sense to unique situations because 
                  every set of game is different - just like every possible combination of
                   relationship in any given time is vastly different.</p>
              <p>In US 
                  alone, one car-accident-related death is accounted for every passing 13 
                  minutes. If we use the world statistic, it would probably be insane. So 
                  does that means that we don't walk the street or drive any cars because a
                   number of people around us are dead because of car accident?</p>
              <p>It 
                  doesn't matter what decision you make because the point of my post does 
                  not address the morality of your decision, which it is absolutely 
                  insubstantial to me. What is of a concern is how your conceptualize your
                   reasoning which give rise to your final decision.</p>
              <p>From what I am
                   seeing, religious conflict is the only real issue. Well, perhaps you 
                  might want to be brutally honest with yourself on what's the real shit 
                  that isn't really workable here and avoid dumping unnecessary components
                   in your reasoning to 'beef up' your justification - more quantity does 
                  not mean more reasonable. </p>
              <p>Are you willing to compromise in the 
                  framework of a relationship or you prefer to pursue your individualistic
                   goals? It does not necessarily be an either or, but in your own private
                   scaling, how much are you willing to relent towards the other side of 
                  the scale that isn't part of your grand plan? Many times, there are 
                  middle grounds that we could tread, not just caught between a rock and a
                   hard place.</p>
              <p>Learn to remove 'rightness' and 'wrongness' in 
                  any decision. Decisions are neutral. There are only wise and unwise 
                  choices. Willing or unwilling choices. If you cannot determine what is 
                  wise and unwise, then you decide what you are willing or unwilling to 
                  undertake. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>it's very good that you are thinking long term because when you get together with someone, things like those you have mentioned will definitely become a problem and will kill the relationship eventually.</p>
              <p>first of all, she is too young for a long term relationship. it would be better to go with someone of similar age category. if you are an working adult, please go with another working adult. when people are in the same life stage, its easier for them to understand what you are going through. its difficult for a student to understand the concerns of a working adult.</p>
              <p>when you go with someone, never have the idea of changing them. that is the most unlikely(0.001% chance of success) thing to happen and even if they do change, it's very unlikely that they changed according to what you wanted. if you cannot accept them for what they are, then don't waste your time and her time, just drop her and let her find her happiness elsewhere.</p>
              <p>since you already know that it will not work out in the long term, it's good that you decided to end the relationship because it ain't going nowhere anyway. its better to end it now then later when both parties are more attached and will end up suffering more and find it harder to move on.</p>
              <p>good luck finding Miss Right.</p>
