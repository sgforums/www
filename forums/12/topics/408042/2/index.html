              <p><br>Look, its just another poor excuse for dumping your gf. Thats what my ex did to me. She said that she wanted so badly to change me to her ideals too, excuses, excuses.</p>
              <p>The point is, I had been with her for 5 years, I ask you, why she never thought of choosing somebody more like her pre-relationship and during relationship?</p>
              <p>Suddenly within 6 months, she found a rich guy who drives a Jag and runs his father's business. Didn't like to change me to her ideals? Yeah right...garbage. I even found out she was double timing me while we were still in a relationship.</p>
              <p>After that, I wise up and be more careful in choosing my partner. I made sure she was the one before I commit to a relationship and good behold I've found a better gf, after 3 years together, we're getting engaged soon.</p>
