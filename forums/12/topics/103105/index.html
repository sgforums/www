            <div class='col-md body'>All i can say is..<br>4 years ago. ..... or maybe more now.. it was... 14th Feb 2000...<br>I stumbled into Melbourne.. wide eyed and not very cluey.<br><br>I wouldn't trade this experience for anything. When i went for job interviews without a PR, no one questioned me and nobody asked if i was a PR. People that i have just met think i grew up here and my family is here.. it's really funny. Anyway... i'm not a good advisor. I played half the time but somehow did pretty well.. In a way i can say i accomplished that side of things. Regret... yeah definitely.. some silly things like not going home during my school hols. Thinking of going back to Singapore.. i dunno. Too hard to answer.<br><br>Anyway.. first year was very hard for me .. like someone had mentioned. I can't really advise on accomodation, i never lived in hostels and hated to share with other students. They assumed my property was common ground.. and free for all.</div>
