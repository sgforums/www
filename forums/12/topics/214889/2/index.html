            <div class='col-md body'>If you are going to have more than 100 people, gathering around the pool site might be an issue.<br><br>Perhaps you can consider only inviting family members and closed friends only to the solemnisation if you insist having the solemnisation at the pool site.  After the solemnisation, you can move on to another venue for your "c0cktail" party (buffet lunch) where you can invite the rest of your friends to.<br><br>How about just hire a hall where you can accommodate a big turn-out?  The set up will be simple... you just need a big long table for all the food and drinks etc and chairs along the hall for your guests to sit whenever/wherever they want.<br><br>Most of the people will probably stand and chat with friends most of the time anyway.  If possible, have some space where you can turn it into a dance floor for people to dance.<br><br>To minimise chaos, it's best to have a program you can stick to (your guests don't have to see this program, just your MC/DJ on that day to make the appropriate announcement) at the c0cktail party including:<br><br>From <time> to <time> - Arrival of guests (Drinks to be served on arrival)<br>From <time> to <time> - Arrival of bride &amp; Groom (MC to introduce the new husband and wife etc)<br>From <time> to <time> - Lunch time (not including desserts yet)<br>From <time> to <time> - Champagne pouring and toasting time (if you're planning to do it)<br>From <time> to <time> - Speech (Father of the bride/Best Man/ Groom/Bride)<br>From <time> to <time> - Cake cutting time<br>From <time> to <time> - Dancing or other entertainment<br>From <time> to <time> - Desserts/coffee/tea time<br>From <time> to <time> - Dancing or more entertainment etc<br>From <time> to <time> - Conclusion of the party<br><br>At the conclusion of the party, if you and your partner are planning to leave before your guests, you can always get the MC to get all your guests to form a big circle with you and your partner inside the circle.  Once everyone is there, you and your partner can start thanking your guests by going around the circle (starting at the same point with one going clockwise direction while the other the anti-clockwise direction).<br><br>These are just some of my ideas....  Anyway, happy planning and congratulations on your impending nuptial.  All the best!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></time></time></time></time></time></time></time></time></time></time></time></time></time></time></time></time></time></time></time></time></div>

So I wouldnt recommend any bridal shop.<br><br>I always suggested for folks to buy/tailor make simple gowns.  Try City Plaza, there is lots of seamtress to choose from.  And Tailors too.  And cheap too. $200 for a gown and another $100+ for a full suit for guy.<br><br>And florist for your garden and the bouquet, try those neighbourhood shops or flower gardens nursery lah.<br><br>Veils, gloves, heels and even hair decorations are easily available if you borther to do some shopping at Arab Street, City Plaza, Katong Shopping Centre &amp; any Sinma Jewellery Shops.  Katong Shopping Centre Basement got a shop that does really pretty  fanciful cheongsums also.<br><br>Since you are doing a garden do.  You might want to consider getting some amatuer photographer to capture your actual day then to want to pose pose pose with those fake smiles in a studio.<br><br>Try a makeover studio if you have to. Afterall, these pictures arent useful except for putting into your wallet.  The rest of those bridal packages albums will be rusting in your storeroom the moment your first baby arrived.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem with catered lunch.<br><br>Is that they never have enough drinks!  Drinks always runs out before your party really started.<br><br>And make sure the bozz of tat catering company is always on hand.<br><br>You dont want to get into a arguement with some teenage waiter with his: Bozz only tell us to bring this amount of drinks.  Bozz busy elsewhere.<br><br>I tell you, anytime I hear that, I will never ever utilized those kinda caterers anymore.  And there is such in multiples in Singapore.<br><br>Make sure they standby 4 more containers of drinks.<br><br>Food wise, get a tasting done first.  And check your guest for allergies, restrictions and get them to give you boxes to 'ta pao'.  And always delay their time to collect back their utensils. You dont want them to clear the food way before your last guest has his fill of the food and drinks.</div>
