(thinking poolside)<br><br>So morning will go fetch the bride and head over to the hotel for the ROM thingy and also "jib cha" to the elderlys...<br><br>That's what we have in mind...<br><br>I'm a teochew and my g/f is a hokkien. Anything regarding the "Guo Da Li" and other tradition customs i should know, before those "san gu lu po" of my mum or relatives starts to give/suggest some insane ideas... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Thanks...<br><br>Thanks for reading and hope this help those who are having the same thought of getting married next year!<br><br>Cheers...<br></div></blockquote>I am not too familiar with the Guo Da Li part except what I had for my wedding a few weeks back.anyway my wife and my dialect group are both cantonese so as said earlier...it differs from dialect to dialect.Anyway....advises from the san gu liu pos can be pretty helpful.another way is to go to those shops selling traditional wedding stuff and ask them.<br><br>going back to ur preparations...poolside ROM....so have to go find ur hotel and see what package they provide and see if it fits ur idea and budget...for hotel package...most likely they will include a nite's stay in the hotel for U...just have to make sure U count the number of people that U are going to invite.some hotels also give free invitation cards for those wedding dinners so I dunno if they do it for wedding receptions...U can check it out when U source for ur hotel.<br><br>and I presume U know U have to register for marriage at ROM website 3 months before the actual day and look for a licensed solemniser for the ceremony itself and be in touch with him/her throughout the 3 months.<br>There are also some protocols to follow(such as U need to invite the solemniser URSELF) regarding the solemniser so go to the ROM website and read.<br><br></div>
