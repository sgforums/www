              <p>I dunno abt others, but if it happens to me, I would most likely keep this affection in my heart if I know I would not be able to commit to her. I would still, however, try to go out with her as friends and keep in touch.</p>
              <p>And if we're meant to be, perhaps after my studies when I come back, we might be able to get together. If she's attached by then, then I can only wish her all the best. Because I think that if I really like someone, I would not put that someone in a difficult position. I would save all that emotional stress to myself and hope that she gets by in the best way she can. I would want her 2 be happy. I would not want to be her source of worry.</p>
              <p>Just curious, what makes you like her?</p>

              <p>Sometimes.. a crush and a love.. can be two separate thing.</p>
              <p>Sometimes.. crush can lead to love.</p>
              <p>It really depends on how the feelings flow.</p>
              <p>Love is reciprocal.. if it is a one way street.. it's destined
                                      to fail.</p>
              <p>I think you should allow the girl to decide for herself what she
                                      wants.</p>
              <p>First you need to put yourself out in the market.</p>
              <p>Let her know of your feelings towards her..but let her know of
                                      your future plans.</p>
              <p>Women hates it when men don't plan for the long term.</p>
              <p>Let her know...where when and for what reason you will be
                                      away....and tell her..</p>
              <p>"I like you, I hope you feel the same way about me too. I know
                                      this is a long shot.. but if you are not able to reciprocate my
                                      feelings.. I can understand."</p>
              <p>Then leave it up to her .. to figure out what she wants.</p>
              <p>If she decides to walk away... so be it. Accept it as part of
                                      life.. for you have a long road ahead of you.</p>
              <p>Never give up your future because of a person. Because you never
                                      know.. if this relationship will or can last. Don't let another
                                      person be the reason of a life long regret.</p>

              <p>How well do you allow this girl to know you since both of you became friends? Is she comfortable in the current friendship with you to bring it to the next level?</p>
              <p>You can have plenty of dreams, ambitions about your future and go ahead to declare your love for her and show her that you are willing to sacrifice all of that just for her sake.</p>
              <p>And guess what? She's not going to love you for all the sacrifices that you have made for her, at least not me.</p>
              <p>She would be more likely to accept you because she knows how much she is loved and cared for by you.....and not how much sacrifices you have made for her to make her feel guilty and responsible towards you.</p>
              <p>Your approach is wrong but since both of you are still young, you never know how things are going to happen in the future, so don't be naive and do not sacrifice your future for anyone...at least I won't.</p>
              <p>Every relationship begins from friendship and if she is comfortable in being in a friendship with you, there are always plenty of opportunities to her to allow you to bring this friendship to the next level.</p>
              <p>Your friendship level does not depends on how much you know about her, it's actually relies more on how much she knows about you.</p>
              <p>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I wouldnt say that our friendship is ready for the next level, we merely got to know each other for like a week? Just the casual hi-bye type of friend.</p>
              <p>I guess its only right for me to stick to my current plans and remain as a friend with her?</p>
              <p>Just some doubts about (just go for it and get her) replies..  Why declare my love for her when we've only less than 2months to work it out(excluding the time it takes for our friendship to grow first) wouldnt it hurt both parties at the end of the day?</p>

              <p>Good luck dude.</p>
