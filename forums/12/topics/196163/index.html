            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Repost - originally posted by Yunhaier</strong><br><br>I will share this article on Soul Mate, which CloUdiSm currently adopt:<br><br>If you've seen me in lectures or on Montel, you might already know that this "soul mate" thing is a subject that really gets on my nerves. In fact, I'd like to track down and kick right in the shins the person who started the rumour that one of our main purposes in life is to find our soul mate.<br><br>It's not.<br><br>The odds against it are astronomical.<br><br>And even if they weren't, the soul mate we find in the course of this lifetime wouldn't necessarily be a lover or spouse at all. The closest thing I have to a soul mate on this earth is my granddaughter Angelia.<br><br>Many people look so disillusioned when I announce that the soul mate search is a myth, like I'm taking their favourite fairy tale away. I'm not, believe me. Giving up the idea that there is a soul mate for us somewhere and it's our job to find them can be downright liberating. Few things bring tears to my eyes more quickly than clients who stay in abusive relationships because they have confused the constant emotional intensity with their concept of what having a soul mate must be like. Even clients with perfectly nice marriages sadly tell me that their greatest failure was in never having found their soul mate. The term soul mate gets mistaken for everything from infatuation to lust to an excuse for stalking, obsession, and domestic violence.<br><br>Maybe it will help if we get straight what a true soul mate is.<br><br>We are created with spirits that have both male and female aspects. We live lifetimes as both genders, as a matter of fact. I have never met anyone who's always been male or always been female every time around.<br><br>We are also created with an "identical twin" spirit whose male and female aspects are essentially mirror aspects of our own. That twin spirit is our soul mate. Our soul mate is not the other half of us, any more than we are the other half of our soul mate. I don't consider myself half a person. Do you, really? I certainly don't think there's anything romantic about thinking we are all a bunch of halves walking around. If I'm not half a person, and you're not half a person, why on earth would any of us spend one minute, let alone a lifetime, looking for "another half" that doesn't exist and that none of us whole people would have any use for anyway?<br><br>On The Other Side we're probably closer to our soul mates than we are to any other spirit, but we're hardly joined at the hip. We and our soul mates happily pursue separate friendships,<br>separate interests, separate work and studies, and above all, our own separate identities. With our soul mates we enjoy the most intimate love there is -- free, unconditional, liberated and liberating, with a mutual knowledge only true identical twin spirits can share.<br><br>Like all spirits on The Other Side, each of the soul mates can choose to be born on earth for another lifetime. They might only come here once or twice, like my Spirit guide Francine. They might feel the need to come again and again -- I'm on my fifty-fourth time around, and my last, I'm delighted to announce. But compared to eternity, even fifty-four lifetimes amount to about a minute and a half.<br><br>Which brings up an obvious question: What are the chances that you and your soul mate are ever going to show up on earth at the same time? Why would you feel the need to, since you are always together on The Other Side anyway, and this experience we call "life" is really nothing more than just a quick trip away from Home?<br><br>Not to mention the odds against the two of you being on earth in the same general age range, enough geographical proximity for you to run into each other somewhere along the way, and the right gender for the two of you to become a couple, which seems to be the top priority of the whole soul mate myth?<br><br>So please, give yourselves (and me) a break and stop looking for a soul mate who in all probability is having a great time on The Other Side right now, waiting for you to come Home. Don't set yourself up for all that pressure and disappointment. Don't cling to a bad relationship in the misguided belief that it is, after all, your soul mate and you belong together, even if you're miserable. Don't devalue a perfectly good relationship because you're missing that "soul mate feeling". Don't believe for one second that there's only one person on this whole planet you're "destined" to be with -- what a depressing thought that is! And I definitely don't want you to reach the later years of your life thinking you failed because you never found someone who wasn't even here but whom you'll be having a wonderful, effortless reunion with if you'll must be patient for a few more "minutes" until you're Home again.<br><br>What you will find as you move through this lifetime are any number of kindred souls -- spirits you have known in one or more past lives. I'm sure you have experienced the instant feeling of familiarity, either good or bad, that happens on meeting a kindred soul. Sometimes that instant familiarity is the springboard for yet another earthly experience together, as friends, as lovers and spouses, or family members.<br><br>Cheers</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>~*~Companion Soul Mates~*~ closely resemble the Twin Flame in-so-far as this is generally a relationship based on romantic love, however there is still karma between the two people involved and although the couple can learn to live within unconditional love the relationship is not based on it. Quite often Companion Soul Mates will come together for a project such as writing a book, starting a business, or even assisting one to get through a particular trial or lesson in this life. Once the project is finished, often the relationship ends as well leaving both parties scratching their heads wondering what happened.<br><br>Companion Soul Mates can and do join together as Life Partners, especially when the Twin Flame is not present in this lifetime or when for whatever reason the Twin Flames cannot be together in this life. Companion Soul Mates are still in the "teaching each other lessons" mode and this is one of the major differences between a Companion and a Twin, but weÂ’ll get into those differences further on.<br><br>Often Companion Soul Mates are confused with a Twin Flame for sometimes there is not a lot of karma left between the couple, however, whenever there is any karma left to work out then the relationship is still within the boundaries of the Companion Soul Mate realm. Companion Soul Mates have known each other in many lifetimes and have loved many times. Generally when you meet a Companion Soul Mate there is an immediate attraction, Love At First Sight if you will, although sometimes there is the opposite because of the remembered hurts of the past, but this is far rarer.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
