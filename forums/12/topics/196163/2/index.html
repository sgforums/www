            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>Maybe i should lightly touch on what is "Twin Flames"?<br><br>Twin Flames have no karma to work out between them, there never has been, never will be and come together for no other reason than unconditional love. Twin Flames love each other with no expectation of the other and with no conditions attached to the giving of that love. It is easy to say that you love someone unconditionally but you need to ask yourself could you love this person if for some reason they could not remain with you? Could you give your love to this person with no expectations, not even that the love will be returned or even recognized? Can you love this person for no other reason than there is simply no other option available to you? If you can answer a resounding (and honest) yes to all of the above then you are experiencing unconditional love. But be careful here my friend for Spirit is listening and may put that love to the test, Spirit may require that you prove yourself worthy of this love and place you in a situation wherein you must truly discover if this is an unconditional love by separating you, sometimes only temporarily sometimes permanently, depending on what lessons you have to learn in this lifetime.<br><br>Which brings us to another point, Twin Flames are earned not a given, you must prepare yourself to be able to join with your twin flame, it is not an automatic, it is a gift. And as a gift, it is truly a privilege to know your Twin Flame but you must be ready. How do you become ready you ask? Well you will have to learn to love deeper than you ever thought possible and that usually means meeting, loving and losing "near twins" which are in reality Companion Soul Mates. Are you brave and strong enough to be able to risk loving with your heart and soul just to have the dream shattered? If not then seeking your Twin Flame is not for you for you must deepen your capacity to love before you can know unconditional love and that means experiencing pain as well as joy. The more pain you have experienced the more joy you are capable of holding within. Sometimes the cup of love must be completely shattered before it can be built strong enough to hold the love of your Twin Flame. Steel is tempered through flame and your heart must be tempered through pain before it is strong enough to protect the love of your Twin.<br><br>When Twin Flames come together they become one, they are not like each other, they are the mirror image of the other. They think alike, they hold the same values and often their life experiences are very similar, sometimes they will actually look like each other. By that they will have similar builds, bone structures and features. This is not however a guide as to whether you have met your Twin Flame or not.<br><br>Twin Flames do not teach each other, they learn together and help each other learn the lessons that have been set before them in this lifetime. When Twin Flames come together they join forces and are capable of overcoming obstacles the average mortal could not begin to face. They are so filled with unconditional love, they literally glow with it and have much to share with others. They are the inspiration that poets write about and singers sing about.<br><br>Another warning I would give at this point is that it is important that we avoid the trap of measuring each relationship against what we believe a Twin Flame to be. For by doing this we lose the opportunity of experiencing all the love that is placed in front of us. Keep in mind that no matter what, if we are to be with our Twin Flame then it will happen and by experiencing the loves placed before us by Spirit we are preparing for the day that we meet this special, special person. We also need to keep in mind that we are not destined to meet our Twin Flame in each and every lifetime. The chances of meeting this one perfect mirror is very slim, it does happen and it seems to be happening more now than ever before, but there are no guarantees.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by browniebaobao:<br><strong><span style="color: indigo;">[b]Repost - originally posted by Yunhaier</span></strong><br><br>I will share this article on Soul Mate, which CloUdiSm currently adopt:<br><br>If you've seen me in lectures or on Montel, you might already know that this "soul mate" thing is a subject that really gets on my nerves. In fact, I'd like to track down and kick right in the shins the person who started the rumour that one of our main purposes in life is to find our soul mate.<br><br>It's not.<br><br>The odds against it are astronomical.<br><br>And even if they weren't, the soul mate we find in the course of this lifetime wouldn't necessarily be a lover or spouse at all. The closest thing I have to a soul mate on this earth is my granddaughter Angelia.<br><br>Many people look so disillusioned when I announce that the soul mate search is a myth, like I'm taking their favourite fairy tale away. I'm not, believe me. Giving up the idea that there is a soul mate for us somewhere and it's our job to find them can be downright liberating. Few things bring tears to my eyes more quickly than clients who stay in abusive relationships because they have confused the constant emotional intensity with their concept of what having a soul mate must be like. Even clients with perfectly nice marriages sadly tell me that their greatest failure was in never having found their soul mate. The term soul mate gets mistaken for everything from infatuation to lust to an excuse for stalking, obsession, and domestic violence.<br><br>Maybe it will help if we get straight what a true soul mate is.<br><br>We are created with spirits that have both male and female aspects. We live lifetimes as both genders, as a matter of fact. I have never met anyone who's always been male or always been female every time around.<br><br>We are also created with an "identical twin" spirit whose male and female aspects are essentially mirror aspects of our own. That twin spirit is our soul mate. Our soul mate is not the other half of us, any more than we are the other half of our soul mate. I don't consider myself half a person. Do you, really? I certainly don't think there's anything romantic about thinking we are all a bunch of halves walking around. If I'm not half a person, and you're not half a person, why on earth would any of us spend one minute, let alone a lifetime, looking for "another half" that doesn't exist and that none of us whole people would have any use for anyway?<br><br>On The Other Side we're probably closer to our soul mates than we are to any other spirit, but we're hardly joined at the hip. We and our soul mates happily pursue separate friendships,<br>separate interests, separate work and studies, and above all, our own separate identities. With our soul mates we enjoy the most intimate love there is -- free, unconditional, liberated and liberating, with a mutual knowledge only true identical twin spirits can share.<br><br>Like all spirits on The Other Side, each of the soul mates can choose to be born on earth for another lifetime. They might only come here once or twice, like my Spirit guide Francine. They might feel the need to come again and again -- I'm on my fifty-fourth time around, and my last, I'm delighted to announce. But compared to eternity, even fifty-four lifetimes amount to about a minute and a half.<br><br>Which brings up an obvious question: What are the chances that you and your soul mate are ever going to show up on earth at the same time? Why would you feel the need to, since you are always together on The Other Side anyway, and this experience we call "life" is really nothing more than just a quick trip away from Home?<br><br>Not to mention the odds against the two of you being on earth in the same general age range, enough geographical proximity for you to run into each other somewhere along the way, and the right gender for the two of you to become a couple, which seems to be the top priority of the whole soul mate myth?<br><br>So please, give yourselves (and me) a break and stop looking for a soul mate who in all probability is having a great time on The Other Side right now, waiting for you to come Home. Don't set yourself up for all that pressure and disappointment. Don't cling to a bad relationship in the misguided belief that it is, after all, your soul mate and you belong together, even if you're miserable. Don't devalue a perfectly good relationship because you're missing that "soul mate feeling". Don't believe for one second that there's only one person on this whole planet you're "destined" to be with -- what a depressing thought that is! And I definitely don't want you to reach the later years of your life thinking you failed because you never found someone who wasn't even here but whom you'll be having a wonderful, effortless reunion with if you'll must be patient for a few more "minutes" until you're Home again.<br><br>What you will find as you move through this lifetime are any number of kindred souls -- spirits you have known in one or more past lives. I'm sure you have experienced the instant feeling of familiarity, either good or bad, that happens on meeting a kindred soul. Sometimes that instant familiarity is the springboard for yet another earthly experience together, as friends, as lovers and spouses, or family members.<br><br>Cheers[/b]</blockquote>WOW!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>I would like to bring your attention to &amp; share on what are "Karmic Soul Mates"?.<br><br>A Karmic Soul Mate is a soul that we still have karma to deal with between us, now this doesnÂ’t necessarily mean "bad" karma, it can be good karma as well. A Karmic Soul Mate can be a family member, (Parents, Brothers, Sisters, Cousins, etc.), a close friend, a romantic relationship, basically any relationship that has impacted our lives in any way. With these people, we always have lessons to share and these relationships can at times not be completely comfortable. Although these people invoke deep feelings (positive or negative) we seldom develop a long-term romantic relationship with a Karmic Soul Mate for these are generally more for lessons and growth rather than a life partner romantically speaking.<br><br>The thing to keep in mind here is that Karma comes in positive and negative forms so just because a relationship is "Karmic" it doesn't mean that it has to be negative. Sometimes we are simply here to say thank you or to return a favour given in a past life time. I know that I am repeating myself on this but it is just so important that we remember this small, yet important point.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>
