            <div class='col-md body'>That sounded like one of the articles i read in teenagers.<br><br>1. Stop feeling inferior!<br>- You blame yourself for the broken relationship. Girls, when saying good bye to a relationship, always do this. Look at his behaviour before you two broke up. To me, he seem to be trying to hint to you that he wanted a breakup.<br><br>2. Gain control!<br>- Get on with your life. Guys all have a certain extent of ego. He MIGHT be dragging this because you're making him feel good. Get on with your life. People love things they cannot get.<br><br>3. If you must.<br>- If you really love him and still want him back, tell him you don't love him first. Try to approach him as a friend. Most guys cannot stand a girl they like being "so close yet so far". That's why their right feelings will reveal. You have to be observant, though.<br><br>-binary-nwitz.</div>
