And you really shouldn't have broken up with him if you chrish the realtionship so much. That was really immature.

            <div class='col-md body'>If you guys have been in a relationship for long, perhaps he is bored. The very slightest mention of 'breaking-up' may seem music to his ears. Provided that he can put all the blame on you.<br><br>Adding girls on friendster? Haha... Seems to me that he can't wait to get to know more girls. Sure, being single means more flirting, but surely he can't be that fast in looking for new girls. Giving excuses that he is angry at you simply makes him feel 'good'. He might feel superior that a girl is willing to wait for him.<br><br>And usually I won't tell a friend who knows both parties of the problem. Cause it usually result in more friction between the relationship. Gossipping and backstabbing might happen and you wouldn't know it. And usually the best advice won't come from the person, instead the person might even play mind games with the both of you guys.<br><br>Do not put blame on yourself, girls are bound to throw a little tantrums to get their way, not all, though. And guys are bound to give in, especially in the case of a gentleman, or one who loves truely. A true gentleman will ALWAYS say sorry and try to make the other party happy no matter whos fault it is.(In my case)<br><br>Now that you are single, just simply make more friends, perhaps relationship now ain't right? Love will always come when it is meant to. Don't wait for time will always be moving. Just make good use of it, no regrets in your future.</div>
