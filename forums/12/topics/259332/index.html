            <div class='col-md body'>I am more interested to find out.<br><br>How he buys the bike.  Its a laid down bike right?  Thats why  it has no road tax?  It means the bike has to be parked at a certain location.  Who was the previous owner and who helped with the lay down bike procedure?<br><br>It sounds suspiciously like someone I knew.  Who has no bike licence and bought a bike.  Under influence by a acquaintance which the acquaintance took advantage of and stole the bike and sell it to another party w/o bike licence and took the bike for a spin and ended up caught on cam at the erp.<br><br>Or maybe its just too rampant that young folks like to hiong?<br><br>So now the fren was caught riding w/o licence, insurance &amp; road tax and passing thru a ERP w/o a cashcard.  The penalty is still a hefty fine and banned from driving or riding for a couple of years.<br><br>The other fren with the false statement. He can either admit truthfully and apologise like nobody's business and hopefully get off with a warning or at worse, a fine.</div>
