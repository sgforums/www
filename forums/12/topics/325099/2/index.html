              <p>Hi youyayu, for your info, I am also studying in MDIS IT course. Only thing is that I am completing my degree course in about 1 months time.</p>
              <p>When I first join the course, there are about 20+ full time students, but at the end of my course, there are only 2 students graduating this term and I am one of them. The rest of the students either quit or was delayed because they failed several modules and need to remodule.</p>
              <p>A degree in Information Technology is definitely not suitable for people who dosen't like to spend long hours in front of the computer writing code, testing, debugging e.t.c. You need a <span class="me">analytic,logical and very energetic mind to push your way through. For example: When you compile a source code and you see a few hundred reported errors, and you say to yourself: "Damn, I hate programming ", then you know Information Technology is seriously not suitable for you because you do not have the analytical mind to find out what went wrong or the mental energy to fix every single error one by one.<br></span></p>
              <p>I have heard from my friend that a friend of his has <strong>failed in Diploma</strong><span class="me"><strong> in IT</strong>, switched to <strong>Diploma in Business Management... failed again</strong>, then swtich back to <strong>Diploma in IT</strong>..... I have also seen people retaking an exam known as "Principle of Economics" <strong>4 times</strong>... For the course in Mass Communication, you need to have very good English. For biotechnology, you need to know your chemistry and biology very well.... nothing is easy.<br></span></p>
              <p>If at diploma level, you are already struggling to pass, at degree level, it will be hell for you. It dosent really matter if you are studying in SMU or NTU or whatever U, if you are not mentally prepared to go all the way, then you have to be prepared to fail all the way.</p>

              <p><br>In IT, you need to learn to have a logical mindset before you can think creativity. If you cant even complete simple programming assignments, you can say bye bye to complex games.</p>
              <p>Its the same as you need to learn to bounce the ball well before you can go and curve it. Unless your ball is a bowling ball which cant bounce and can only curve.</p>
