She remembered all your actions and find it quite a turnoff. When the two of you get back together again, it is useless because she will still remember it. To win a girls' heart, there is no need for all those fanciful stuff that you just mentioned. Women don't want or need those. They only want you as a person.

There's always two sides to the story. Since the lasttime I posted here...I've patched back with my ex gf. All is well till August...I'm  posting about it now, because I really love her and feel that what's going on is not healthy for our relationship or any relationship at all.<br><br>I wonder all the time, what women want. Simply take for example...she asks me for help, of course as a boyfriend, I would do my best to assist her. But she's not thankful or grateful,she will say things like "I got ask you to help meh, kaypo." and when seeing her in trouble sometimes I delibrately ignore her, she will whine saying "What kinf of a boyfriend are you? I don't like guys like that, so ungentlemanly...you cannot see I need help meh?" Its like...if I help, I get told off, if I don't, I also get told off.<br><br>Just two months ago, I bought 4D for the first time in my live, and I won $500. I did not tell her about it,I just asked her out and brought her to eat and buy her stuff. She went back and told her friends that she suspects that I'm cheating on her because I suddenly treat her so well. I mean its like...heck...when I treat her well, she suspects I'm cheating, when I'm cold...she says I don't love her.<br><br>She told me that she's sick of being in a r-ship and wants out. But if she really wants out, why would she ask me to go all the way to print stuff for her at Peace Centre, then deliver it all the way to school which is in Tampines when I've got nothing on in school at all. I just made the trip there to submit her work and return home. Sighz...I hope some women can shed some light on what she really wants.<br><br>I just saw her blog, she wants a new wallet. I agree too, the Billabong wallet I got her 2yrs back is rather old and dirty already. I've no qualms spending on brands like Jane Shilton etc, so long its below $100 as I'm a student and though I work part-time I pay my bills and hardly take allowance from my parents. She's eyeing a LV monogram wallet. Personally, I feel that being a poly student and only 19yrs old, even if I had the financial means to buy her the LV wallet, her friends and others will think that its a fake right?I thought of this as when she bought her pair of Papillio which I paid for, her friends who own the Neckerman or copy versions, said that her's is fake too. To me I feel that its not the brand, but its whether the person using it has that status that aura to go with the brand.<br><br>Sighz...I really don't know what she wants. For everything I do, there seems to be two sides of it and both sides seem equally bleak. I really love her but things cannot go on like this, we can't hold a proper conversation about our r-ship as she always ends up flaring up and blocking me in MSN and not replying my sms/calls. Women out there...please help me understand one of your comrades, all I've wanted is to be a better boyfriend.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>Fwah, so good.

Damn pissed off!!! I don't understand why is it that guys whom 2-time,3-time can get away with things and the girls are forgiving to them, while me a faithful and loyal chap gets dumped.Fark!!! Unfair world!!!</div></blockquote>This girl is gone dude.<br><br>The sooner you found out, the better. There is no such thing as the ONE. There's only good ones. Pampering her too much results in you giving too much of your power to her. This doesn't work out in the long run when you put her on a pedestal. As much as you need to earn her respect, she should do the same as well for a meaningful r/s.<br><br>It's obvious this girl has low feelings for you. In fact, her feelings have already died a long time ago when you wanted to patch back. Women with low feelings, not all of them, cheat. She found you boring and has no excitement in her life. Someone new has come along and replaced you.<br><br>Why guys can 2-time/3-time? Because they are players. And these players are in demand by the women. They are not necessarily go exclusive with the women either, just dating.<br><br>doko</div>
