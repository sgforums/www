            <div class='col-md body'>As the subject head goes...Heads or Tails. There's always two sides to the story. Since the lasttime I posted here...I've patched back with my ex gf. All is well till August...I'm  posting about it now, because I really love her and feel that what's going on is not healthy for our relationship or any relationship at all.<br><br>I wonder all the time, what women want. Simply take for example...she asks me for help, of course as a boyfriend, I would do my best to assist her. But she's not thankful or grateful,she will say things like "I got ask you to help meh, kaypo." and when seeing her in trouble sometimes I delibrately ignore her, she will whine saying "What kinf of a boyfriend are you? I don't like guys like that, so ungentlemanly...you cannot see I need help meh?" Its like...if I help, I get told off, if I don't, I also get told off.<br><br>Just two months ago, I bought 4D for the first time in my live, and I won $500. I did not tell her about it,I just asked her out and brought her to eat and buy her stuff. She went back and told her friends that she suspects that I'm cheating on her because I suddenly treat her so well. I mean its like...heck...when I treat her well, she suspects I'm cheating, when I'm cold...she says I don't love her.<br><br>She told me that she's sick of being in a r-ship and wants out. But if she really wants out, why would she ask me to go all the way to print stuff for her at Peace Centre, then deliver it all the way to school which is in Tampines when I've got nothing on in school at all. I just made the trip there to submit her work and return home. Sighz...I hope some women can shed some light on what she really wants.<br><br>I just saw her blog, she wants a new wallet. I agree too, the Billabong wallet I got her 2yrs back is rather old and dirty already. I've no qualms spending on brands like Jane Shilton etc, so long its below $100 as I'm a student and though I work part-time I pay my bills and hardly take allowance from my parents. She's eyeing a LV monogram wallet. Personally, I feel that being a poly student and only 19yrs old, even if I had the financial means to buy her the LV wallet, her friends and others will think that its a fake right?I thought of this as when she bought her pair of Papillio which I paid for, her friends who own the Neckerman or copy versions, said that her's is fake too. To me I feel that its not the brand, but its whether the person using it has that status that aura to go with the brand.<br><br>Sighz...I really don't know what she wants. For everything I do, there seems to be two sides of it and both sides seem equally bleak. I really love her but things cannot go on like this, we can't hold a proper conversation about our r-ship as she always ends up flaring up and blocking me in MSN and not replying my sms/calls. Women out there...please help me understand one of your comrades, all I've wanted is to be a better boyfriend.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

But its just that I really really love her alot. My other female friends were quite stunned when I asked them for solutions. Because they've always seen guys being quick on the rebound from the end of a relationship.But I can't...I really really love her alot.And the typical talks we have, usually end up with her crying and ignoring me. Its quite sickening to think of it to say the least, as why is it that other couples can be so successful in their r-ship but I can't?I've always always envied those elderly couples in their 60s,70s and 80s and are still very affectionate about each other.Sighz...</div>

You can never go back to your previous r/s when it's over. Because the scar is there. Previously, who initiated the breakup? Was it her? I think it shd be that case.<br><br>How did you two get back again in the first place? Was it you or her who wanted it back? I suspect she dumped you first and then she cannot find any substitute and returned to you.<br><br>You might not like what I am going to say now.<br><br>You are like many of the NICE guys out there who gave in to her every silly requests and demands. You are too weak, guy. She is bored of you because you were too available and everytime say 'yes' to her. Let her know you are not happy and she can happily end this relationship. Let her know you are pissed and you can walk away independently. Come'on you tell me: You treated her so nicely and and you bought her the wallet? Is that how you treat a girl when she treated you like crap?<br><br>She is bored and she is trying to get rid of you. She might not know what she is doing because of her low feelings or is it because of her sucky character or both. I say it's both. She is trying to make you feel pissed so you can get rid of her. This is how the female behaves. (Don't get me wrong. Im not anti-female. I love females)<br><br>She blocked you on MSN and did not return your calls/MSN. Is that high feelings on her part? R/s is abt give and take. Do you think she is taking or giving? I believe your brain tells you to stop it but your heart says continue. What I can suggest is back off and don't try to fix things. The more you do it, the worse it gets. Back off and allow things to clear up.<br><br>Please don't try to seek opinions on how to gain back her love because it shoud be the other way round. Because what you are doing is actually demeaning yourself.<br><br>If you value your face, that is.</div>

But once you are with them as steady and if they are sick of you either because you turned them off or because they are demanding  or both you are gone. Sometimes, it's like a test, sometimes they are really turned off. Either ways, don't expect to be treated like crap. What you deserve is equal respect from her for an enjoyable relationship. I bet you never let her know you want deserve respect from her. Did she say "thanks" when you bought her stuffs or help her? No? I expect her not to do this. She expects to be a princess.</div>

Women don't like weak guys, period. For all the talk about sincerity, it's useless as long as you are perceived as being weak.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly, my peers and family judge me to be a perfectly practical and rational person and they do not know of this problem. Only a few of my guy friends and girl friends know about this. Its like, I can make decisions about things in less then a minute irregardless of what it is, and all are swift and decisive. But when it comes to relationship...sighz...its like when my friends have relationship problems, I can suggest to them very practically and be very level-headed about it. But when its my own...its a different ballgame altogether...Sighz..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I mean its not about the winning you see. For me I like to throw her surprises and see the smile on her face when she is surprised. Also, there was once I bought chocolates for a good buddy's birthday, she's upset as she's never ate that brand before. End up...I bought her 1 box the next day, and guess what. She ate 1 chocolate from the box, and let the rest spoil.Its $40+ lor...sighz...when I asked her bout it, she said this,"You don't know I don't like chocolate meh?"Haiz...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, a good deal of relationships doesn't work out and I think that in your case at this point in time base on the information that you are providing, its not working. Maybe she wants something that you cannot provide and maybe she's just not matured enough to be in a relationship, but its quite clearly that neither of you are happy in this relationship. As Dr Phil says, don't ask what is right, ask what is working. If the relationship is not working, you need to sit down and seriously ask her if she wants to carry on and put the effort in to make it work. If not, then no matter how painful and awkward it is, please get out of it.</div>
