              <p>Rather.. ask yourself what you need to do with your current relationship with your gf.</p>

              <p>my advice is : go with the flow.</p>
              <p>since you are still not married, you need to be clear what kind of woman you really desire for a life partner.</p>
              <p>you can have a stead for 2 years or more. but that does not necessarily mean she's definitely the one who's destined to marry you.</p>
              <p>marriage can either be your bliss or your grave. think and look long-term, and find the right life partner, before you sign that piece of paper that will seal your fate.</p>
              <p>in love, there's no right or wrong. if you really love someone, fight for her with your dear life. and if you no longer love her, please be merciful enough to let her go find her new happiness. a woman's youth is limited. don't waste her time, and yours.</p>

              <p>my advice is : go with the flow.</p>
              <p>since you are still not married, you need to be clear what kind
              of woman you really desire for a life partner.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>you can have a stead for 2 years or more. but that does not
              necessarily mean she's definitely the one who's destined to marry
              you.</strong></span></p>

              <p>There are times when we felt that we made mistakes and regret in life, with regards to our previous relationship.

              <p>II) The absence of graduation in prior cosmic lessons resulted in reiteration of the same chapter once again. What we cannot master, we learn again. </p>
              <p>I suggest instead of first leading yourself into the direction of asking '<em>Should i just forget her quickly'</em> - I reckon you should reframe your question and direct the question inwardly.</p>
              <p><em>'What does this mean to me and my development in Love?'</em></p>
              <p>You might want to understand if there's an action/s you wish to compensate for your previous failed relationship and unconsciously directing this effort towards this 'proxy'? </p>
              <p>Also the identity of your relationship is being questioned as well.</p>
              <p><em>'What does it means for your relationship and your gf?</em>' Namely, is your current gf lesser in any aspect than a figure of the past?</p>
