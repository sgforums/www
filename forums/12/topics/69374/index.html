When u date someone u've only known for a short time, but who's physically attracted to u, &amp; u to them, u tend to be less @ ease.  The reason for this is tt, u feel compelled to live up to tt other person's expectations.<br><br>But when u're wif a fren, u're @ ease, aren't u? : )  This is esp. so wif true frens, u're really urself wif them, &amp; despite quarrels &amp; arguments, u're always forgiven &amp; u always forgive them.<br><br>Ur fren, noes u for u.  A person who's physically attracted to u &amp; vice versa, may Not noe u for u, until both of u r together.  As time passes, they realise tt they can't accept who u really r.<br><br>This is juz a general observation, but it doesn't apply to ev. body : )  Juz my 2 cents' worth, as usu, cosh I'm the Energiser Bunny <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>RP<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lolsuck:</div><div class="quote_body">hi<br>would like to seak the point of view of u people about the right way to get a steady and last as long as possible..<br>i have seen my friends having girlfriends and boyfriends,but their relationship ended very quickly..<br>some a week some a month,even 2-3days..<br>most of them have a common property in this relationship..<br>they know each other not long.. and soon bcome attached and both parties isnt that kind of ugly sort..<br>is that true that 1 shld know another well enough before trying to be together?guys and girls should know each other well enough before deciding what to do..<br>in another term.. 1 shld not judge by the looks of another.. but shld get to know their character...&lt;------am i right to think this way?</div></blockquote></div>
