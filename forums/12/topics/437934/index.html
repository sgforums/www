              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">10 years later…</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span> </span>We rekindle our friendships and not love. We did not really talk to one another within these 10 years of empty connection because we had studied in different university and “our friendship” was suffering a breakdown. I am not exactly sure why she was angry with me. I assumed friends drifted apart as normal friends do, as we lived our life apart, with different cliques of friends that we had made along the way. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Within these 10 years, I hided my feeling and decided to move on. I do not have the same strong feeling for her now. However, recently, we had reconnected as friends. One day, I realized that she had the same feeling for me before.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Now I begin to feel a cycle of emotion: Regret, Love, Fear, Doubts, Aversion, and Hope</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Though old feeling still exist, it just not the same. She is brave enough to confess (not a direct confession but a subtle confession) and mention “let things take its natural course”. I think she knows that both of us had moved on with our life. She had changed and I had changed. Situation had changed. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I am no longer sure if I still want to be with her. She probably feels the same way.</span></span></p>

              <p>since u say both have moved on and changed views etc., then confession should only reveal the past with no real effects. If however, there is still some smell leftover and something happens, then why not? Things taking it's natural course may include your confession too.</p>

              Muse over this
              
              Reasons to love or not to love? Then later one will look for reasons to justify .... love is simply sharing of what one is. Of course, it is the uncertainty, the terror of the unknown what love mite entail or not that reduces one to justifiying, rationalising.
              
              as for numbers, its just numbers, who cares, if one loves and genuienly loves, one does not have to explain, reason, cajole, - the bird of paradise sits on an open palm, trying to clench and own it - one kills it 
              
              The heart knows no reasons and fears and love abides when one resonates of the intuitive heart.
