              <p><br>TS,  I think he likes you but he's waiting and still thinking about going further. Try not like him as more than a friend, he's not worth it since he's still thinking whether you are worth the effort or not.</p>

              <p>typical buaya tactic. new only to noobs like TS. bring a girl he wanna bed to a club he is well known for fooling around, let her see the other girls who are vying for his attention. after that, he tell you he is no good for you - so if u fall for him, its your problem. and he is not responsible. if u want him, then its just FWB or maybe just ONS. but nothing else beyond that for sure.</p>

              <p>If he still beats around the bush giving pretty lame excuses.. or dilly dallying.. well.. seems like he is laying the groundwork for some fast in fast out. Looks like he wants some fast food takeaway, tell him.. sorry. Yours is chef prepared.</p>

              <p>He already stated that he is not interested in you as a gf.</p>
              <p>So please do not see him as a bf. Just take him as a chat buddy, someone whom you can talk to with, but preferably kept at arm's length.</p>

              <p>trust me on this one, kiddo. this is typical buaya effect. hard to resist, no? only if you know the ending first, will you be able to resist. hence i give u the ending.</p>
              <p>another thing. u think he bring you out no benefit to him? wrong. it makes him very attractive to the other girls in the clubs. any guy who can bring a girl to a club will auto attract other girls in the club. cos they know he must have something to attract a girl to go with him. those single guys who go to clubs are either losers or lone wolves. his tactics are more subtle.</p>
