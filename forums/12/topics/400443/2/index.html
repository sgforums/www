              <p>I find it suffocating for me to make friends with ppl like him
                  and his friends who make assumptions as and when.</p>
              <p>It just need a little drama to show the true nature of ppl.</p>

              <p>Actually I think it is suffocating when a person doesn't know when you need time away from him/her.</p>
              <p>Whatever happened between you and your friend, it is apparent that he needs space and time away from you. It may be difficult for him to express it bluntly as he does not want to hurt you - but it is definitely clear that he is giving you a lot of hints that he needs the 'time off'.</p>
              <p>Instead of reading the hints, and being an understanding friend - you are now pushing him to really stop all entire contact with you.  In the end, making him feel guilty will just make him patronise you: is that what you want out of a friendship?</p>
              <p>He has the freedom to choose what he wants to do with his 24 hours a day - whether it is to do his work, to go out with other people etc. EVEN if he chooses to nuah at home instead of going out with you, it is HIS perogative! No one owes another person a friendship and i think I'll hate someone to go out with me just for the sake of obligation.</p>
              <p>Let him take a breather from you and maybe he will enjoy your company again.</p>

              <p><br> Hi,</p>
              <p>I got fren also very similar to yours.But I pretend to like him.
              He is very arrogant.</p>
              <p>Last time, he was heartbroken when his girlfriend abandon him.
              So I was the person who be a friend and advice him.</p>
              <p>But now, he is very unfriendly. He has a new girlfriend and a
              new job. When I ask him out,he makes a lot of excuses. One time,
              when he finally relented and came out, he even attempted to spite
              me by telling me that he's coming late.</p>
              <p>And then when he came one hour later, made me waited for him for
              one hour. He told me that he went to gym first. What a jerk. I told
              him off. But he said that he would have been late anyway because of
              the rain.</p>
              <p>So we went yam cha. I ask him what is his problem. He gave me a
              lot of excuses. He tell me he now live with his gf in their new
              Condo. He say that he is too busy bcause he has to shop for grocery
              and cook for her. I ask him, hey i call you out for yam cha once in
              2 months, you also too busy to come out? Some more he don't have
              kids. Why is he so busy? Now he got gf and very good stable job, he
              side step friend like me.</p>
              <p>He kept on with his excuses. I have a friend who have two kids
              and every weekdays his company flies him to Malaysia to work. Yet,
              he still got time to yam cha with me every forthnight.</p>
              <p>So I thought that this friend must have been a jerk. I recall he
              quit his job 3 years ago and went on to become a financial or
              wealth planner. His business wasn't successful. Because he didn't
              have enough clients. So I guess he must have blamed me being one of
              his friends who didn't buy his policies.</p>
              <p>Good! At least I know what kind of true friend he is. He also
              managed to find out about my salary from another friend, when I
              accidentaly applied to one of my other friend's company. So last
              time, he tried to mock me about my salary. Before he quit his
              so-called prestigous job, he tried to mock me by telling me that he
              got offered by a weath planner company to work part time as an
              administrator with the same salary as mine and he had the
              opportunity to go freelance and sell his policies as well. Then
              coincidentaly he quoted the salary same as mine, and he said it was
              very low. He said that to try to offend me. I know he did so
              because I know that there is no way, anybody can get my exact
              figure, my salary was SGD -,377.00  I am omitting the
              thousands. If he can say the last three digits as 377 then
              something is not right.</p>
              <p>What a jerk. But I call him out even though he refuses to pick
              up my calls and made a lot of excuses not to meet me. But I still
              call him. Why? Because I want to tell other people, that I am not
              so easily shoo off. He thinks he can get away with his rudeness? I
              gather all the evidence how bad he treat me and how bad he was rude
              to me. So, I tell everyone about his arrogant behaviour. I call him
              not because i like him and I know he is not interested in peace but
              to make a mockery out of me. I do so, because I take the challenge.
              I know I will meet a lot of this kind of people outside. So, I want
              to learn how to handle them. To make me a better person next time.
              Also, I am very generous person. My other friends call me out, I
              never say no. because I don't want to be like this friend. God will
              vindicate us one day. I am very sure, god would punish friends who
              don't appreciate friendship.</p>

              <p><br>I already dump him as a friend. When I came down to town from Malaysia for CNY I didn't bother to call him. But 2 years ago we came out because of class reunion, i kepochee and ask him what is he doing. Nothing vengeful about that.  </p>
