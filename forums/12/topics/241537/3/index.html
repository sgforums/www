I think it's only safe to think that he's either interested in you (primarily?) or he's just an overly confident dude.<br><br>It can be a complicated break down just based on the 'He is interested in you scenerio'.<br><br>Possibilities.. He might be still holding onto emotional baggage..? He might be interested enough but to some people, it's no reason enough for them to step into a relationshipship.. -&gt; There must be some 'triggering factor(s)'. He's not sure about how you might be feeling too..? etc...<br><br>That's why I'm suggesting you encourage and hint him along for now...? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>or he isnt too keen lor.  actually im under the impression that if a guy IS interested, he will ask.  might take his time to figure himself a little, but ultimately he will do the asking.  if u feel something is going on, chances are he too will feel it, and if he choose to let u slip, maybe he isnt really considering u.<br><br>at least not yet.  dun get into the trap of falling hopelessly in love with him.  when u found out he was never interested u fall even harder.</div>
