I think what Chaah is saying are these and I am learning from her:<br><br>1) man-woman relationship is really a mind reading game.....she is saying try to be as open as possible so that it is easy for the other party......I really regret not doing enough for my ex.<br><br>2) Although it is a mind -game, at the same time, a woman has to keep cool so as not to look desperate. For man, it is still ok. If his feeling is proven wrong, the most paiseh only.<br><br>Woman don't want to look desperate even if she is. In case she is wrong about her feeling, she can be seen to look cheap.......it is about dealing with her feeling......<br><br>Especially for Chaah. She still has office staff to deal with, remember?<br><br>3) It is the man who must do the chasing. No matter much a woman indicates her feeling, it is the man who die, die must indicates his feeling. From my experience, must indicates not one time but many, many times.<br><br>At first I don't know....I already indicated how much I like her...how beautiful she was to me.....I thought she know......then I saw how insecure she was as time passed by......<br><br>Woman is really like a vase. Man must takes it out and admires it from time to time and makes sure don't polish so hard that it breaks and says how beautiful it is........haiz if only I can turn back the clock............<br><br></div>

I think what Chaah is saying are these and I am learning from her:<br><br>1) man-woman relationship is really a mind reading game.....she is saying try to be as open as possible so that it is easy for the other party......I really regret not doing enough for my ex.<br><br>2) Although it is a mind -game, at the same time, a woman has to keep cool so as not to look desperate. For man, it is still ok. If his feeling is proven wrong, the most paiseh only.<br><br>Woman don't want to look desperate even if she is. In case she is wrong about her feeling, she can be seen to look cheap.......it is about dealing with her feeling......<br><br>Especially for Chaah. She still has office staff to deal with, remember?<br><br>3) It is the man who must do the chasing. No matter much a woman indicates her feeling, it is the man who die, die must indicates his feeling. From my experience, must indicates not one time but many, many times.<br><br>At first I don't know....I already indicated how much I like her...how beautiful she was to me.....I thought she know......then I saw how insecure she was as time passed by......<br><br>Woman is really like a vase. Man must takes it out and admires it from time to time and makes sure don't polish so hard that it breaks and says how beautiful it is........haiz if only I can turn back the clock............<br><br></div></blockquote>I can't help but agree with ILPSY somewhat. If Chaah hadn't the remotest liking for the guy, I don't think she'd even start this thread, much less care about interpreting the guy's every gesture.<br><br>She wants him, but she's going to "hold back" - well, is a potential lifetime's worth of happiness worth just that little ego-bruising?
