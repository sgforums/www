              The service of most stores seem to have suffered an alarming drop of proper mannerism nowadays.
              They seem to think that theres actually an option to be nice to customers?!
              I believe most of you have already encounted the non-english speaking variety...LOL!
              
              My horror story resides with such an encounter.
              As soon as I spoke english to her,the whole expression on her face would change and that "wonderful" mainland chinese attitude would show.
              I can't help knowing how predictable this kind of behaviour is.
              I could go on but there really would be no end to it....LOL!
              
              
              Your turn......kindly share with us all your horror tales!
              
              
              
              PS&gt; sincerest apologies if such a topic has been brought up before.
                      I don't post much...LOL!

              <p>Sales line is ok, but how many locals want to do it? Pay you 1000 bucks a month, 12 hour shift, work on weekends, stand outside the restaurant and promote ramen/teppanyaki/soba, otherwise you'll be inside serving the occasional grouchy local customer, you want?</p>

              <p>U are very understanding by making thes valid point</p>
              <p>Some local customers can be damn bitchy and a pain in the ass. Which is why I am always polite and courteous towards sales staff. Unless of course they choose to be nasty</p>

              how many of you have actually worked service before? while we look at other's service standard, how about the part we ourselves play? As customers we always got the impression customer is always right, we give them downright lousy attitude. We make unreasonable demands thinking that we knows best and stuffs. They are ppl too and they do have their moods. When we go outright to spoil their mood, why are we still expecting ppl to smile at you? I believe we shld all self reflect on ourselves whether we are good customers before we go ard talking about bad service. 
              
              It take one to know one. Work in a full service line and you know how bad singaporean customers can get.
