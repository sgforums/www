            <div class='col-md body'>Hey girl, I am working on 3 jobs, 1 on weekdays, both on weekends. So take heart, you're not the only person who is having to work really hard. It'll build your character, you just need to look on the bright side of life rather than wallow in self pity. The fact that you're able to take on so much work and these ordeals, it shows how strong a person you are, and the last thing you need to do is find any excuse to feel sad. I think it's good to work, you're contributing to the society and you're so much better than alot of people whom we called useless people of the society, who have hands/legs but don't work always take from the society but never return. So cheer up, look on the bright side of life, you're still young, long way to go in life.</div>

Just bear with it for the time being but bear in mind not to jepodize your studies due to work.<br><br>I'm one living bad example that you shouldn't follow. I dropped out of school right after my O Levels and tried to study part time and work full time but I simply just can't concentrate on my studies thus never really complete anything. I'm very free now, no work no money and plenty of stress. Tried to find jobs and realised that there isn't much I can do and I have to think of my future with my gf.<br><br>So end up what? I decide to start my own small business hoping that it'll at least expand in years to come and money starts rolling in. But right now it's still just at the beginning and I'm still living on bread and water with no earnings.<br><br>Ask yourself, do you wanna end up like me? If "NO", then just bear with it. Things will be much better for you once you graduate. At least you know when you'll graduate..I don't even know when my business will really start to earn money.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
