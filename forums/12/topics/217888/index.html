            <div class='col-md body'>You're dealing with at least two key factors here, namely the approach that you take to the subjects that you're studying and your study habits.  Study habits are probably easier to deal with, so let's look at that first.<br><br>The longest single period of time you're likely to be able to focus on something is about 40 minutes, but let's start with 20.  If you don't have a watch with a countdown timer, try getting your hands on one.  Set the timer to 20 minutes, and once you hit the start button, get down to work.  When the timer goes off after 20 minutes, take a 5-minute break and get back to work.<br><br>The idea behind using the timer is that you don't want to get distracted watching the clock - instead, you need to focus on whatevere you're doing.  At the start, even 20 minutes will seem like a challenge and you'll find your attention wandering, but just stick to what you're doing.  Once you get used to it, that 20 minutes will seem pretty easy.  Move up to 30 minutes with 7.5-minute breaks, and later to 40 minutes with 10-minute breaks.<br><br>Don't expect immediate success with this, but stick with it and after a while you'll develop the habit.<br><br>The other part's a bit tougher.  Let's face it - you can't really expect to have an interest in what you're studying if none of the material has any personal relevance to you.  The trick is to take what you're studying and have a bit of fun putting things in your own terms.  At Sec 4, I absolutely hated literature, but my way around it was to turn it into a game - for example, one of my classmates and I made up a Bronx version of Julius Caesar: "Brutus!  You rat!  You dirty stinking low-down scumbag!  After all I've done for you, you stab me in the back?".<br><br>Ah well, you had to be there - it was good for a chuckle.  My point is that instead of trying to memorise everything by rote, turn it into a form that means something to you.</div>

Don't you think you are only causing stress only? If not why?</div></blockquote>All depends on how you approach it.  If you go "I MUST get 80%", you're forcing yourself to do it, rather than aiming for it - that's stressful.<br><br>I'd suggest that a "let's see how much we can squeeze out of this - 80% looks good" approach is closer to what aiming means.  It's all a game, and you just play to win.<br><br>Hell, when you do get what you aim for, especially if you consider the target respectable, the feeling's priceless.</div>

Don't you think you are only causing stress only? If not why?</div></blockquote>Nobody's asking you to aim for a roofless sky... Know your limits and aim for something realistic enough... But never belittle yourself or your own standard.. Aim for something totally unrealistic, of course would make you fall...<br><br>Do you actually think the total elimination of stress is good thing? That's only when you're already highly efficient or still have a long way (time) to manage your studies... Then again... If you have a long way to go for you to plan and work your way through, I don't see why you can't aim high?</div>
