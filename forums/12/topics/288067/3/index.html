After sometime, i realised that i am not the one she likes.<br><br>She at first was just forcing me to tell her my crush, then i told her i like a girl from my course. I ask her to do the same, she said the guy is not from my course. Thats the first blow. I knew that its not me.<br><br>Then she dropped another few hints while trying to persuade me to tell her who i like, and i am almost certain she is not talking about me.<br><br>Then i did something stupid. Knowing i will fail, i still confessed through sms as she got disconnected and went to sleep.<br><br>I think i got the wrong hints from her, even in today's conversation, her unwillingness to tell me who she likes although she wants to know mine etc etc, before i realised its not me. I still went ahead and confess.<br><br>I think i am stupid.<br><br>She have not replied me,  most prob sleeping but well, its all over!</div></blockquote>dude, u already told her first she is not the one u like but rather someone  else from ur course. how u expect her to tell u the one she like is u? unless she is realli thick skinned.....<br><br>i think u stand a good chance already. normally gals wun go for one-one dates (esp 5d4n wtf?! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ) with someone they dislike. since she dun dislike u, u already have some chance. go for it....dun regret it if u dun...she might be waiting 4 u too..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>nvm la... u are a brave Spartan,, u confessed liou.. at least she knew it now.. if she reject u, just be a friend la...<br><br>so, wat u do now , is just wait for her reply,, if she never say anything for months.. that means she rejected u but just duno how to say and perhaps she scared might affect ur relationship with her...<br><br>SO , after a week and she never reply at all.. u can simply say, we can still be friends and dont worry cuz it wont affect your frienship<br><br>U must learn more bout gals , dude,,if u got no exp, whatever gals said  might give u wrong hint.. so better know them better. I noticed gals dont really notice that they are gicing the wrong hint but hey, it is us guy who think too much sometimes without knowing what they really think or want.<br><br>Cheer up la.. ur not stupid. U just dun have the experience bout how gals treat guy sometimes.. they can treat u very very good that u almost convinced they like u but in the end, they just like only a guy..and that guy is not u.<br><br>To know if a gal really really like u, u just have to do more research man, seems ur research is too little and only based on few facts</div>

Furthermore, i might be away next near for a few months. that period perhaps will tell me if there's any hope for me.<br><br>i know this is sort of a gamble.
