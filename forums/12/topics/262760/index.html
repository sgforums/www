It's a problem, because she wants to have a kid, and she doesn't want to have a kid without marriage.<br><br>What would you do in this situation?</div></blockquote>The girl should ask the bf why he wants to marry at the age of 35. Why that specific age, any significance? Or is it possible to maybe make it a few years earlier?<br><br>I think many guys are reluctant to marry early because they put their career first, they would want to establish their career and stabilize their financial situation before getting into a marriage. Getting married is not an easy decision, it concerns two parties and the guy will be thinking if he is able to provide for the girl. So maybe the reason why he sets it at 35 is because he thinks by then he should be able to support the girl and the kids when they come.<br><br>So if it is possible for his career to take off before then, there might be a possibility he can make it a few years faster. The guy should understand the girl's concern and try to find a way to compromise with her.

            <div class='col-md body'>this is a tough one, both are young and 22yr old man and a 23-24yr man's thinking can be very different depending on if he is still schooling or working ......<br><br>He may think that he wants to get married at 35 now but might change his mind later there is no way to know now. I guess it all depends on the girl if she thinks its safe to give him some time, after all she should know him better than anyone of us here.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
