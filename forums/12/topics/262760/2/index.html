No intention of getting married early... or is it the other way?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Anyway, I should seek advice and consultation from families and friends.

It don't have to be CEO standard but well enough to assure her I offer stability.<br><br>I will discuss more with her to see in 1 or 2 years time what will happen. We will pen down our current issues and keep check (she want to settle down by 28, I want to settle it by 35) and then after 1 year, we cross reference the points again and our own reflections to see if our values have changed. Then another year to further check.<br><br>BUT ultimately we both have to help each other to be more faithful and accountable to each other while we work towards a solution whereby we can come to a consensus.<br><br>That is what I would do bah...

            <div class='col-md body'>Possible solution for the girl :<br><br><span style="color: brown;">The girl can set a 2 yr time frame to try to understand the guy and set a challenge to convince the guy to marry early. To be frank, few guys that really love a girl will want to marry 1 at 35yrs old. In fact, to my opinion, I feel that no guys will want to marry 1 at 35 yrs old. There is a reason behind on the intention for the guy to marry 1 at 35 yrs old. And the girl has to find out and share the problems with him...<br>If 2 yrs failed, the girl can decide to leave the guy. Anyway, the 2 yr time frame can also use to judge if the girl really love the guy... So, it is not a bad idea...</span><br><br>Possible solution for the guy who truly love the girl:<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Socialise more, gain more experience from those who married and blah blah to widen yr view in marriage and career. After which think for a while, present yr plans or ideas to yr gf. Or give some "if" statement to her, to test her reaction. If she doesnt understand, then there's nothing u can do abt it... Just put the burden on yr shoulder... :p If she understand and willing to share the problem with u, good for u ... </span><br><br>Anyway, to sumarise.... it is just abt talking and understanding each other... If both of them cant even pass this stage, I think both of them do not even need to think about marriage... Coz, in marriage, u need even more understanding...<br><br></div>
