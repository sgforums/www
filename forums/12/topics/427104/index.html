              <p>Okay so this involves 2 of my good friends actually. Called A and B (duh). Im close with them both since 2004 and recently both of them are quite hostile just cos of a stupid issue in my opinion. We are all 21s.</p>
              <p>It was 2 years ago that this girl B likes a guy from our school. I wasnt too aware abt it but i came to know they 2 were steadies. They broke up just aft a few months. Then this girl A and a few of her friends went to console B cos she was devastated. I rmbr B skipped alot of lessons just cos of her heartbreak. We spend alot of time consolling her and try to make her forget abt the guy. Girl A was quite close to her and basically u can say they are best of friends. Eventually B moved on...</p>
              <p>Just last week, B called me and was fucking mad abt something. She said that she came to know A was dating her ex-bf. B said she was so heartbroken to know the news cos she sees it in a way that by A dating B's ex-bf, it shows that A is somewhat supportive of what B's ex-bf did to B prior the break up. I told B to call A and ask her qtns. B said A wouldnt want to pick up her calls. It makes me sad to see my best friends fighting over a small issue. Since the guy is single, he can date whoever he wants right? At the same time, if my ex-bf mistreats me and my friends know it and one of them dates him soon after, i will be disappointed too. Not out of jealousy but comeon, that buy gave me hell and u are in love with him! Im quite neutral abt this but how do i make them talk to each other abt it? I know i can help cos i dont have issues with A and B.</p>
              <p>What should i do as a friend?</p>

              <p>Fear is the strongest emotion. From which births emotions such as jealousy etc.</p>

              <p>What breaks relationships/friendships .  Moolah... and girls or boys in this instances. Just let them work it out themselves. If A doesnt listen to B , and IF she gets the same treatment as his ex, then A and B can become best of friends with the same experience from the same guy. After the whole fiasco is over. xD</p>
              <p>IF A gets treated well, there is no reason B should be angry, or maybe she should, cause she got treated like shit. But that's just how it is! Both date the same person before, what will go wrong with that right u ask ? Alot. Just lend an ear and a hand when A n B are in need of one lo.</p>
              <p>I think best is not to interefere with thier private affairs, only when they are in immediate physical danger or so much emotional distress that she is bordering on insanity or immediate self-harm do you intervene. Because trust me, sometimes you mean well, but people just dont listen. If ppl actually listen, the world wouldnt be so fuked up now. Always ask yourself this.. and ask them , "Is the juice... worth the squeeze!"</p>

              <p>What breaks relationships/friendships .  Moolah... and
              girls or boys in this instances. Just let them work it out
              themselves. If A doesnt listen to B , and IF she gets the same
              treatment as his ex, then A and B can become best of friends with
              the same experience from the same guy. After the whole fiasco is
              over. xD</p>
              <p><strong>IF A gets treated well, there is no reason B should be angry, or
              maybe she should, cause she got treated like shit. But that's just
              how it is! Both date the same person before, what will go wrong
              with that right u ask ? Alot. Just lend an ear and a hand when A n
              B are in need of one lo.</strong></p>
              <p>I think best is not to interefere with thier private affairs,
              only when they are in immediate physical danger or so much
              emotional distress that she is bordering on insanity or immediate
              self-harm do you intervene. Because trust me, sometimes you mean
              well, but people just dont listen. If ppl actually listen, the
              world wouldnt be so fuked up now. Always ask yourself this.. and
              ask them , "Is the juice... worth the squeeze!"</p>

              <p>I think i will do just that. Check on them individually how they are doing. But I have to tell B to move on and get along. And from what i can guess, A is abit guilty cos she isnt picking up B's calls.</p>

              Wow! the guy must be good looking , tall, hunky and is BIG down there.
              
              If not, do not proceed because tell B - he is not worth it. Since I assume B was dumped by that guy - she can start dating his best friend or brother in return if all she wants was revenge.
              
              Else logical planning
              
              1) Ask B ,if she already have sex with the guy 
              
              If no = no lost , because all of you still young and serious there are A LOT OF GUYS around.
              
              2) If yes = ask her if it was good
              
              If no = tell A that guy sucks in bed no point getting attached to him
              
              3) If yes = Hate A and support B because A refuse to share the candy with everyone.
              
              4) Only befriend A if she shares the guy's candy with both of u.

              <p>Okay so this involves 2 of my good friends actually. Called A
                      and B (duh). Im close with them both since 2004 and recently both
                      of them are quite hostile just cos of a stupid issue in my opinion.
                      We are all 21s.</p>
              <p>It was 2 years ago that this girl B likes a guy from our school.
                      I wasnt too aware abt it but i came to know they 2 were steadies.
                      They broke up just aft a few months. Then this girl A and a few of
                      her friends went to console B cos she was devastated. I rmbr B
                      skipped alot of lessons just cos of her heartbreak. We spend alot
                      of time consolling her and try to make her forget abt the guy. Girl
                      A was quite close to her and basically u can say they are best of
                      friends. Eventually B moved on...</p>
              <p>Just last week, B called me and was fucking mad abt something.
                      She said that she came to know A was dating her ex-bf. B said she
                      was so heartbroken to know the news cos she sees it in a way that
                      by A dating B's ex-bf, it shows that A is somewhat supportive of
                      what B's ex-bf did to B prior the break up. I told B to call A and
                      ask her qtns. B said A wouldnt want to pick up her calls. It makes
                      me sad to see my best friends fighting over a small issue. Since
                      the guy is single, he can date whoever he wants right? At the same
                      time, if my ex-bf mistreats me and my friends know it and one of
                      them dates him soon after, i will be disappointed too. Not out of
                      jealousy but comeon, that buy gave me hell and u are in love with
                      him! Im quite neutral abt this but how do i make them talk to each
                      other abt it? I know i can help cos i dont have issues with A and
                      B.</p>
              <p>What should i do as a friend?</p>
