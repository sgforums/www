              <p>My dad started his buisness trips 5 years ago. It was all ok
              until this afternoon, where my mom and I found him within the
              country where he was suppose to be overseas. He's been borrowing $$
              from my mother, grandmother, aunt and myself for his business and
              never returned a single cent. Sure we've visited his shop before
              and it seemed ok, but what happened this afternoon was just too
              much. My mom now suspects him of infidelity coz there's this prc
              woman who helps him out occasionally. I don't know what to do now
              coz my mum wants me to give her a solution, yet I do not want to
              make quick assumptions. Can anyone give some advise? Please do try
              to understand what I wrote above becoz I'm not typing in the right

              <p>Thanks guys, mom and I forced the answer from dad. It was hard at first but he finally came out with it. He wasn't cheating, just that he happened to be back for his clients goods before he transit to malaysia when we visited him(saw doc prove). The money he borrowed apparently was cheated by his business partner, and he didn't know how to bring it up to us that's y he kept quiet for so long.</p>
              <p>Thanks for your help ppl, the air is finally cleared in my family. We are finally able to talk to each other naturally again.</p>

              <p>That prc was just a 'slave' belonging to the next door in the past. She helped him because my dad helped her son before. Now that he's moved to his new place for some years and from what he declared, we don't see there's any reason for there to be a scandal. There was truth in his eyes, we choose to believe it.</p>
