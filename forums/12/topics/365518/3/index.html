              <p>um. guess its really hard to forget....probably you woulnt and never will? the feelings that only one person can provide. haha. its quite esoteric....and i never really believed in that tree and forest analogy before anyway. i think its simply some supportive words which people use to try and console others but have no..significant meaning.</p>
              <p>guess instead of trying to forget now, you can block that memory out from your mind instead. to me, "forgetting" is to face the situation and tell yourself to accept the truth and reality and move off with life. to "block" is to pretend to yourself nothing happened and get a move on with your life...although it could be nagging at your conscience now and then, but at least you dont have to face it now. as time passes by and you calm down...perhaps you can better accept reality. and maybe at the same time realise someone else actually cares more about you than you thought....</p>

              <p>So what are you going to do now? Chase her back again for a 4th time or move on? This is a very important question which you need to ask yourself first. Given that NS is coming your way soon enough,.you may want to stop all bg relationship for now until you are out of army, or at least through with BMT.</p>
              <p>Nobody can tell you what to do, seriously. But we can tell you that it is pretty obvious the two of you are not mature enough, and have problems with having a proper bg relationship.</p>
              <p>From your posts, can I conclude that she is the one who dump you everytime? If that is the case, you better move on already. She takes you more as a fling - someone who she needs now and then -  rather than a bf.</p>
              <p>Getting over her will be a tough thing, but with army around the corner, it is a good chance for you to not think about her, as once you go in, you will be busy worrying about whether the PS is going to te-kan you in the next hour or so.</p>
              <p>For now, after this one month with her, just take the remaining time you have to study and build up your body; using exercising and training as a way to keep your focus somewhere else.</p>

              <p>well well well... i understand your pain... its very difficult to let go and maybe after years you will still feel the pain...</p>
              <p>Sorry I cant help you, because I never actually let go before... so what I do to ease my pain is to get her back. Once you get her back the pain will actually go. So ask yourself do you want to get her back, if yes.. then your pain will go off.</p>
              <p>If you dont intend to get her back, then you listen to the others and see what you can do to ease the pain.</p>
              <p>Its painful, some people never let go until they die, they will keep having the regret feeling inside them forever. The most you can do is to occupy yourself with work, with activities so that you will be mentally tired to think of her and hope that the pain will ease off.</p>
              <p>However, please do not indulge in drinking, smoking or gambling just to numb yourself. This will not help you at all, but harms you more.</p>
              <p>God bless you!</p>
