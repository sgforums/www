I forgot what amount of protein u cannot exceed but u can find the info on the net or health mag.<br><br>U can still eat MEAT! Don't eat red meat loh... in fact lean chicken meat is a good source of protein and somemore no carbs or low carbs. Eat balance meal. Long-term having atikin meal isn't actually healthy.
