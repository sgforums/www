              <p>you need to be a christian too like your wife and let God take care of your problems. duh.</p>
              <p>speak to her pastor and say you also want to know God, whose name is JC. A couple that prays together is a happy healthy couple. That is the reason why Christians who are single <strong>are only supposed to</strong> marry other Christians. People like your wife who become Christian after they are married (conversion happens after marriage) and are left with unbelieving spouses are not to be blamed for being married to a non Christian.</p>

              <p>Ya... guess you guys are right.  I am afraid of change.  The past is gone but linger only as memories ..  I want to hold on to the past and live with the happy moment.  Will the future bring me happiness, we don't know ...  will the past actually bring happiness in the future, we too do not know ...  oh what is happening to me ??  I used to embrace changes and I tell my people we must accept change.  But I am now, confronted with change, is hiding from the true world.</p>
              <p>I wake up with tears on my eyes, not that I cried but there are just tear and my heart heavy.  Perhaps depression is fooling me.  I used to tell my children and staff.  Everyday we have a choice - to be happy or not to be happy.  We choose it and not chosen by other people.  I have been choosing un-happiness.  I tell myself I must remain positive but the surrounding do not allow me to be positive.  Things is happening and I am afraid I am losing the war.</p>
              <p>I just cannot work.  I cannot concentrate.  I declared half day and closes the office.  I went home and spent my time in front of the TV.  Only in front of the TV will my mind be occupied.  But I cannot on the TV 24 hours.  I just hope I can find something that is like the TV to keep me occupied.  I don't want to think anymore.  I am very tired.  very very tired.  The more I think, the more I sink. </p>
              <p>Your words of encourgement helped.  But the moment I turnd away from th screen, I am depressed.  I stll cannot let it go.  I still can't accept the truth although I wanted to.  It is so difficult.</p>

              <p>I just came back from a weekend holiday with my wife.  We never talk about the problem and we basically just laze around and have sex.  Some thing that was not done for a while now .. But I cannot cum ...  even after a long session, it  just won't cum ...  We had it so many session and I did not cum.  Am I losing interest?  Then I just realised the worst ...  I dare pen here because she know my nid and she will come here to read it ..   sigh .. another problem to kept to myself .. . . .</p>
              <p>The medication, I had taken for a month already ...  a lot of time I feel like it is not working ... wanted to give up . . .  still feel so blue.</p>
              <p>So after this holiday, what should I do ? </p>

              <p>Please understand - medication(s) and even pschotherapist and even councillor(s) are simply all temporary.</p>
              <p>U cannot deal with what u <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>dont'</strong> understand and accept</span>.</p>
              <p>If u can, reconcile to and accept your emotions (without getting attached to them or identifying with them) and NOTE - all emotions pass, it is the wanting "them" to go or wishing them away that has u mired in a rut.</p>
              <p>I would not suggest tht u do , cos doing is easy but it is not going to solve. Understandin u, not your spouse, is the key and most of being able to accept things (including people) around u. There is no certainty in life. all is change and that is the only thing that is permanent.</p>
              <p>If u choose to wish and desire that things/pp remain the same - u are merely setting up yourself to 'fail' again.</p>
              <p>Go with the flow - but be open to what may or may not happen.</p>
              <p>ALL THAT ONE ACCEPTS 'FREES' ONE, ALL THAT ONE RESISTS BINDS ONE.</p>
              <p>PS - Let me just reiterate - the more u have a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">centre</span> of your own making - the less anxiety, the less pressure. In other words, u paint your paradize and enter it as opposed to looking for one and hoping that it would fit u. It works - the paradise that one may look or subscribe to/embrace outside of oneself but eventually fails.</p>

              <p>What is the sex act actually?</p>
              <p>It is only a biological act meant for reproduction. It is true that majority gets satisfaction from it and mostly it will be guys who will make such claims.</p>
              <p>For women, or most women, it is totally a different concept. Most will only do it with the men they love, and the pleasure they get is unlike men. It is a deeper level, right down to the human emotions of a feeling being wanted, being loved.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, what brings a man and a woman together is love. And love is more than sex. The happiness is the critical factor that matters in an union. And what is greatest true happiness, when it is freely given and with no expectations of return?</p>
              <p>Cum or not, is not the vital factor. It is the happiness, and the pleasure you can give. It would be natural if you feel shortchanged. But it is only the animal perception you grew up with, a base instinct which many men would grew out of it when they fully mature. Some truly grow up, but many just grow childishly old. In that union, even if you feel shortchanged, it is more compensated by the woman you made love to who will love you even strongly more.</p>
              <p>When you truly love, and see the woman whom you love pleasured, you will find true happiness, and nothing really else matters anymore..</p>
              <p>Pleasure, we men can get from elsewhere, eg, dedication to our work, obligations we fulfill or even achievements made that seem impossible to others.</p>
              <p>You are sadly, still locked within a primitive mind which you must outgrow to find happiness, which is already in your life. That all that has happened, you and your wife can still love and make love is a sign of absolute recovery. Some never have that chance, given your situation. You are indeed a very very lucky man.</p>
              <p>I guess your next step is to rebuild your confidence in yourself. You are no lesser man, even though you subscribe to mainstream manly beliefs mainly created by desperadoes with a high sex drive. You are more of a man if only you would believe and trust what you are fully capable of - genuine love, caring and concern for your love ones. This is what truly matters and makes you a man, a respected one and envy of others.</p>

              <p>Some medication do not work by itself. It is only an aid to the remedy.</p>
              <p>Like sliming pills, taking them alone does not work, if the diet is not changed, and exercise is not incorporated into the programme.</p>
              <p>You must put in some physical and mental effort together with your medication. Try to control your thoughts. Stop the dialogue that is going on incessantly in you head.</p>
              <p>Try stopping your thoughts, (like holding your breath,) for a 5 - 10 seconds, then try for longer periods, then try for the minute.</p>
              <p>Of course, it is no good to be mindless, you have to think, but for the time being, you got to control the runaway dialogue going on in the mind. When you can stop that, you can now think of to improve your computer, solve the economic problems of Singapore, or how the neighbourhood can be improved, and what are the daily needs of your family. But don't start on yourself again.</p>
              <p>You can't ejaculate when you have sex. That would be a setback for your wife. She submit to you because she is your wife. To her the act is nothing more than that. And you not being to ejaculate, will make her wonder, about herself. That she is really old and useless as a woman to you. To her nevermind if she does not enjoy sex, but it is important to her that you do. It is like cooking, she cooks, you eat, and if you cannot enjoy the food, then she will not bother about cooking anymore. The bond between you and your wife will lessen. So please see the doctor. It could be the medication that is interfering with your ability to ejaculate. Don't think too much about it, medication is known to have other side effects. But do let your wife know about it.</p>

              <p>Thank you Ninja.  But he is not all wrong. I am responsibile for what is  happening to me now and I am as much to be blame.  I appreciate your kind concerns.  With the encouragement here, there is no reason I cannot snapp out of my depression.  I only need time to sort myself out of it </p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>U can get 'out' - 'kill' the 4 so-called inner voice(s) in u - the politician, the priest, parents n society. I say that cos there is no such thing as inner voice - only a conditioned crowd (the 4 thru eg, beliefs,traditions, customs ....add on) having an abode in u - in other words, the inside of u has been hijacked.The real inner voice is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">silence</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>Eg U may think that u are in the driver's seat - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in reality</span>, u are a mere passenger - other's are cajoling/prompting u to be or do. In everday living - one gets lost, attached or identifies with roles/personalities. Hence the split on the inside. One is disconnected from one's source - heart, being, soul (any name that resonates of or with one).</p>
              <p>Just <span style="text-decoration: underline;">understanding, accepting and being alert</span> to it will weaken the 4 voices and u will see what u are, and of course, it takes <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">lots of courage</span></strong>.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Courage is a by-product of self-love</span> (not to be confused with one's idea of what one is or what one has or what one was = this is merely ego!</p>
