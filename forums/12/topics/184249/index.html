From what i know she went into business with a long time family friend. I was shocked to read in her diary that she was cheated of her money in the business, owing $500K++ and now prostitute in Singapore, Thailand and Australia.<br><br>She wrote that the family friend (who cheated her business) forcibly made her to sleep with him and persuaded her to prostitute.<br><br>This is what my mum wrote in her diary...."Yong" refers to the family friend. "Martin" (not real name) is my elder brother. The entry was dated Feb 2005.<br><br>"Yong found me my first client yesterday. He's only 22. Very young chap. And I'm 45. I felt so odd kissing him because he's around the same age as Martin. I feel so ashamed of myself. pls God, why do i have to end up like this at my age. Why?? God, help me pls. I beg you. I beg you to please save me. I really can't face my sons"<br><br>I also found a copy of dvd in the same cabinet showing her having sex with about 10-12 foreign men. It seems to me most or all of them didn't use condom. She looked so cheap doing all those things for the men.<br><br>I grew up seeing her as a confident, firm career woman. But her diary reveals a vulnerable her, and it hurts to see her being manipulated to do things for those men in the dvd. She was even crying in it.

            <div class='col-md body'>Your mother is in great desperation and she could not find a better way to raise funds to amass the amount of money she needs. The method she has chosen to earn money is dangerous and risky.<br><br>I believe that she needs to be reassured of the fact that she will be forgiven unconditionally and that she would always be loved no matter what happens. Maybe the reason she is doing this is because she fears harmful repucussions, discrimination and the disrespect from her own family. Right now, she needs alot of reassurance and unconditional love to prevent her from hurting herself even more.<br><br>That is all that i could say for now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hoya! Hoya!<br><br>Let me tell you a little story.<br>An American senator was visiting a Red Indian tribe, with the hope of getting their vote. The tribe was gathered in the middle of the village, and the senator gave them the political speech. He promised them free medical care, free education, subsidised petrol, and also upgrading with covered walkway connecting all teepees. The tribe yelled Hoya! Hoya! with every promise.<br>The senator was pleased. He threw in free liquor and cigarettes for good measure. Hoya! Hoya! the tribe screamed.<br>The senator was mighty pleased with himself.<br>Later the chief invited to senator to his home for lunch.<br>On the way the senator saw some prized bulls.<br>He asked the chief if he could see the bulls up close.<br>So they stopped the car and the senator got out and proceeded towards the bulls.<br>As the senator was nearing the bulls the chief called out,"Watch out! do not step on hoya."<br><br>ibanana, you need to hold the diary in your hand to post in such detail.<br>People do not hold another's diary for long.

            <div class='col-md body'>ibanana,<br><br>Sorry to say your story sounds unconvincing. Firstly, victims who is ashame of their own act will never have any VCD or DVD showing that. Especially so if they are trying to hide their behaviour from their love ones. Secondly, it sounds more like a drama plot than what that is happening in real life. Lastly, $500k is rather a high amount to begin with, there is no way one will be able to repay by engaging in such activities.<br>On the event that what that you relate is really true, I will advise you to seek professional help immediately.<br>It is rather absurb to be talking about your own mother in this way and please stop such behavior. If you need help there are other ways of doing so.<br><br>Cheers</div>
