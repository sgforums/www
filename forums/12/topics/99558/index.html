I gave my 100% and everything... Of course was HURT DEEPLY in the end....<br><br>Then I came up with a STRANGE thing... I wanted to go for SHORT TERM relationships... Like... REAL SHORT... I told the girl that the relationship would end 2 weeks after we've known each other even before we started off... She agreed... When the time was up, we just couldn't bear... She was crying for me.... I STAYED.... PROVED to be ONE of the GREATEST MISTAKES in my LIFE....<br><br>Then I have my 'heart' divided out... And when I came across one of my CLOSEST EX... I told her about myself... She TAUGHT me something... "In a relationship... No matter how the outcome might be... Don't withold your LOVE for each other... If you're AFRAID... DON'T LOVE..." Cause even when you're in a relationship... If you don't use your heart... You probably still won't be able to understand what TRUE LOVE is ALL ABOUT..... TRUE LOVE is not about 'not getting hurt'... It's simply about BEING TRUE....<br><br>LOVE with YOUR TRUE HEART... But of course... Don't expect that failure would never befall you...? Life itself can always be quite unpredictable...?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To love someone, is a beautiful thing. And for u to have given 100% in a relationship shows what a wonderful person you are. My advice for u is that.. give what u have in a relationship (ie 100%)... if you don't, you'll regret it.<br><br>Of course there are times when it can be very heartbreaking when the other party don't give as much as u do. However, remember that.. giving your 100% means that u've fulfilled your part and given yourself the opportunity to love someone.... True love is about both party giving their outmost dedication and love to each other. If you keep giving 100% to someone.. your dedication and love will touch someone.. and i'm sure.. u'll be able to meet someone who will love u as much as u love them.<br><br>So don't be dishearten...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
