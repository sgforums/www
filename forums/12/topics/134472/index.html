As a girl, I will feel very wei qu if my bf dun admit that we are together..and I try to figure out, why is that so?  He feels that I'm not good enough for him, that our r/s cannot see daylight?  He is juz playing with me?  He has some other girlfrens..etc.  If u truly and sincerely likes somebody, pls give her the assurance and acknowledgement that she needs..and if u are really serious about her, pls, NO flirting.  But I do understand that u said there's other complications like promotions and so call maintaing the scandal situation..<br><br>Aren't u insensitive?  Flirting is already a sin, not to mention flirting in front of her.  You really din spare a thought for her feelings.  Fine, u said u were drunk.  But after you heard about what happened, you did nothing.  If you cared a least bit, you could have done something.  If you really like her, you wouldn't have flirt with the other 2 girls.  Perhaps she can tolerate<br><br>Since there's confusion about her seeing somebody and why was she hot and cold to u etc..why din u trash it out with her?  Knowing that u have hurt her, and knowing that u still like her, dun ever hurt her again......but if u dun like her, there's no reason for u to hurt her also.  </span></div>

He is juz playing with me?  He has some other girlfrens..etc.  If u truly and sincerely likes somebody, pls give her the assurance and acknowledgement that she needs..and if u are really serious about her, pls, NO flirting.

Flirting is already a sin, not to mention flirting in front of her.  You really din spare a thought for her feelings.  Fine, u said u were drunk.

How much do you really want or crave for this relationship?<br><br>There are lots of unknowns and uncertainties. Even if you get together, you might not be able to handle her in a relationship. You might not be able to accept her character (like you already can't outside of a relationship, though sometimes things work the opposite way in &amp; out). If I'm not wrong? If she's not out to play you like your friends have suggested, she's probably uncertain herself... It seems quite beyond her ability to handle the relationship well. And it's quite obvious that it's beyond your means.<br><br>Unless you're one who's prepared to dive into a relationship with lots of uncertainties quite blindly, and face whatever beholds for you.. This game is not for you.</div>

The confusion was conjured right from your own doings. If you wanna flirt around innocently without any strings attached, make sure you stick to its rule. Do not began the game and alter the variables later on, you will serve to confuse and bring troubles later on.<br><br>You are like the typical greenhorn salesman; the one that tells you alot about his product, the function, the benefits your consumer are getting, etc - but doesn't really know how to close to deal. What you are doing is merely futile, similar to that of this typical greenhorn salesman. To know about your feelings..hint...know...acknowledge... is nothing - to SAY them and to PROPOSE a relationship, guang ming zheng da, is two drastic level.<br><br>You can't blame her for the cold war and attitude. Two reasons:<br><br>I) This is an office relationship. Cold war is common and has pretty high rate of occurence and frequency.<br><br>II) Dubious position and status.<br><br>If you fell for her and everything else isn't too complicating <strong>BY NATURE</strong>, I say go for it (Please note that this complication wasn't by nature, it was man-made). If you have to lose a relationship in the future, make sure you lose it being the boyfriend, not someone who belong to neither here nor there.<br><br>P.S: Having same previous attitude in the past doesn't justify your stance forever. You got to learn to be different other times in your life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
