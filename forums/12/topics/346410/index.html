              <p>Hey kplayer,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think the question here is, what do <strong>YOU</strong> want?</p>
              <p>Your current mentality tells me that you are just "taking what you can get". I think that is not the best mindset to have. I believe that as man, we should respect ourselves enough to go out there and get what we want, instead of settling with what we have.</p>
              <p>But I assume that you are actually romantically interested in this girl and she has proven her attractiveness to you.</p>
              <p>One thing that is for sure is that she does not dislike you, which means you are in a position to make something happen. What do <strong>YOU</strong> want? I think what you should do is lead the relationship towards the direction that you want. Do you want to be friends, friends with benefits or a couple? Let her know how she is attractive to you and tell her your intentions.</p>
              <p>Live and Love</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>Yes, What DO YOU WANT?</p>
              <p>If you want the girl to fall in love with you or you are hoping for the girl to fall in love with you, then you can WAIT LONG LONG for it...cos it's not going to happen to you.</p>
              <p>And if you're a MAN, and you are sure that you like her....then you should express your interest in her and ATTRACT HER.</p>
              <p>But since you are so unsure and indecisive of yourself, you are probably hoping for her to fall in love with you then you can simply say "yes" or "no".</p>
              <p>This is soo naive, if you want to experience love and relationship, then you must work for it and EARN IT.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, please kindly make way for a better guy who are more sure of his feelings for her and absolutely in love with her as compared to you to sweep her away and rescue her from you.</p>
              <p>Please be smarter and have a mind of your own and stop listening to your sex-pert predator friends of yours.</p>
              <p>And why is that? Because not every girl is the same as what your sex-pert predator friends have described.</p>
              <p>Friends can go out alone together without falling for each other. It just meant that she doesn't dislike you as a friend, but that doesn't means she has fallen in love with you.</p>
              <p>Please ask your sex-pert predator friends to grow a brain first before acting like some Singaporean Champion.</p>
              <p>There are always smarter and better girls around in Singapore, so please don't assume all Singaporean girls are more retarded than your friends.</p>

Go out with other girls as well and make comparison. From there, you can decide who is the best for you. Some times a girl goes out with you for free food and entertainment. Hence, be a smart Alex. See more flowers before you make the important decision. Good luck.</p></div>

              Sorry to say, but she is not into u. She don't initiate SMS, don't reply immediately means she is not that keen. She may be going out with u cos u are paying.
