            <div class='col-md body'>when going for clinical trial, they are specially concern for your health status. I do not know what type of trial you are undergoing, but if you feel unfeel, you have to tell them immediately. They will even note your complain down into their data as part of the trial result.<br><br>because you will not know what they want from the test(placebo or double-blind), so just keep them inform of anything which you dont feel good or right...there is no harm, and they will appreciate your contributions..dont worry about it..<br><br>weijian: such trials, are paid, and i think they are paid quite well...personally, i have no such experience, but i am from research area, so i know abit here and there....Normally, they will put up a notice in the newspapers, seeking for healthy males or females between whatever age, and their requirements...<br>just keep a lookout in the papers...</div>

I thought of just helping them since i have been running to improve my stamina, just take that as my normal training.
