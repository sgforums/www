            <div class='col-md body'>I've known her ---&gt; "V" around 3yrs liao bah.. @ 1st there were 4 of us in a grp.. We were realli close with each other.. In poly, we are always seen tog.. And our classmates used to comment tat u see 1 of us, u can see the other 3..<br><br>An incident changed our whole friendship.. It occured when we were celebratin "V' birthdae.. Happen tat.. It was kinda weird.. We went shoppin tog. But then.. It seems like they were all walkin by themselves.. Not in a grp.. "V' got sensitive n became unhappy.. Since then, we slowly break off with the others.. &amp; tat's when we got close tog.. @ tat pt of time.. I feel tat wat the others did was reali untolerable.. Thus, i supported 'V' in backin out of e friendship..<br><br>She's a great friend.. During the period when i was very down.. I jus broke off with my bf.. She was the one who accompained mi to shoppin, movies, etc.. We also started to hang out with a diff grp of plp.. [Then.. Quite suddenly, she got tog with another guy from our grp.. It was onli till quite ltr din all of us found out..]    ----&gt; Ltr i'll explain why i said tis..<br><br>A yr past.. &amp; I got tog with another guy.. Tis is when things starts to sour tremendously as time goes by..<br><br>From the time i got tog with my bf, in less than 3mths time he gonna go into N.S liao.. My parents were v. strict.. &amp; I tried spendin as much free time as i could.. We couldn meet much coz he's workin &amp; onli free @ nite..<br><br>The jealousy started from the time he got into N.S. Wk end he still gonna work.. So of coz.. I'll put him 1st in priority!!<br><br>She started to get jealous.. Sayin tat.. When i'm with her.. She always put mi in 1st place over her bf.. But i treated her as if she's not impt.. Haiz!!<br><br>How mani times i put it across to her tat.. As long as u tell mi in advance u wanna meet up.. &amp; tat i've no appointment.. I'll surely meet up with u! But then.. She got upset whenever i couldn't make it..<br><br>She used to call last min.. Eg.. She meetin her friend but then it's still early to go school.. Called mi on the dae itself but then i was with my bf n couldn mak it.. Or.. Once was when she compained her bf 2 school &amp; asked mi if i could meet her earlier? Ha.. Both occassions i was with my bf..<br><br>&amp; she complains tat.. Each time she called mi, i'm always with my bf.. Why can't i jus meet her??<br><br>My principle is tat.. 1st come 1st serve.. If i already fix a date with u, i wouldn cancel jus to meet my bf.. Vice versa.. How mani times i tried explainin to her.. But it jus wouldn go in..<br><br></div>

How long a friendship would last can somehow be close to handling a BGR at times... It takes maintain and accomodating... People can change even though at times it can be a sad thing...<br><br>If you still treasure her friendship, simply tell her so.... But at the same time, also tell her and hope she'll understand that she would also have to respect your own life, your own priorities at times.. Nobody's perfect in this world and hope she'll give room for your inperfection....<br><br>If a CLOSE friend is doing something(s) which is totally OFF your CONDUCT, BELIEF(S) and ACCEPTANCE... I simply don't see why you should / could just shut your eyes forever and pretend that nothing's wrong with her. My personal opinion.</div>
