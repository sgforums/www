            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Beckboy,<br><br>Since u still love her, give her a short vacation only. Dont let it become a long vacation or a permanent break-up. Otherwise u forever lose her. During this vacation time, let her know that u still love her and think about her. Then, hopefully she will come back to u loh. So u have to keep up the romance wooing process, but more slowly and more subtle. Dunno, maybe like call every few days or once a week, whatever, as u see fit. The idea is to let her know that u are still there for her waiting for her and still loving her. Hopefully she will be touched and return to u.<br><br>But u must be mentally prepared also lah, in case she finds another guy. If that happens, then just be good friends with her loh. Being good friends is also a form of love.</div>
