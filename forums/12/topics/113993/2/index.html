I know you'll keep thinking of her, keep wanting to have her back, beg her and stuffs. You'll go crazy and a lot of silly things.<br><br>But, NEVER EVER pester her.<br><br>She'll get annoyed and irritated by your action, even though you THINK it is alright. Trust me, it's never alright.<br><br>Let her cool off first, can still be concern abt her but dont be OVERLY concerned. I guess an sms a day is ok.<br><br>Impt thing is, dont do things to irritate her. Let her cool off. Let her have her space.<br><br>If it's really meant to be, she'll come back SOONER OR LATER.<br><br>Just be paitient and don't piss her off!!!<br><br>Yes, yes, I irritated my ex till a point, where now she totally ignore my every response.     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Anyway, do get on with ur life, but do tell her that u will promise to be a better man/bf. If she comes back, she will be happier, and u too. If she doesn't, you have also changed to become a better man, and u should be happy cos more gals will like u, and u will not regret, but she may regret instead. </span><br><br><span style="color: red;"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Stay happy each day, its true tat some one commented earlier, whatever is urs, its just a period of possession, it will not last forever.
