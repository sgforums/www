            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Just Something to share with u ppls that i read from other places</strong><br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>I am 30+ le, happily married for about 10yrs. However, my love life wasn't so smooth sailing before I met my hubby.<br><br>My ex is a guy whom is 7yrs my senior. I was 20 when I met him. He is rich, decent and very kind guy who goes to church n volunteer alot. I was attracted to all his good points.<br><br>We worked in the same company at that time. I was 1 of the youngest n prettiest girl there. I had many suitors but I wasn't interested at all. I juz became frens with my ex cos he stayed near my home n often offer to fetch n send me.<br><br>We chatted everything n share our love life. I guess I felt v secure to hv some1 so muz older to lean on. I didn't realise that my ex n I started to click off after that.<br><br>He had juz broken off wif his gf of 6yrs n I was his companion. He liked how innocent n sweet I was. I trusted him fully as we were so open abt our relationships.<br><br>I thought that there was no reason that he shd cheat on me cos he is so old le. I respected him n even obey his instructions wat to wear. I was so naive n silly.<br><br>We only went out after work til midnite.. I will hv to wait for his calls on wkends for a date. I cld not afford a hp at that time n wil always stay at home to wait for him. He usually picks me up v late evening.<br><br>He did not show any sign of cheating. However, he misplaced his hp in my bag once n I got his gf phone number easily. There r many nos but I saw this particular 1 with a nickname which stored office, hp n pager n I guess something fishy.<br><br>The next day, I page that number n a girl returned my call. As my ex had told me all abt his ex, I juz pretend that I am buying insurance frm her(she is an insurance agent). I met her n was surprised to see a contrast between the 2 of us. She is the next door girl while I am young n vibrant.<br><br>That night, I called the girl again. I mentioned my ex name n she started crying pitifully. She told me that it was not the 1st time. I was hurt n angry. He had met her daily but briefly. He always send her back after dinner claiming he was v tired n met me after that. He chosed to spend most festival with me n leave her alone. He always hv excuses..I juz wondered y this gal can accept all these craps lor.. On his birthday, we booked a chalet. He did sneak out during lunch time claiming he had some errands to run n return to me.<br><br>I confronted my ex then. I was sad but I was a v strong headed girl then. My ex denied all but he did not stop me from breaking up. I pitied the girl for spending 6yrs with this jerk.<br><br>I did not eat n cried for 3 days. It was difficult for me. I decided to resign frm my job but my boss encouraged me to stay. My ex also started telling every1 that he was v sorry but he really did not cheat. I guess I was too stubborn to accept any explaination then. I moved on with my life n met my hubby. My hubby is also a nice guy n we got married v soon after that.<br><br>If u were to ask me, if I married on impluse, I guess I was at that time. However, I really hv to thank god that I had made a wise decision. Sometimes, I do ponder if I shd listen n accept my ex explaination but then... I met him 5yrs after I got married, he still insisted that it was not wat I thought. The only acceptable explanation I can find for him is : he was torn between the 2 of us. He loved us both???<br><br>I am sharing this story not to encourage pple to give a chance or break up. I juz felt that u hv to learn to thrash things out b4 jumping to any decisions. I love my hubby n we hv a wonderful family. I dunno if things wil b different if I chosed to give my ex a chance at that time. My ex is also a v proud person so he did not bother muz explainations 2.<br><br>Nevertheless, I was really hurt badly n I always worried abt the trust in my hubby. I trusted my hubby alot 2 but I juz hoped I can put my past behind n start learning to build trust in men again. Lastly, I wish everyone the best in love</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And the point of this story is???<br><br>Really, if this woman really really really has gotten over her ex as she said, then is there a need for her to tell anyone about her past at all? so what if she bumped into her ex after five years later and he still insist it wasn't what she was thinking at that time. It shouldn't make a diff with her anymore bcause it was already the past. She has moved along and got married. Her past with her ex would have been a haze, a distant memory already. Why the need to ponder or wonder what would happen to her present now if she has acted differently if she had given her ex a chance?<br><br>From what I see, she actually still retained a part of her for her ex , which in a way she is cheating on her spouse now if you ask me. She still couldn't let go of that part of her past with her ex. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
