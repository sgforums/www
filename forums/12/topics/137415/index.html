I was practically not interested in anything except liquor and cigarette, drinking and smoking almost everyday.<br><br>I love her alot, but yet she had decided to end it all. It took me a lot of efforts to show her that I truly love her but no use at all. She still decided to end it. She wanted to remain as friends but I didnt want to. I don't want to be reminded of the past few months that I had gone thru. It is really very torturing.<br><br>It also took me a lot of effort to get over this r/s and to start everything afresh. It is really tough, and as and when memories just come and I miss her again..<br><br>She did sms and call me a few times. But I didn't just want to remain as friends, it's just too torturing for me. Now she has another guy.<br><br>Yet today, I saw her, actually I didn't want to call her. But I saw her at the clinic near her office. My heart soften, and I know deep within myself that I still love and care for her a lot. I am very worried as why is she seeing a doctor. So I called her and talked to her for a while, she really looked very pale and she said she was not feeling well for the past few days.<br><br>How I wished I could be right there by her side to take care of her right now, but seems not possible. So I wished her well and asked her to take care of herself.<br><br>I thought I had let go of this r/s, let go of her, but I was very wrong.

I am trying to let go, day by day, I just keep myself busy with my work. But there are times when I am alone, I will start thinking abt her.<br><br>That is also why, I refuse to remain as friends with her. Not that I am petty or what, but I feel that is the best way for me to let go and also not to remind me of the pain that I had gone thru also.<br><br>I am much better but today when I saw her, I keep thinking about our past again, really can't stop myself from not thinking.<br><br>Sigh..</div></blockquote>I cut off contact with all my exes too. Today when I see them again, I just stare them in the face and walk away.<br><br>Call me cruel if you like.<br><br>Oh, you will forget when you have met a better person in the future.
