Avoiding each other isn't the easiest way because you'll start imagining things.  You can still hang with the person like a friend but first you take off you rosy "love" glasses.  Open your eyes and see the person for what they really are.  Look at the "bad" side of the person and soon you'll think "what the heck was I thinking being in love with that!!??" Trust me, you'll start avoiding soon after that.  If not, at least you've got a friend for life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>here's some reasons why she may have been at the doctors:<br>1) maybe she went to the doctor to see if she's pregnant<br>2) maybe she went to the doctor cos she thinks she's got STD/communicable disease<br>3) maybe she went to the doctor to get oral contraceptives<br><br>Maybe this will help you forget about her faster.<br><br>Maybe some girls just need some space (hence the break up) but want to stay in touch... maybe patch back later.<br><br>Maybe if you'd been there when she sms-ed or called, she wouldn't have needed the other guy.</div>
