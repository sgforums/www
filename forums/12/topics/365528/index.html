              <p>1) Since you are in poly, group works and projects could not be avoided. Social relationship and networking are VERY important. You need assistance from one another, no matter how smart and capable you are (this applies in working life too). Hence building up your social circle is very important. You do not have to please everyone, just make sure you have enough peeps to rely on in times on crisis. Looks like you didn't manage to do so. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="icon_surprised.gif"></p>
              <p>Ever wonder if you had appeared snobbish or arrogant in front of them? <br>Are you naturally a straight-forward person that speaks without thinking? <br>Are you the initiative type? <br><br>Because people won't hate you for nothing. There must be something. Some reasons.<br>Did they actually tell you that they hate you? Or is it just in your mind? Cuz they didn't talk to you or something, and that makes you think that they hate you? <br>And how do you spoil their mood, like what did you do? Did they actually make a comment about it?<br><br>How about try approaching them instead (initiate lunch, dinner, etc) and remember to put up a smile?<br></p>
              <p>2) Sure there are.</p>
              <p>Just think of the money you gotta pay for poly courses.</p>
              <p>Are you going to let some random, insignificant people to affect your studies?</p>
              <p>Do you want to repeat your modules? (paying extra $ and time to graduate etc)</p>
              <p>The main problem is due to social relationship, not the course you are taking.</p>
              <p>Just keep in mind that you are there to study. You have interest in your course, you want to do well, graduate, and f.o. You are not there to please people. You can survive being a lone-ranger. (definitely not a healthy thought, but that is if the problem remained unsolved) Even if you switch poly, could you confirm that the same problem won't happen again? Whatsmore, when you switch poly, everything is back to square one. You need to make new friends, adapt to new environment, etc.... Do you really want this?  </p>
              <p>.... Hope this helps.</p>
              <p>Dont worry too much.... Everything will be fine. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>What year are you in now btw? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>I believe TS is a JC student since he mentioned transferring to a poly and not changing to another poly.</p>
              <p>You have to find and understand the cause of people'e  behavior to you. People don't become hostile and ignore a person for no reason so review all your past actions and try to think of what you might have done to make people dislike you. Another alternative is to just openly ask them what they dislike about you. You can never change unless you know what is wrong.</p>
              <p>As mentioned, poly has alot of project and group base work so you really need to be able to make friends and keep friends to make it easier for you to manage all your projects and stuff since poly is not a place where you can finish the entire course on your own without any group work</p>

              <p>Thanks for the suggestions! I am sorry I didn't make it clear that I am in jc.</p>
              <p>Well I did considered the suggestions before,but I guess they have cemented their very first impressions and it seems really hard to change it. Due some circumstances after orientation, I was switched out of my orientation group into my present class. I wasn't able to join one of their cliques. Well I guess it might be due that I constantly give out a negative atmosphere making me unapproachable.</p>
              <p>I think because of the already-cemented first impression, It seems that they would rather ignore me or simply shun me away. I like to make people smile (but I can't make myself) and I like to better their feelings. But sadly, none of the people in my class need this kind of spare tyres.</p>
              <p>I have tried to remedy the situation, even going out to watch a movie with them. But we can't seem to even find a common topic to chat about (except well school).</p>
              <p>Truthfully, I am facing such a situation for my first time and I am not really sure how to deal with it. Well the problem only lies in school thus I was able to find support from my friends outside. But nevertheless, I bet they would find it a chore when I constantly rant about what is happening in school.</p>

              <p>Your 'cemented' impressions might have been a barrier to help you move forward since part of you already 'givenup' on any hope and improvement and now you are already planning to run away by going to poly.</p>
              <p>There should be different cliques in your class, have you tried to mingle with all of them or just 1 or 2 and given up expecting all to the same? 1 Outing is never enough to make people know you well enough to have lots to chat, you should not give up so quickly and give others and yourself more chance to get to know each other and maybe make friends.</p>
