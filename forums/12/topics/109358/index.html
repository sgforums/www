            <div class='col-md body'>And i tod i was the only one feeling this way. My mood jus deteriorate gradually since news abt xmas, new yr celebrations came early this month..<br><br>When everyone is celebrating away in pairs or with frens, it always highlight ur plight if u are alone... makes u  feel like a loser or wonders what's wrong with u??<br>U get constant reminders of how others are partying away... ads in tv, radio, the stupid chirpy DJ asking everyone how their celebrations are going on..<br><br>Anyway, to prevent any depressive moments, i load myself with good food (they always brighten my day  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> ) &amp; lots of appropriate movies, drama (eg. Cast away--- about a guy all ALONE on an island, or comedies).<br><br>i remember reading abt death rates going up during year end festive seasons... 1 cause is all the over partying, alocohol &amp; overeating. The other i think was suicide rate.<br>The other possibe factor is SAD -- seasonal afflicted disorder. Ppl feeling moody as a result of the lack of sunshine (literally &amp; Metaphorically) in the cold, windy season<br></div>
