It may feel weird but trust me, it's worth it.<br><br>2) Why bother to know whey she wants to leave you? The fact is there no matter what the reason is. Put in several scenarios.<br>a) She's got incureable illness and she choose to leave you so that you won't have to face it with her (sorry..not cursing her..just an example). She's bent on leaving you, so even if you got to know the real reason, going against her wish might only make her feel more miserable.<br>b) She's seeing someone else behind your back and it's quite obvious in this case that she chooses him over you. So why bother to find out? Isn't it better to keep things this way than to realised that you've been wearing a green cap for a long while before she finally put a stop to the relationship? Trust me if this is the case, you won't want to know the truth. You'll definitely regret.<br><br>3) What if one day in the future she goes out with another guy? Pal, you probably have met another wonderful woman who is destined to be your one and only beloved wife, will you still care if she goes out with another guy? Even if you haven't found the one yet, still her dating other guys has totally nothing to do with you. Just accept the fact that you aren't the one in her life. Harsh but it's something we have to face unless we are so damn lucky. I'm not even counting my chicks yet.</div>

It is the worst way.<br><br>There will be some girls who will cheat and will lead you along like a little puppy. For these cases, I agree they should be taught a lesson before you dump their sorry asses without looking back.<br><br>But you are quite lucky in this case, at least she tells you the truth directly and she didn't play any games. The timing could be better...thats all.<br><br>So I don't know what reason you can "cook" up in your head to hate her. She is not interested anymore. So just move on and find another.</div>
