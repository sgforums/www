            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Sinicker,<br><br>1. If you next meet her face to face, be cordial but maintain it at arms' length.  If she wants to be friends further with you, let her make the move.<br><br>2. Why insist on pursuing this matter?  Even if you wanna know desperately, she is Not obligated to tell you.  It may Not be what you want to hear, or she may Not be prepared to tell you.  Why don't you give it a few years before you ask her, or obtain closure?  By that time, chances are you would've gotten over it, or couldn't be bothered to know.<br><br>3. She's No longer yours to control.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sinicker:</div><div class="quote_body">i just want to ask...<br><br>1. what should i do if i were to meet her face-to-face? can't i talk to her ever again?<br>2. i still want to know why she left me. how?<br>3. what if one day in the future.. she goes out with another guy.. how..</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Sharked,<br><br>Good for you, you were lucky, &amp; so was your gf, who was able to make you forget your ex &amp; enjoy your time with her.  Sadly, this is more the exception rather than the norm, evidenced by Zeny's case, &amp; a number of very sad souls in AA.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sharked:</div><div class="quote_body">Hmmm..... the gf i went out with for 3.5years, when she asked me to be her bf, i still haven got over my prev ex, i told her tt right from the start and it would not be fair to her to be treated like a replacement, she told me she'll help me forget about that ex and will slowly get me to fall for her instead. Well... she did a good job..... though it didnt last forever, but i had 3.5yrs of gd time<br><br>what i am trying to say is tt.... if she gives you a chance, and u truly loves her, do your best to make her devote onli to you, let her ex be onli part of her memories.<br>Time can do many things, time can heal, time can destroy, time can strengthen a bond between two persons, time can also increase the distance between two.... its just a matter of how you make use of time<br><br>but of cos, being the persimist i am, here's a reminder, just dont be surprise if they get back together again, but if they had already broken up for looong time liao, then it should be no worries</div></blockquote></div>
