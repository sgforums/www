Compelling or trying your best in changing her mind, even though successful, may not be for long term, as her mind will constantly be on the search for excuses to break-up.<br><br>Once a person made their decision and put their thumbs down, it is usually not that easy to change their minds, particularly involving emotional issues which are complex and confused easily.<br><br>All the best!</div>

There are many things that we cannot explain, and many things that we will not know about what happened between you and her.<br><br>Right now the most important thing is to focus on your As first. Remember, just study. Its hard not to think of her, but tell yourself, what's the point? She let you down, so does that mean you are gonna let KZ, the Lancer gang, and especially 'Mum' down?<br><br>It hurts, and it will hurt each and every time, be it the first, second, fifth, 100th. But right now is the most important time. Do not be distracted. Like what Mum would say, focus pple focus! You must focus on your As now. Questions can be asked later. If you want to know the truth, and she does not tell you, it will not change if you ask her now or you ask her after As.<br><br>In a relationship, 90% is you and her, and 10% is abt the circumstances you cant change (Starpuppy, am i quoting you?), precisely because it is the 10% that you cant change, there cant be much you can do about it right now. If you want to chase her back, or etc etc, its after As. Not now. Especially not right now.<br><br>Go for a bus ride, dude.</div>
