              <p>Find friends with common interest. When people are talking during class breaks, just blend into the group and listen. Then maybe you can strike conversation on a familiar tone. Some friends like to collect comics, some like to talk about internet games, some like to talk about transformers. What is your area of interest?</p>
              <p>Be a bit thick skin. If you try talking to 10 people, maybe out of that, 3 or 4 people are open to talk to you. Not everybody is open to talking.</p>

              <p>Get used to it.</p>
              <p>I am not being mean, simply frank. People in my secondary school happen to be the most vile, artificial, conniving bunch I have ever met. It took me the first  2 years to realise 99.99% of people are like that. Believe me, I have seen it for myself.</p>
              <p>I came out trimphant after 4 years of being left out of groups &amp; having only a small pitiful "friends". They were more accurately describes as "people that had common interests in mind". Since 4 of us, including me, had no clique, we form an artificial one to make others believe we were close friends. Rather, it was circumstances that coerced us to become apart of the quartet.</p>
              <p>I scored a wonderful L1R5 of 7 raw score. I was so happy on 9 Jan 2012 when I collected my results. I didn't cry as I felt that it was only fair as I had busted my chops in 2011 on all subjects. I immediately exited my school in style (in my dad's car) and don't intend to go there ever again.</p>
              <p>Just keep your eyes on the prize till the end of the 4 years: Your O level results.</p>
              <p>Dont feel sad, you aren't alone in this cold world.</p>

              <p>Cold the world may be. But it is up to you to view the world and see it in positive light. One has to always be optimistic. MacGregor theory X and Y, looks at the view at both sides of the coin. You can view a person as lazy or is it that the person lacks motivation?</p>
              <p>Not everybody is artificial. Perhaps one can reach out to somebody. Remember the world is what we make it to be. If we think it is cold, it is cold. If we see it as a challenge to take up opportuntiies - then it is a world of opportunities.</p>

              <p>Experience...</p>
              <p>Secondary school is very much depends on what type of crowd is there and if you are suitable with that crowd...</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, my first sec 1 to sec 3 is very lonely coz all the malays are mats and minahs wannabes and all the chinese are Ah beng and Ah Lian wanabes.</p>
              <p>I spend most of my time in school library where I met with my 2 closest friends till this day. The only 2 other malays in the school who are interested in Mangas, Animes, gaming and tech. And also have a decent score that we can have L1R5 of 16.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here's my advice... Eventhough your classmates mostly not interested in you is because you are not very interesting to them. But's that ok... most people your age interest are very artificial and will change over time... What you need do is to focus on yourself and do what is important/interesting to you and your future... Try and learn your interested musical instrument, learn your desired sport, go take up interesting courses like drawing, finance management (if you're interested lol), go volunteer with your local MP, etc</p>
              <p>Do  what you love to do and the right people will follow... </p>
              <p>But you must be at the right place to do it. I unfortunately do what I love in a classroom full of mats making fun of the only malay in class who is interested in J-pop back then... I should have joined a volunteer group to extend my social group back then.... You join more things, meet more people, higher chance of finding the right friends.... As Eric Cartman once said, To find the right friend, you have to sift through a lot of dicks...</p>
              <p>Your school is not the world... there is a bigger world out there... If you realize this now, you confirm will be a step forward compared to your classmates...</p>

              <p>When growing up, I also 'dun have alot
                                      friends to talk to'. But now in my 40s, I turned out quite alright, more or less.</p>
              <p>In JC, on the 1st day, I spoke to those sitting around me...which school they're from and what subjects they are taking up. The one on my left was unfriendly. The one on my right was friendly. So as we left the classroom, I continued talking to the one who sat on my right. As we reached the canteen, I said 'lets order drinks'. Till today we still good friends.</p>

              <p>And in studying, you dun feel lonely, because you are alway busy with it, to find the answer, the truth, the meaning, the knowledge needed, and more importantly, the constant asking of teacher and mates about these question, that definition, why like this, how come like that, how to prove it....asking question is the best way to learn and get less lonely.</p>

              You would think that my grades were good all along.
              I'll have you know that for the last 4 years from 2008 to 2011, I never had an A1 in my grades in school, not even once. My grades were always in the Bs at best. I think I had only a few A2s in my 4 year hellish journey.
              It was a sad time and never in my wildest dreams did I think I would do as well.
              I did everything within my power to ensure I did well. Everything. It was sad and painful.
              I think I deserve some kind of award for my hard work and tolerance.
              All I got was the Good Progress Award of $200.

                              <p>Cold the world may be. But it is up to you to view the world and
              see it in positive light. One has to always be optimistic.
              MacGregor theory X and Y, looks at the view at both sides of the
              coin. You can view a person as lazy or is it that the person lacks
              motivation?</p>
              <p>Not everybody is artificial. Perhaps one can reach out to
              somebody. Remember the world is what we make it to be. If we think
              it is cold, it is cold. If we see it as a challenge to take up
              opportuntiies - then it is a world of opportunities.</p>

              You can try to look on the positive side of issues, but sometimes you have to be realistic and speak the facts alone. 
              Why deceive yourself? It doesn't help you solve anything at all.
              As I knew that I was in such a lousy position in school, it motivated me to take out the big guns and ensure my success at the end of my 4 year stint.
              Not everyone is artificial but are you really that free to spot this kind of good people? Honestly? I don't think so. Good people are few and far between. Everyone only cares about themselves. Noble people like Mother Theresa rarely come every generation.
              I don't think you have much of an argument against this open fact.
