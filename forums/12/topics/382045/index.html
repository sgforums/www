              <p>hi , i need some help cuz my relationship with a classmate juz fell into the pits.i knew her since sec 1 and i got to admit that i was'nt that into her at that point of time. But after the march holidays , my teacher changed our sitting arrangement and i've been sitting with her ever since . shes a really great girl . shes also the first and only girl who bought me presents when its my birthday besides my mum. she was lky my best friend then . when ever theres projects , she would offer me a place in her group cuz everybody got into their groups and its either i solo or join them. Shes really awesome and i regretted not appreciating her earlier on. Its was during the sec 2 june holidays that i began to think of her everyday, infact i miss her a whole lot . however when i got back to school , my teacher changed the sitting arrangement into rows of three. A ''friend'' of mine is now sitting beside her.At first it was nothing , in fact i enjoyed his company . but soon things turned out for the worse. At first the girl started talking to my friend a hell lot . then she tend to ignore me . i was fine with that. Then when it was her birthday , the friend of mine actually asked '' HEY ANNA HOW YOU WANT TO SPEND YOUR BIRTHDAY?'' she actually replied that she wanted to go to the movies and asked him along. yea i was pissed and sad at the same time. i went to the toilet and tried to control myself . it was one of the worst day of my entire life . and after the exams , my stupid asshole teacher changed the sits again . and im still sitting beside her . Shes a totally changed person . every time i ask her something the answer would either be i duno or she juz gives me a blank look . when ever theres free time , i can find her at the back of the class talking to the ''friend'' of mine and having fun =.=. the Sat 3 weeks ago , i was on carpark duty cuz its the school open house . and to my horror,when one of the buses that are leaving for the location of the cip pass by the school gate , i saw her and my ''friend'' sitting together laughing and teasing each other. i was utterly devastated and immediately asked my platoon mate to take over my position.</p>
              <p>whats worse, shes in the same class as me next year and i duno how to face her. someone pls help me so that i can get out of this predicament and get over her before the classouting which is coming very soon...</p>

              <p><br>What do you hope to achieve together in your relationship with your female friend?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IF you like her, make sure you do everything within your power to MAKE HER LIKE YOU first before you blur blur go and confess to her when the doors to her heart are still closed to you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Talk more to her, a smile can do wonders to help relieve the tension and remove the awkwardness between both of you and can also become the invisible bridge needed for this potential friendship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>DO NOT IRRITATE HER no matter how tempted you may be, unless she's comfortable and relaxed with you, you are more likely to irritate her for real if you tried to attract her attention by doing so.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Join her in the canteen if she's alone, buy her a drink if she doesn't have one. Share your eraser with her and halve it if you need to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Care for her like your good friend and close cousins and siblings, but minus the physical contacts. Do not take her NO as a form of rejection because it may be necessary and needed to reject your lame requests and suggestions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do not take everything seriously, and do not be overly zealous about her. It's better for you to be the cool guy and give her room to think about you instead of trying to squeeze yourself into her mind forcefully.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good Luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Hi Crappylogy,</p>
              <p>I hope you will not mind me saying this - You cannot force others to change, but you can change your own self. You cannot force her to be girl whom you previously know, but you can learn how to move on.</p>
              <p>It is evident that you have strong feelings for her, thus you are upset that she is close to another guy, and no longer close to you.  </p>
              <p>Please do pardon me for saying so, it is not a good time for you to start a relationship right now. It will not be easy for you to get over her, especially when you will be seeing her everyday, but you should try to focus more on your studies instead.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>It takes time to learn about love. It is thru pain and suffering then you will learn  to treasure what is the true meaning of love.</p>
              <p>You like her that is why you feel the hurt she is with someone else. Either you accept it and move on to another gal or stay and fight.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you chose to stay and fight, learn to know your enemy well, study him.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself why she talks to him?</p>
              <p>Why is she always around him?</p>
              <p>Is he really better than you?</p>
              <p>Are you willingly to change your ways in order to be closer than her?</p>
              <p>Understand yourself. Study your strength and know your weakness. </p>

              <p>hi , i need some help cuz my relationship with a classmate juz
              fell into the pits.i knew her since sec 1 and i got to admit that i
              was'nt that into her at that point of time. But after the march
              holidays , my teacher changed our sitting arrangement and i've been
              sitting with her ever since . shes a really great girl . shes also
              the first and only girl who bought me presents when its my birthday
              besides my mum. she was lky my best friend then . when ever theres
              projects , she would offer me a place in her group cuz everybody
              got into their groups and its either i solo or join them. Shes
              really awesome and i regretted not appreciating her earlier on. Its
              was during the sec 2 june holidays that i began to think of her
              everyday, infact i miss her a whole lot . however when i got back
              to school , my teacher changed the sitting arrangement into rows of
              three. A ''friend'' of mine is now sitting beside her.At first it
              was nothing , in fact i enjoyed his company . but soon things
              turned out for the worse. At first the girl started talking to my
              friend a hell lot . then she tend to ignore me . i was fine with
              that. Then when it was her birthday , the friend of mine actually
              asked '' HEY ANNA HOW YOU WANT TO SPEND YOUR BIRTHDAY?'' she
              actually replied that she wanted to go to the movies and asked him
              along. yea i was pissed and sad at the same time. i went to the
              toilet and tried to control myself . it was one of the worst day of
              my entire life . and after the exams , my stupid asshole teacher
              changed the sits again . and im still sitting beside her . Shes a
              totally changed person . every time i ask her something the answer
              would either be i duno or she juz gives me a blank look . when ever
              theres free time , <strong><em><span style="color: #ff00ff;">i can find her at the back of the class talking
              to the ''friend'' of mine and having fun =.=</span></em></strong>. the Sat 3 weeks ago ,
              i was on carpark duty cuz its the school open house . and to my
              horror,when one of the buses that are leaving for the location of
              the cip pass by the school gate , i saw her and my ''friend''
              sitting together laughing and teasing each other. i was utterly
              devastated and immediately asked my platoon mate to take over my
              position.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong><em>whats worse, shes in the same class as me next year and i duno
              how to face her.</em></strong></span> someone pls help me so that i can get out of this
              predicament and get over her before the classouting which is coming

              <p>this brings to mind a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhYL0qUyjHM">song</a> by donny osmond. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>dear crappology, she was really sweet on you with the birthday gift. why be this miserable guy who never makes her laugh? if you really like her, the least you can do is get her a christmas present, tell her she's wonderful and make her laugh.</p>
              <p>why pull a long face and sulk in the toilet when the other guy makes you jealous?</p>
              <p>be chirpy, ask her out to the movies and go have mac donalds together. if she rejects you, well, at least you tried, right?</p>
