Its like i feel some ppl deliberately kept quiet in my presence.<br><br>Today example:<br>I bump into 2 of my classmates (gals) in canteen today. Usually i jus eat alone, but since they saw me, i didnt wan to appear anti-social &amp; sat with them .<br>So after sitting down, we all 3 were quiet..After a while, the 2gals started chatting with each other... <span style="color: blue;">BUt no one spoke a word to me </span><br>At the back of mind, i kept thinking.. If it was anyone other than me sitting there, they wld surely strike a conversation  (out of courtesy at least)<br><br>It happens a lot of other times too. PPl jus keep quiet in my presence. Sometimes i tried to initate a small talk, but it will died down soon..<br><br>Anyway i am quite PISSED nw. I adopted this "Zipp my mouth" policy... if the other party is goin to keep quiet, i will jus zip my mouth entirely.</div></blockquote>Maybe you have a 'I am pissed look'? People are not comfortable talking to people who looks aggressive.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>You know, its kind of normal. Some people have nothing to say all the time. But er, generally I donÂ’t think its good. So, like what they sayÂ… practice!<br><br>I used to clamp up whenever someone calls me on the phone, especially a girl, cause of a bad exp with an ex (have you ever tried calling someone for 15 minutes, and there are 10 minutes of silence at least?). But eventually, after a few years, I got my confidence back and starting calling people again.<br><br>But sometimes if youÂ’re really tired, or the mood is just wrong for words, (Beautiful sunset, complete comfortable silence), then its alright if you donÂ’t say anything.<br><br>But remember not to overdo it and start talking non-stop whenever you see someone <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U should have taken the initiative to start a conversation cos they may be shy- talk abt recent events or S'pore Idols/ TCS shows.<br>Don't worry, the girls won't bite!<br>Just treat them like one of the guys.<br>Once u clam up, people will say u are anti-social.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>try ASKING QUESTIONS... it may not be personal, at least not for a start.<br><br>show some concern... e.g. How's your day? How was class/work?<br><br>ASK OPEN QUESTIONS... general and objective enough for person to start talking.<br><br>if person clams up or give you monosyllabic answers, try to ask CLOSED QUESTIONS. eg.<br><br>Did you go the concert last night? Were you late for class this morning?<br><br>next step - you share your opinions, or experience.<br><br>example - yeah, last year when i was taking that class, that guy was tough on us too (share opinion). we had lotsa homework (share experience). sorry he gave you a bad grade (show sympathy).<br><br>few rules to remember... 1) dont get too personal and ask about people family history. 2) share your opinions, not force it down people's throats. 3) be yourself but do it bit by bit.... better be safe than sorry. not many people can accept you at one go.<br><br>see, not so difficult right? good luck !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey... why did you sit with them and expect them to inititate conversation?<br><br>did you intrude... example, if you went to sit with them, did you say "can i sit here?" sometimes girls have things that they want to talk among themselves your presence make it awkward. it doesnt mean they dont welcome you; its just that they have something that others should not know... WERE YOU CONSIDERATE TO START WITH?<br><br>you can also inititate converstation, no need to wait. try these..<br><br>1. do you know a good sushi place? i am thinking of going there for dinner...<br><br>2. did you gals catch the move "whatever"? i heard its really scary...<br><br>3. how is your assignment/exam preparation coming along?<br><br>4. did you catch singapore idol last night? i like.....<br><br>5. what are you planning to do during the holidays?<br><br>communication is a skill. you need to practise and learn as you go along. dont be afraid to make mistakes. better now than later in life when you offend your boss or colleagues.<br><br>keep going !<br><br>good luck</div>
