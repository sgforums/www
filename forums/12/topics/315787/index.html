              <p>so here's the story.</p>
              <p>i've been frequenting a certain club for the past 2 months now and without fail, i always see this guy there too. I was really drawn/attracted to him at first sight. he's not THAT handsome nor attractive (according to my friends) but i have no idea why i find him ultra appealing and cute. after 2 weeks, i just cant stop thinking about him. i plucked up some non-existent courage to approach this guy who know him by acquintance only and i found out his name. I searched for him on friendster/facebook and found his msn. but he havent logged into msn yet up till now. i found out that he knows some of my friends but sadly, they're not close to me :( but i managed to dig out some infos about him and he's the kind of guy that i'll like/go crazy over.</p>
              <p>my friends told me im freaky and sound like a stalker :/</p>
              <p>i really like him but it cant be love at first sight as i barely know him personally. but just at the thought of him never fails to light up my day and bring smile to my face :)</p>
              <p>what is wrong with me? can i be in love with someone whom i barely know? plus i didnt talk to him at all yet and alrdy im on cloud 9. should i just talk to him when i see him? im sooo damn scared that he'll think im freaky or a stalker.</p>
              <p>god i sound like a totally lost teen (which im not that young)</p>
              <p>your thoughts and advice is really really appreciated! my friends refuse to hear another word about him :(((</p>

              <p>This type of "love" die out sooner or later .. Sometimes i go club got girls i will remember for a few days.. Their face and so but somehow it will be disappear from my mind..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway for your case .. If u realli do wanna make friends with him.. Give him some eye contact .. If he get the signal he will come over. There's this very funny thinking guys have .. Some guys will think like "wah a girl come over like that .. must hang up and sell" so i guess u dun take the first step bah</p>

              <p>When I went clubbing with my friend last time, my friend met his previous gf there.</p>
              <p>The girl remembered us cos we were regulars at the club then.Sadly, due to character difference, my friend chose to let go of the relationship.</p>

              <p>The next time you see him again, before talkin/approaching him, make some eye contact and smile. Let him know you exist. Then talk to him, like "Hello, i always see you here.. bla bla bla" some normal conversation.</p>
              <p>dont sound/appear to be desperate. you know fishin.... sometimes you pull and also let go.. do this.... dont pull all the way</p>
              <p>im not sure if you have added him on msn.. but i suggest not to add him on everything - msn, friendster at one go because he might be thinkin, "how do you get my msn etc? you went to search for them? wow you are one hardworkin girl"  Although you know his msn/friendster/whatever already, dont let him know that you know a lot bout him. Back to the conversation part, you can ask him (for number) from there. You can say sth like.. "i love to club here too with my buddies, perhaps we could all club together some day...."</p>
              <p>theres nothin wrong with you as this is pretty common.. i get this a lot too but usually i will forget bout the faces maybe because  hangover or somethin then i cant rem already. Very few stay in my head. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>

              <p>so here's the story.</p>
              <p>i've been frequenting a certain club for the past 2 months
              now and without fail, i always see this guy there too. I was really
              drawn/attracted to him at first sight. he's not THAT handsome
              nor attractive (according to my friends) but i have no idea
              why i find him ultra appealing and cute. after 2 weeks, i just cant
              stop thinking about him. i plucked up some non-existent courage to
              approach this guy who know him by acquintance only and i found out
              his name. I searched for him on friendster/facebook and found his
              msn. but he havent logged into msn yet up till now. i found out
              that he knows some of my friends but sadly, they're not close to me
              :( but i managed to dig out some infos about him and he's the kind
              of guy that i'll like/go crazy over.</p>
              <p>my friends told me im freaky and sound like a stalker :/</p>
              <p>i really like him but it cant be love at first sight as i barely
              know him personally. but just at the thought of him never fails to
              light up my day and bring smile to my face :)</p>
              <p>what is wrong with me? can i be in love with someone whom i
              barely know? plus i didnt talk to him at all yet and alrdy im on
              cloud 9. should i just talk to him when i see him? im sooo damn
              scared that he'll think im freaky or a stalker.</p>
              <p>god i sound like a totally lost teen (which im not that
              young)</p>
              <p>your thoughts and advice is really really appreciated! my
              friends refuse to hear another word about him :(((</p>
