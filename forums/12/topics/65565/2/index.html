They get the JOB only when they at least TRY TO....<br><br>Don't post such request on Yahoo groups unless both YOU and your class mates' relationship is ACTIVE online... ASK them IN PERSON... From my own experience, it's always good to START seeking your 'group' or potential project mates EARLY... Or at least should SOURCE for the POTENTIAL candidate whom you can get along with and have things to contribute to the team...

Your main objective there is to study. It'll be nice if you can get along with them, but sometimes you'll just happens to be in a situation where you barely fit in... If you can and is willing to change your style a little to blend in, do that... If not just do your stuffs.... When you start work things might be different...<br><br>I'm not in the situation to comment about your current group of course mates as I don't know a thing about them...
