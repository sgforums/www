            <div class='col-md body'>i have this problem in socializing that seems to start from very young.<br>as in bonding with ppl, getting into grps for projects etc.<br>i noticed i seem to prefer joining ppl older than me. like last sem, there are some forward modules students, so they are older than me by a year, but i prefer joining them for lunch during breaks etc, rather than joining ppl of my age.<br><br>anyway this coming sem, they wouldnt be in the same class as me i guess. actually what worries me is that there are would be quite a number of pracs this sem, so i have to find grps to join for the pracs and finding ppl to grp with me is the major prob.<br><br>i dunno why but i cant seem to bond with my class ppl. bond as in, talk to them, being close or friends with them. to the extent of having no probs with seeking grp partners.<br>i have 3 sems left before i grad and it seems i will have to endure this humiliation when i have to go round begging to join ppl for time to come.<br>this prob of bonding with ppl has plagued me for 3 sems already, i feel that it has already caused a disturbance to my studies, in the sense that i always worry abt bonding with them that my grades are sh|t.<br>alot of times i feel that the prob is because i dont like to talk alot. it is only when there is a common topic then i will initiate a conversation or when some starts talking to me then i respond then there will be some chatting etc.<br><br>so i really want to know,is how can i improve on my relations with my class ppl and at least let them feel at ease when i approach them to grp.<br><br>i am not asking them to become best of friends with me in a matter of seconds or something, rather at least, can talk to them or grp with them with ease.<br><br>this has caused me sleepless nights for almost a week. and my term starts jan5. god help me....</div>

You contribute reasons for what's happening through personal deduction and reflection. But generally, its very clouded, because your emotions comes into the picture. (Dread, hate, etc).<br><br>Prefer working with older people? Have it ever occur to your that these people would require the same form of social/interaction skills you would empoly on others as well? (Irregardless of whether same age or not).<br><br>So what's the real problem? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Its within your psyche which contributes to your subconscious hidden behavior that you don't realise.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You feel that the wavelength is different from your classmate as you feel that you don't talk alot and probably different topic as well. In your mind, when it comes to your group of friends, you automatically shut off, which will in the end display, without you realising, body language that signal 'l-am-a-loner.' vibes. Others will catch it subconsciously and will not attempt a good chance to know the real you because their subconscious mind reads the vibes and acknowledge them.<br><br>Then you pick up their body language and feel that they are just merely classmate and nothing else. You futher distance yourself. And the whole damn cycle continues.<br><br>Its not the problem of being on the quiet side - I have friends who are so damn quiet, yet they don't quite experience the same problem as you.<br><br>Advice? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You can wall your mind with this preception and forever be stuck in the cycle. The keyword is 'OPEN MIND.' Recongise and acknowledge that everyone is different, therefore we learn, share and gain from one another.<br><br>In a group when there is a conversation between people. Listen to the speaker. Nod head/show body language that you agree/disagree. (Raise eyebrow, etc). Here's a secret tip - if you can't be a speaker, learn to be a good listener. It really helps alot to blend in whatever place/society you are with. Gradually when people knows that you are a good listener, they will talk to you. Then from there, you return their conversation decently. Of course, you have to show interest in what you say and listen, if not, people wouldn't bother at all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
