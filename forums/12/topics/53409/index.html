            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sorry to hear about your deceased friend. That is part and parcel of life. Take it in your stride.<br><br>Firstly, why are you in a r/s with your current bf? Are you having problems with your current bf that J knows off?<br><br>Secondly, when you mentioned you still think of J, is it really becoz of memory that's why he still lingers around in your thoughts or are you thinking about him, wondering why is he not the one to be holding your hands and standing next to you?<br><br>You mentioned you do not want to msg him to inform him about how you're feeling. Guts feeling tells me you didnt do just that becoz you don't want J to pity you and that you do not want to look fragile to him. (I may be wrong) Search deep within yourself and you'll know exactly why... (bear in mind, you first mentioned you felt you got nothing to tell him thus not msging him, when he probed, you told him you didnt know how to put your words to him. Which is which exactly?)<br><br>hm... much as there're guys out there who are very sacrificial, telling the girls they like that 'I'm happy as long as you're happy'.. deep within lies another meaning and that is 'whr on earth can you find someone, like me, who don't mind someone they like being attached and still wishing to see them being happy?' many times they're just out trying to make you go off-balance, having doubts about your current r/s and make you feel unstable. Becoz offhand you will think, 'what am i going to do to this guy who's so good. maybe my bf is not as good as him...'<br><br>I hope I make sense to you, bcoz to some girls and guys out there, it's always about this thing call 'challenge' and 'thrill'... please cast away all doubts on your r/s if you're indeed having one now.  You shouldn't be swayed  bcoz of what J told you, but on what you believe in.<br><br>Cheerz...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Angel_gerz,<br><br>I think "like" is an understatement. It seems to me more like true love and care because he really wants you to be happy. Actually, in his heart, he is not really that happy without you by his side but because you seem happy to him, he cannot stop that kind of happy feeling from growing in him. Personally, I say that I'm happy that the other person is happy only when I truly love the person. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The pain of being rejected may be hard to bear but at least, you need not lie to yourself. Maybe you should try to let him know your feelings in a subtle way so that you do not get hurt if the answer is negative. It is better to do something now and never regret no matter how painful it is, than not to do that thing you always wanted to do and end up regretting. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>like Yunhaier said. it might just be a platonic frenship. not all guys need to possess the ger. some are just as happy to see their love happy.<br>anyway, most guys would have moved on. dun linger in the past no more.<br>its irrelevant and wont bring u happiness. move on with ur life and cherish ur relationship with ur bf.<br>things wont be normal if u cant be sure what u want. time heals but wont cover over things.<br>letting time pass to get over this matter is just self deceiving.<br>sorry i dun seem able to help u.</div>
