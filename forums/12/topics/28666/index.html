            <div class='col-md body'>u're entitled to go for wat u (think u) want in life at this moment. so simply put, if u wanna be single for watever reason, then be single. break it off, and yes u may hurt someone in the process, but not after putting in alot of thought i hope.<br><br>all the above mentioned that u think will make u happee is achievable while being attached. that's wat i believe.<br><br>as for being the first priority in ur own life, well i guess that's a nice way of saying u wanna be selfish? don't get me wrong, i'm not trying to throw flames here. to be honest everyone has to fight for their own happiness, since no one else will, but there is a certain unique and indescribable satisfaction to make another person the first priority, while that same person makes u theirs.<br><br>and... priorities are akin to "rules". we can't live by rules all the time. a simple example would be a student having exams. the first priority is to study, and if a student hasn't studied hard enuff to be able to pass the exam, is he/she gonna forgo going to sleep, eating, shitting just to pass the exam? i know it's a pretty simplistic example, but i draw similairities between the example and the view of "priorities" as a whole.<br><br>and exactly wat does making YOU the first priority entail anyway? are there "steps" to be taken to make urself the top priority? isn't it a pretty subjective question? and to be honest, isn't that human nature to a certain extent?<br><br>maybe my point is that certain things do not have to be hard and fast. in your case, i dun see a need to choose "myself" over "us"... u could be happier being part of an "us" than by urself, or you could not. but if u are/were happee being part of an "us" then wouldn't that mean u're putting urself first priority since u're making urself happee? it's too vague.... i ask again: how exactly do u go about making urself top priority? and even if u knew the "techniques", how sure are u that they will work?</div>

Actually, i've experienced similar situations before too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>i tink its really selfish to make such decision leaving her with no choice but to accept your decision. Maybe there's a need to balance ur time well bet relationship &amp; frenz...<br>but if u really feel that breaking up is what u tink is best for u, dun drag it too long. If u dun intend for a patch-up after u've enjoyed ur single-hood, make it clear &amp; dun let her wait for u.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

If you are trying to delay the inevitable outcome, might as well, grant him/her happiness to move on?

Everybody has their own circle of friends. I bet your bf/gf also has his/her circle of friends.<br><br>If you find the relationship is suffocating you of your social life, then singlehood is a good option. However, why not try to balance between spending quality time with ur bf/gf as well as sharing some happy moments with your normal friends? I've seen people who can do that, and their companions are understanding enough to let them do so. It may just work out for your case too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
