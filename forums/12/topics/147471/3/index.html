            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sweetevil:</div><div class="quote_body">Is a guy who uses verbal abuse on his gf, worth holding on? Many times, i have been verbally abused whenever we argued with each other even over the slightest things. We quarrel almost anything under the sun and moon. I am sick and tired of the way he treats me when he loses his temper not because its my fault, you know it takes 2 hands to clap, but sometimes he gets really over sensitive and just simply never learned to close one eye on puny matters. He always thinks he is in the right even though he is really in the wrong. I am really sick and tired to have to keep forgiving him and is it true that promises are meant to be broken? Just because I can everytime stomach every mean things he said to me, that he can take it for granted? We've been together for almost 5years and I'm his first girlfriend.<br><br>After the argument, often he would apologized and always giving me 'broken' promises that he will not use vulgarities on me anymore. Time and time again, I would just forgive him since because I still love him. People tend to change over the years, either for the better or for the worse. His attitude changed for the worse, definitely and if you asked me if I am still happy with this relationship, I'll say a Yes and a No. He still does shower me with love and care and i do feel pampered. He often talked to me about our future and what he wants the best for us. He impressed me with his matured and future insights. Now, looking back I am so worried and a little afraid to spend my life with him because I do not want my husband to talk to me that way. It is really hard to change a leopard's spot, right? If he can treat me like this <span style="font-style: italic;">now</span>, what would be the future? His temper and attitude is getting out of hand, but I can say that I am numbed already because I used to cry so much and even resort to using pen knife to inflict the pain on body.. but not anymore now.. coz i know It's not worth it.<br><br>My friends used to tell me he is not good enough for me in terms of looks. But why should I care? I love him for who he is and not what he is. He does has his own good points like always putting himself into other's shoes, sensitive(but too much can really kill me), and he is filial to his parents(family orientated, husband type of material) and etc, which i see most young guys nowadays lack in these qualities. If a guy really loves his gf, he shouldn't even be using vulgarities in the first place right? When my guy friends tell me that I should let go of this relationship and wait for someone better, someone who treasures me more. Because if he treats me this way, that means he is not afraid to lose me right? But on the other hand, he is so protective yet loving, he doesnt likes guys to stare at me. Whenever other guys are looking at me, he will give stare back at them and give the "DONT-FCUKING-STARE-AT-MY-GF" attitude, which can be quite undesirable especially in the public and we will end up quarrelling because of 'they staring at me and because I wear too revealing clothes which I don't think it is all that revealing <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> I will be so embarrased and sad <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> He's serving the nation now and next year would be his last year. My friends told me that if he is still in the army he should even treasure me more? I think any other normal girlfriends will not stand his boyfriend mistreating her right? Moreover, he is doing national service now. I do have guy friends who like me, but I know my limits. He is not romantic i dont mind but I prefer my boyfriend to be romantic. I dont know what I want <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> Perhaps, I should be contented with what I have <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Can you guys tell me what is true love? To me, true love is also about accepting your partner's flaws, but he sees it otherwise. He thinks that if you love him/her, you should try to change yourself for the better. Well, thats true. I did try my best to change for the better. I hate it so much when he keep asking me to change my attitude when we quarrel. I mean who doesnt gets furious and sarcastic with his remarks when one is angry? I admit when i get really angry, I would be really sarcastic but more often that not I will try not to argue with him and stomach his temper towards me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Please give me some advice on what I should do or should not do.

To start things off, I've got to tell you very honestly that I'm one who had used vulgarity on my gf / ex...<br><br>Not often and usually in moments of fit angers.. Most of the time I would just try to divert the words on myself.. On myself, on the other partner.. Either way, I'll agree with you that it might not be very healthy (depending on the habits and mentality of the couple involved..).... Each time I used them on her, I would often be very much troubled.. In the previous relationship which I had used such excessively, it had led to a break up shortly.. Initiated by me...<br><br>Often there're a couple of guys who use 'vulgarities' on their partner...<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">1. Normal acceptance type - It's a common language of communication and very okie between the couple.<br><br>2. Anger - In fits of anger.<br><br>3. Habit - Some people just hang such words around their mouth.<br><br>4. Control &amp; dominance - A sense of superiority over gf. Like what Yun has described.<br><br>5. Abusive and insensitivity - Doesn't care a damn type.</span><br><br>Generally speaking, you're not one who can accept such and view it rather seriously...? And your bf at least has the habit of using these quite commonly... At this point, it could only mean either more to just that and no less...<br><br>To break up because of this? I think it's really your call as different people accept things differently... And how intensely he used his words...<br><br>Alot of what Yun has mentioned meant much sense...<br><br>My guess is he's really the sensitive type... Relatively inexperienced at maintaining a relationship and perhaps even too absorbed at this point to be focusing... There's no saying for sure which direction he should be heading towards in the future to come....<br><br>If you wish to continue in this relationship, there'll have to be alot of change in mindsets to come.... His thoughts are habitally often too self-absorbed... He does 'reflect' but often much later in time when things happens...<br><br>Technically speaking, such a kind of guy should have a hidden abusive trait in him... Not to say that he'll certainly be abusive to his gf or would definitely be an abusive guy... His 'nature' also shows him to be more towards such tendency though that might not really happen until things have broken down between you and him...<br><br>Just like the way I've described my 'vulgarities'...? Sometimes the direct opposite of love is just 'hate'... And in some cases, such 'hate' can be abusive in nature...<br><br>Care to describe more of what ya meant when you said he's getting from bad to worse these years...? Care to share both your star signs?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In short, I'd keep an eye out for better opportunities if I were you.  Without covering any ground that's already been covered in this thread, I'll say this:<br><br>Under any circumstances, a string of broken promises stretching over five years is ridiculous.  If he can't keep a simple promise to refrain from swearing, how can you expect him to commit to weddding vows?<br><br>Also, if he hasn't sorted himself out after all this time, he's either unwilling or unable to treat you right - in either case, the end result's not good for you.<br><br>You've noted that your arguments are about "puny matters" and "everything under the sun and moon".  If that's the case, don't you think you guys have drifted apart?<br><br>As you have yourself noted, the trend's getting worse.  Yunhaier has very aptly identified the issue of power here.  Your boyfriend's raising the stakes, so you're going to have to work out for yourself how much is enough.
