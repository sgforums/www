Anyway, he just called to apologize for the mistakes he had made and talked to me really nicely. I don't know what else to say to him because my feelings are already numbed. Sometimes, I think that I really am too soft hearted. no? I know he still loves me, but why the verbal abuse? Makes me wonder.. because if you really love the girl and afraid to lose her, you will refrain from doing that to hurt her right? Maybe I have not retaliated perhaps thats why he took it for granted time and time again since I always keep forgiving him. Whenever i argued with him on the slightest thing till one point I actually questioned myself if we're still loving. No doubt that we're still going on strong but perhaps its just happens that he's on one of his foul moods and said things without sparing a thought for me.</div>

Recently, he has been training for Army Half Marathon which is coming up in September. He trains and runs everyday and need not go back to camp for the time being. Even If he doesnt gets to book out everyday and only can meet me once a week when he was still a recruit(or whatever you call that), I was more than happy and contented. I can say that I'm pretty understanding, which not many girls with boyfriends in the Army is able to do that.</div>
