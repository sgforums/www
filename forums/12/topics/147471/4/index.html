And for the 1324259385762135th times I am emphasising - without astrological birth chart, it cannot determine anything. So therefore, by Sun Sign, it's may not be accurate, because it isn't meant to be - it serve as a easy (or fun) guide because it easy to obtain the data involved for Sun Sign.<br><br>REAL Astrology doesn't just look at the Sun Sign. Analysizing from birth chart is a more accurate and holistic approach.<br><br>Scorpio's intense characteristic is not because he/she is a Scorpio; rather it is due to its rulership - both Pluto and Mars (8th house as well). Both planets are very active, dynamic and powerful; therefore, it produces alot of strength, especially if the birth chart is well placed.<br><br>To be fair: Scorpio make great friends. So good that you probably knows who to depend on during crisis. An evolved Scorpio is an incredible lover (highly sexual as well). Scorpio is the kind of lover who will go all out to protect their love ones from danger, peril and danger. Scorpio are emotional deep thinkers; somewhat still water runs deep kind of people. What doesn't mention isn't forgotten; it is still heavily considered. Just that they need the retreat and time to analysis the emotions and message involved.<br><br>P.S: Personally, I connect better with Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

(there's probably more, which I cant think of now) Pretty much insulting and hurtful, no? He always tell me to "think before I act". Seems like, people don't practise what they preach? Well I mean, who doesnt say wrong things at the wrong time, right? Nobody is perfect. Somethings I said if he doesnt likes it, he wld be very offended and more often would lead to verbal abuse. But of course, he doesnt do that for no apparent reason. When i mean 'close one eye', as in some times I do something wrong, which is really like no big deal or if I dont think it is wrong but he gets so offended and angry. Simply put it, he just cannot close one eye and cannot take criticisms and offences.</div>

He's defensive to himself and probably to you simply because he sees you as his...<br><br>Whatever mentioned suggest that he has quite an impulsive nature. His verbal abuses could be his nature or consequence of habit cultivated within his NS serving... Either case, it has to stem from his 'impulsive' nature... Too often and repetitive lost of control is simply bad...<br><br>Whatever you've described of him shows that he's incapable of much 'self-control' in this nature of his... Just like a drug-addict who might know drug is bad for him but has no control over his actions... Greatly disadvantageous over time. Simply put...<br><br>If he has other troubles hitting him at the same time; get too used to his action; begin to take you for granted... He MIGHT just become a violent guy? It would very much be dependent on his own self-control (more like self-cultivation - such a nature is most well-restrained when one is more 'refined' in a natural way) and how much control he has over other aspects of his life....<br><br>Destiny probably states.. If he's DOING GOOD, you should be all the way ON TOP with him... While if he's not..? Be caution...?</div>
