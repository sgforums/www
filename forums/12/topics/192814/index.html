            <div class='col-md body'>I too call it generation gap.  But this can be just the pyshical or material things that you are seeing here.  I have siblings who are much younger than I am and we are products of different generation, we dress differently and have different taste in music etc.  But we are able to connect on a certain level.  That to me is good enough.  Friends have laughed at me for not being able to keep up with the latest pop music and all, but I don't really bother as each has their own different preferences and like I said.. most importantly, there isn't any communication breakdown, that's more crucial.</div>

So it results in everyone dressing differently and have different attitudes and are we growing apart? Unfortunely I dun have a answer to that question.
