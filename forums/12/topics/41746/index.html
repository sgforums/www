He was older then her by 3 years, so they did not know each other at first... Walking pass each other, crashing into the same guy in the bus a few several times... She did not notice him, and he did not notice her...<br>But At that year, things started to change, and led to a story, which none will forget...<br><br>At that year, online chatting has just been introduced, and it was hot among students, and especially teenagers. He was curious about what online chatting was all about, so he connected the MIRC, and went to his school's IRC channel. He met her...<br><br>He went into the channel.. looking through all the nicks, he saw a nick " ReMeMbeR"... he find it special, so he clicked on the nick, and he and she started chatting for the first time...<br><br>Days passed, they met in school too... She was really pretty, and he was really cute looking... When he saw her, he would smile and walk pass quickly... She too... she only gave a smile everytime she see him... They have never talked much face to face... But when both of them where online, chatting, they would have loads and loads to talk about... Soon... both of them fell in love... He was the first person that she loved, and she was the first person that he loved.. But they never did tell each other about their feelings towards each other... Then... she changed school, and moved house... They lost contact...<br><br>Years passed, He could still remember her... They have been seperated for about 6 years, and both of them had already reached working stage... He became a fasion designer, she became a fasion designer too, though they were in the same line, Fate was never onto them, he never saw her and she never did see him at all...<br><br>Until that day, He was to represent his company to sign a contract with the other suporting company. He met her... He saw her...  Memories came back... Everything.. the times they had.. the Path that they had once taken... all flashed and re-capped in his mind... He and she had a long talk.. they begin to contact each other by exchanging phone numbers....<br><br>One day, He login into his MSN messenger.... and someone had added him.. the nick was "ReMeMber"... He knew it was her.. they started chatting, soon, he told her that he like her before, and still do...  there was no reply for a moment.. then, the girl replied that she was felt the same at first too.. she like liked him alot alot.. but thinking that he didn't like her, she did not dare to express her feelings...<br><br>She apologized, a regretful sorry, and told him,  she had already gotten married a year ago and is living well with her husband and baby boy... She told him to forget about her, then she quited... And never came online... They lost contact forever...   He was sad...  dissapointed, and  full of regrets..Should he have told her that he liked her, today, they might still be togther.... regrets... regrets...<br><br>In order to remember the Love that they once shared, and in order to remember her.. He contacted MSN and paid an amount of money, to personalise, and reserve the nick "<span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Remember</strong></span>" just for her...Only she can use the nick "<span style="color: indigo;"><strong>Remember</strong></span>"  and he did this all...  Just, to remember the girl, tht he had always loved.. but were never bound to be together......<br><br><img src="http://www.send4fun.com/multiheart.gif"></div>
