Is that the kind of security you want? To "follow" a guy who is still clueless as to what he wants in life and where to go in direction?</span><br><br>Unless your BF knows where he is headed in a few years time (like night studies while working, then apply for better job, etc, etc), I think your parents may be right in this case.

He will probably be more mature only after his NS... You both obviously have different needs at this point in your lives. You are already looking towards the future and wanting to plan for it whereas he is not quite a man yet.<br><br>6 years is a long time and sometimes we romanticize the relationship too much. If there is sex in the relationship, then the girl usually tries to get a more firm commitment from the guy, especially if he's the first time.<br><br>Maybe it's time for you to take a step back and evaluate your relationship with him. The person you fell in love with 6 years ago may not be the same person he is now. Physical relationships aside, if you truly find many positive qualities about him that you admire and the feeling is mutual, then give the guy a few more years to grow up and mature. Enjoy your youth and relationship in the meantime and put plans for the future aside for now. You will argue less and perhaps preserve the relationship till it is time to discuss the future...<br><br>Then he will also be more mature and ready to deal with meeting your parents.</div>
