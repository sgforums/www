So what if you both cannot get married, why the guy must remain bachelor? No link. Come on... deep in her heart, she still longs for someone there to love, be it whether she is married or not - layman term calls it a spare tyre.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You don't call this love - selfishness has blinded her. Think about it, even if the guy get married, what CAN she POSSIBLY gonna do? Nothing ya? But she could say one thing - you broke her promise and make you hell of a gulity. Then it become emotional blackmail. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Be rational and wise to such attempt, because if you can't see the sign, that's where you gonna learn your cosmic lesson.<br><br></div>

Think thru' what you want in the relationship with her, and what she is asking for in the relationship with you.<br><br>Is she providing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span> (not all) of what you want in the relationship? Are you providing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">most</span> of what she wants in a relationship?<br><br>Think thru' why you started out on this relationship. Be generous in your compliments. At the same time, tell her <span style="text-decoration: underline;">gently</span> your fears and worries in the relationship (eg. financial instability). Perhaps it'd help.</div>
