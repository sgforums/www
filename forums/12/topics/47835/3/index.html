It is a fact that why virgin gf/bf or wife/hubby is idealistic is because people are having premarital-sex without considering the consequences. One must think this way: does pre-marital sex have any benefits?Cant think of any. In contrast, I can think of many disastrous consequences of pre-marital sex. think abt it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To a certain extend, yes I agree that one should keep themselves for the person who truly love you and for someone who truly deserve it. Let's say you're in the r/s and you believe he/she is TRULY the one and fully convinced that you'll walk down the aisle together, will he/she be considered the one who TRULY deserves you at that point? How do you gauge if he/she is truly the one? Based on what criteria?<br><br>Can I also say that much as there are some girls with high sex drive, many times it's the guys who initiated/convinced the girls to give themselves to them there and then?<br><br>No one can detect if a guy is a virgin or not, but sorry that's not the case for a girl. If a girl gives herself to the guy she loved most there and then, can you say she's stupid that she failed to see what lies ahead of her, probably all those sweet nothings said to her are lies and empty promises. But then again is she at fault for giving herself to someone she truly loved then? NO! Because if you're the guy, you definately won't feel she's stupid nor feel she's at fault.<br><br>All the -ve comments are given because of the fact that most of you have not been in this similar position. Guys, put urself in the position of the girl and you'll understand why certain things are done. Yes, some girls are addicted to sex, that's where to term 'loose' comes in. Think of those who're not loose and lost themselves to the guys because maybe they're 'stupid' if you wanna put it that way. But ultimately one learns from their mistakes and all they asked for is a chance to redeem themselves and make up for all that is done. Some people learn things the hard way, well the impt thing here is whether he/she deserves the second chance.<br><br>It's not that girls do not have respect for themselves and lack of morality and responsibility. Can we say that guys who deflowered the girls and leave them for another are also at fault? It takes 2 to clap probably. So just before your personal opinions come into place, think of how your views and suggestions may affect another one.<br><br>People with a past will hope that they be accepted for what they are. No one is born perfect, why seek perfection from imperfection? Rather than doing that, why not cherish what you have? It's all in the mind.<br></div>

All i get is negative responses from pple in this forum.. giving me names looking down on me.. my plight is almost similar to cliff jus that i got to know abt my girlfriends chaste status a couple of months after we got together.. it is really difficult to get on and over with it.. after i posted the thread i've decided to give it another shot to get on with life.. but deep inside it is really very toturing...we had a talk and all i get is apologies and promises..i tried to hang on to our relationship and until a few days back i really cannot take the mental torment and i blasted everything back at my girlfriend..<br>to put it in a easier scope for pple who don know wat it feels like:<br>if your girlfriend cheated on you when u are together its easier to handle bcos u can jus let go of this kind of girl... but for our kind of situation you get the cheated feeling but u cant bear to let go...  bcos love is still around.. (at least this is how im feeling)<br><br>our current relationship status:<br>we are of marry-able age.. parents of both sides are contented with their future in-laws.. we are into marrying plans a years down the road<br>..i've decided to give a last try to salvage our relationship.. in another 5 hrs time she will be coming over and we will be talkin things out.. i myself is very much into this relationship.. in my eyes she is a beautiful girl  with a big warm heart..however when i get to know abt her past it jus takes out 60% of respect from her.. to think that she lost her chaste in hr JC years.. JC a place where pple get an advanced level of education and have a more profound vision of life and yet it happened there and then.. her reason..:" im jus not thinking at that point of time..i tried to resist him (her ex-bf) many times back but at that point of time when it happened i really wasnt thinking.. im sorry.. i really loved him then... "<br>like that how? when i hear of this everytime.. one side of me is telling me that she is also very pitiful and deserves to be forgiven the otherside of me is telling me she totally have no dignity and respect for herself... aiyah.. dun wanna sae so much ready heart aching ready cannot finish typing..<br>GOD BLESS u guys out there..</div></blockquote>I think I told you before and will say it again: its your mental prison. Betray you during the relationship is better than she losing her virginity before you, before marriage and you said that love is around and makes it difficult? I think its utterly wrong.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If love was measured by levels, you are definitely a few level lower than true love (if true love was marked as the highest level).<br><br>The issue here isn't about love by itself - <strong>its about accepting people's past. </strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Can't accept people's past - you can't move on - relationship stagnant and dies off eventually. Basically, its your cosmic lesson you have to go through this lifetime; this scenario was thrown to you because you will probably learn alot of things from it. The bottomline remains: will you survive the lesson? Probably not. It will be back or lots of regrets - trust me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote><strong>...'JC a place where pple get an advanced level of education and have a more profound vision of life and yet it happened there and then.'</strong></blockquote><strong>Welcome to the real world. </strong>Your preception of this is utterly wrong: I seen alots of cases and witness it myself.
