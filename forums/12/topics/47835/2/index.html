            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by userid:</div><div class="quote_body">i have a tale to share here..abt a boy and a girl...<br>let me name the boy cliff and the ger linda...<br><br>some time ago..cliff met linda at an online chat group outing...they have not known each other before...although cliff had chatted with linda previously over the net and have gotten to know about each other pretty well. linda was a shy ger...she was quiet but pleasant over dinner and left a good impression on cliff. after the 1st group outing...during that time...linda was unhappy because she was facing some problems...thus cliff decided to ask her out for a day to let her take her mind off her problems....it lasted a day and the two had a great time... and apparently sparks flew between them because after tat date linda began acting strangely....cliff noticed this...and he wondered why at first....but slowly..it dawned on him tat linda might have taken a liking to him.. he wasnt sure though...after much contemplation he decided to ask her about it....being an honest ger with a straightforward personality, linda admitted that she had indeed started to like cliff...but thought tat was probably just an infatuation tat will die off after sometime...cliff acknowledged this...and told linda that he was also attracted to her though he wasnt really sure of his feelings..he let her know abt this uncertainty as well... this conversation set the foundation of a very transparent friendship between the two...from then on..they were very honest with each other about their feelings etc there was no hiding between the both of them... the two of them decided to meet up after the conversation to sort things out... during the meet up, however, things didnt go smoothly.... cliff felt the pressure to reciprocate her feelings because he knew of them...and in the end he decided perhaps he didn't really like linda after all... and as he was always honest with her..he told linda he wasnt sure....and told her tat if she did want to have a final answer..that she would have to assume he didnt like her at all... having said this...cliff felt a huge sense of relief...though he did know tat linda was disappointed...well..both of them thought tat was ok since they had only gone out together a couple of times..<br><br>after tat episode...the two of them developed a stronger frendship as they 2 of them cliqued very well...cliff decided to ask linda out again, he somewat found that he had begun to miss linda in her absence..and looked forward to chatting and meeting her again...perhaps unknown to him... he had begun to develop feelings for this nice girl. the 2 of them spent a day together again... this time.... without the tremendous pressure, cliff realises his true feelings for linda and he was very happy.... cliff told linda of his feelings and the both of them rapidly became intimate friends...both knew of the love between them but decided to give themselves time to get to know each other better... before they knew it...love blossomed and cliff and linda knew they were on the verge of becoming bf-gf...both were happy and contented...<br><br>however, this happy tale took an abrupt turn one day, when the 2 of them approached the issue of sex..cliff was single then...and had been single all his life... he has a firm stance on pre-marital sex (pms) and felt tat he would not engage in it till after marriage... he wanted to save the most intimate part of him for his wife one day...and he felt tat the more he loved a girl...the more he should help her keep her chastity by not making love to her before marriage...so that in the event their relationship didn't work out...she would have no worries nor problems in moving on to her next relationship, in case her next partner might also have a firm stance on pms. this was how cliff saw the issue of pre-marital sex...<br>however, he was devastated when linda admitted to him tat she had slept with her 1st ex once. she explained to him tat it was a mistake..and tat she had learnt her lesson and had not slept with her other bfs...but cliff was shocked, deeply saddened and dumbfounded. he knew linda loved him alot..and thus risked her happiness to tell him the truth...hoping that in doing so...cliff would understand and forgive her... cliff...loving linda alot then... indeed wanted very much to do so...he thought of ways and means to convince himself that it was a mistake of the past..that she did not mean it....tat she was not a loose girl..since she had since learnt from her mistake and had not allowed this to happen ever since... but now the prob is this: cliff while really wanting very much to accept the ger he loves....knew tat he had a problem with getting over this..because he does not know how to handle the problem of recalling this mistake...the vivid scenes playing in his head...of another man having sex with the girl he loves dearly.. and worse..the fact that she had allowed this man to do so... whenever he thinks of this....it fills him with hatred, pain and anguish. cliff is a person who looked for a serious relationship...one which has the potential of marriage years down the road...in this relationship with linda now...he knows this is fillled with uncertainty..because he doesnt know if he will ever get over this problem....he did not want to have it haunt him for the rest of his life. cliff right now..is in a dilemma...accept or not to accept... he had told linda that it was unlikely for him to ever accept her now because of this... and both of these 2 are suffering...they miss each other everyday and the pain is killing them....but both are helpless...they know they will live in regret forever since they felt they were made for each other.<br><br>i hope this story will give young boys and gers out there something to think about.... how a simple thoughtless act of pre-marital sex can ruin the happiness of an otherwise blessed couple. i mean this...cos im the cliff in this story and im still suffering now.</div></blockquote>Why must virginity be important in a relationship?

Especially guys!<br>If Cliff love her, love her for what she is and not torture himself by thinking over and over again that she is not pure anymore.  People do make mistakes.  I think what matters most is that when a couple is together, neither one part should be fooling around with another person.</span></div>

There is no such thing as a 'perfect' gf.<br><br>So this is life... that is presents you with choices in no way can u pick out the most perfect.. the most acceptable option. So, maybe there is this girl who is nice to you, really sweet but not a virgin. And then again, there might be this girl who is a virgin, but real nasty to you. Take your choice.<br><br>While there is no way anyone of us can help you 'erase' that image, it all depends on your mentality. If you feel u cannot let go of that 'disturbing' thought... spend more time being more open minded. By saying that, I dun mean u should go around bedding woman. I am saying that since this girl is so nice to you, honest to you, why blow up this chance just because of her past which is not, technically, a fatal error ?<br><br>Its just so saddening to know that a girl likes you for who u are... yet only to be rejected cos of her honesty. I have yet to hope for a girl to like me for who I am. And I'm still searching.<br><br>Guess some guys have all the luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it all depends on how much they value themselves. as i said b4, i feel its more worth to save myself for someone who will always be there for me, who will accept me for who i am, rather than go and do it with the so called people i love. i mean. love is not just a feeling, feelings change, so wat happens if u slept with the person u so called love then later broke up? its like giving part of your heart away, then if u sleep with every bf u hv, so how much of your heart is really left when u finally meet the one who will always be the man of your life, the one worthy of your whole self. how much of u is left by then? love is a commitment. not a feeling.</div>
