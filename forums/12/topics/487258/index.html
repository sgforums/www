              <p>I recently broke up with my ex. Here's the story.</p>
              <p>He's serving NS now and i left him not because of NS. For the duration that we've been together, i try my best to make time for him during the weekends by clearing and rushing all my schoolwork on weekdays so that i can spend my weekends with him. I always spend 1-2 hrs travelling to his house every weekend because we live very very far from each other. He never fetches me from the bus stop or the mrt and on one occasion, i got lost on the way. He got really angry that i got lost and scolded me for not being able to navigate properly. </p>
              <p>I understand that army guys are normally really tired and stuff so i don't expect him to travel to my house or send me home. And i also understand that he's really busy during the weekdays so i don't expect him to text me or call me much. So i do try to initiate conversations occasionally like asking how he is and stuff although he never asks about how i am doing or what i'm busy with. </p>
              <p>Every time we quarrel, he never fails to bring up things like "maybe you should go find your perfect guy somewhere else" or "i just want an ideal girlfriend", things that suggest that we should part ways.</p>
              <p>Recently we got into a huge argument over something minor that was my fault, and he said truckloads of hurtful stuff to me. Things like "i don't give a fuck if you are hungry, that's your problem. The thing is, I'm hungry". And when i try to apologise for my actions that i sincerely felt was wrong, he pushed me away, swore at me and said something like "don't touch me, i don't give a single fuck about your sorry". And when i asked why he wasn't appreciative of the time i sacrificed for him, he said "All you do is take taxi over to my house" and when i clarified the fact that i am a student and i don't earn to be able to pay for taxi fare to and from his house, he said "i don't give a fuck. That's your problem. I didn't say you couldn't take taxi." And after that he went on to say how ever since i came into his life, i spent my weekends with him and so he doesn't have time to go out with his friends, go to bars and how i don't like it when he goes to club. Thing is, throughout the time we spent together he never brought up these issues. It just seems like he said all this out of anger. And all this happened after he told me to leave his house at around 8pm when it was already dark. He just said "Just leave, i don't want to see you again" and even went on to ask me if he needed me to open the door for him. I believe he treats his parents, loved ones and ex-girlfriend like this too because his parents don't really like talking to him.</p>
              <p>Thing is, i did love him. I loved him alot. I tried to understand that he's tired, stressed, angry. And i used to complain that he didn't text me enough, didn't give me enough attention but i stopped because i knew i was being unreasonable. I stopped demanding for so much attention. Maybe i didn't know how to express it properly but i did love him. I would always look forward to Fridays because i'd get to see him and hug him after a whole week of not talking and communicating much. That whole incident tore me apart, being told by someone you love so much to leave and they didn't want to see you again. I just don't know how to fight back or stand up for myself anymore. </p>
              <p>He did apologise after that and told me that he would never tell me to leave or say such things again. He told me he still loved me and that he still cares. To be fair, he does bring me out for dinners, meals and pays for alot of the stuff. </p>
              <p>I thought about this for the entire night and decided that it was time to leave this toxic relationship. I cut off all contact with him and just left. Right now, i am trying to stay positive so that i can start the healing process. Its difficult because i am constantly replaying all the hurtful things he said to me in my head and i'm constantly beaten down. I feel bad about myself and i feel that i'm not worth anything. Also, i keep getting the urge to contact him and return to the vicious cycle again. (I haven't so far)</p>
              <p>My question is, what could i have done better? Is he the problem or am I the problem? Conflicts are bound to arise because we are two different people. People quarrel to fix problems, come to a compromise or understand the reason for the other party's actions, not to blame each other for their differences. What could i have done better to get my point across without sounding like i'm blaming the other party? Can i blame him entirely for treating his loved ones like this or does he have some other deep seated issues that he didn't tell me? Is he just stressed from NS and taking it out on me? Is there any way i can help him even though we have broken up? </p>
              <p>I am not the best girlfriend, but i want to be a better girlfriend in my next relationship. Thanks for reading guys :)</p>

              <p>Yes. You have.</p>
              <p>I was in a similar situation as you once, and it felt like I was doing everything I could just to keep the relationship afloat. But sometimes it just isn't enough, and that's when you have to let go - which you did, so well done you!</p>
              <p>I came to the conclusion that maybe I shouldn't have been so needy, and given him his own space to do his own things. But then again, why spend my time with someone who isn't as happy to see me as I am to see him?</p>
              <p>It sounds like he's not a very nice person. You're not the problem, so don't feel bad about yourself. Keep your chin up and you'll feel better eventually :)</p>

              <h1>Jolin Tsai - Real Man Lyrics</h1>
              <p>I just don't really get it, why would you choose to be lonely<br> You've got everything you want, you just need a boyfriend<br> How long you gonna hold out for, what're you being so picky about<br> <br> Listens more than he talks, won't think I'm slow<br> Knows when I'm down, stays with me in silence<br> Only I'm on his cell wallpaper, lots of sweet little gestures<br> Doesn't have an appetite eating by himself, asks me before he takes out his card<br> Likes my friends, and will love my dog<br> Knows about the environment and loving the earth, protects me like a hero<br> Always openly introduces me, remembers every holiday<br> Eats apples with me when I'm losing weight, buys lipstick for me<br> <br> *I don't wanna boyfriend<br> I need a real man<br> An honest mouth, a reliable shoulder, gentle eyes<br> I don't wanna boyfriend<br> I need a real man<br> Real man real man real man real man<br> <br> When will he appear? (x4)<br> <br> Knows how to work and play, knows how to be crazy and live life<br> Knows how to cook and play sports, knows how to love and dream<br> Like a boy but also mature, is generous to me but doesn't spend on himself<br> Teaches me video game tricks, does everything with me<br> <br> (repeat)<br> <br> (Rap)<br> I be your real man<br> Will he appear? (x4)<br> I understand a little now, how to get rid of your loneliness<br> What you talked about for 2 or 3 minutes, I'm willing to take 2 or 3 years to do<br> Since you've been holding out for so long, do you wanna wait for me<br> <br> A real man playing cool, acting gentle, he can bear any burden on his shoulders<br> My lips just move slightly and he knows what I'm thinking<br> Just show me one real man<br> A man of ten talents, real man<br> <br> repeat * (x2)</p>

                  very very far from each other. He never fetches me from the bus
                  stop or the mrt and on one occasion, i got lost on the way. He got
                  really angry that i got lost and scolded me for not being able to
                  navigate properly. </p>
              <p>I understand that army guys are normally really tired and stuff
                  so i don't expect him to travel to my house or send me home. And i
                  also understand that he's really busy during the weekdays so i
                  don't expect him to text me or call me much. So i do try to
                  initiate conversations occasionally like asking how he is and stuff
                  although he never asks about how i am doing or what i'm busy
                  with. </p>
              <p>Every time we quarrel, he never fails to bring up things like
                  "maybe you should go find your perfect guy somewhere else" or "i
                  just want an ideal girlfriend", things that suggest that we should
                  part ways.</p>
              <p>Recently we got into a huge argument over something minor that
                  was my fault, and he said truckloads of hurtful stuff to me. Things
                  like "i don't give a fuck if you are hungry, that's your problem.
                  The thing is, I'm hungry". And when i try to apologise for my
                  actions that i sincerely felt was wrong, he pushed me away, swore
                  at me and said something like "don't touch me, i don't give a
                  single fuck about your sorry". And when i asked why he wasn't
                  appreciative of the time i sacrificed for him, he said "All you do
                  is take taxi over to my house" and when i clarified the fact that i
                  am a student and i don't earn to be able to pay for taxi fare to
                  and from his house, he said "i don't give a fuck. That's your
                  problem. I didn't say you couldn't take taxi." And after that he
                  went on to say how ever since i came into his life, i spent my
                  weekends with him and so he doesn't have time to go out with his
                  friends, go to bars and how i don't like it when he goes to club.
                  Thing is, throughout the time we spent together he never brought up
                  these issues. It just seems like he said all this out of anger. And
                  all this happened after he told me to leave his house at around 8pm
                  when it was already dark. He just said "Just leave, i don't want to
                  see you again" and even went on to ask me if he needed me to open
                  the door for him. I believe he treats his parents, loved ones and
                  ex-girlfriend like this too because his parents don't really like
                  talking to him.</p>
              <p>Thing is, i did love him. I loved him alot. I tried to
                  understand that he's tired, stressed, angry. And i used to complain
                  that he didn't text me enough, didn't give me enough attention but
                  i stopped because i knew i was being unreasonable. I stopped
                  demanding for so much attention. Maybe i didn't know how to express
                  it properly but i did love him. I would always look forward to
                  Fridays because i'd get to see him and hug him after a whole week
                  of not talking and communicating much. That whole incident tore me
                  apart, being told by someone you love so much to leave and they
                  didn't want to see you again. I just don't know how to fight back
                  or stand up for myself anymore. </p>
              <p>He did apologise after that and told me that he would never tell
                  me to leave or say such things again. He told me he still loved me
                  and that he still cares. To be fair, he does bring me out for
                  dinners, meals and pays for alot of the stuff. </p>
              <p>I thought about this for the entire night and decided that it
                  was time to leave this toxic relationship. I cut off all contact
                  with him and just left. Right now, i am trying to stay positive so
                  that i can start the healing process. Its difficult because i am
                  constantly replaying all the hurtful things he said to me in my
                  head and i'm constantly beaten down. I feel bad about myself and i
                  feel that i'm not worth anything. Also, i keep getting the urge to
                  contact him and return to the vicious cycle again. (I haven't so
                  far)</p>
              <p>My question is, what could i have done better? Is he the problem
                  or am I the problem? Conflicts are bound to arise because we are
                  two different people. People quarrel to fix problems, come to a
                  compromise or understand the reason for the other party's actions,
                  not to blame each other for their differences. What could i have
                  done better to get my point across without sounding like i'm
                  blaming the other party? Can i blame him entirely for treating his
                  loved ones like this or does he have some other deep seated issues
                  that he didn't tell me? Is he just stressed from NS and taking it
                  out on me? Is there any way i can help him even though we have
                  broken up? </p>
              <p>I am not the best girlfriend, but i want to be a better
                  girlfriend in my next relationship. Thanks for reading guys :)</p>

              <p><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> It can be considered a toxic relationship because when he loses his temper, he lashed it out uncontrollably like a barbed whip. And because you are on the receiving end, I am sure the impact is debilitating. Somehow, he doesn't seem competent in having the ability to manage his feelings reasonably and may have difficulty in dealing with relational-trust-emotional-intimacy issues.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">From your writing, I can tell that you really want to help him. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">However, before you decide to plunge into this love version of messiah complex, be very mindful of the fact that leading a relationship isn't tantamount to doing social work. More often than not, your engagement would naturally involve certain degree of personal cost and sacrifice - which is also ultimately meaningless because you are technically out of the picture already (namely no longer in the relationship with him). </span></p>
              <p>By asking how you could do better is already an indication to me that you will surely become a better girlfriend. The philosophy is not so much about the 'how', but more on the 'why'.</p>
              <p>"Why is being a better girlfriend so important for you?" <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="icon_question.gif"></p>
              <p>My assumption for the above question (on your behalf) is that you probably want a fulfilling relationship that could hopefully last till the end and you want to make sure that the only controllable factor - which is yourself - can be tweak to improve the probability of that happening.</p>
              <p>If I am largely right, then ultimately, self growth with volition will surely lead you to quality and excellence. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> There are some probable directions for you to proceed via self discovery and I will frame it in four questions for you to ponder about (you don't really have to answer me though): </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">i) What attracts you to this guy? (e.g. he is dependable)  </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">ii) How come you are attracted to these qualities/example mentioned? (because I like stability in a man).</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">iii) What are the 'side effect' of being attracted to these sort of qualities/example mentioned? (e.g. he is boring).</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">iv) If what you want is </span><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">a fulfilling relationship, then for the </span><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">qualities/example mentioned above, are these </span><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">qualities/example </span><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">fundamental for you to ensure a fulfilling relationship (in your perspective)?</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">  (e.g. between fun needs and stability, it is fundamentally more important for me to be in a stable relationship). </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
