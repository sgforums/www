He might end up being a regular? Gradually be interested to go outing and stuff?<br><br>P.S: If it is really causing him agony, he must have the will in wanting to improve or change. There's seriously no point in someone telling you their problem only for ranting purpose, but eventually they are more comfortable in retaining status quo and hanging around in familar ground.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</strong></div>
