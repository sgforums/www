Show it to her that you will never be what you were last time anymore. Well.. about methods to do so, i can't help you much. Think about something original though and make sure you stick to being sincere once and for all. Don't repeat past mistakes.</div>

If you are going to persist in such immaturity, this will probably afflict your future relationships until you have the wisdom to evolve yourself.<br><br>Your suffering is very much due to the fact that she is able to get on with life much better without your presence - a self absorbed quality of love. Like a scoring a blatant victory over a screwed relationship; if she has found happiness outside you, perhaps you, being the source of her great misery, might just want to take some time off to introspect and decide how you want to improve your inner qualities.<br><br>If you claim love, but she is very much better off without the framework of this relationship - perhaps, letting go might demonstrate more strength than clinging on.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TS, from ur thread, i can only conclude one thing --- you are too possessive and you are self-centered.<br><br>First, ask yourself these qns<br>1) do you like to be control<br>2) do u like do be flared at by someone u loved<br>3) do u ever want to do something u really enjoy but being constantly discouraged and reprimanded by someone whom u really care<br><br>I think the only resolution now is none other than sending her an sms to apologise about ur past action. Be it she reply a not, at least she knows u repent. Maybe u can try to follow up by asking her whether u and her can be friend again.<br><br>U are the one who caused all this and so dun blamed her for being oblivious to all ur actions. U must learn to give and take... not always u are the one taking everything but given nothing. Love is mutual if she doesn't like u anymore, give her ur blessing --- be a gentleman <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe this break-up is a really good lesson for you. It lets u realise that maybe, u should have kept ur temper in check, rather than flaring up unnecessarily. I guess that's what could have caused the break-up in the first place.<br><br>But like u said, u have changed for the better, than maybe just move on. Continue to be friends with her, and let her see the new u. Let her see how different u are, and maybe that could be the catalyst for u two getting back together again.</div>
