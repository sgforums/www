He knows sch ends at 4.p.m exact, or she can leave at 4 even if haven end, so he times her. If she haven reach home by 4.45, she gets it.<br><br>She cant go out with her friends, girls or guys. There was more then once, she went out with all of us, the boyfriend called her and scolded her till she cry in the public.<br><br>She works part time, and works in a retail fashion stall. There will be days they work late, or do stock takes. If she works late even for 5 mins, she gets it. Once was worst, the boyfriend went down and waited for her, she did not come out of the shopping mall within 10 mins, he went in and fucked the IC up side down.<br><br>Whenever they are together (i mean as in really together physically), the guy is damn fucking sweet bla bla bla, but whenever he is not by her side, he turns into a monster.<br><br>Although my friend loves the boyfriend very very much, she cannott ake it and talked to me about breaking up a few times.<br><br>Look here, the person who suffer when you do all those stuffs, is your gf, not you.<br>Imagine the position you put her in.<br>Imagine the amount of freedom she has to give up coz of u<br>Imagine the enjoyments she have to give up because of u<br>Imagine the friends she lost coz of u<br>The list goes on and on.<br><br>You really better change.</div>

But yeah, whether you can get her back or not, it depends on fate too. Try to be more open, as you most probably have already and tired to hear of 'there are still many girls out there'.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You pretty much know whats wrong with yourself and almost everyone else is telling you the same thing.<br><br>Never let anger get the best of you. And its good to know that you're learning from your mistakes. But this I have to say, even after you've change for the better you have to be prepare that she may or may not take you back. Nothing is certain. Change because you really wants to and not just to get her back.<br><br>Things always happen for a reason, you're learning to control your anger and that is a good thing. It'll help you in your future relationships and who knows ? It might even help you in your career in years to come.<br><br>best of luck !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
