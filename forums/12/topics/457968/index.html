              <p>I have been going out with this girl for 5 months, but we haven't been able to progress our relationship due to religious issues.</p>
              <p>You see, she hates my religion. I don't want to say anything about the religion except to say that it is definitely NOT islam.</p>
              <p>I never ask her to change to my religion but it seems to separate us most of the time. She thinks I am very staunch in my religion because I attend classes, seminars, community work a lot but I am not staunch at all because I am a person with a lot of flaws, I do drink liquor, I do cross the red light, I sometimes accidentaly swear at people. In other words, I am imperfect and i don't go around judging other people.</p>
              <p>Because I always talk religion with my social circles, I sometimes have the habit of accidentaly talking religion to her, and that makes her mad at me. When I accidentaly say it, she will go and boast her religion back at me and give me the quiet treatment.</p>
              <p>I get the feeling that my religion is affecting her and not sure if she likes me enough to continue.</p>
              <p>So what should I do? I had a heart to heart talk to her about religion and she frankly tell me that she thinks my religion is bias and not good. Ouch, but i just don't get it, why she takes offence at it when I never ask her to change to my religion. I was hoping that she allow me to freely practice my religion while she practice hers.</p>
              <p>I really like her a lot.</p>

              <p>She cannot accept you for who you are.  That's the problem with many ppl in relationships, and these ppl think they have the ability and right to change the other person. Everyone is unique.  Ppl of such mentality should just go find a custom made robot and go into a relationship with it. </p>
              <p>Do you want to change for her (in this case, you have to abandon your religion)?  Only you can answer.  But bear in mind, you will not be a happy person if you were to change cuz she wants you to change. </p>
              <p>To change her?  Not a good idea.  If she, one day, decides not to think this way about your religion, good for you.  Your relationship will go stronger.  But this will really be up to her.  You can't change her.  YOu can't convince her.  Only her mind and heart can do the work.</p>

              <p>Some 20 yrs back, I let go a good relationship due to religion too. </p>
              <p>Remember at that time, I went through some difficult issues in life, and she took me to her religious place to seek blessing.  I only know when I reached there, thus I kindly declined her offer. </p>
              <p>Sometime later, I ask her what will our children's religion be, and she replied, half will follow me, half will follow her.  With that, tears flow down my eyes.  After much praying, within weeks, I broke off with her, both of us in tears. </p>
              <p>Looking back, as much as I am sad to let her go, even as friends (we lost contact soon after), but I think I made a right choice.  I am happily married with 2 kids now, and happily worshiping as family, and even praying together during hard time.  If I have chosen her, that will not happen. </p>
              <p>Sometime, you need to look forward, beyond your emotion.  </p>

              <p>To summarise your post. She thinks you are staunch. But you admit you are not because you drink and curse. But you still talk about religion to her because you think she is one of your religious friends who do not know the real you.</p>
              <p>Religious topics are very sensitive because it involves family roots. Religion and Race are always the barrier for relationships.</p>
              <p>If you want this relationship to continue, be yourself and stop acting religious. You are embaressing your religion by not being able to stand up for it. You are also embaressing your whole family.  Reason I say so is because if you are firmly grounded, you will be able to refute all allegations.</p>

              <p><img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Religion is not merely about a faith belief; in fact, it encompass an entire framework of perspective, values, ideals, rules, norms, mores and outlook of life - which includes the way we view love and relationship specifically. For some, it is central to the motivation of their behavior and how they manage their interaction with others. <br><br>Love requires no religions for it is not a living entity, unlike a human being, tormented by the need for 'answers' to justify its very existence. Therefore, the suffering of having any forms of religious conflict stem from the couple and belongs entirely to themselves. <br><br>This is an important understanding because I will not attempt to reply your post from any faith-based perspective, but rather, reflect it as the choice you have made in name of love - since this choice is probably a succulent condition for such conflict to manifest in the future. You might have intense feelings for this girl; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>however, the inability of being able to accept each other in your own respective skin is likely to be the cause of your misery.</strong></span><br><br>It is not about whose religion is more superior, but rather, not being able to gain mutual respect and understanding of each other's values naturally generate great challenges for your relationship. It is also a similar set of problem for other form of value-conflict, in which religious conflict belongs to one type of such dimension (I called them Jupiter affliction). <br><br>Therefore, what is ultimately more important to you? Being able to be a 'good member' of your chosen religion OR the love &amp; belonging need you get from her companionship? Surely, that would give you some concrete insights on how you could proceed with your situation.<br><br>P.S: The point I am driving at is that there is no absolutely way you could continue a relationship like yours without bloodshed IF the both of you are not able to reconcile each other in your natural state. Perhaps deep in your respective subconsciousness, though you might claim there is none, there could be a quiet desire to convert the other, which is actually no difference from a romance-frenzied lover wanting to change her down-to-earth dude to become 'more romantic'. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"><br><br>Cheers</p>

              <p>Never let anyone change your religion because this life is short. How long can we live, the longest is slightly more than a hundred years and how many people can live till a hundred year old? Look beyond this life time. Never let religion gets in the way of your relationship. Relationship and religion should be separated. If the person let religion gets in the way of the relationship meaning that person does not love you enough.</p>

              <p>Sometime later, I ask her what will our children's religion be, and she replied, half will follow me, half will follow her.  With that, tears flow down my eyes.  After much praying, within weeks, I broke off with her, both of us in tears. </p>
              <p>Looking back, as much as I am sad to let her go, even as friends (we lost contact soon after), but I think I made a right choice.  I am happily married with 2 kids now, and happily worshiping as family, and even praying together during hard time.  If I have chosen her, that will not happen. </p>
              <p>Sometime, you need to look forward, beyond your emotion.  </p>
              <p>Take care, </p>
              <p>Boring Old Man.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Religion is not merely about a faith belief; in fact, it encompass an entire framework of perspective, values, ideals, rules, norms, mores and outlook of life - which includes the way we view love and relationship specifically. For some, it is central to the motivation of their behavior and how they manage their interaction with others.<br><br>Love requires no religions for it is not a living entity, unlike a human being, tormented by the need for 'answers' to justify its very existence. Therefore, the suffering of having any forms of religious conflict stem from the couple and belongs entirely to themselves.<br><br>This is an important understanding because I will not attempt to reply your post from any faith-based perspective, but rather, reflect it as the choice you have made in name of love - since this choice is probably a succulent condition for such conflict to manifest in the future. You might have intense feelings for this girl; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>however, the inability of being able to accept each other in your own respective skin is likely to be the cause of your misery.</strong></span><br><br>It is not about whose religion is more superior, but rather, not being able to gain mutual respect and understanding of each other's values naturally generate great challenges for your relationship. It is also a similar set of problem for other form of value-conflict, in which religious conflict belongs to one type of such dimension (I called them Jupiter affliction).<br><br>Therefore, what is ultimately more important to you? Being able to be a 'good member' of your chosen religion OR the love &amp; belonging need you get from her companionship? Surely, that would give you some concrete insights on how you could proceed with your situation.<br><br>P.S: The point I am driving at is that there is no absolutely way you could continue a relationship like yours without bloodshed IF the both of you are not able to reconcile each other in your natural state. Perhaps deep in your respective subconsciousness, though you might claim there is none, there could be a quiet desire to convert the other, which is actually no difference from a romance-frenzied lover wanting to change her down-to-earth dude to become 'more romantic'. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"><br><br>Cheers</p>

              <p>Never let anyone change your religion because this life is short. How long can we live, the longest is slightly more than a hundred years and how many people can live till a hundred year old? Look beyond this life time. Never let religion gets in the way of your relationship. Relationship and religion should be separated. If the person let religion gets in the way of the relationship meaning that person does not love you enough.</p>

              <p>Yes spot on about values. Her values and my values are very different. You see, when I ask my friends who are not of my religious affiliation, they don't seem to understand, they just say, go for it, for the sake of love. For me, its a clash of enormous differences. Worldly sense, we both may click well, we both like statistics and talk about politics but in the value sense we differ far apart. My religion teaches me not to love the things of the world of materialism, to seek the eternal spiritual gifts. Her religion teaches her that doing good all the time is the key and making lots of money is good. My religion teaches me that doing good all the time, won't save us because it is impossible to reconcile ourselves to god because we as mere human beings have neither the capacity to impress god but the only way is thru the god's appointed saviour. Her religion despise my religion because they think my religion is arrogant and hipocrite. While my religion is free for everybody, everybody has free will so as long they do it out of love and obedience to god.</p>
              <p>I foresee, if i were to continue this relationship, it is going to explode into enormous argument, very unpleasant. And if I were to move from the dating stage into relationship, if it doesn't work out, i be sucked into the emotional pain of break-up. And likely to hurt her feelings too, not to mention, strengthen her hatred for people who follow my religion.</p>
              <p>I am in a huge dilemna. There are not a lot of people follow my religion so it is hard for me to find a soul mate there. At my religious place, always mismatch, no ladies there are compatible. On the other hand, on teh scene of people not affiliated with my religion, I find a lot of ladies have commonality with me. Unfortunately we clash in terms of religion.</p>
              <p>Its really hard to find somebody like her. But she goes to her religion and chant prayers which hurt me spiritually, everytime she says that. My religion is very spiritual and her continuation in dwelling in her religion with all those chanting, affects me deeply because she is somebody i try to foresee as my future wife.</p>
              <p>It is very difficult for both of us, time and time, almost we almost held hands, but we both balk back, because of hesitation. We foresee a very uncertain future.</p>

              <p>Some 20 yrs back, I let go a good relationship due to religion

              <p>Remember at that time, I went through some difficult issues in
              life, and she took me to her religious place to seek blessing.

              offer. </p>
              <p>Sometime later, I ask her what will our children's religion be,
              and she replied, half will follow me, half will follow her.
               With that, tears flow down my eyes.  After much praying,
              within weeks, I broke off with her, both of us in tears. </p>
              <p>Looking back, as much as I am sad to let her go, even as friends
              (we lost contact soon after), but I think I made a right choice.
               I am happily married with 2 kids now, and happily worshiping
              as family, and even praying together during hard time.  If I
              have chosen her, that will not happen. </p>

              <p>Yes, I cannot just shut out religion and she cannot shut out her religion and we just go continue on like this without even considering the consequences.</p>
              <p>Religion or my faith is more than just going to a building and making prayers, its my whole life.</p>
              <p> If she is impartial then our relationship would be in harmony. However, she criticize my religion. WE spoke about tithes and offerings for my religion. I said it is necesary because my religion need the finances to pay for the community work, premises upkeep and salaries of full time workers. I say that my religion does not compulsorily require the 10% contribution, we only volunteer to contribute because in our religion, god loves a cheerful giver not want to force a reluctant giver to give donation.</p>
              <p>She still not convince and she gave me the blackface because next time if we are a family, she doesn't want any of the money finances given to the church. So yes, the religious differences will inevitably disturb our relationship.</p>
