              <p>Popularity and reputation are but over-stated terms of defination.</p>
              <p>Find out why a person is popular or carries a reputation that others trust, and you will understand such terms more clearly.</p>
              <p>No human would like to associate with negative or sad people. Life is already tough enough without that added burden from them seeking to be friends. It's not that one is not caring, but humans need a source of strength, role models, to push and propel themselves above their daily woes, and learn from them.</p>
              <p>You too can be popular and have a good solid reputation. All you need is to be a bit more caring, listen more than you talk, be honest and sincere to your friends at all times good or bad, and your circle of relationships will grow automatically.</p>
              <p>Do not attempt to be a square peg in a world of round holes. You will never be able to fit. Attempts to be aloof, unique or acting cool will get you nowhere. Rather, be yourself, a caring person whom others can trust and rely on. This is something you too will admire in others, why not you become your own ideal and live it?</p>
              <p>True friendships are precious in life, treasure it if you have to opportunity to make them.</p>

              <p>Sorry, but you really need to see a psychiatrist to psychoanalyse your personality and  problems. You need professional help. Seriously. Better to be aware of it now, deal with it, during your formative years than to deal with it later when you are more set in your ways.</p>

              <p><strong>No human would like to associate with negative or sad people. </strong>Life is already tough enough without that added burden from them
              seeking to be friends. It's not that one is not caring, but humans
              need a source of strength, role models, to push and propel
              themselves above their daily woes, and learn from them.</p>

              <p>It's really an irony. Why would anyone think those who look troubled are cool? I find it hard to comprehend.</p>
              <p>There were times in my life when woes overwhelmed me, and I had attempted not to care about anything or anyone, for none seemed to care about me. I would walk alone, dine alone, drink in a pub alone, keeping to myself, and even if the world was falling apart, I wouldnt bat an eyelid.</p>
              <p>I was cold to anyone and didnt wish to talk to anyone. I still did my job, frighteningly cool and detachedly professional, more like a machine than a human. Some shunned me, but others thought I was 'cool'.</p>
              <p>But deep down inside me burned a pain no one could help. It was a lonely period. It is not something a human should endure, but in my pain, rather than to lash at others, i bottled it deep inside, and tried so hard to put on a smile, which was difficult, and only worsen the hurt and loneliness when if only i had just talk to someone who cared and understood, the pain would be lessened thru constructive criticism and advice. </p>
              <p>The irony of it all was that there were others who think such attitude are good role model behaviour to adopt, perhaps in the hope to illicit sympathy. They don't realized that they wont get any, more so if it was just an 'act' and would be derided outright when found out. None would want to feel foolish in helping an 'actor'.</p>
              <p>Then there are those who put on angsty unnecessary behaviour on their own young shoulders. Youth is only once and should be enjoyed and not suffered, so long as expectations are kept reasonable.</p>
              <p><strong>Every problem, regardless if we are young or old, has a solution</strong>. We have to solve it, and move on to enjoy our limited time on Earth. No one needs to be in pain, more so the need to 'act' out pain, which makes one's life more miserable when others avoid such people.</p>

              <p>I agree. Both TS and  xtreyier should look to Jesus for help. Jesus is the answer to all problems you have, and only He can provide us with true content and joy that is not fleeting and temporal.</p>
              <p>xtreyier, Jesus will also answer you for all you want in a life partner. This is definitely true. I have seen countless acts of miracles, in which people who got exactly what they wanted in a life partner, the odds of which would be totally improbable by human capacity.</p>
