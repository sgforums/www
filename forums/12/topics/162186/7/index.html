            <div class='col-md body'><strong><blockquote>A realistic question would be: what are the chances of coming together IF the woman already knew that this man is moving at this pace of life? Actually, the chance is zero unless she has decided and 'keyed' it in into her definition that this doesn't matter to her and there are other factors that she is looking into Love other than this aspect. </blockquote></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> This is at most time the most classic scenario in a lot of r/s before it started. Often or so, people are so call attracted to the opposite party visually and base on the common interest of both, but that doesn't account for the common goal in life and pace. Even with a common goal, there's thousands of ways to get to a same destination. Often people will start to have this thinking "it's ok that he/she's not so stable now, perhaps in times to come he/she will improve." That's it. Expectations. I'm not stating that expectations are no good, but what one can do doesn't mean the other could even if they are heading the same destination (take not I mention "destination" and not "direction").<br><br><strong><blockquote>Maybe one would ask, 'What if only AFTER one has entered into a relationship and discover this discrepancy? Then my question back would be 'Are you willing to make that a mutual definition or resist against it?' [b]A successful relationship is when both sees a common direction and NOT merely gazing at each other. </blockquote></strong><br><br>Well, that would have depend on individual and decide what is best for themselves.</div>

I do feel ashame of my actions or reactions towards my gf at times.<br><br>What I've penned down in text here are therotically "right" but sad to admit that I'm still practicing it thou and suxs on the test.<br><br>Me and my gf, we just started dating 3mths plus back and god has thrown a big test on me. Her dad met with an accident and it's been two months since he's in hospital and he still am in hospital although his condition has more or less stable down. My gf was there at the hospital 24/7 except for working days but she'll be back at the hospital once off work.<br><br>Honestly I can't imagine myself staying in the hospital for so long and worse to mention, sleep there. Let me explain a bit. I'm Singaporean and my gf is malaysian and she stays there. Nevermind how we met, it's kinda complicated. Being in a long distant relationship (LDR) is already hard enough and the accident her dad got involve doesn't make things any easier.<br><br>As a partner, I should be able to understand her situations and foresee the changes in the situations and try to accustom to it. I did, in fact. But at times, I do lost control of my emotions and let my own selfish needs gets over my sensibility and get cranky with her. I"m just too lucky that she's one who understands me well and endures my crankiness.<br><br>Despite all the things I've said here, it's more like a reminder to myself.<br>1) To learn to love the woman I love.<br>2) To learn to cherish a woman I can't afford to lose.<br>3) To learn to learn from the mistakes I make in the past and never to repeat them again.<br>4) To learn not to grip too hard to the one you love for fear of hurting them<br>5) To learn to hold on to the one I love so that I won't live to regret later<br>6) To learn to respect the one I love.<br>7) To learn to love myself so that she can set her mind take care of her father without having to worry about me.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> To learn to give her the support she needs so that she won't ever feel she's alone although I'm not by her side physically.<br>9) To learn to know what are her needs<br>10) To learn to remember the joy in my heart and the smile on my face when she said she love me for the first time.<br><br>Sometimes I do realised, the more I fear losing someone, the harder it is to control my own emotions. There's so much to learn, so much about myself to improve. She's one wonderful woman who really open up my eyes and heart and make me realised how "ugly" I am actually.<br><br>I always thought that loving someone means being nice to her, give her my best. But I'm so wrong. There's so much into a relationship, a feeling that bounds thousands and millions of definiations to it.<br><br>Love is a knowledge to be learn till the last breath of our lives.</div>
