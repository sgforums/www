            <div class='col-md body'>Gals can be rather petty at times. I find it cute when they do that,like a child wanting candy at the candy store. But from what NNP commented, your gal has probably forgotten the reason why you 2 are together. For my mine, its exactly the opposite, i'll be buying her stuff&amp;she'll be like "Ok ok enough liao".<br><br>But no matter what, do not hit a girl. Even if she has cheated on you. Hit a wall, hurt yourself, vent your anger out on something else, just not her lor. Even if she does "accept" your apologies, i tell you any trival disagreement you guys have in the future, she is sure to bring it up one, because its her Trump Card! ; j</div>

But then it could become a factor for arguments and of course in the end is how strong is your will to keep on believing that it won't affect the relationship.<br><br>Like I mention previously, both relationship (my ex and current gf), both expect about the same from me but from a different angle and attitude and my vision for myself in the future becomes different. My ex gave me nothing but pressure and stress and I couldn't look far enough to see which direction I should go whereas my current gf is more encouraging and and it gave me enough space and to look further thus I'm able to plan and move.<br><br>A marriage is not base on how many tables you hold for your wedding or how elabroate your wedding dinner is. You can spend $100,000 on a wedding dinner but what does that prove? Nothing. Marriage is a lifetime commitment and a life time course. You learn from your partner everyday, read them and understand them and when problem arise, see it as a test to the relationship and how well you can handle the test. If you don't study well and understand a certain subject, do you think you can pass the test? The answer is "NO".<br><br>Often people make a mistake of pointing the finger at the opposite party when problem arise in the relationship but how many people did actually try to think of their own shortcoming?<br><br>It's easier to preach then to action on it. I know almost everything I should do in a relationship but I can't deny that I'm a human afterall. Greed, demands, selfishness, all that are part of human desire and it's just a matter how greedy you are and how demanding you are.<br><br>If you have read before my past posts especially regarding my past r/s, I do learn a lot and try to correct my mistakes. Please take note, I mention "TRY". Even now I can't say I'm a perfect partner for my gf, I'm not even near perfect but rather far from it. Each day I learn from my current gf how to love her and how to love myself. Each day I proceed on in my life to make it better so that there'll be less problems to think of. But during these time I do still make mistakes. I'm not a saint, sometimes I can't see where I gone wrong, especially when it just happen. But day after day, I try hard to give myself more time to think of what happen and why it happened and sometimes if I were to think of it, I am at faults too.<br><br>Regarding to your last question, let me quote you a very good example. There's two apple right in front of you and you can only choose one. Apple A, in your own eyes, looks sweet, juicy and delicious and Apple B look more plain and not so nice. Someone picked up Apple B and took a bite and comment that it's very sweet and juicy and cruncy and when he took another bite from Apple A, all he commented is that this Apple A isn't nice at all. With all that comments coming, which apple will you think you'll choose?<br><br>I know deep in my heart that love can't be measured by anything, but I'm still learning not to measure love that way. Knowing and having the ability to do it is of two different matter, and again it's an effort for both instead of just a party. Love is not just a feeling shared. Imagine you and your partner are being tied together. She's one who is eager to move forward in life and keeps on moving but you on the other hand is slower or doesn't wanna move at all. Initially she might still feel it's ok to drag on for a while but how much longer can she drag? She'll feel tired and it'll become a burden, an obstacle. Same even for the other way round. Why you think some man had affairs outside even after they are married and have a good wife who stays at home and look after the family?<br><br>Anyway, there's too much factors to name it all out. I would be damned by other forumities if I were to name all out cause it'll be a long long list.</div>

In CloUdiSm context, definition of a relationship means and occurs during the inaugural stage of the relationship... the moment just before the couple gets together. We all come together in a relationship because mentally and emotionally, we have accepted the deal and package our partner 'present' to us. This whole package includes every single details about him/her... we decided that it was alright and we accepted the relationship. Naturally, if there was something repelling about the 'package', one wouldn't hesitate to reject the relationship.<br><br>This definition is keyed into our relationship during the transition. For example, one Leo Girl and Scorpio guy sees trust as essential in Love. This will extend out to honesty between one another, being open and constant communication. This is a shared definition and how the relationship maneuver depends largely on what this definition is defined at the beginning of the relationship. [I use your words... quote and explain my prior lines]<br><br><blockquote><strong>My ex gave me nothing but pressure and stress and I couldn't look far enough to see which direction I should go whereas my current gf is more encouraging and and it gave me enough space and to look further thus I'm able to plan and move.</strong></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Your relationship moved the way it was defined by you.<br><br>To add mutual definitions, as the relationship moved on, it wouldn't cause much issues - the real knocks is when one tries to re-define existing ones or add new ones in their own effort subconsciously. We cannot prevent our environment from new psychological and emotional input... it is a natural phenomenon in Love. However, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>when too much amendment is made to this definition, the couple suddenly becomes so incompatible.</strong></span> [I use your words... quote and explain my prior lines]<br><br><blockquote><strong>Imagine you and your partner are being tied together.

But as the journey goes by, they come to another junction and this time is a Y junction and both are heading the same direction but on different path. So, what's over at the other end of the Y Junction? Most often or highly possible that both will end up in the same path again ahead of the path but most couldn't go through it and thus both decide to give up halfway the journey.<br><br>There's no real definitions to Love and although it's just a four letter word, it consist of so much other things to consider and not only on self but to the partners too.<br><br>So I wouldn't say I'm right in my comments before but rather just how I look at things in my own angle. If I'm so right, then I wouldn't have so many failed r/s but even then each r/s is a big lesson to me.</div>
