I had a gf few years back and we are only together for less than half a year. All time she claim she love me but she love to hit me and scold me just because she's moody. All these I bear with it until one day I went to her house without informing her and caught her redhanded in bed with another person. She didn't even feel guilty about me finding out her affair and instead start scolding me for not informing her beforehand that I'm coming and start to hit me and throw things at me (mind yah, I didn't even lift up my hand or move neither did I make one single sound. I just stood there looking at her, obviously still stunned at what I've just bump into). I stood there motionless and let her use all her abuses on me until she finally threw the house phone at me and hit my head and I bleed. She finally stop to catch some breath. I just blankly walk up to her and give her a tight slap over her face and then I left the house never to return again.</div>

Not fair to the gf for us to do that. Let him be the one to judge his own problems. We can only listen and share some of our experience with him so that he can analysis but we shouldn't really be assuming too much.
