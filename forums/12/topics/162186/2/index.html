Let go of this girl before you start losing confident of yourself. I don't think it's you who can't earn and support her but rather she's getting more and more demanding. What does she mean that she "think" that you can earn more money in the future? It's a good thing that she got confident in you then, but what happen to herself? Getting mroe and more greedy or she's starting to think that the money you earn is not what she expected?<br><br>Worse!! What she mean she's in this state because you are so loowly and poor? What kind of state she's in? If she's so highly, then ask her to prove that she can support herself. You can jolly well ask her to f**k off and find someone she thinks worthy of her.</div>

Why is there is need to give it to her? My guess is that you still have feelings for her and you hesitated in the breakup. My suggestion is that you share your feelings with her. If there is no changes, then shorten your pain and breakup early. Good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

What I mean is, girls are of the weaker gender (as in strength) thus they cannot be slap. Man are of a stronger gender, thus they can be slap by a gal and the gal got no wrong? I mean what the hell is this ruling about? To protect the weaker gender and instead the stronger gender gets beaten by the weaker gender and the weaker gender can get away with it?<br><br>I still prefer to deal things case to case instead of basing on genders. Some girls just needs to be taught a lesson for abusing their privilages. But that doesn't give all guys the rights to anyhow slap ppl also.</div>
