Dun end up like me, live with the guilt for 9yrs and torture myself over it again and again with that thought. You have done what you could have done to redeem yourself.<br><br>All these nine years I keep asking myself why she just can't forgive me and why she still hate me so deeply over these years. There's no answer to it. Then I finally realised that nothing will come out of it. She'll never forgive me and I can't live on torturing myself like that forever.<br><br>I've done my part to redeem myself and enough is enough. She wants to continue to hate me, by all means go ahead. I'm letting go and I had let go. Even a life sentence is not for life. I've learn my lesson and learn it well.</div>
