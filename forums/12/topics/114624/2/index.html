You have mental illness. The symptoms you describe are that of 'negative schizophrenia' which are loneliness, social withdrawal, apathy, and depression. You may also have "bipolar disorder" at the same time, with symptoms of having wide mood swings.<br><br>The psychiatrist will give you medication. It will help you a lot and it is powerful because it affects and balance your brain chemicals. You will see results and feel and think much better.<br><br>The people here in the forum are helpful and gave you advice to go out more and make more friends. I'm not saying these are wrong. These are good advice, but you need to combine it with actual medication to be more effective.<br><br>I see that you yourself have mentioned "bipolar disorder" in your post and chose "John Nash" as your nickname. Bipolar disorder is a mental illness and John Nash is a famous man who had schizophrenia. I therefore conclude that you yourself have a guess already, or have a knowing already, that you suffer from mental illness. It is good because the first step is to acknowledge and recognize that you have mental illness. The next step is to seek treatment.<br><br>I don't know whether you have ever tried seeking treatment in the past. If not, seek treatment now. If yes, continue your treatment.<br><br>What is important, you must remember that you do not have to suffer in silence without any treatment, or think you are crazy. It is treatable, although you need to be patient because you may need long-term medication.<br><br>Please take action and seek medication.<br><br>If you need more help or extra information, please feel free post more, or use the PM function and PM me if you like. </div></blockquote>Seeing a doctor is ex leh..

This is quite untrue and there are other people who are having this problem as well.  We just don't know any.<br><br>Unfortunately, urban life makes people lonely and we think that we are the only ones that are alone when other people we do not know of(could even be our neighbour!) is thinking the same thing. I understand that family and relatives cannot be our counsellor all the time, and all they can do is offer advice...eventually we are the ones to climb back up.<br><br>Do something(like a hobby) to distract yourself from the lonliness and insecurities, and probably, you would feel better. The first step is admitting you have a problem and wanting to solve it. But hey, at least from this forum, you know you are not alone.<br><br></div>

They work really well and results with patients are very good.<br><br>If u bypass this option of professional treatment and medication, I don't know whether it is wise or not.<br><br>When this medication leads to real and significant improvement which are measurable by tests, yet u don't take up this option, I don't know whether it is advisable or not.<br><br>If I were u, I would seek treatment.<br><br>Already several years of having this problem, how long do u think u need for recovery if u try it without medication?
