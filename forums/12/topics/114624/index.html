            <div class='col-md body'>hey kid,<br><br>Don't keep thinking that way. Just to make u feel alittle better....there are other people in worse situation than u are. E.g. Tsumani pple!<br><br>You feel lonely is because you are lonely. Seriously for some of us, as we grow older, we have less frens. Many reasons due to this....your friends have other committments, family, work, etc. So won't have time to call on you.<br><br>So don't expect pple to call on you to go out or something. Either call ur frens up and try to arrange for a meeting or make an effort to try to make new frens. As u grow older, unless u have very very close frens who call on you, most of the time, these pple will normally have their own life in future and will not have "time" for you.<br><br>Advice: Try making new frens on the net, chat online, etc. Join more forums! *grin* and you will feel less lonely!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by john nash:</div><div class="quote_body">23 this year, I have loving &amp; supportive parents, a stable family background &amp; no financial woes, an otherwise good life except for one thing--- I have no friends.<br>After gradually losing touch with my closest frens of secondary sch &amp; a few unsuccessful relationships, I find myself experiencing dreadful bouts of loneliness, paranoid &amp; depressive mood sporadically.<br>Can you imagine I have not been to a movie, clubbing or jus going out on a sat for almost the past 2 yearsÂ… Not because I have no time, no money but simply Â‘cos I have no company. The bliss of emotional bonding common to most people has been so elusive to me. Many a times, as I watched the kind of joyous interactions between the people around me, I seriously wondered what is wrong with me.<br>Whilst watching a movie late one night about the life of a compulsive gambler, he said something that reflects my sentiments quite well Â“ I always wondered if I have no friends Â‘cos of my gambling, or I gambled Â‘cos I have no friends. Whatever it is, all I know is I always end up alone at the end of the day.Â”<br>I have habitually pondered if I have no friends Â‘cos of my depression, or am I depressed Â‘cos I have no friends.<br>I used to be quite certain I must have some deep character flaws. But today, I came to conjecture quite irrationally, that it seems almost my destiny to be lonely. Despite all my efforts, most of my relationships have habitually broken down. Most of the time I tried to ask somebody out, they are either jus Â“tiredÂ” on that day, busy or meeting someone else. I thought getting a partner would make my life slightly better, but as luck would have it, the last girlfriend I had was extremely busy with lots of other friends &amp; basically left me worse off.<br>IÂ’m perpetually plagued with an Â“Outsider syndromeÂ” no matter where I go--- my friends are usually closer to their other friends or gf/bf, whilst my own partner seemed emotionally miles away with other people.<br>On a good day, I tried to rationalized my problems, I am adequately blessed with many things: good parents, material comforts, no physical disabilities, so maybe life was jus being fair. On a bad day, I feel almost suicidalÂ… though its nearly amusing to die Â‘ simply cos I have no friends.<br><br>After recurring botched attempts at both relationships &amp; friendships, IÂ’m immensely afraid of even the most subtle rejections &amp; feel peculiarly uncomfortable with people increasingly.<br>Virtually an recluse now, the only social contact I get is the occasion dinner at my grandparentsÂ’ place or visiting a close relative.<br>Quite ironically, I have no problems talking with members of my extended family, though we are not exactly close. Sometimes, IÂ’m quite assured that there is nothing inherently wrong with me. Other times, the slightest setback may trigger a spiral of self-doubt, self-hatred &amp; memories of previous failures. Over the past few years, IÂ’ve experienced bipolar-disorder characteristic of alternating ecstasy &amp; paralyzing blues. But I still attribute the cause of my emotional turmoil to external factors (unsatisfying relations with friends, unmet expectations) rather than some biological defects.<br></div></blockquote>and i thought i was the onli one....</div>

You can see things more clearly and probably learn a thing or 2. Right?<br><br>- Do you know yourself well? Some people are naturally extrovert, participative. If you are not, just be yourself.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi John Nash,<br><br>Please see a psychiatrist and seek medication. You have mental illness. The symptoms you describe are that of 'negative schizophrenia' which are loneliness, social withdrawal, apathy, and depression. You may also have "bipolar disorder" at the same time, with symptoms of having wide mood swings.<br><br>The psychiatrist will give you medication. It will help you a lot and it is powerful because it affects and balance your brain chemicals. You will see results and feel and think much better.<br><br>The people here in the forum are helpful and gave you advice to go out more and make more friends. I'm not saying these are wrong. These are good advice, but you need to combine it with actual medication to be more effective.<br><br>I see that you yourself have mentioned "bipolar disorder" in your post and chose "John Nash" as your nickname. Bipolar disorder is a mental illness and John Nash is a famous man who had schizophrenia. I therefore conclude that you yourself have a guess already, or have a knowing already, that you suffer from mental illness. It is good because the first step is to acknowledge and recognize that you have mental illness. The next step is to seek treatment.<br><br>I don't know whether you have ever tried seeking treatment in the past. If not, seek treatment now. If yes, continue your treatment.<br><br>What is important, you must remember that you do not have to suffer in silence without any treatment, or think you are crazy. It is treatable, although you need to be patient because you may need long-term medication.<br><br>Please take action and seek medication.<br><br>If you need more help or extra information, please feel free post more, or use the PM function and PM me if you like.</div>
