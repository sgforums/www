            <div class='col-md body'>I think what the thread-starter is trying to say is 'How to overcome the shyness of initiating a conversation between 2 people of opposite gender whom just met each other or are strangers to each other'.<br><br>In my opinion, most of the time people tend to think too much, like "How will he/she reply me if I say 'Hi' ? " or "What impression will I give him/her if I initiate a conversation like this?". Well, just be natural, don't think too much. Just go up and say "Hi, I'm so-so and so". The other party wouldn't eat you up if you say the wrong starting sentence, right?  Treat them as if they are your friends already. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

But they deal with it. Even if ur workin as a dj for club..everything dark dark and no one can see you, u wont be immune to stage fright.
