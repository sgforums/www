              <p>I refuse to name anybody in this story of my life.</p>
              <p>Hi, im 19 years old poly student who has a total of 5 siblings in my family. Im the fourth child and also a twin to my brother who is the last child. I have an eldest brother, 31, years of age in 2011. I , as a matter of fact, have not spoken to my eldest brother for 19 years of my existence in earth. He hasn't too. Well, okay the only conversations we've had is when he ordered me to buy him things or do certain stuff he wants. Other than that, our conversations wont last more than 10 seconds. Also, he is the only sibling that i feel so estranged towards. WHY??? Will this last forever??? Also, he is self-centered.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Yes, it was back when i was a child. He'd abuse me and kicked, puched me. Called me stupid. There was once, he told my mum " Mum, why do you want so many children". When i heard that, i started hated him. Since then, we never talked. I dispised him for not even expressing love, care nor anything that an elder brother should do. Sometimes, i take him out of the family household.</p></div>

              <p>as expected from my first leading question...several adult behaviours in later life are largely attributable to childhood problems....they are very common....when siblings fight one another for parental attention and personality differences....</p>
              <p>the only solution is growing up....time will absolve all things when one gets older with greater understanding of the world around him...even if it does not resolve easily and overnight, do not let such matters impede your embracement of brotherhood....which is one of the most beautiful meanings in life....</p>

              <p>By figuring out WHY.. will you feel less hate towards your brother and less hated by your brother?</p>
              <p>His resentment stems from the fact that he had to share family resources with his siblings.</p>
              <p>Being the oldest.. he was probably unfairly burdened with many responsibilities not given to younger siblings.</p>
              <p>Yet, your parents had to distribute family resources equally among the siblings. The problem magnifies.. when family resources is currently stretched thin because there's too many mouths to feed.</p>
              <p>He probably felt slighted because he felt that the resources used on younger siblings could have helped him achieved much more in our cut throat society.</p>
              <p>To him.. siblings are just a drain on his resources..with no return but headaches and liabilities. Even a slave master gets labor out of his slaves when he feeds them.</p>
