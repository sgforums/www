Although I know there are times when silence between couples is inevitable but, she feels that I need to start taking much more control in the relationship.<br><br>For instance, like when she's depressed or relatively quiet she'd like me to liven up the mood rather than sulk together with her. I understand what she's trying to drive to me. I am a fairly cheery guy, I know I can crack her up mos of the time, but she tends to get very unpredictable and often I am just worried I might blurt out something cheesy or corny and the situation worsens. As a result she can get very moody (which sort of backfires my initial intents), and I fear I may have had a hand in producing that outcome.<br><br>Right now, she isn't picking my calls nor replying my messages. In the long run I don't think this will make things last. And I do love her very much. Just need someone to nudge me in the right direction in handling this. Just no trolls please. Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear ArchEnemy,<br><br>From what I've read, I would gather that both of you, or at least your gf, are in your early twenties.  She isn't mature enough to realise that these kinda expectations of you may strain a relationship, &amp; may even ruin it.<br><br>The only thing you'll be able to do is to put across to her gently that this is just Not done.  You don't do it to her, &amp; unless she's prepared to be treated the same, she should also take care of YOUR feelings, Not have everything go her way all the time.<br><br>Relationships are about give &amp; take, &amp; this applies to each party's feelings too.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ArchEnemy:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi all,<br><br>I'm a working individual in my twenties.

            <div class='col-md body'>She may be moody, or trying to sort out her thoughts as to what's bothering her, or does not know how to put things across to you. It may help for you to send her a nice card to share with her your concerns about wanting to comfort her but being afraid to say the wrong things and making her angry in the process.  Assure her you'll always be there to listen to her and to do whatever she needs u to do.<br><br>After that, give her a call or meet up with her to really listen, and hope she will open up and tell you what's really bothering her. Bring a small bunch of her fave flowers too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Albeit I am in the process of either acceptance that this will eventually lead to a dredgy standoff or things will always remain as it was.<br><br>To be honest, I am probably some one who never tries to solve problems for others; dishing out advice is one thing but always taken with a pinch of salt. choice is always yours.<br><br>Thus the problem (or rather the issue here) maybe I've been listening too much.<br><br>Sometimes I space out and nothing comes to mind, and I don't really wish to try to hard to please, more often than not, if you do, it tends to come out all wrong.<br><br>Or maybe like what you guys said, I don't feel appreciated for my past efforts and it failed to reciprocate my current stand. I understand being in a relationship you can't ask for too much and the juxtaposition of two individuals cannot and must not be justified by one. But it breaks down some where along the line. And that's just sad. Which is what I feel now.</div></blockquote>How old are the both of you and what are your horoscopes?<br><br>I understand how 'jerky' you can feel when your efforts are not appreciated or even return with 'unkindness'...<br><br>But 1st thing I would like REMIND YOU of... Of the REASON WHY you POSTED this THREAD? Of WHY it CONCERNS YOU.... BOTHERS YOU...<br><br>Like you've said it, YOU REALLY LOVE HER. <strong>REMEMBER THAT</strong>.<br><br>If you can't solve problems for her, then don't attempt to...<br><br>If she's down, BRING her to PLACES where people are ENJOYING..
