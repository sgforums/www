            <div class='col-md body'>I broke up with my ex last June, after many years of being together. He went overseas for his study this Jan. We remained pretty close in touch over ICQ. I am still nursing over the pain that had resulted from the breakup. He was my 1st love and (not only to me)the ONE for me. But all dat had to end. I was naturally crushed, defeated and devastated beyond words. Till now, I cant seem to be able to stop talking abt our past with him. Cant seem to forget the wonderful times of us being together. Cant seem to forget the times when we had stood together to even out any differences or any crisis or problems either one of us had encountered. I got to know this guy, X off the net a few months after our breakup. We went out soon after and I was bowled over by how chivalrous he was to me. I was smitten and could feel myself liking him. I wonder if I was on the "rebound" trip then. I tried testing his feelings for me, coz the way X behaved was if he likes me. The test results came out negative, being disappointed, forced myself to move on. I went for a month-long holiday and when I came back, I met up with X a few months later. He said appreciatively that I've grown prettier. :Ãž We started flirting and teasing each other using sms-es. Till one fine day, he told me dat he has been seeing someone for the past few months. I was naturally crushed, again. but nevertheless, we kept in touch. He called me up for a chat one night, and he started telling me how unhappy he is with his gf and how he planned to break up with his gf after her impending bday. A few weeks later, he told me that he likes me. I was elated of course! We met up frequently after that, more than he met up with his gf. He said he treats me like a gf. But I know nothing will come out of this "relationship" if he is still with his gf. It's been almost a month since his gf's bday, I dont see him doing anything to end the r/s. In fact, I think they've gotten closer and me, the dumb one kept on waiting to see if he'll break up with his gf. I feel as if he is treatin me as a sub gf. I feel really used and angry. At times, I really felt like lashing out at him, to get out of my life and to stop toying with my feelings, but I cant bring myself to do it... Why am I being kept hanging in the air again, for the 2nd time in my life, the first being by my ex? Do I really like X or am do I just seeking for attention? I know I shouldnt be on such close terms with X, but I cant help it. He's just treats me so nicely when he is around me.<br><br>------------------<br>*** Nothing Lasts Forever ***</div>

But for your case, I feel that X is nt exactly sure who he loves, mayb he's juz treating u as his gf substitute, who knws?  However, he may also b serious, this u had to find out yourself liao. I guess u shd observe and find out more abt this guy b4 making any decisions, try approaching his frds and c what they say, ok?<br><br>By the way, u r an undergraduate, which tertiary institute r u frm, I'm juz graduated frm NUS with a bachelor in sci major in chemistry, mayb we r even in the same course...<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Witness :I cant seem to get away from him. It's like everytime I psyche myself not to sms him or think abt him, he'll call me or sms me. Just like he just called telling me he just felt like talkin to me at that point of time. I shot back, teasingly of course, dat he was just feeling bored dats y he called up. mikegk_76: U r rite, the way he looks at me, just melts me literally. He is the affectionate kind. But besides that, he is not everything I want in a guy. Even my frens who had seen him before clnt point out why isnt he the suitable kind for me. Hmm... i dont quite know how to explain that. Well, he did say if only he knew me earlier than his gf. Observe? Wat shld i look out for? We dont have any common frens though.<br>------------------<br>*** Nothing Lasts Forever ***<br><br>[This message has been edited by oxygene (edited 07 August 2001).]</div>
