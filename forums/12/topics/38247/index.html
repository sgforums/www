Seriously, I couldnt quite believed my eyes ! I also asked her what's the most important element in a relationship. she said "i dun really noe, i'm still learning. perhaps, it should be trust." well, maybe she has some "trusting" problems with her bf or something ..<br><br>What should i do now ? I think i really like her. ain't some kind of infactuation i'm certain. she's just different from other girls. not just in terms of looks (well i gotta admit i find her quite pretty and captivating) she's also humble, loves nature .. and stuffs.. any advice old bro and sis ?!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks everyone for all your comments. (btw why do u want me to quit Master ?)<br><br>I did some searching and believed that it is none other than a mere desire to be with her. Maybe you may think it's selfish - I do not know. But with it, I also yearn to give her happiness in any possible ways I can. Well, I don't think she'll ever fall for me. Like what some of you said, I should let fate decide. (though i think it's dumb)<br><br>I guess I will just remain as a friend to her. Cheering her on when there's an opportunity to. And if she ever likes me, then we shall talk about it another time. I believe Love is patient; Love is kind. It does not envy nor boast and is never self-seeking.<br><br>Thanks all !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

(perhaps she was busy or something; it doesnt matter now)<br><br>Somehow when i reflect back, i'm amazed that i've actually liked someone like her. she doesn't possess the qualities of my ideal girl but yet she seems so special at the very first sight. maybe that's why they said love is blind.<br><br>She has been with her present boyfriend for 4 years. And 4 years relationship isn't easy to maintain; I guess they must have went through quite alot. Although it's dumb to leave such things to fate, I guess I don't quite have any other choices. It's for her good and mine as well.<br><br>I really agree with what Yuhair said. Even if she's with me, it doesn't mean that she'll be happier than what she once had enjoyed with her former boyfriend.

(btw why do u want me to quit Master ?)<br><br>I did some searching and believed that it is none other than a mere desire to be with her. Maybe you may think it's selfish - I do not know. But with it, I also yearn to give her happiness in any possible ways I can. Well, I don't think she'll ever fall for me. Like what some of you said, I should let fate decide. (though i think it's dumb)<br><br>I guess I will just remain as a friend to her. Cheering her on when there's an opportunity to. And if she ever likes me, then we shall talk about it another time. I believe Love is patient; Love is kind. It does not envy nor boast and is never self-seeking.<br><br>Thanks all !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>Good thought....
