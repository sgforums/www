            <div class='col-md body'>Your question is really hard to answer,it really depend on u and your wife financial status,if both are u r working (which is common now) and u have kids,it will be gd to have a maid but there an alternative of childcare centre if u dun like to have stranger being in your hse.<br>but remember if u have a maid ,u have to be responsible for her safety lah,her whereabouts etc,if she commit some offence u may be liable too hence it impt to chose a gd maid also . think it better to employ a local one perhaps an auntie from the neighbourhood or maybe your relatives although the costs of local one is higher at least u are not responsible for her well-being after work and living expense will be reduce too for the maid.</div>
