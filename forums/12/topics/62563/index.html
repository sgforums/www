            <div class='col-md body'>My mum is heavily addicted to casino gambling and has lost millions and millions on the casino tables. Yet she still demands for more money even though we are almost broke. When we dun give her enough money, she will smash everything she sees including plates, vases and even the deity figurines we worshipped at home. I often quarrel with her becos of her demands and in revenge, she went out and spread rumours that we as her kids are unfillial to her and my dad is a unfaithful bastard who abuses her physically. She will treat us like shit but takes her friends as treasure. She will only be nice to us when she needs money.I would like to know what you people out there would react. Is it really unfillial on my part if i shout at her in public and ignore her? I am really pissed at her double standards.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all your replies. The ironic thing is that i also work inside a casino for a living, Its useless to persuade my mum to give it up. Almost all of my family members has given up on her. Life has been hell for us though things are picking up. Worst of all, my dad is willing to forgive her and give her 10 to 15K monthly allowance when business picks up again. I cant believe such silly men still exists. pardon me for calling my dad silly. If you guys have a wife like my mum, will you be nice to her like my dad?<br></div>

Yet she still demands for more money even though we are almost broke. When we dun give her enough money, she will smash everything she sees including plates, vases and even the deity figurines we worshipped at home. I often quarrel with her becos of her demands and in revenge, she went out and spread rumours that we as her kids are unfillial to her and my dad is a unfaithful bastard who abuses her physically. She will treat us like shit but takes her friends as treasure. She will only be nice to us when she needs money.I would like to know what you people out there would react. Is it really unfillial on my part if i shout at her in public and ignore her? I am really pissed at her double standards. </div></blockquote>Sometimes we gotta look at the roots, to solve this prob. U know when it actually started? Why/How it started?There must be a time when your mum started out this habit.....u should scroll through these questions, before any real actions can be taken. Find the roots first.....</div>
