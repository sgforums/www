              this is a complicated story, please understand and give advice if possible.. all listed are not real names to protect identity..
              
              "my friend (Jasmine) had a twin brother called (James).. when she was 3 and james was 2, their biological parents John and Mary had a divorce in 1990.. Jasmine was brought up by her dad and Mary brought James to usa with her then bf, Daniel.. a few years later, Daniel and Mary had their own children and Daniel sent James to foster parents.. at that time Mary was very upset..  my parents adopted James and we lived as siblings for many years..last year, my dad passed away and my mom sent us to singapore because she wanted us to learn chinese. our family is wealthy and my mom now works in a branch of a well known company owned by my late father.. i go to school together with James and we are also friends with Jasmine. both of us liked Jasmine a lot but she loves James but not me.. they have been dating for some time without knowing that they are actually siblings. James took his stepfather's surname so Jasmine couldn't tell.. the most amusing thing is that my mom met John (Jasmine's father) John is still single after his divorce in 1990..and because of this very unexpected meeting..my mom now knows that Jasmine is actually the sister of James.. i have no objection about my mom seeing John because i know he is not after my family's money...but i can't bear to see Jasmine going out with John's son..also her own brother! Jasmine does not know about this yet... right now everyone, my mom, me, Jasmine's dad knows about it except the couple... should i reveal the truth? "
              
              this above is written by my friend..any advice for such a situation?

              <p>Wah.. Ok let me get this straight. This is not some soap opera school project you are trying to submit for credits ?</p>
              <p>Too many loop holes lah.</p>
              <p>The termination of Parental rights law in USA is very strict leh, you can't just foster your own child off so easily hor.</p>
              <p>You have to be deemed unfit and/or the child may have abnormal handicap making it impossible for their biological parents to care for them. If parents are deemed unfit they will also lose custody of their other children too. </p>
              <p>Also hor, John is jasmine and James biological father leh... He must be a very mentally sick guy to allow this relationship to carry on, knowing full well j n j are siblings, and continue to keep them in the dark.</p>
              <p>Should u reveal the truth.. Actually no, to inject more drama, you should go sleep with John who is dating your mother.</p>
              <p>Please hor, I know u are trying to write a compelling story.. But you can only fool teeny bbopper <span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  ">lah...</span></p>
              <p>Adults will probably toss your story into the rubbish bin. </p>

              <p>Assuming the above isn't fictional: </p>
              <p>1) Given your affections for Jasmine, IMO you're not exactly in a neutral position here. In the event of a split between J and J - net gain. </p>
              <p>2) The implicit judgement here is abhorrent. Siblings falling in love may be taboo, but it isn't immoral so long as nobody else was harmed. </p>
              <p>3) Therefore, MYOB. </p>
              <p>4) I recommend watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116905/">Lonestar</a> (1996 film). </p>

              Boy+girl twins are fraternal twins and they come from two different eggs so they won't look alike. 
              
              Identical twins are from same egg and they look alike. Will be boy+boy or girl+girl.

              Heh!Heh! Just like the mounds on the chest  of fairer sex whom some call twins!
              But more seriously, I believe there is a mechanism which is mutual olfactory aversion which prevents copulation of siblings of same set of parents.

              Thanks for the interesting bit of information!  In non biological terms, twins(in the instance of twin towers) denote that they are identical looking pair or associated in tandem.
