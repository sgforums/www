              <p>i do not know the sentence of child abuse but the possible outcome of making a police report will be</p>
              <p>1. ur mon get some kind of counseling and she change for the better.</p>
              <p>2. you might not get physical abuse in future but will hv lotsa of mental abuse like scolding, dun talk to u, treat u as stranger in future.</p>
              <p>As i do not know how old n ur gender, i got 2 suggestion for u. 1. talk to ur father and ask him to be the peace maker. 2 retaliate-----of cos not asking u to beat her but put up a brave front as to show u are not an "easy prey" meaning to say u r not young anymore and u dun deserve the punishment.</p>

              <p>I would suggest you report before she kill you. <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">I have seen many crazy people around in the hospital. You never knew whether you will be alive next time ...  Sometimes, they do things without consciously aware of what they are doing. It is different from you writing now, you are aware and conscious of your posting and languages, gestures... </span></p>
              <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">If you are 14 now, and you think you have grown up, your parents should act like advisors. When you are lost, then they comes in consulting you. When you seems to be too off track then they will come to interfere with you. </span></p>
              <p>You should know how to automatically study when exam comes, govern you own pocket money know what to spend what to not spend, when to sleep.... </p>
              <p>Talk to your dad first. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FYI, My parents hardly interfere with my life since secondary school.</p>
              <p>Happy birthday. Good Luck.  </p>

              <p>I know how this feels like, as it happened to me before in a slightly different level of lesser severity, of course. I believed no one should ever resort to violence as a means to solve any problems. It only makes matter worse.</p>
              <p>Clearly, If things don't worked out like what ocy said, then perhaps it's time to take a firm stance towards the situation by bringing the matter to officials, who would be able to take whatever means necessary to rectify the situation.</p>

              <p>yes, i believe i have helped out alot. i am an academically
              inclined student with reasonable grades. i study hard when it is
              necessary and i never ever gave my parents problems over my
              results. i am in the IP stream, students from there are
              academically gifted and do not have to take o levels. however, she
              is not pleased. she gives all kinds of comments about my results
              just because i didnt do well for my EOYs this time. im sec 2 by the
              way. and i participate actively in my CCA and never once have my
              teachers called my parents up to complain about my results. i pass
              the promotion criteria as well every single year. my sister faces
              the same problem as i do. except that she's smarter and moving on
              to JC next year. <strong>we help out alot in the household, and we're not
              like other spoilt kids who demand to be paid for doing household
              chores. we can cook, fold and hang the clothes, iron the clothes,
              sweep and mop the floor, you name it, we do it. i dont deny that
              sometimes we may be a bit lazy, but, we ultimately still contribute
              to the family and play our part.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its not just about all the stuff we do at home<strong>. i am in a
              reasonably good school, and all she knows is to throw me crude
              remarks which make me feel bad instead of encouraging me. she tells
              me that with my kind of results, i will only manage to have a job
              as a roadsweeper next time and with my kind of results now,</strong> i can
              only make it to poly. i am only sec 2, there is still room for
              improvement, and i alr told myself that i need to study hard for
              the upcoming years.</p>

              <p>What the heck! you are saying that I am a spoilt child! . Have you heard of "one to one equivalence exchange"? </p>
              <p>just ignore her. <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">dont need to think too much about your academic. </span></p>
              <p>if exam just study, if you failed, you failed , if you score well then go on higher level. Whether you ended up in ITE, Poly, Uni. just try your best. it is unnecessary to compare to other. The FACT is you dont need to be the top in school to be successful in this world. Just pass can already. </p>
              <p>Try to develop other talents like swimming, piano, singing... </p>
