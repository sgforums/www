            <div class='col-md body'>Got to no this girl for half a year from irc. Occasionally we still got go out and i feel that we can click along very well though i do not no how she feels.<br><br>Of late, I would get very excited when we had a chance to meet and would yearn to be with her. In fact, i dun feel the pinch spending money on her and would treat her every now and then. At times, i ask myself if i would scarifice for her and i felt the reply is Yes is my heart.<br><br>Yet this is where the confusing part steps in. I felt that i do not have the love for her and would not miss her for up to 2-3 weeks. After 2-3 weeks, i would really look fw to going out with her.<br><br>I felt very comfortable being around her and she is comfortable with me 2. I no that she treat me as a normal fres by the way she treat me. However, due to this dilemma over the circumstance i faced, i really do not know if i should chase her. Do i really love her or is it that she is just like a good fres to me? Or is it that when u seem to get along very well, love just seem to be blured into friendship?<br><br>would any kind soul up there kindly enlighten me? I felt very lost at times over this matter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another brother of mine arhz?? hehehe~<br><br>Just some questions... How you know you will sacrifice for her?? and what does sacrifice means to you??? You willing to push her from a on-coming car?? Or just willing to spend you meague allowance or salary on her?? a lot of difference there my dear... Think for a while before you answer, because many people gives one reply without consideration, but when things really happen, their actions is another.<br><br>However, I can tell you that if you love someone, it doesn't mean you will miss her everyday.. then again if you miss someone eveyday, doesn't mean that you love her... One very good example for many people is their forgotten parents, I believe deep inside we love our parents, but they are seldom remembered... the other one is some of your close buddies (could be guys or girls), you feel a miss if one day you don't talk to them, but you don't love them like you do for your special someone right??<br><br>Sorryz confused you liaoz.. hehehe~<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)

Yes... Sometimes LOVE (BGR) can be easily BLURRED in out of a friendship.... This is the NATURE of human to want MORE in life.... But LOVE (BGR) is NOT all about achievements...

            <div class='col-md body'>there is really this thing called a true relationship between opposite sexes. in my opinion, it aint love for you, it doesnt exist. and when you feel it does, it is only that void you are trying to fill up, when you need a gal to satisfy your emotions. when you think you love her, it is a continuous process, starting from the begining and not like a hidcup.<br><br>you start to think of her everyday, it doesnt stop, you will put her in your top list of activities throughout.<br><br>or maybe, deep inside, you want to have more choices, but she happens to be the only one at present. and till you find another one, you can go on like this forever?<br><br>ask yourself if you want a long term, or short term or just play play relationship. dont focus too much on whether you think it is love or not, or you find yourself twirling around like a bunch of dirty clothes in a washing machine.<br><br>Regards.</div>
