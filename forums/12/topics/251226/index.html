            <div class='col-md body'>Be practical man. People will tell you that if you find a job that you love doing, you'll never have to work....... It's all bullshit bozzz! When your hobby becomes a job, fun goes out of the window! Your only concern is just getting the work done, enjoyment has no place at all! Do something you want and which gives you satisfaction in completing well... it's more likely you'll stay with the job longer.........  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
