              <p>Hello friends.</p>
              <p>Ok alot of things have changed since my last post.</p>
              <p>I didn't celebrate her birthday with her this year.</p>
              <p><span id="intelliTXT">She called me recently and was crying on the phone. It was an
                  unfamiliar number so I picked up the call. She told me she had just
                  broken up with her bf and didn't know who else to turn to. Her clique
                  of gfs in poly didn't really helped her much so she called me I guess. She asked me if I could go out with her.<br> <br> Being the sucker I am, I said ok even though my heart was bleeding when I heard her voice. I took a cab to her house immediately and we went to
                  cineleisure. We watched a movie and during the movie she was crying on my
                  shoulders, I'm not very good with words so I just took off my jacket
                  and let her wear it. After the movie we were just walking aimlessly and
                  she started telling me abt her ex. She said he was always borrowing
                  money from her and treated her like shit even though she loved him
                  alot. They were together for 2 yrs+ until they broke up a few days back. She said the last straw was when he didn't meet her even though he ask
                  her to meet up and he went to meet his frens instead. She dumped him
                  but she felt miserable, she said.<br> <br> From the moment she got on the cab, the old feelings were summoned. I
                  felt the familiar feeling of lovey dovey again and once again I can't
                  stop thinking of her for the whole night.<br> <br> After the she spoke to me aboutt her issue, I told her lets go to clark
                  quay for some drinks and bcause I knew she liked live bands so we went
                  down and she was really happy with live band and stuffs. After awhile,
                  she went to the toilet and I didn't know why I did it if you asked me now, I
                  went to the band(it was 3 man band, 2 guitar n 1 singer) and asked him
                  to play 'Always Be My Baby' and allow me to sing. At this point of
                  time, it's around 2am in the moment and left aboutt 5 locals and less than
                  10 ang mohs in the pub. She came out of the toilet and they started to play
                  and I started to sing and by God, I swear I was feeling on top of the world.<br> <br> The angmoh dudes damn on, sing together with me and started dancing, I could see she was blushing as she's the quite shy type when it comes
                  to crowd. The guys were all very sporting.<br> <br> After that we took a cab back and on the way back she told me she's
                  very sad about her ex but will try to forget him. That son of a gun was
                  calling her through out the night but she kept cutting him off. We were continued talking and she
                  also said,Â  she looks for a guy for cares about her and would surprise
                  her. She's not those materialistic girls, she said so long he can make
                  her happy, even if he no money she will marry him. <br> <br> Now the question remains, what should I do? Is she giving me a hint or
                  am I thinking too much? Because when I dropped her off at her house,
                  she gave me a hug and kissed me on the cheek. After that night with her, I really can't think of anything else. In camp everynight I think of
                  her only and nothing else. I call her everynight and we will talk till 3am plus
                  when she has to sleep as she has to attend school the next day. What should I do? Is she using be as a rebound? Or do I really stand a chance now?</span></p>
              <p>We now meet up every other day as I got quite a number of offs to clear. We even had dinner just now. She seems to be over her ex, or am I deluding myself?</p>
              <p>I don't wish to spoil the fragment of a relationship I have with her now if I rush things and propose to her. What should I do?</p>
              <p>Thanks for your time people, and sorry to disturb you guys.</p>

              <p>its indeed a twist of events or twist of fate. Though it has been hard situation for her, it was i feel is a turning point for you to make your move. Afterall all these years , u have been so indulged in this saga and now it is all starting to show some worth. I wished this happened to me 8 years ago, but imo too late now for me.</p>
              <p>Now yr direction is to "keep" her, but at the same time dont let her use u as a crying shoulder while she goes on with other guys one r/s to another. A lot of girls do this and so be careful. Your sincerity is unquestioned but hers, i cant comment . Watch her closely after this saga and decide on your future. all the best to both of u.</p>

              <p>Thanks, I'm now quite close with her but I don't dare to ask her yet incase she reject, I won't even have a chance to talk with her anymore.

              when it comes to crowd. The guys were all very sporting.<br> <br> After that we took a cab back and on the way back she told me she's
              very sad about her ex but will try to forget him. That son of a gun
              was calling her through out the night but she kept cutting him off.
              We were continued talking and she also said,Â  she looks for a
              guy for cares about her and would surprise her. She's not those
              materialistic girls, she said so long he can make her happy, even
              if he no money she will marry him.<br> <br> Now the question remains, what should I do? Is she giving me a hint
              or am I thinking too much? Because when I dropped her off at her
              house, she gave me a hug and kissed me on the cheek. After that
              night with her, I really can't think of anything else. In camp
              everynight I think of her only and nothing else. I call her
              everynight and we will talk till 3am plus when she has to sleep as
              she has to attend school the next day. What should I do? Is she
              using be as a rebound? Or do I really stand a chance
              now?</span></p>
              <p>We now meet up every other day as I got quite a number of offs
              to clear. We even had dinner just now. She seems to be over her ex,
              or am I deluding myself?</p>
              <p>I don't wish to spoil the fragment of a relationship I have with
              her now if I rush things and propose to her. What should I do?</p>
              <p>Thanks for your time people, and sorry to disturb you guys.</p>

              <p>She already knows that you like her. Whether or not you actually <em>tell her</em> doesn't matter. If you make your move now, chances are you'll wind up a rebound.</p>
              <p>Give her some time, just keep doing what you're doing. Until you are sure she is over her ex, then make your move. :)</p>
