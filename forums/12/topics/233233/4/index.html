            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with what everyone says here. In this modern world of ours, it's ok for the girls to pursue their love &amp; fight for what they want. BUT do not make your first move yet. Let him recover from his previous relationship. Always stay there beside him. Let him know that your presence will always be there to soothe his broken heart &amp; help him recover from his broken relationship.<br><br>You predict that he will forget his ex in 6 mths' time? No. Do not predict such stuff because you won't know when he will completely get over his ex. Yes, it is good to set a goal for him but do set this target for yourself. Since you are rather close to him, you should be able to tell when he has gotten over his ex-gf. Or if you can't, ask him outright just to confirm whether he has gotten over her. Once you can confirm he has recovered from his ex, you can start pursuing him.<br><br>By the way, to all forumites in this thread, I have a question. Is it possible to fall for someone after treating a him/her as your rebound guy in the beginning? When I posted my problems here a long time ago, I found out I was the rebound guy to my girlfriend when she told me she accepted me because she was emotionally unstable back then. Because she told me that, I gradually lost my whole trust in her over the weeks and broke up with her in a month's time, not to mention that we were quarelling over lots of other stupid small matters all the time. Because if it is possible, then the TS might be in for a tough ride if he treats her as his rebound then eventually likes her only to realise too late that the TS has lost all faith in him by then.</div>
