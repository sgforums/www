Just because he once expressed his desire to remain single does not mean it applies for life.<br><br>If he really is single now, give him some space to at least get over it so that you aren't the rebound girl, and then go for it.

Chances are, hes still "not over" with his ex, and actually not emotionally ready to commit to any relationship - which theres not much you can do; and its dangerous to expect anything more from him at this point.<br><br>If you value him as a friend too, take things slowly.  If it doesnt develop into anything further then so be it.  Dont tear your hair worrying if he likes you or not.  Its not so important, more importantly hes not ready to commit to you, and hence  make no moves towards you.<br><br>In fact if you ask him outright, its probably a "no".  But theres a potential for it to become "yes", if the relationship nurtures.  Be patient. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
