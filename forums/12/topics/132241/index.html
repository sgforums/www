While some others need time to discover... (everything seems cool until real conflicts arises..)<br><br>In any case at all, of course the 'love' in a relationship should be pretty important.... When you talk about overwhelming (I'm personally prefer to use overcoming...) the 'differences', it would depends on what 'differences' you're talking about... And... It's often not just a MOMENT of 'overwhelming'.... As in... "YES!! We've MADE IT!!!" A relationship is a constant effort and journey...

How old are the both of you?<br><br>Somehow I suspect sort of romance rushes through the head thing in this case? But often when you're asking a question like 'i m also wondering why i love him' and couldn't seems to find any appropriate answer to that, you should be aware of a possible 'alert amber' in the future of this relationship. Of course, it doesn't necessarily means that this relationship would turn out for the worse. It just means this relationship should have lots of areas of uncertainty.</div>

Regardless of race or religion, whatsoever... Understand that there could be a consequence which you might have to answer for in the price of such a kind of relationship....<br><br>And remember... Distance can play a trick on the relationship... It could mean not being able to meet up as often as a 'normal' couple would... Can you tolerate that? And the 2nd question you should be asking after that... Can he tolerate that?<br><br>Cultural differences and possible pressure from peers, friends and family... Have you thought about things like that?<br><br>Sure. At this point you might be thinking that 'love can overcome all' kinda notion... But when the situations start to pour in, together with the uncertainty you're holding for this relationship itself, I would say you're just like giving yourself unneccesary troubles to tackle with...

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br>Very long didnt post liao. For those who are questioning about mixed races &amp; nationalities, I think its ok lah. Im not supporting my statement just becoz I have a foreign gf, but Ive been thru this phase before &amp; I believe if u strongly believe that this relationship can work, chances are, it will.<br><br>Just remember this : LOVE CONQUERS ALL<br>And this : ALWAYS REMEMBER WHY YOU TWO FELL IN LOVE IN THE FIRST PLACE<br><br>My gf is a Thai, still in Thai &amp; I know its pretty difficult to bring her to Sg. So, im weighing my options to migrate there. Im 32 already &amp; had my fair share of local gals. Not saying our local gals are bad in whatsoever ways, but other foreign chabors have much much more to offer in terms of what most guys would look for. The only drawback would be her education level (thus will affect our income level) &amp; language (Im currently taking Thai now while she's taking English course)<br>Ive spoken to my parents about this &amp; surprisingly theyre pretty supportive coz they have learnt to let go (Im matured enuff to plot my own chart of life) &amp; I guess i need to start my own circle of trust (for those who has watched "Meet The Fockers" hahahaha)<br><br>Both of us have thought about the road ahead of us, and we felt even stronger to take our r/s to the next level. So if anyone has doubts about this particular topic, fret not. Our own gals are going for angmo, and I cant see why local guys cant go for foreign gals.<br><br>So, have fun. Enjoy the journey, not the destiny<br><br>Im the ONE<br><br></div>
