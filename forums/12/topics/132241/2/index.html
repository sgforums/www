Anyway..all the best(^_^)b     </div></blockquote>Hi, thanks to all of ur advice...esp to aragorn73 and young stallion. our age diff is 6yrs..dunno if thats considered too old for me...but my man has a young character and likes to joke ard...and i've always wanted a bf of the same race but things dun usually turn out the way it shld be. thats why i've been wondering what exactly do i see in him...he's lowly educated, smoke, sometimes talk dirty...but i can see that he's a considerate and honest guy, who likes to help friends in need. anyway...hopefully my parents are open minded...and will accept him if i intro to them. but that will take abt a few yrs before we decide to settle down.<br><br>conclusion: it all depends on fate...</div>
