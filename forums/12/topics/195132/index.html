            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Me and my bf has been together for 7yrs. Our relationship has been stable. My family (esp my sis) knows him and he often comes to my house. However, whenever I suggests to go travelling with him, my sis will get angry and refused to talk to me. My sis don't want me to go alone with him. I've not travel with my bf alone yet. Becoz every time she gets angry, I'll give up my plan.<br><br>Told my sis about my travel plans yesterday. She still jokes about it and said she is afraid that my dad may not like it. My dad is ok with it when I told him today. So just now I told my sis that dad agrees, then she got angry. And now refused to talk to me. I don't understand why one moment she is ok, the next moment she flared up at me.<br><br>I really don't wish to give up my plans and disappoint my bf again (has been doing that many times for the past yrs). What should I do? Anyone can advise me how to solve this problem? Do you guys travel with your partners?</div>

She might also feel that the bf has stolen her sis.<br><br>I have a fren who was like that also, kicked up a big fuss when her sis was lovey dovey with her bf, she kept passing bad remarks about her, say she's being a hypocrite, when he's at home, she will take initiative to do housework etc, spend more time with him, especially weekends etc.  Can understand the bonding between sisters, but I think she had gone a bit too much.  Advised her a bit, yet she was not appreciative and gave me attutide.  I shut up ever since, and washed my hands off her.  </span></div>

[My mom has passed away] I know she is worried about me. I'm aware of her good intention. That's why I always give in to her demands. But I need to have some personal space and freedom to lead a normal and healthy relationship.<br><br>Was hoping to find a nice way to let her understand my needs. Don't want to cause any strain in our relationship</div></blockquote>You'll have to let her understand that you're a grown up and you've got your own life to lead...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Our relationship has been stable. My family (esp my sis) knows him and he often comes to my house. However, whenever I suggests to go travelling with him, my sis will get angry and refused to talk to me. My sis don't want me to go alone with him. I've not travel with my bf alone yet. Becoz every time she gets angry, I'll give up my plan.<br><br>Told my sis about my travel plans yesterday. She still jokes about it and said she is afraid that my dad may not like it. My dad is ok with it when I told him today. So just now I told my sis that dad agrees, then she got angry. And now refused to talk to me. I don't understand why one moment she is ok, the next moment she flared up at me.<br><br>I really don't wish to give up my plans and disappoint my bf again (has been doing that many times for the past yrs). What should I do? Anyone can advise me how to solve this problem? Do you guys travel with your partners?</div></blockquote>your story sounds familiar, I have a galfren who is married, she simply refuses to let her sister who is 27/28 yrs old now with a steady boy fren go travelling alone with the partner even tho their mum/dad has no problem with it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>my gal fren is a little conservative, but what amazes me is that her sister actually listens to her, quite touching loh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>nevertheless, try talking heart to heart to your sister and understand her fears and concerns, I'm sure it will all work out  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

You've got to make her understand that you're no longer a kid. This is about a trip, not about sex. At the current century, she thinks both of you only need to go overseas in order to have sex if you're really into it?</div>
