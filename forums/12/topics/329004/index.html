              <p>hi... my gf and I have been together for 3 months.. she has a very poor constitution since young, and keeps suffering from a bunch of ailments, especially recently:</p>
              <p><br>- severe insomnia (can be unable to sleep for days straight, even sleeping pill sometimes has no effect)<br>- prone to knocks and aches<br>- low blood pressure/migraine<br>- prone to constipation (and when she has gastric flu/infection, she vomits instead of having diarrhoea)</p>
              <p>i'm reaching my wits' end... it's to the point where she's plagued by at least one of the above every time we meet, every day etc...</p>
              <p>i love her and it hurts so much to see her like this, while i cant really do a thing about it, other than being with her whenever possible, and protecting her.</p>
              <p>what can i do to help her?</p>

              <p>we're working in the same dept, was quite hectic last few months, but recently levelled off and getting abit better.</p>
              <p>i think her diet is crap, irregular meals and usually eats very little, at night even if 9pm go to bed, also cant sleep... until like 1-2am.</p>
              <p>she used to visit psycho for her insomnia, some other specialist for her other probs, but after working, nv visit for quite awhile already, discharged. So now if wana go again, need to get referral letter, wait , etc...</p>
              <p>damn painful to see her suffering like this. granted it cant compare to what some are experiencing, but i want to see her healthy instead of not being able to fully enjoy whatever she does...</p>

              <p>How's her outlook towards life as a whole?</p>
              <p>If her psychology is fine, then maybe can ask the doctor if she is eligible for a blood change. That might help her if like what you have said, she has a very poor constitution since young, and keeps suffering from a bunch of ailments. High possibility the problems lies in her blood. Did she had a blood test and what was the outcome?</p>
              <p>I have to remind you that having blood change is a very expensive process and painful and there is are certain risks involved. So do it only at your last resort if possible, but do consult your doctor for the possibility prior to doing so.</p>
              <p>Another alternative is to find another less stressful job with less working hours.</p>
