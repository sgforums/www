Please let this bf go. If not you will only harm your prince chamming by loving him half heartedly. Since you never even give up on your current bf how can you even ask for a return?<br><br>So please tell yourself if you still love him then stick to him and stop whinning, if you can let him go then you will have a chance to find someone new. Stop blaming on others when the only person you should blame is yourself for not being brave enough to let go.</div>

I have been telling myself not to enforce my idea of what i THINK is good for him. I am not his mother and i dun want to behave like his mother too. He is right, i am too no confident.  Thats why i keep pulling him by my side... its time to give him some leeways.<br></div>
