              <h1><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.231;">I’m currently in a dire situation.</span></h1>
              <p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.231;">I received a call from a policeman belonging to the Violence
                      Against Person Squad (VAP). He said that he wants to know what happened between
                      us and the Ministry of Education (MOE) with regards to our daughter.</span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.231;">Background information:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.231;">When my daughter was in her primary 4 (10 yrs old), due to
                      some school issues, I requested for her to sit for her SA2 (final year exam) in
                      the school’s General Office. The principal (Mdm Balakrishna) did not accede to
                      this request and thus, my daughter did not sit for her exam.</span><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">As the school issue has not been addressed, I applied
                      through the principal for homeschooling for my daughter. Months later, someone
                      from the Compulsory Education Unit (CEU) called and inform me that I’m not
                      allowed to homeschool her due to my daughter not taking her P4 final year exam
                      (special arrangement was not approved by the principal).</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">There were no more follow-ups from the CEU until when my
                      daughter turned 12, where a meeting involving a few people including the
                      principal, Karen Chan (Head of CEU) and myself was arranged. In this meeting,
                      both the principal and Karen agreed on not allowing my daughter to take her
                      Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) if she did not return back to school.
                      Since then, we engaged in correspondence with the group.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">When my daughter was about to reach 15 (according to the
                      Compulsory Education Act, a child of ‘compulsory school age’ is one who is
                      above the age of 6 years and who has not yet attained the age of 15 years), the
                      principal sent me a report and copied it to Karen Chan. Most of the content in
                      it contains inaccurate information. I have highlighted the huge disparities in
                      the report to both of them, yet none of them bothered to respond.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Out of a sudden, not knowing what
                      has happened, we received a call from a policeman belonging to the Violence
                      Against Person Squad (VAP). He said that he wants to know what happened between
                      us and the Ministry of Education (MOE). We provided him with the information,
                      however he did not get back to us ever since.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It has been almost 2 months and
                      there was still no update from him, thus we requested to close the case as we
                      did not do anything wrong, plus there were no further queries from him.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Suddenly, his superior sent a text
                      message insisting to meet-up to investigate on the matter (in which we still
                      have no clue what it is about). We have requested him to write an email to
                      explain on the situation (to make sure it’s clearly documented), but he came
                      back with a reply of “communication thru email and behind computers is not
                      helpful, not effective and will cause misunderstanding”.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">How can a simple school issue
                      propagate to such a serious case involving the police, from the Violence
                      Against Person Squad?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">“You don’t want to be the first
                      parent to be sued for kids not returning back to school” was the statement
                      Karen said to me in my previous meeting. The school’s principal has also
                      reiterated on this.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Hmm… food for thought…</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Reviewing from past experiences,
                      where there are huge disparities between statements made (especially those of
                      the school’s principal) and a lack of transparency in communication (no meeting
                      minutes after meetings, questions and requests were left unresponded to), I
                      would like to ask if it is possible to take this straight to court to settle
                      this issue.</p>

              <p>Mdm Tan,</p>
              <p>"</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">In Singapore, it is the law for our 
              children to attend primary school under the Compulsory Education Act. In
               order to homeschool, we need to seek permission from the ministry of 
              Education (MOE) to be exempted from this Act. However, our homeschoolers
               will need to sit for the PSLE the year they turn 12.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">For Singaporean homeschoolers, there are
               two critical aggregate scores we need to clear. One is the benchmark 
              which is set at the lower 33rd percentile of that year's cohort scoring.
               Failing to meet the benchmark will see the homeschooler re-sit the exam
               in the following year/s until he or she passes the benchmark OR turns 
              15 yrs of age, which ever comes first.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The other critical score would be the 
              fail aggregate. (I don't even know what that score is...) If the 
              homeschooler outright fails the PSLE, the MOE will revoke the permission
               to homeschool and the child will be placed in a public school to 
              prepare for the PSLE."</p>

              <p>Her case is very clear cut.</p>
              <p>This mother does not know the proper way/channel to homeschool her child.</p>
              <p>Withholding education is a form of child abuse.</p>
              <p>Her child did not sit for PSLE, that's why the authorities got involved again.</p>

              <p>Well, you cite school issues a few times...</p>
              <p>If you believed your child is being bullied, then you could change school if you believe the current school does not do anything...</p>
              <p>If you believed your child is being framed by teaching staffs then you could raise the matters to MOE...</p>
              <p>If you believed your child has some problem and needs to receive special attention then you could try sending her to a special school...</p>

              <p>i totally agree with fireice - parent have problem and need special attention !!!! call police !!!</p>
              <p>parent - seem to think that their children have problem - and need special treatment - without proper medical or official documents.<br><br>Parent paranoid - insist the school make special arrangement which would have been unfair to other students. End up denied her child of the needed education !!! - call police !!!</p>

              <p>Dear madm Tan,</p>
              <p>Your writing skill is super, however you did not tell us what are the ''' school issue''.</p>
              <p>In your lengthly explaination of your ''dire situation'', you're telling us everybody and everything else is wrong, except you. The school is wrong for causing the ''school issue'', the school principle is wrong, the CEU is wrong and the police is wrong, etc, etc, etc.</p>
              <p>I remembered when I was in primary 3-4 I was bullied by my mat classmates all the way when I went into the elite class. (Me old last time no EM3 such thing.) Even in pri 5-6 elitie, I got dispecised by my form teacher. However, I still got straight As with 3 stars for my PSLE.</p>
              <p>You get what I trying to say? Let your child go thru the ''school of hard knocks''. She will get stronger in the process. Staying at home will not help her develop her interacting skill.</p>
              <p>Send her back to school pls for god sake.</p>

              <p>Agree with Laksa Seehum..</p>
              <p>Mdm Tan,</p>
              <p>Send your kid back to school.. Whatever disagreement you have with school or the edu system here, you are using your kid's education and her future as a gambling chip against whatever people you have problem with. At the end, your kid is the greatest loser because you fail as a parent! She had no formal education since Pri 4, from what you describe....</p>

              <p>Actually after reading this topic a bit more.. I am more concerned would agree with other forumers that the parent needs some kind of help or attention. The story does not seem right even though it does not tell the complete picture of the problem... She said no contact for 5 years! At Pri 4 had problems, kid left school and homeschool. That is about 10 years old, at 12 called for PSLE and did not put kid back in school, didn't take PSLE... now 15 years old, still no PSLE. She should be in secondary, sec 3 now! So, there had been contacts made!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If police report was made, then it must have been contacts made and something serious was discovered. Or the kid or parent cannot be found!! Something is really very wrong and maybe its true the kid needs protection? Of all things, from the parent? Child protection is a big matter. The recent case of Sweden detaining a foreigner from Malaysia for beating their kids is one example. For people who think we need to be very "advanced" like Sweden or Finland, I think they are just selective when they criticise our system. Maybe in Sweden, this case the arrest already done rather than just police want to talk and chat and drink tea...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But truly, Mdm Tan, whether you are desparate, in "dire situation", you are not telling the complete picture.. maybe you are not lying but just didn't really tell everything correctly. Maybe you suddenly use this sgforum to try to justify yourself and like the forumer earlier said, to show that every one else the school, MOE, police is wrong... The way your story is that does not look like the case...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe you have already "robbed" you kid of basic primary school education if you don't do something now, whether to you it is the right thing or not. Thats why police is called? Hope you take the advice given from forumers. But expect your kid to have problems going back to Pri 6 at 15 years old. Pri 6 if you had properly schooled her at home. If not, Pri 4? She will have a lot of other emotion issues to deal with among lots younger kids... But, this is your fault really!! I don't know how you will explain to her when she become an adult why you didn't give her the education she deserve and how she should later take care of her own kids education... good luck there!</p>
