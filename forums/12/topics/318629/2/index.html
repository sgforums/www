Encouragement becomes pointless at this stage. You need to smack sense into him. As in, get harsh and give it to him in the face. Too much sympathy and encouragement will only make him more dependant on external forces to keep him alive. He needs to develop his own will power and reason to live and try to be happy.</p></div>

              <p><br> I used to have the same mentality, thinking that 'immature' people
              deserves more scoldings than help. I even felt disgusted at those
              schooling teens posting on Aunt Agony dying or whatever over bgr
              problems when instead, all of us know that there are much bigger
              and important things in this world to worry about. Wars, injustice,
              disasters, etc.</p>
              <p>But later I came to realise that I've been through that phase
              before...spent the whole year emo-ing because of a girl, among
              other lame 'problems'. So I guess everyone needs to learn how to
              grow up, and there's no harm trying to help these people see the
              world outside of their own.</p>
              <p>After all, if such people really do something foolish at the end
              of the day, don't we as part of the society have a role in it?
              Besides, who define 'maturity'? For all we know, mankind could be
              the most immature animal on earth.</p>

              <p>I've got this friend whom I don't actually know very well. We attended the same JC, but had only been very casual friend, saying 'hi' when we met each other on the way, some simple conversation now and then. In fact, after leaving JC, we've never met each other again, much less talk to each other.</p>
              <p>But I do read his blog. Soon after entering JC, he was enlisted into the army (like me). He seemed to be very depressed in the army. He obviously missed his school life very much too (who don't, actually?) .These few months he kept talking about 'wanting to die' and wanting to 'fall deeper and deeper into darkness without getting up'.</p>
              <p>The sad thing is, there isn't much comments on his blog encouraging him. I always thought he was quite a popular student when he was in JC, but well, despite all his emo entries on his blog, nobody actually seemed to be advising him or encouraging him on his tagboard.</p>
              <p>With so much being said, I'm actually quite worried about him even though we don't really know each other that well. How can I help him?</p>
              <p>I guess I should at least give him some encouragement or inspirational advice, but I don't know how to. I doubt a sucidal person would actually be interested in listerning to big, chim and long philosophical speeches.</p>
              <p>Come to think of it, who don't face hard time in the army? I too, is quite tired of my military life, but no way am I going to allow myself to sink into darkness, much less be suicidal. Lol...a sad guy trying to help a sadder guy.</p>

              <p>Start encouraging him  by commenting on his blog. Just identify yourself as an ex-schoolmate and drop a message once in a while. It may make a difference in his life for him to know that someone else in this world understands what he is going through.</p>
