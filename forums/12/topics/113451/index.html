            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Sorry to hear of your situation, but its very normal for all relationships - the fire will die down, but the important thing is to keep the flame alive and not let it die completely.<br><br>I find that spending time away together in a different environment helps.  I don't know how old you are, but from personal experience, going for a short trip helps.  Doesn't have to be an expensive or extravagant.....just some beach resort in Malaysia (important: south of Penang hor?) will do.  You're lucky in the sense that you can take advantage of the many holidays which are imminent.<br><br>Whatever you do to keep your relationship alive should be done willingly and not seen as a chore.  If you feel that its really troublesome and find it a big chore trying to fan the flames, then maybe the relationship is not worth saving (sorry).<br><br></div>

There are many who could never earn up to $6K a month and they are still surviving well.<br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Pray do tell me how you judge the quantity of love in your relationship? You took your honeymoon period as a basis of how much love was? And now that all was calm and you felt that love was gone?<br><br>Passion may suffer a little dip, but certainly not love.<br><br>Love always evolve, because as time moves and our expectation changes, everything would be different. The kind of love she has, has transformed into security and future planning and not the kind of lovey-dopey thingy you two had years back. In fact, only conscious effort would allow you to upkeep such passion in relationship - but as you have mentioned, the relationship has been running rather smoothly and uneventfully, and causes this conscious effort to wane gradually. Painfully true - only lessons and obstruction are remembered and worked on.<br><br>In CloUdiSm, under Love Eco-Cycle, every relationship will strike a peak where growth is at its least. Our first step into every relationship is to try and lengthen the stage of Honeymoon and drag as much during the second stage of Growth. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We must grow with our relationship and not expect our relationship to move as a separate entity.</strong> </span><br><br>Do not let fear discourage you.<br><br>In fact, serve it as a motivation and time to work onto your relationship.<br><br>Nothing is dead until declared.<br><br><strong>Fight </strong>for your relationship and strive to improve. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Start taking her out for dinner, and do all sorts of romantic stuffs. But do remember to keep her in anticipation at all times. Anticipation will generate more attraction a woman will feel towards you. Slowly, take your time, this is a process, not a wave of a magic wand!<br><br>What do I mean by keeping her in anticipation?<br><br>Simple. Take for instance, if it comes to the part when you are about to kiss her, try this - Lean forward until your lips are so close to touching hers, pause for a few seconds, then pull away, and finally, wait for a couple of seconds more before moving in again to kiss. Get the picture?<br><br>Hold on, I didn't ask, "Get the Logic?".

Often than not, some people would fail to realise (as in your case?) that love grows into different stages... Rather than only 'worshipping' your love and glorifying it alone (which would only create a form of delusion on how love of yours should be judged), you should also note the change in various needs and requirements in a relationship...<br><br>I suspect both of you could be young if not relatively immature in the handling of your relationship.<br><br>Commitment is not the only thing which would keep a relationship going, though often it's an important if not essential factor.<br><br>Try not to of things like 'how to make her hug me more' and such... It's really quite pointless... If she loves you, she'll naturally hug you more and such if that's her way of expressing her love for you..<br><br>Appreciate her... Teach her how to love and share this relationship meaningfully with you AFTER you've learnt how to yourself...<br><br>Take some time to read through Yun's post... Though I feel that it's not really 'complete' but it's really quite a good post...</div>
