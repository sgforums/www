You have taken the first step to helping the relationship by reflecting upon it.  There is no quick solution, as each relationship is unique.<br><br>Feeling lost is definitely an uncomfortable feeling but it is also an indication that something do not work, not right.  Knowing what causes the feeling may help you derive an solution to your problem.  It takes 2 to start a relationship, it also takes 2 to solve their problems together.<br><br>Where expectations are concerned, sometimes we get frustrated and confused because what happens in real life are so drastically different from our ideals, what we thought it to be.  It may be a good idea to share with each other what are each of your expectations.<br><br>Do not stay on the relationship for the sake of staying.  Stay in the relationship because both parties would want to move the relationship forward.... pace it at a speed both are comfortable.<br></span></div>

Not about the maintainence a relationship, not about taking... And not even only about giving....<br><br>Sorry, gotta go....</div>

The LOVE that it produces NURTURE and SUBSTAIN itself.... Just LOVE her, don't worry about whether you're giving enough to her... That just COMES NATURALLY, when you're TRULY IN LOVE with her.... And when you LOVE her that much... Her LOVE for you should just comes in proportional too, THOUGH not 'DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL'.... That's when LOVE would grow on its own and exist for the sake of its existence.... If that's not the case, worry not too...? It just means that the time is not ripe or it's not meant to be.... Why worry and see so far into the future, when in fact, there may not even be a <span style="font-style: italic;">future...?</span><br><br>With that, I wish you LUCK...?</div>
