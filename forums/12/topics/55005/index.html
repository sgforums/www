            <div class='col-md body'>Make things short and sweet... sometimes people NEVER appreciate the things they have until they lost it. Many people in here belongs to the category of 'Been there, Done that'.<br><br>Off hand from your post, I can't tell exactly the reason for flaring over small issues were becoz you indeed wanted to test her.. but what I can tell you is temper is self contained and controlled. <strong><span style="color: blue;">Anger is one word short of Danger.</span></strong> if you realise<br><br>More likely you're unable to contain your anger with her not becoz you wanna test her, it's more of you knowing she'll be there for you, hence subconsciously you're trying to push the limit. It's the case of taking her for granted.<br><br>Well, every action results in equal and opposite reaction. The opposite reaction is that her bubble burst, she no longer wants to be treated the way you did to her previously hence the break up.<br><br>If you think by showering her with gifts can make her return to you, you're giving her 'assurance' through the gifts, wanting to buy some form of love back via this method, then I think chances are sooner or later she'll treat you as a 'carrot head'. Of coz nothing is absolute. You mentioned you know she's not the sort to make use of you to buy gifts, still I won't suggest you take chances. Personally speaking, probably your ex is not the sort to do that, but always remember that another form of influence exists in friends. What if her close friend/buddy suggested to her on having sweet revenge.. and one of that will mean asking you to buy things for her, knowing that now both you and her takes on opposite roles compared to that before the breakoff?<br><br>If you indeed want to win her back, it'll be through sincerity, patience and hard work.. not merely gifts. You don't own a mountain full of gold where you can send miners to exvacate the gold everytime you run out of money..<br><br>I hope you understand what I'm trying to tell you...<br><br>Cheerz..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you're right i used to take her for granted. and that's why each time i disappointed her.<br><br>now, i only want to give her the best i can give and show her that i still care for her and love her deeply. not because i want her back. but cos i want her happy. if one day she become a materialistic sort of girl, she will no longer be the girl i love. and i will never regret giving her whatever i gave, cos at the time i gave, she is worth it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Once bitten twice shy<br>People may even think twice before commiting to another r/s with another guy, needless to say with the same guy that hurt her in the first place... U definitely have to show her that you are worth her commitment once again... material needs are not what the girl wants you to be able to fulfil... most of the time they want you to be there when they needed you, emotional support in other words. Be patient since she dont find your calls being a nuisance, means there is still chances. Do really change for her, and not change just to get her back and revert to the old self once she is back...<br>Good luck pal... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

UNLESS she is willing to give you another chance - she wouldn't be moved at all. You mentioned that the both of you broke up already....<br><br>Do you actually think that buying 6100, paying for clothes all that does really help? Acting like a bf to her without any emotional attachment involve - she would likely to think that you treat her better as a friend and probably its would be better for the both of you this way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If you want to win her back - do not show change because you fear of losing her. This has form but <strong>lack substance </strong>- date her out one day and talk things out. Trust me, its useless having to do such things unless you enlighten yourself from within and the changes you made becomes a norm. If not, such changes will only be an illusion - things will revert back to the original state when you both patched again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Nothing can escape talking things out - you have to date her out and reveal your thoughts and feelings to her. Don't ask her to see the changes you have made - seek for chance and see if its possible.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P:S: Update me if things happen.
