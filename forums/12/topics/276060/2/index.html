            <div class='col-md body'>My tip is not to be too abrupt. Drop her some obvious hints to let her be mentally prepared. Otherwise you'll scare her off if she doesn't like you. You can give her gifts once in a while, message her good morning/night, show that you're interested. If she responses positively you know you stand a good chance. As for the big day to ask the question, sincerity is all that counts!<br><br>Good luck! =)</div>

I felt he is protecting me, like he is the only one that i should love. And that nice charming smell of hugo boss for men perfume just take my breath away.
