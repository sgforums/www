Just eat at MacDonald and drink at Kopitiam.  In the first place, I do not fancy him much, but after few outing, out of the sudden i feel the love while standing in front of him in the middle of a crowded lift at Takashimaya, he put his hand infront of me, i thot he was going to molest me, but instead he placed it so steadily just below at my slim belly without much touching, it just to protect me against other peoples around, i lean back on him and feel so warm, he smelled my sweet long rose dye hair, luckily I just washed my hair. I felt he is protecting me, like he is the only one that i should love. And that nice charming smell of hugo boss for men perfume just take my breath away. No word was said even till we reach our floor we still remain as it is and never go out of the lift, then I turn, and he said, "I love you, Angel"<br><br>So u see, it take a special time and occasion to announce your love for someone.

Then one day, a boy bought me a big diamond ring, wow! i so happy, and then he said, i love you my Angel, and i said, yes yes, i love you too.<br>Btw, in the end, we also parted, because I love the diamond more than him. And my love was mend for the diamond.<br><br>Then, there was another guy, just out of NS, we go out a few times, he never touch me, just hv dinners and movies, he is a poor guy, so i dun want to chop him so much. Just eat at MacDonald and drink at Kopitiam.  In the first place, I do not fancy him much, but after few outing, out of the sudden i feel the love while standing in front of him in the middle of a crowded lift at Takashimaya, he put his hand infront of me, i thot he was going to molest me, but instead he placed it so steadily just below at my slim belly without much touching, it just to protect me against other peoples around, i lean back on him and feel so warm, he smelled my sweet long rose dye hair, luckily I just washed my hair. I felt he is protecting me, like he is the only one that i should love. And that nice charming smell of hugo boss for men perfume just take my breath away. No word was said even till we reach our floor we still remain as it is and never go out of the lift, then I turn, and he said, "I love you, Angel"<br><br>So u see, it take a special time and occasion to announce your love for someone. Pick that moment, if will give us girls alot of affection to fall in Love at the right moment.<br><br></div></blockquote>I saw a lot of documentary show saying that smell does plays a huge role in relationship.<br><br>Can I ask you something? If that day he wasn't using Hugo Boss, will you still fall in love with him? Is the smell the deciding factor when you say 'Yes' to him?</div>

He just said "i love you, Angel"<br><br>And yes, I was quite taken away by the perfume, therefore i should said at that moment, i fell in love with Hugo. And maybe he fell in love with my head and shoulder shampoo.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>And please, dun use cheap cheap perfume hor, the odour is terrible, yet with all those sweat, eeeeee..... Run...<br><br>So, it is important to groom oneself before proposing to or dating a gal, tho you may felt why needed to, because impression last. Go for men grooming, facial, pedicure, manicure, tummy trimming, hair styling, right clothing and perfume.<br>It help in getting the girl you want. It show to the girl  that you are sincere, respect her and good to be near.<br><br>Unless your gf is ah lian or ah hua, then all the above do not apply.</div>
