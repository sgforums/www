Even if the person who picked it up wanted to return it, theres nothing much he/she can do coz no particulars are known to him/her. Chances are at the terminal's lost and found. Dont worry so much. I mean you cant blame others for losing stuffs so get over it and save up and buy another one and be mor ecareful next time. About the works inside the camera, you would better do something about it quick, dont let a lost camera drag you down on your sch work.<br><br>Anyway i still hope your camera returns one way or another.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

But life is like that, you have to learn how to live with this set back.  You have to learn from this lesson (be extra careful and take extra precaution especially when you are in a hurry).<br><br>Be prepared for the worst, ie you will never get to see your camera again.<br><br>Now, think forward about what camera to buy for yourself, the same brand and model or another one?  where to get funding?  when are you going to buy?  where are you going to buy?<br><br>I pray that miracle will happen and the good hearted one who picks up your camera will try to return it to you.<br></div>

Even if the person who picked it up wanted to return it, theres nothing much he/she can do coz no particulars are known to him/her. Chances are at the terminal's lost and found. Dont worry so much. I mean you cant blame others for losing stuffs so get over it and save up and buy another one and be mor ecareful next time. About the works inside the camera, you would better do something about it quick, dont let a lost camera drag you down on your sch work.<br><br>Anyway i still hope your camera returns one way or another.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>Just to share that I lost my hp when in the airport waiting for my united flight.<br>I did not realised it until when onboard the plane where they announced to switch off all electronic devices. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>When back from my trip 1 week later, I discovered that it was found by someone in the terminal and call the lost and found company bak2u.
