            <div class='col-md body'>hey RAW.<br><br>sine u asked for experiences, u got it.<br><br>when i am attached i don't get suspicious easily. as u know, i got done by unfaithfulness. i guess my trusting nature might have been my downfall, since i chose to overlook many of the clues that might have been there. it's not that i saw them and ignored them, it's that i probably convinced myself sub-consciously that it was nothing.<br><br>of course until one fine day when something happened and it was just to damn obvious. that's when hell broke lose, and well she and i survived to tell another story today.<br><br>the point here is a LINE. where do u draw the line that the signs and clues speak with a substantive voice? u can choose to ignore them if it doesn't cross the line, or voice it out (i yelled till sore throat btw! ahahha) if the line is crossed.<br><br>hope that helps~ sorry to hear that this uncertainty is happening.<br><br>another point, sometimes in a reln it's not wat one KNOWS... it's wat one BELIEVES.<br><br>i BELIEVED that she was true to me all the way, until of course the water broke, and then i BELIEVED that she was screwing him behind my back (even tho she claimed she wasn't).<br><br>who cares wat the truth is? it's wat the victim believes. so i will always remember, never to do anything that leads the other party to believe otherwise.<br><br>a very obvious example, you're attached and u go stay at a "korkor's" place. even tho u didn't do anything with him since he's ur "korkor" but what for raise ur bf's suspicions? hope u get wat i mean.<br><br>take care RAWie~~!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

She din ask him for it, so he din bother to rtn either. I din believe him coz he hasnt been contacting them. His last gf was ard 10mths back! The rest? Few yrs back also. Suspicious I was but calm (I'm not tt kind of GF who screams &amp; shouts. I like to talk, discuss &amp; solve problems), so I told him to give me the pouch which contained 2 sanitary pads, shampoo/conditioner, disposable panties, White Musk spray fr Body Shop but he said better not, he'll ask if she still wanted them.

Give him the benefit of the doubt like jeremy has mention, and until you caught him red-handed, just trust him (relation is based on trust isn't it?)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>One thing I would like to point out: you mentioned that it was his invitation from him to you to his house. If he was something real fishy, you think he wouldn't be intelligent enough to know that such items should be kept somewhere real secret?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>See that's why the possibility is almost unlimited - forget about investigating further like a detective on crime - it will only hurt the relation and brew discord. But always keep a cautious eye around - that's for sure.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: I am sure if this was something real fishy - anytime within next 3 months, you should be able to see the picture clearer.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

All those you mention was past.. You are in a r/s for only 4 months.. how well can you understand him?? SOme people can have their r/s for years.. and yet they jus can't understand each other well.. I dun see what's wrong in here...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>He inivite you to his house.. and of cos.. if he meant to hide all this to arouse your suspicious.. Firstly he wont even ask you to go over to his place.. Secondly... if he knows you are coming over.. he should have kept all those in a secret compartment and lock it...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You say he wasn't on his guard.. I think probably.. he jus dun bother abt the things he had... He had the library book with him and how long was it?? Recently or sometime ago?? Its not surprised for him to go to a library and borrow books.. Maybe at that time he was so curious about "horror stuffs". All these might happen before he knows you..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Bolster and VCDs might be last time his ex-gf bought to his house.. left it there and never take it back. jus like the Pouch! Or it maybe his younger siblings bother him to buy those stuffs?? This i'm not sure.. Cos dunno he's only child or he's the youngest...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>As for the pouch.. whatever that contains inside doesn't matter.. Already said that it belongs to her ex-gf.. Definitely.. those stuffs inside are meant for lady's use!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Fishy?? YOu afraid of what?? Afraid that he might turn to be a Gay? OR a Bi? If you are scared.. ask him to call her about the pouch she left..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Don't be too sensitive over things.. Some things are not meant to be from what you sees... You say you ain't those girls who would scream, shout or pick-up a fight out of the blue.. But however.. you  seems to have no confidence in yourself.. and think too much of such unnecessary things! Build up your confidence level.. Have faith and trust in him! Have a good talk with him.. Tell him about your sensitivity.. Honesty is what you wan!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Rawie, real GLAD that you're still STRONG and surviving....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Whatever you've mentioned is NOT enough to CONCLUDE that your bf is CHEATING on you... HOWEVER, it does bring to quite a level of SUSPICION... I can see that we have quite some differing opinions from the people in here, I'm gonna give you some INSIGHTS which I hope would really help you... PERSONAL FAVOR... As a friend..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>1st of all, we talk about YOUR SUSPICIONS... Not GROUNDLESS, not enough to CLOSE the CASE... But the FACT that it's enough for you to POST it this here shows something... It should REALLY QUITE BOTHER you...? 2 possibilities..? He's GUILTY, he's NOT.... As Joho had mentioned, it's quite UNLIKELY that you're gonna PRETEND that NOTHING ever happened at all.... Guilty or not, these QUESTION MARKs would no doubt <strong>cause a CRACK</strong> in your relationship... Short-term or otherwise....<br><br>2nd thing... You BINGO on something... From the 'LIMITED information' I know of you and your bf...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  He's a <strong>LOUSY LIAR</strong>... And yes, it's quite likely that he's a FLIRT (pls that is not enough to condemn him... It just rise the chances A LITTLE...).... BASED on this FACT, further questioning him (meaningful ones please...) is very likely to lead to FURTHER 'discoveries' IF he CHEATS on you....<br><br>BONUSES... When ya questioned about the stuffs ya found in his room, did you CONSOLIDATE the 'evidences' and asked him OR did you asked him about the things SEPARATELY...? How did he responded to you...? (in particular his expression...?) Did he mentioned anything ADDITIONAL about the items..? In particular the HORROR STORY book(s?) and cartoon VCDs....<br><br>This is ADDITIONAL... I normally won't really recommend this UNLESS things get WAY OUT OF HANDS... And in your CASE, it's somehow an 'OPEN ASSESSMENT'... &lt;- Cos you've already asked him about the things and send him an 'ON GUARD' signal.... This is what I'll recommend.... REMEMBER the title(s) of the horror books and the VCDs.... The cartoon VCDs... Are they DIFFERENT cartoon characters or a SERIAL about a particular CARTOON CHACRACTER... IF it's about a PARTICULAR cartoon character, that character MIGHT be your 'saviour' and probably chances are his IDOL.... Was those RENTAL VCDs or BOUGHT...? Read through the story books and contents of the VCD... Then it's QUIZ for him AFTER he returned the library books... But BEFORE that, REMEMBER to ask him HOW he liked the VCDs and books... Just to ensure that he've finished the items and it's a FAIR TEST....?<br><br>Some questions of INTEREST for me...? If you would be so kind to entertain me...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  What's his job nature...? He surfs the internet..? ICQ? IRC...? Oh yeah... By the way, NEXT TIME ya found a pounch like the one you've mentioned.... Leave your OWN BRAND of sanitary pad behind as a SOUVENIOR...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>~Good luck babe, anything just MSG me...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

IF it's about a PARTICULAR cartoon character, that character MIGHT be your 'saviour' and probably chances are his IDOL.... Was those RENTAL VCDs or BOUGHT...?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SunRisE:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi reallieRAW,<br><br>What are you suspicious about?? All those you mention was past.. You are in a r/s for only 4 months.. how well can you understand him?? SOme people can have their r/s for years.. and yet they jus can't understand each other well.. I dun see what's wrong in here...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>He inivite you to his house.. and of cos.. if he meant to hide all this to arouse your suspicious.. Firstly he wont even ask you to go over to his place.. Secondly... if he knows you are coming over.. he should have kept all those in a secret compartment and lock it...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You say he wasn't on his guard.. I think probably.. he jus dun bother abt the things he had... He had the library book with him and how long was it?? Recently or sometime ago?? Its not surprised for him to go to a library and borrow books.. Maybe at that time he was so curious about "horror stuffs". All these might happen before he knows you..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Bolster and VCDs might be last time his ex-gf bought to his house.. left it there and never take it back. jus like the Pouch! Or it maybe his younger siblings bother him to buy those stuffs?? This i'm not sure.. Cos dunno he's only child or he's the youngest...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>As for the pouch.. whatever that contains inside doesn't matter.. Already said that it belongs to her ex-gf.. Definitely.. those stuffs inside are meant for lady's use!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Fishy?? YOu afraid of what?? Afraid that he might turn to be a Gay? OR a Bi? If you are scared.. ask him to call her about the pouch she left..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Don't be too sensitive over things.. Some things are not meant to be from what you sees... You say you ain't those girls who would scream, shout or pick-up a fight out of the blue.. But however.. you  seems to have no confidence in yourself.. and think too much of such unnecessary things! Build up your confidence level.. Have faith and trust in him! Have a good talk with him.. Tell him about your sensitivity.. Honesty is what you wan!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>Thks man.......your points have been helpful but you seem to have missed out my replies earlier on which I explained some of your qns &amp; I'm too lazy to repeat leh...refer back ok? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Thank you Terima Kesih A-ri-ga-to Xie Xie Thanx....Muak muak...keke <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a guy so I'll speak from a guy's instinct and view.<br>Leave him! ur bf is cheating on u like a runaway train headed for alabama.<br>Check his hp la!(DEMAND IT!)<br>Check his icq msgs(pretend to use his pc for some work or stuff).<br>After u find out he has been cheating(which he definitely has), take revenge! Nothing beats sweet revenge on playboys and 2 timers.<br>Methods of revenge:-<br>1) Sabotage his pc by PERMANENTLY deleting some critical system or work related files(a guy's pc is one of his most precious things-trust me)<br>2) Take money from his wallet(I'd like to think of it as compensation)<br>3) SPEAD the word that he is 2 timing u but make it look piiful for u.<br>Tell all ur friends and his friends and all those in the forum. A photo would be nice.<br>4) After all that has been done, make a big scene and slap him REAL HARD then leave him forever!<br><br>If I can come up wif more I'll let u noe.<br>REMEMBER, DON'T BE SOFTHEARTED! He will make use of it to make u forgive him!!! LEAVE HIM AND NEVER THINK OF HIM AGAIN.<br><br>Trust me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
