            <div class='col-md body'>Well, 4 mths is really at the beginning of a r/s. If you gonna marry him and lets say you got about 40 years ahead of you, that's 4/ (12 x 40) = 0.83%. If you can't trust him now, what are you gonna do in the next 99.17% of your life with him?<br><br>Anyway, if you are still keen to "test water", try asking him about the stories for the horror book and VCD cartoons. If he aren't sure, he haben seen them. So it is up to you to guess who did.<br><br>However, if it is me, I would rather choose to trust, and throw away my worries. It is not healthly for an r/s to have so many suspicions. But hey, what do I know, I am a guy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>girls by nature tend to be paranoid about everything their bf does regardless of whether it is practical or not.<br>I must admit that i do sometimes suspect plenty of stupid things.<br>Well..i suppose being over sensitive or being over suspicious will only cause harm to your relationship. Well i learnt it the hard way so i'm sharing wif u as an outsider point of view.<br>Men in majority are born to be a very practical kind of spieces..they are not emotional creatures like we women.<br>Still keeping the pouch that his ex gf gave could be the reason that the pouch is still usable and not spoilt so y waste it..use it till it is spoil. For women, we might tink "dont tell me he still misses his ex" If he is unsure about being with u..den y is he with u??<br>So dont be a paranoid...@ timeS<br>CHEERS!</div>
