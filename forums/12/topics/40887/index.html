It was his invitation so perhaps bcoz of this, it was possible that he wasnt on his guard &amp; led me to the discovery of <span style="color: blue;">a library book abt horror stuffs </span><span style="color: red;">(that is not him, he doesnt go library, not to mention borrow a book there &amp; reads. All he knows is his Xbox)</span>, <span style="color: blue;">a small bolster pink in colour, with an Olive-Popeye's GF </span><span style="color: red;">(he doesnt like girlie stuffs, not to mention in shocking pink)</span>, some <span style="color: blue;">cartoon VCDs </span><span style="color: red;">(i never know that he enjoys cartoons &amp; bother to spend $$$ on them besides his games)</span> &amp; <span style="color: blue;">pouch packed with woman's stuffs</span>.<br><br>For the above items, he told me that he borrowed the book from library &amp; he reads horror books. Unbelievable. HE bought the bolster coz it looked cute. Cute? Ridiculous! Somemore in pink! i left out to ask him abt VCDs. Then the pouch belonged to his ex-gf. She din ask him for it, so he din bother to rtn either. I din believe him coz he hasnt been contacting them. His last gf was ard 10mths back! The rest? Few yrs back also. Suspicious I was but calm (I'm not tt kind of GF who screams &amp; shouts. I like to talk, discuss &amp; solve problems), so I told him to give me the pouch which contained 2 sanitary pads, shampoo/conditioner, disposable panties, White Musk spray fr Body Shop but he said better not, he'll ask if she still wanted them. Fishy.<br><br>How abt it? Am I too suspicious? I hope I am coz I've yet to hear from him abt what he'll have to say abt my suspicion  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div></blockquote>reali fishy...... if it belong to his ex....... n all were so long liao.....<br>he nv bother to return neither they ask from him......<br>y bother to ask now if she still wan them..... he wan ask would have ask earlier...... no need to wait until now after u say u wan it rite???<br>mayb someone will come n take back, but not his ex.......<br>r u thinking wat i'm thinking???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
