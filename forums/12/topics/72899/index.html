Life suxs as it is....get a hobby u like, get some company or set a near goal to work towards to. It'll make your everyday something to look forward to.<br><br>There'll be times like this in our life whereby we wonder what and where do we fit in in this part of the world. Answer is... we're nothing, the world still moves w/o you, your friends and family still carries on even if you're not around. Years down the road, your name will be forgotten, you're just another grain of sand on the beach.<br><br>Do what you like, follow your heart, dun let your surroundings affect you. We're nothing in this world, so we come 1st, others can wait.</div>
