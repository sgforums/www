            <div class='col-md body'>Feeling stressed or pressurised is part and parcel<br>of life. Stress or pressure can help us avoid<br>dangerous situations. It makes us alert, and gives<br>us the motivation to deal with problems that come<br>our way. However, if the stress or pressure<br>becomes too much to bear, it can interfere with<br>our everyday lives. Such disruptions can have a<br>devastating impact on our physical and emotional<br>health.<br><br>Pressures children face in school<br><br>One type of pressure is the pressure to perform.<br>Even before starting formal education, some<br>children are already enrolled in pre-school. There<br>they are taught subjects such as languages,<br>arithmetic, science and technology. It is a good<br>thing for them to start learning early in life.<br>However, it is another matter if the main focus is<br>on getting results, or getting ahead of others.<br><br>Another kind of pressure is the pressure to<br>reform. We should be constantly seeking to<br>improve. Special Assistance Plan (SAP) schools,<br>the Gifted Programme, independent schools, Primary<br>4 Streaming and the Integrated Programme are some<br>of the educational schemes that we are aware of.<br>All these programmes are good, but they can be too<br>daunting for some.<br><br>The pressure to conform can be another kind of<br>pressure at school. It is not about wearing the<br>same uniform, which is essential for<br>nation-building. It is about succumbing to<br>pressure from peers, and about picking up habits<br>like smoking or engaging in illegal and immoral<br>activities.<br><br>Signs of stress in children<br><br>Your child is under stress if he or she<br>consistently:<br>withdraws from activities he or she<br>previously enjoyed<br>suffers from insomnia or chronic headaches<br>has a sudden change in behaviour or displays<br>mood swings<br>suffers from bouts of low self-esteem and<br>depression<br>is not trusting and has feelings of not<br>being wanted or loved<br>refuses to go to school<br>indulges in drugs, smoking and drinking<br><br>Ways parents can help<br><br>Here are some useful tips for parents:<br><br>Be sensitive to their feelings and tell them<br>that you recognise they have a problem.<br>Let them express their feelings.<br>Encourage and praise them when they do well.<br>Encourage them to share their troubles or<br>worries with you or<br>their friends.<br>Create a loving environment and show signs<br>of affection.<br>Have realistic expectations of your child.<br>Get them to try out a new hobby or sport to<br>de-stress.<br><br>Get them to talk to their counsellors in school if<br>they have difficulty confiding in you. They are<br>there to help students deal with their worries.<br>Encourage your children not to keep their worries<br>or pressures to themselves<br><br><strong>- Courtesy of Singapore Health Promotion Board</strong></div>
