              <p>Wonder if anyone ever thought of being born/ reincarnated as the opposite gender....</p>
              <p>For me sometimes I wonder what it's like to be a girl...</p>
              <p>I think it's quite good and nice...</p>
              <p>Girls seem to be more....in touch with their emotions, kind, stable, gentle...</p>
              <p>More moral.....less agressive....</p>
              <p>Hmm...what else...</p>
              <p>More in touch with beauty, fashion, astethic arrangement like interior arrangement, flower arrangement, etc....</p>
              <p>They can maintain their beauty with 1001 hair styles....1001 clothes, accessories, make-up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Socially I think they are better too....less stressed in society, viewed more kindly, represent warmth, gentleness, kindness.....and also they have better social skills....they can talk and relate to more people, pleasant and nice and unthreatening, and can make friends quickly....</p>
              <p>They also have more talents in linguistics and literature....</p>
              <p>Hmm...what else...</p>
              <p>Ya....some more things but I cant think of them now...</p>
              <p>If I cant be a female, then I wish I can go back to a little boy.</p>
              <p>Anyway, how about you?</p>

              <p>anyway, being a woman is not exactly as good as what you think, first, we have to endure the discrimination by men, especially sgmen, secondly, we have to endure the pain in giving birth to babies, third, the life of woman is only fun from teenagers to about 30 yo, after that, men hardly notice you, and most will call you aunty, then by late 40s, u get menopause, no more fun in sex, whereas our opposite partner, the male is still happily going on with their sex life..they are term as men no pause.</p>

              <p><br>sg men where got discriminate? Sg gals are protected by unfair gender laws that r biased against the weaker gender. And they get the same opportunities in workplaces like equal promotion chances and welfare.</p>
              <p>SG gals are better off than most asian countries' gals. For instance, in Japan, they wont get the same chances as guys in their careers.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, we have org such as AWARE to 'protect' u gals.</p>

              <p>No, Im not gay.</p>
              <p>Like women definitely.</p>
              <p>But I understand different people think and feel differently, and gender plays a big part in it.</p>
              <p>Age and life stages also play big parts, but that is another story.</p>
              <p>I just think that my opposite gender has several advantages, which I think I will never attain.</p>
              <p>Like the things I mentioned above.</p>
              <p>Mmm...maybe I can add a few more things....</p>
              <p>They pay more attention to details.....and can enjoy chocolate and food better.....enjoy shopping....enjoy smells/ aromas/ parfumes better.....can connect more with children.....</p>
              <p>And if they are sad, or have problems, lots of people will sympathize and help them...</p>
              <p>Lots of things.....</p>
              <p>It's fascinating.....I wont ever be able to be a female....nor do I wish to have an operation....but the the only times I can enter a woman's mind is when I read the literary works of a female writer, and I think they are special and different.</p>
              <p>I'd like to ask if anyone of you have ever wanted to be a different gender? Or maybe the wording is not very accurate......fascinated by the different gender.....and envy them or their advantages.....</p>

              <p>You see how many lines of your thinking revolves around sex.</p>
              <p>Life is not all about sex.</p>
              <p>There is a reason why I also covet to go back as a little boy.</p>
              <p>Because as a little boy, my life is not interfered by sex-related things.</p>
              <p>Nothing wrong if you as a woman get older and you lose "sex appeal" , you will just gain motherly appeal, and then grandma appeal.</p>
              <p>It's still interesting and nice.</p>

              <p>anyway, being a woman is not exactly as good as what you think, first, we have to endure the discrimination by men, especially sgmen, secondly, we have to endure the pain in giving birth to babies, third, the life of woman is only fun from teenagers to about 30 yo, after that, men hardly notice you, and most will call you aunty, then by late 40s, u get menopause, no more fun in sex, whereas our opposite partner, the male is still happily going on with their sex life..they are term as men no pause.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So before u go for a sex change, think probably hor, this is not the same as getting a citizenship </p>
