              <p>yup, ego problem... guess it's inevitable for a guy.</p>

              <p>you have some bit of inferiority complex and it will stay because it is a character trait, especially so for guys, unfortunately nothing can change it. I bet ALL of us has abit of that, unless you are a monk who has gained enlightenment from the worldly affairs.</p>

              <p>I know it's wrong to have these kind of thoughts but sometimes cant help but feel my gf is too good for me to deserve her. Feel a constant motivation to improve myself and when I sleep or bum I feel guilty cos she's a super busy undergraduate with community work, part-time tutoring plus taking music and tennis lessons but she very enthu about meeting like 3 or 4 times a week...<span style="color: #ff0000;">can see her deep eye bags everyday.</span></p>

              <p><br>Then u shall propose meeting her near her home or at her convenient. Maybe even paying cab fare for her after yr dating to squeeze more resting time for her.</p>

              <p>If u start to do more things that benefit her and make her feel love, yr 'I don't deserve u' mentality will rapidly fade away....</p>
