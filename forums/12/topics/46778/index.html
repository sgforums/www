What can you lose since you are at the <strong>begining phrase </strong>without even knowing her personally? You ain't attached, you knew nothing about her, etc - its like you are playing Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and you are now at the 1000 bucks question - you win or lose, you still get the 1000 bucks - might as well do a good planning on how to approach her and DO IT.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: You will regret if you waste too much time and learn about things that is disappointing. Do something useful and show your sincerely in wanting to know her - do not, I repeat, do NOT appear to be too fake and ambigious.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

And tot it will never happen again..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>But now God is giving you a second chance.. You met her again!! She doesn't recognise you is a good thing.. From here you can even start a conversation and not like the old time method "Hello, Can we be friends?" Oh man!! That is the lousiest quote i ever heard.. hahhaa *no offense*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Since now you know where she's working.. You should grab your opportuinity to go get to know better.. You can approached by asking "Do you still remember me?" You did that already.. But the next thing.. pls don't ask whether can be friends anot... Talk to her first.. communicate with her.. Once she feels comfortable with you.. Eventually you don't even have to ask to be friends anot.. You both are friends liao..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Talk to her like a long lost friend.. REmember DOn't Scare Away! Cos girls are always sensitive to such situations... They know you are up to something.. Be it to be friends or wat.. They will protect themselves from it.. In order to break this barrier inbetween.. Let her know that jus wanna be friends.. and not be cos you wanna get her!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Don't say verbally.. but body language.. Actions speak louder than words right? Once a while walked pass her shop.. If she's in there jus smile and walked away.. since you already approached her and talked to her b4.. Don't let her think that you are some kind of stalker or wat.. As time goes by.. you step in and have a chat with her..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Don't purposely everyday go down jus to see her.. She might get irritated.. or pissed off! All the best to you!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>CheerS!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
