              This is going to be long, please bear with me.
              
              It all started a few years ago, when my mother's younger brother(my uncle) ran into financial difficulty following losses in soccer betting. He approached my parents for a loan and to help him apply for a credit card under my dad's name. The money amounted to 10k. My dad was reluctant initially but my mom persuaded him to, they were siblings after all, she felt she had to help. 
              
              Along the years my mother brought up the issue of payment to him several times, only to be replied with, "i'll pay you back when i have the money". He didnt pay back. His false claims of having no money was accompanied by his extravagant spending. Every new year, his daughters would have the latest handphones and mp3s, branded clothes and all. In addition, his daughter boasted that she had a cash-online card given to her by her dad.  My mom would ask him "you said you had no money but there you are, living such an extravagant lifestyle, giving ur daughter a debit card, he replied,"my money, none of your business"(wo de qian bu guan ni de shi).
              
              Fast forward to this year, my parents are having financial difficulties themselves. Their business is not doing well and my father owes the bank money. They would always quarrel and we had to sell the car and send the maid home. Because of this my mother has tried to asked him about the money, he would get irritated and aggressive over the phone, saying that even if he had the money he wouldnt pay her back. He believed that my family was well to do and it was our obligation to give him the money. Our families have not met for the past 2 chinese new year. My mom would give red packets to her sister to pass it to his kids. He has never once rejected the red packets, gladly taking it, with no red packets given by him whatsoever.
              
              I've seen my mother crying alone in the living room on countless occassions, crying over the loss of a brother and over what she thought initially was a well meaning gesture to help her brother tide over trouble times, has instead serve to distance them to the point of losing their family ties. My dad on the other hand does not want to contact him, saying that he is resigned to never seeing the money again. As the eldest son, i feel helpless seeing my parents struggle to make a living, my mom's a fruit shop operator, and my dad is getting on with his years. They have to scrimp and save to put their kids through school. I'm 19 this year. And i want to help them get the money back. I plan to head over to my uncle's place one night(havent been there in like 5-6years) and have a talk with him. I know this is not right, as a chinese saying goes, "let the adults handle the matter, kids shouldnt interfere". I have thought about going over and beating the shit out of him but its not right, hes my elder after all. I want to go over without my parents knowledge and have a amicable talk with him, explaining my parent's situation. And hoping that he would have a conscience and return the money. I would love to hear your feedbacks on this. Thanks for taking the time to read this. If you are familiar with the law, and there are any avenues to claim it back. please tell me.

              One. It is indeed none of your business to go talk to your uncle and whatever.
              
              Two. If you so go over to talk/beat/beg your uncle without your parents knowledge, you are committing the act of creating conflicts within your own family members.
              
              Three. Your mother cried over her own foolishness.  Your father accepted that foolishness and does not wish to pursue the matter.  They are in no dire need of your uncle at the moment except for havign to tighten their belts and provide you and your family members a decent home and future.  Its not a emergency yet for your uncle to show family spirit.  Arent you jumping the gun here?
              
              Four. Its only 10k.  Your future can bring in 10k a month easily. Think about it.

              <p>Val,</p>
              <p>Viciouskitty is right.</p>
              <p>Why throw your future away for 10K ?</p>
              <p>Yes, we understand you feel very betrayed by your uncle.</p>
              <p>But you must understand that, the reason why your family is in financial difficulties has nothing to do with loaning your uncle the 10K.</p>
              <p>Why not you tell yourself .. when you make it big, you will throw another 10K at your uncle's face the next time he comes begging.</p>

              <p>pity ur mum who's sandwiched btwn all the problems u stated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as a son, u can show ur support by being a good boy and focus on what u shld be doing (studies?). if you think u can handle it, try to take up some part time work to support urself financially and relieve ur parents of the burden of having to give u pocket $$$?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>really no point for you as a junior to speak to an elder, dont care whether u're 19 or 29. u'll put ur mum in greater difficulty if u do dat coz ur b*stard unker may even kaopeh to ur mum &amp; add more strain to her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for the legal avenue, it's a lengthy &amp; costly process. for $10k, worth it or not? i think take $10k as a lesson learnt bah. to learn how ungrateful some people can be and never be like them. more impt is to move on and focus on improving ur own family conditions. let ur mum &amp; dad know u've grown up &amp; care for the family and are supporting them in sensible ways, not add to their already estranged relationships with that idiot and financial woes.</p>

              <p>it's ONLY 10k..? seriously leh.. they are owing the bank money and have to sell car and stuff, every bit helps and this is one big bit man..</p>
              <p>and does the amount even come into play here? you owe money, you pay money la.. 10bucks or 10k, u want to borrow without the mentality of returning, u are robbing and stealing liao..</p>
              <p>somebody come up to u and give u one tight slap, u going to say suan le la let's go..? at the very least slap back then go away right?</p>
              <p>to TS, he has decided to play the game of "cut-ties and act blur", then u just play his game with him.. seriously.. the next time u see him, BLATANTLY suan him upside down with insults.. lets just put it this way.. u are NOT going to get the money back.. so just take it that u spent 10k buying a slave for u to insult..</p>
              <p>i beg to differ with what viciouskitty has said..</p>
              <p>a person who hasn't the least bit of shame to return the money then will not suddenly see u so chee cham den come and return u the money one.. he has already shunned TS's family for two years.. take angbao dun give back.. lanjiao whey oso come out already...(wo de qian bu guan ni de shi).. all the signs are there already.. u dun have to be a multi-millionaire to give angbaos back to the relative who gave u..</p>
              <p>if u cant get back ur material wealth, make the best out of it..</p>
