            <div class='col-md body'>ok long time haven been posting...guess i am pretti lost in my world.<br><br>since i grad...i went for an operation on my kidney...then started working..in a family run printing coy...stay there for 5mths...decide to move on as i don wanna be stuck in a family run biz.<br><br>went on to join a clothing industry...as i got interest in clothes...but in the end this coy is also a family run biz...even it is a big coy...with family members holding all key positions...<br>b4 joining this coy, during the interview, i told the HR tat i leaving my previous coy cos is a family run biz...thus she didnt wanna tell me tat this coy is also family run.<br>the nature of this job is very administrative. not my type of tea.<br><br>now i am outstationed in brunei for mths...and worse there is no package. and by the time i back in sg in july...i be in my current coy for 5mths.<br>i feel like 2 wks b4 i return to sg, send out resumes and when i am back, i can go for interviews.<br><br>now i am considering teaching and joining banks either in the call centre or as a personal financial planner / personal banker. I understand that these jobs req shift work, wkends and even targets...but i am prepared as I am more of a sales person and enjoy customers service more. (all my part time job when i was studying is more into service / retail industry, and my previous job is also account servicing)<br><br>cos i understand tat my current coy is "stingy" and does not give expat package when stationed oversea. turnover is high here...and politics is extreme.<br><br>i do not wan to quit w/o a job as wat i did previously.<br>yet i don wanna stay too long.<br>I am afraid tat coy may not even consider me or grant me an interview if they think i am a job hopper from my resume. moreover i do not have enuff experience but yet i wan to join a different industry...<br><br>previously i did apply for all local bank jobs b4...but failed...nevertheless i still wanna try again. I am not sure if banks will consider my applications again for the 3rd time. I didnt know wat i wan then when i first go for the interviews back then. so i admit i screw up during the interviews.<br><br>however usually for the jobs in the banks....they will wan ppl with banking industry experience...but for the post of call centre or bankers, they do consider fresh grads. However i don think i can still consider myself a fresh grad.<br><br>really lost. heard from my HR manager and anohter friend...tat they feel that upon graduation, try out diff jobs till u find the one u like for the 1st 2 yrs.<br><br>but problem i grad in dec 2004. and now is 2006. so i left abt 6mths...and really i doubt i am still consider a fresh grad.<br><br>the reason i took some time to get a job...becous i went for an kidney operation in jan and only feel better around march. then when i quit my 1st job..i spend 4mth searching (and also went on a tour) and found my current job.<br><br>i have friends who told me to fake my resume for my 1st job...make it look longer...and also got friends told me not to put in my 2nd job as i am not really doing any constructive stuff in my current work. some told me to state tat i am helping my family biz.<br><br>kindly advise...i am really lost.<br><br>ps: sorry for this lengthy post, &amp; for not typing this post in a orderly manner...as i am doing it right now during the office hrs. so just wanna quickly post it out...as i think i going bersek soon............<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are not a fresh grad. The interviewer will note your graduation date and probably notice that you had short (&gt;6 month) stints at each position. The best way to defuse this is to give a good explanation in the interview. Never make the mistake of excessively bad mouthing your old companies. Nothing turns an interviewer off faster than a whiner.<br><br>Have a story prepared that shows your enthusiasm, saying something like "I was approached for the second position and I decided that I wanted face new challenges etc (lie if you must but make it seem like you were moving up, not laterally)." Then brush the matter of leaving the second job by stating how "fascinated you are by the banking industry" .<br><br>Make sure u're up memorable in the interview, cause a good impression will forgive alot of things on your resume. This is all assuming of course, that you qualify for an interview even if its just on the phone.<br><br>By the way, theres a big difference from woking in a call center and being a personal financial manager. You might want to focus on whichever one is more suited for your current experience and resume.<br><br>Good luck on your job hunt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok another point....<br><br>I previosuly in the past did apply to banks, but was unable to pass the interviews. I did apply for the position again say abt 1/2 years later but was not called up. so Should i apply for banks again...i will say this is my 3rd attempt.<br><br>thus will like to know does Banks actually have the data and monitor the "rejected candidates" should they apply again?<br>i like to know my chances...<br><br>of course I have heard of friends of other industry, tat they didnt pass the interview but when they apply again..they managed to pass the interview andgetteh job for the next round.<br><br>so really...i am cluess to why didnt the bank call me up the 2nd time when i apply again. does tat means i got no more chances with banks???<br></div>
