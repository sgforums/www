              <p>I believe it can work out if both parties trust each other and are willing to commit extra efforts to maintain the relationship (eg. girl returns to SG every semester break and guy spends most of his time with her each time she returns, and both keep in contact with each other regularly). The question is, are both parties willing to spend that amount of effort to make sure the relationship lasts?</p>

              <p>Just a personal experience~~</p>
              <p>Four years ago, I was supposed to go to the States for my uni studies; it's something I have always wanted, especially I can do my fave course i.e. Psychology. But, I just started a relationship at that time, so obviously my bf wasn't too keen on me going. As the due date for entry drew nearer and I am still in Singapore, I knew that I would be staying after all. There were no quarrels whatsoever, my bf only replied me one sentence, "If you go to the States for studies, the day you left is the day this relationship ends".</p>
              <p>My dad offered to go to the States with me to get the enrolment done before the dateline, but I didn't reply him, though he asked me repeatedly for days. Ultimately, I didn't go. I didn't check out how my parents felt, because plainly, I don't have the courage.</p>
              <p>My bf wasn't appreciative at that time and felt it was 'li suo dang ran' that I should stay. I took up Finance for my uni here; but it sure wasn't a course I love.</p>
              <p>Up till today, I am still wondering how things would have turned out if I have really left that time. Up till today, I still do have this regret of not going. Especially when Finance is just not my passion.</p>
              <p>My bf wasn't the type to try out a long distance relationship; neither is he able to take such things.</p>
              <p>Ironically, two years back his buddy wanted to go to Aust to further his studies after having save up the funds while working for a few years. His gf wasn't keen on maintaining a long term relationship either. My bf stood up for his buddy and ask me to persuade the gf to 'allow' his buddy to go. Frankly, I didn't persuade, because I don't have the right to, I gave up my trip for him!</p>
              <p>Ultimately, the gf relented after repeated assurance by the bf, and now, they are maintaining the relationship via long distance. Distance does make the heart fonder from what I see from them.</p>
              <p>Actually, put it more plainly, it's not hard for the one who's here, it's actually harder for the one who's leaving; because the one who's leaving is leaving all the family, friends and loved ones behind to go to a foreign land; having to adapt all over again.  </p>
              <p>It may not be easy to maintain a long distance relationship; but if you don't try, you'll never know. If end of it all, everything turns out well, congrats. If things dun turn out well, be optimistic, at least you both tried.</p>
