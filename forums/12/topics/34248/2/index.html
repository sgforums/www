            <div class='col-md body'>to be honest. i did sneak a puff or two and she caught me several times. but it happened several months ago and ever since after that i have been a good boy coz i learnt to treasure her a lot more after those incidents. btw i've been smoking for more than 10 yrs liao. kinda hardcore.<br>i say again! i did not do anything else. all of my free and available time and effort was invested in her. wanted to spend more time with her before i leave.<br>now is that she said she's tired of all the quarrels and dun want it anymore and she no longer feels the same as the time when we started hence she wanted to end. i've clarified with her that i did not give her any attitude, although i may be pissed off but i kept quiet. hoping in time she will realise that she was too insenitive towards my feelings. but she still hanged on to her idea.<br>rationally thinking am i rite to say that no couple in this world will live those lovey-dovey days from day 1 to the end of thier lives? i tried explaining to her that it is normal for us to hit the peak and cool down but it will be up to us to keep the flame alive. it is only i went abroad things started to go up and down. i am confused. i dunno wat she's thinking and wat she wants is hurting me real bad. she confessed this is the first real relationship she's really happy about. even dissussed through our future plans liao.<br>i really want to know what is going on. what can i do to salvage this situation? she'll always give me this reply she dunno, feeling gone liao. she dun find the need for it liao. blah blah.<br>although 1yr + is not a really long time but enuff for me to sort out my thinking and wanna really tone down my happy-go-lucky attitude and face the real world. tot she sorted out her thinking too but i was wrong and i dunno the reason for it. she's the kind that fears lonliness. the reason why i called her everyday juz so that she will not feel that lonely and to let her know that i have never left her out of my life.<br>every part of me began to rot away never felt this much pain. past relationships was never this bad.</div>

But maybe you are giving her too much pressure on your side. It is not that I saying you are wrong. You may harbour good intention but maybe your way of expressing your point is not right? You had to undrestand that it is hard for someone who is alreadys so addited to something like acohol to quit whenever they one. MAybe she is already trying but she keep hearing you pressuring her. She can be demorlaised in the process and thus give up trying and throw her temper. Maybe you should at least try to understand why she don't want to quit. I don't know if I'm saying it right, cos i don't really undrestand your stituation.<br><br>Don't try to say break up easily.....at least not until you are sure thats the last restore to solve the problem. Think of why you want her to be your GF in the 1st place. There must be something nice in her that you are so attracted to that you are willing to torlorate her other short points and start a relationship with her.</div>
