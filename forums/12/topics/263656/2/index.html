" (Since you two are best friends, maybe you know better what excuse is good. (read her palm? do your homework... google)<br><br>If she lets you, then hold on to it...<br><br>BTW please don't assume too much... from your posts it looks like you tend to jump to conclusions... and think of the worse possible outcomes automatically.... why like that?</div></blockquote>i dunno...maybe i m pessimistic...i always like to emo over her..think a lot.haizi dunno where i stand</div>
