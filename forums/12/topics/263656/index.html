Try to be as casual as possible. Like for a start, you just take her hand and pretend like you are looking at something on it.<br><br>If she pulls back in disgust or shock... say: "Wait let me see... " (Since you two are best friends, maybe you know better what excuse is good. (read her palm? do your homework... google)<br><br>If she lets you, then hold on to it...<br><br>BTW please don't assume too much... from your posts it looks like you tend to jump to conclusions... and think of the worse possible outcomes automatically.... why like that?</div>
