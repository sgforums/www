              <p>1. Asking for help requires courtesy. Or at least some small talk... Your friend was rude in demanding your help.</p>
              <p>2. Whether u wan to accept her apology or not is up to u. Other ppl say yes then u will do it meh ? </p>
              <p>3. Since she has made queries with you before, she probably oledy thinks u r free labor. Or mobile GV queries. Or whatever. You let yourself be taken for granted, shouldnt that set u thinking ?</p>
              <p>4. So instead of answering her on how you feel, you "threaten" her with a public thread. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>does she do that often? like when she needs help she seems to contact you whereas other than that she doesn't contact you?</p>
              <p>if that's the case, i feel that you should go talk to her properly about this issue. Because if you are close friends, at least try to sort things out. no one is perfect. i'm sure even though you felt that her behaviour towards you is unacceptable, she might have on the other hand thought that " hey since we are friends what's the harm of helping me out "</p>
              <p>That is one possibility because we as humans tend not to judge ourselves properly.</p>
              <p>However if i were in ur shoes, i'll definitely think that she was rather rude. Having her own emotional problems is one issue, and talking in a more polite manner is another issue. She shouldn't have shown attitude to you simply like that.</p>
              <p>Yet, i agree that <strong>twists </strong>pointed out you were childish in behaving quite rashly over this matter. Didn't it occur to you that u should have at least msged her and asked " Why what happened? What's wrong with you"  I'm sure a much more understanding friend would have done that.</p>

              MmM... I was prepared to get flamed when i posted this thread anyways.
                      
              Anyways, first off sorry for the long post. But i've already tried to shorten it. =(
                      
              Let me answer some general questions thou. (some quoting myself)
                      
              @club18 : After thinking and reading thru(after i cooled my head), 
              i do agree with you that i should not have said that. 
              Thing is, that was the last straw for me.
                      
              @Cz : Thanks for your honest answer =)
                      
              @Ferret : wow, that's alot of questions from you. 
              True, the final decision is up to me 
              but i'd at least like to hear what people think about it 
              and to see if i'm really as what she said 
              "you only concern about how you urself would feel 
              but you never think about why ppl dun want to answer tat question lo"
              Haha, perhaps you are right about me letting myself being taken for granted. 
              I guess i do have an issue of "how to reject people" =X sigh~
              And with regards to your last point, I think my first post has already pointed it out. 
              And with this reply, i've more or less answered you. 
              But if you feel that i'm actually threatening her, then i cant do anything can i? =)
              Lastly, everyone have issues of their own dont they? And i do admit that i have mine.
              Peace~
                      
              @wilsonhao : True, accepting the apology is one thing, but remaining as friends is another. 
              I do doubt that i'll remain as friends with her after this. The most we will be is as acquaintances. 
              She has done quite a number of things that has made me unhappy in just a few months. 
              But i doubt she knows that. =)
                      
              @Daisuke-kun : Haha, sorry about it. To forgive is one thing, to forget is another.
                      
              @4794 : ok, this reply shocked me. And i'll say that i do not like this girl.
              But i used to treat her as a close friend.
                      
              @twists : First of, i do not surf sgforums before this. 
              I used to surf it a few years back when there was only a few boards 
              and not like now being flooded with hundreds of boards. 
              &gt;.&lt; Childish? perhaps. But, i'm getting some where at least.
                      
              @j_dsowner : Thanks for your reply. It really made me think. =) 
              Well, to quote you "we as humans tend not to judge ourselves properly."
              That's one big flaw with me. Judging myself is what i do worst. =(
              I guess my anger got the best of me at that point of time. 
              (and hence the time lapse from my replies, of coz it's also because i was working =x)
              Problem is, with all her smses i have no time to cool down.
              Even my colleage beside me was wondering what happened. Once again, thanks alot for your reply. 
                      
              @FirePig : Uh Huh? your point being?
                      
              @Miss Tiny : MmM, a small problem you say. To you perhaps. 
              To me, it's not just because she's not replying my question OR using me as what Ferret said "mobile GV queries".
              It's more like, does she even treat me as a friend kind of thing 
              or simply just using me and pushing me aside when she has no use of me. 
              And to your next post, i have my reasons of not saying who she is in this forums. 
              I'm just basically using this forum as a means to bring some points across. 
              I'm not saying that you have guessed correctly or wrongly, 
              but please do edit the nick out. thanks tons.
                      
              @joshua182 : eh... lol i dont really understand your first part thou i have some assumptions. 
              No i do not know what movie she watched. 
              Just told her the movies that was on for the period of time she told me to look out for.
                      
              @Bellini &amp; magical_wen : I'm glad i'm still young at heart.
                      
              @Fireice &amp; Y_Shun : Use orginal nick? You mean you can have clones in sgforums and not get banned? 
              Cool, first forum that i came across that allows clones. 
              Please show me the prove that i'm a clone. EVEN if you are the president of SG. 
              As long as i am not doing anything wrong, i am not afraid of you. 
              And as above, i'm glad i'm still young at heart. =)
                  
                  
              ---- edit ----
                  
              Once again, sorry for the long post. =x Didnt expect so many replies.

              <p>I think<strong> you are in the wrong, ts</strong> and the <strong>girl isnt in the wrong at all</strong>.</p>
              <p>First you told her you are at work. But girls are always very persistent and she asked whether you can help her to go to gv.com.sg. You could have rejected her but <strong>you said OK</strong>. Having said okay means you wanted to help her with no conditions attached. She is not treating you like a maid because she asked whether you wanted to help her or not and you agreed to help.</p>
              <p>As for her not answering your questions, well <strong>she is not obliged to do so</strong>. She could be busy, blurred or simply do not wish to answer your answer. Anyway, she did say thank you even though there really isnt a need to for such a trivial stuff.</p>
              <p>Next, <strong>you actually have the cheek to scold her</strong> "i'm not your personal servant or slave. You can forget abt contacting me ever again." She even said sorry to you lol. <strong>Does she have any backbone?</strong> If i were her, i would just replied "ok, I never treat you tat way lo you want to think wat whatever you want lo i have a clear conscience lo" and never bothered to talk, sms to you again.</p>

              @FirePig: And here we go again with the "girls" vs "boys"? And personally, from your reply, i would love to be a "friend" with you. Can just call you up and ask you for help and when you ask for it, i can just say no. =) But seriously, i doubt you will want people to treat you as such would you? And for your questions.
              
              A1) What do you understand by "I am working"? Do you know what is work ethics? I would help without asking why if i'm in front of my desk. But i'm not, am at someone else's desk trying to trouble shoot some problems. Thankfully, the person was leaving when she called.
              
              A2) I'm unsure as to why you would want to know if i am a male or female, i'm quite sure you would have guessed it from my nick? So i guess i need not answer your question.
              
              A3) What has being married got to do with this? mmm... But for your record, i am not married.
              
              LoL, feels like being questioned by the police. O wait, you were from the police. ;)

              <p>Well well, this alone doesn't prove she's just making use of you. Maybe you can provide more examples of how she treated you in the same way as this.</p>
              <p>If based on this example alone, I see no reason why you have to make a mountain out of a molehill.</p>
