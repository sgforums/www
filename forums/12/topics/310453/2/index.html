              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>I think you are in the wrong. Here's how I looked at it:</p>
              <p>1. You had mentioned that you are at work and so I do not think anyone can help it except to be abrupt with the tel. conv.</p>
              <p>2. Your question about whether is she at work - is quite irrelevant and since you had mentioned that you are at work and the tone might have been like you cannot be on the phone for long - she then has the right to be abrupt (not rude) in ending the call. To me, I felt that question could be answered later i.e. an sms/ call later/ meet up. I felt that you might have been put off by her abrupt manner. Mind you she wasn't rude in her entire phone conversation. You had a wrong perception here and hence you are sore. Correct me if I m wrong.</p>
              <p>3. Then came your sms. I think your start of the sms is telling me that you are crossed and sored about the whole episode earlier. So again, I felt that you are like a sore loser here. Again, let me repeat that u had mentioned that you were at work. If I am in her shoes, I would have done the same thing as well after I had gotten the info I wanted.</p>
              <p>4. However, I felt that she could at least add a remark saying: I will explain later, as I had taken too much of your time, thank you and bye. I think if she had said this - you would have felt better and the sms could have been avoided. Well, you see I think here is the problem with our communication nowadays - "Choice of words." So, in this area let us give n take, for I am sure as you have mentioned that she is on the down side (emotional problems) and you should have been more gentlemanly in forgiving her lack of tact and choice of words. Please be mindful that she had said Thank you - as mentioned repeatedly in your post. Some people just feel that saying thanks is sufficient namely your g/f here.</p>
              <p>5. I can sense that she feels equally bad too, having to take much of your time in checking the shows and show times. I believe it could have taken a considerable time. Also, if she is using a cellphone then all the more abrupt for airtime is costly and you know how women are with these bills right?</p>
              <p>6. I felt that she did come to her senses a bit at the end by taking the initiative to apologize to you. I do not think for her rudeness and/or taking u for a servant but rather your time off work and her choice of words. And she cares about you to do so. Again, I felt you should have apologized first for your insensitive remarks.</p>
              <p>I felt that you should not have let this escalated to this stage and I am sure you did not exercise give and take here, well enough. Also, since you know that she is down emotionally lately, such an act from you isn't really helping and gentlemanly of you. I cannot help but say that you had let your emotions got the better of you here.  <br>How and what you want to do with your r/s here is up to you - no point posting right? Or are you doing this out of malice and an injured ego of yours?</p>
              <p>Cool down and be a gentleman.</p>

              <p>dunno leh. you still want to ask whether you should accept the apology. i think you should ask whether you should apologise for your actions.</p>
              <p>no doubt its rude of her to ignore your questions but nevertheless she did tell you the reason ultimately. is she close to you? if no why the hell you get so worked up for?</p>
