              <p>I have a crush on a girl at school. One day, we went back home by the same bus, I managed to get a conversation with her. She was open and friendly. That day I plan to approach her more often, like going out with her friends more often. However, i also hang out with my own group of friends.</p>
              <p>One day, after school my gang of friends were going out for bowling. But I told them I wanted to follow this girl and her friends for an outing. One of my friends (from my gang) blurted out and said very loud, "I know you only want to follow them because you want to go after her (the girl)". I was so embarassed because he said it so loud that she and her friends could hear what my friend said.</p>
              <p>After that, she began to give me the cold shoulder. Whenever I run into her in the corridor at school, she would purposely go the opposite direction. And then when i hang out with her group of friends, she purposely sat far away from me. When I try to talk to her, she would snub me and not be very friendly.</p>
              <p>Could she be playing hard to get? Or is she rejecting me? I am not sure, please advise.</p>
              <p>I ask one of my friends who is good at courtship, he claims he had a similar situation but he was very persistant. He even stood out in the rain, to woo his girl. He forced himself into the girl's tution, just to court her. So my friend said that she is playing hard to get. But I want to hear from your opinions. Dear Forumers, please help.</p>
              <p><strong> Update: at 2pm</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I forgot to also say that the girl, she is beginning to flirt with other guys. Suddenly I see her so chatty with other guys. That day, after school, she went out with a group of new friends, along with some excited boys for an outing. And she didn't invite me. Is she trying to up the ante? Increasing the competition? </strong></p>

              <p>Right now you give her the opportunity to "pour cold water on your proposal" because of what you friend said. She was embarrased by the remark.</p>
              <p>So just lay off a little bit. A little bit only.</p>
              <p>Wait for rain. And then try again.</p>

              <p>Based on experience and common sense, she is embrassed by the unpleasant event that had taken place. The evidence that you mentioned "<em>purposely sat far away from me</em>" implies a negative notion of wanting similar thing to happnen again and perpectually and conscienciously stay away from you. From what I can observe "<em>she would snub me and not be very friendly</em>" is tells me that she is being defensive and yet unsure how to handle the awakward situation between both of you.</p>
              <p>Suggestion:</p>
              <p>1) Meet up with her in a quiet place, explain to her what has happened i.e. your friend had been rude to her by shouting sensitive things about her.</p>
              <p>2) Offer your apology by saying "<em>hey I am sorry for that incident that happened, I know it might have cause you to be troubled</em>".</p>
              <p>Optional: 3a) Confess to her that you like her and tell her why you like her and how long have you been having a crush on her. At this point, she will experience a mixed reaction of uncertainty and confusion. Persuade her to give you a chance to be in a relationship. [prepare some hand-made gifts i.e. stars, drawings, stuff toys, flowers (girls go crazy over flowers)], all you need to do is to make her feel special and praise her.</p>
              <p>Optional: 3b) Offer a meal as an apologetic gesture. If you feel that the time to confess is not right, you could offer her a meal for being placing her in an awakward situation.</p>
              <p>Outcome: 4a) If she accepts your confession and is willing to be in a relationship with you, you should cherish her. and post back in sgForum to tell us the outcome. However in the case where she rejected your love because she's unprepared or confused, do not force her. Act as if the conversation have not taken place and continue to be good friends. Try again nex time.</p>
              <p><em>Personal experience: I have a soulmate whom confessed to me when I was in sec 5. I rejected her love and pursue the girl that I loved. Now, she have become my soulmate and we read each minds other like open booked. Depend on how you define soulmate, my definition of soulmate is someone who knows what you are thinking without you speaking a word and know your thoughts and mind at a deeper level.</em></p>
              <p>Outcome: 4b) Reaffirmed the friendship. Tell her that in future if you have problems in schoolwork, ask if she is willing to help you. Or if you are the one who is better in schoolwork, offer your help to her during revision. Then wait for the right opportunity and confess again.</p>
