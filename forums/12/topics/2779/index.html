            <div class='col-md body'>I've got this FEELING that both of you are still YOUNG.. But NOPE... Not gonna tell you the young people shouldn't fall in love and should study hard thingy shit.... Just wanna remind you that if both of you are YOUNG, you can have a LONG WAY to go with each other OR perhaps with another man of your choice in the future... He might be too young to handle the relationship now too... Whatever it is, let him know and understand your stand.... Make him UNDERSTAND that mutual respect and understanding is IMPORTANT in a relationship... And he still think (or tell people that) both of you are no longer couple, I think you should let the relationship go.....<br>Another thing to ADD... If both of you are NOT a young couple (especially HIM).... I ADVICE you to give him a SERIOUS THOUGHT... For MOST PROBABLY he don't even know how to THINK...?</div>

But then, if he keep taking u for granted, u b really pitiful, do u know that?  U must pluck up your courage and confront him face to face about the problem u r facing, don't b used by him?

Of course it's NOT as simple as easy as we SPEAK... I used to be a very fickle-minded guy and those 'funny' attachment feelings too before I become a DEVIL.... I don't seems to be able to get rid of anything in my life or clear up my cupboards as all those things I'd just got 'feelings' for.... Sounds FUNNY? Ya... Now I think humans ARE TOO....<br>Anyway, my final words for now would STILL be.... I think you people are still 'young'.... Whatever it is, GLAD that you're single and HAPPY with it...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
