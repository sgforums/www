            <div class='col-md body'>hmm just really confused, jc or poly since if got a choice now. My result isn't very good but i feel like i might not do well if i were to go jc and my As might not even be good enough for me to go uni. If i screw my stuff in jc, i will still be back to square one, noting. If in poly, at least i can still have a specialised skill that i can count back on, perhaps even get a job with the diploma. There might even be a slight percent of going to uni also.<br><br>omg...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My Personal views,it should be better to go to poly,as u can apply what u study there when u work next time.Secondly i am currently in Uni now,some of my peers used to be from JC and find it extremely hard to cope with Uni stuff,likewise i am more adapted to studies from the experience gain in poly.<br>Thirdly some of the Uni offered exemption for poly students,hence those graduated from poly might be able to obtain a degree just by 2 years which result in a reduce of a yr sch fees.(Uni sch fees are super expensive!!!!)NUS n smu has even raise sch fees now,who know what will happened in the furture right.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>See, if you go poly and you decided you're uninterested in the course its no harm changing it at the end of the year. You're still young and such cases happen often in poly. You make feel left behind by 1 year but i tell you, when your 35 years old in a career that uninterests you you'll be feeling even more sorry for not staying back a year to start a new course.</div>
