If u can't take gd care of urself &amp; ur child, don't bother thinking of getting some1 new into ur life. Ur child is ur responsibility, not a burden or obstacle for u to find new love. No 1 noes wat the future holds. If u ever meet some1 in future who is serious abt sharing ur life, she shld noe wat is expected of her role.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi.. No point feeling depress now over love issue now.. What is your priority now? Your kid or to find someone to love you? You got 2 mouths to feed.<br><br>It is definately depressing when there is a divorce and much so later your relationship with a girl ended. All these are back then.. I belief you are still young. Don just sit there and just can't stand back on your own 2 feet.. Go look for a job..<br><br>Girls.. There are many out there still.. Its just fate that you did not get the right one.. You still have your friends.. Be it 1 or 1 million.. they are still your friends whom you can talk to and such.. What about your family members? Don you think you should spend more quality time with them?<br><br>Don't just think about your love life and telling yourself to be depress.. Like i mentioned above, you have 2 mouths to feed.<br><br>Cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by male_1978:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi..<br>I am a divorced guy with a child..after my divorce..i got to know my ex-gf who spent 4 happy years with me..she knew i am a father..yet she was able to be with me for this period of time..recently, we had a huge quarrel as we both had little time together due to our career..<br><br>She initiated the breakup..i was so depressed..that I cant even carry on my job..and recently..quit my job..which pays me well..about 4k a month..now jobless..and my mind..i just cant do anything..<br><br>Even though i know career is more important..i just can't stand the fact that me love is gone from me forever..i did so much for her..and it's just gone..because of her..i don't have many friends with me..maybe 2-3 whom i can talk to..that's all..<br><br>I am now feeling worse than death..no job..no companion..somemore i have to think of my child..i have nowhere to turn to now..i know i shouldnt have quit..but i just cant work anymore..<br><br>can i ask you..especially gals..will you get into a relationship with a guy if you know he has been married before and with a child? if this guy is really sincere in his love to you..and with a career..will you not mind the fact that he got a child? i am really afraid i won't be able to have another companion again..</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi male_1978<br><br>I recently became a father myself and I am suddenly hit with the feeling that I have another burden on my hands. I fully understand how you feel now. Yes having a companion is very important to carry on with life. But in this present society, love alone cannot feed you and your child. Wouldn't it be better to put all your love into your child now? I know its a different kind of love, but just to do it. Think about your child's future, thats more important than anything else now.</div>
