Hope ur not offended.[/b]</blockquote>I'm not offended at all.<br><br>But I'm sure BOTH sexes will agree that it is NOT love when you try to force something upon someone. Whether it is physical or psychological, directly or indirectly.<br><br>I'm sorry if I sound harsh, but if your boyfriend needs to be "forced" to stay with you, then it's not happiness and definitely not love. However, if that's not that case, and he truly wants to be with you and care for you like no other, then you have my heartfelt congratulations and I wish blissful happiness for you and him for the rest of your lives.<br><br>One thing that I wish to tell you is that no one should be indispensable in your life. I would urge you not to crumble should your boyfriend (or anyone else in your life) leave you. I'm not saying that you should not love him with all your heart. I'm saying that your LIFE should not be contigent upon his. It's degrading yourself, and VERY VERY troubling for your guy.</div>

No.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>People who threatened to kill themselves for any relation, deep within them is hidden gnawing inferior that acts like a time bomb. When the catalysis reacts (probably the guy/girl requested for a break), this hidden negative feeling will activate the time bomb.<br><br>Think about this: You can't love anyone, unless you learn to first yourself. (One of the top ten rules in Love). Then if you learn to love yourself, you <strong>wouldn't</strong> threaten to kill yourself because you know how to appreciate yourself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>But when one tries to kill themselves, which means they don't love themselves.
