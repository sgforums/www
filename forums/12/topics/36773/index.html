If u can't control ur emotions and feelings, u would be in a turmoil of emotions and funny thinkings and thoughts like 'killing urself' will enter ur head! U r now in a state in emotional turmoil whereby ur emotions are running high and ur bodily actions are being controlled by ur emotions. Stop that! Sit down, or better ask someone close out to talk about the problem, look at the matter from a logical point of view and not emotional pt of view. The 2 qualities : Emotions &amp; logic: each has its strong factor, but u must know how to balance them and know when to use each one at its fullest or half half. Logically think the problem thru,<br><br>1)why did he break up with u? Lack of communication? Were u able to see this coming? The blow would be greater if u didn't see this coming. Is it his character type to play around with girls? Then u shouldn't be with him in the first place unless thats what u want too.<br><br>2) could the problem also lie with u? Did u all really go into a relationship juz cause of boredom or really there was something and both of u decided to put in effort? The 'there was something' part is the usual thing but the 'put in effort' most of the time isn't present. Most pple dun put in effort in making a relationship becoming stronger. They think love is all about the big demonstrations: Vday, sex, flashy presents etc. When real love is about the small things in life which 2 parties decide to put an effort in, to think about each other, to want to be part of each others life. Most pple do not approach love with such a viewpt and thought and think its juz the 'love at first sight' thing, which sad to say, give abit of time, the fuel runs out.<br><br>3) Talk about this to your close frens and see what viewpts they can't say. Sometimes they can offer valuable insights which u can't see in ur current state of anger, sadness and frustration.<br><br>4) The most important thing now is not to think of 'Why break up with me?' It leads to a state of personal bashing and leads to nothing. Try to draw good conclusions about this bad relationship, learn the lessons so that in your next relationship, watch out for signs and most importantly, go into a relationship for the more appropriate reasons.<br><br>Singlehood is great!</div>

You go go down to his work place during his lunch break or dinner, etc to get the real reasons out of him.<br><br>Secondly, he say you don't understand him - This is so vague. What problem is currently exisiting within this relation? Pour everything here, so I can analysis for you. Or if you prefer to Pte msg.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Guys who when with you and throw in excuses like, don't understand well enough, that sort of reasons - are just giving excuses because they want to break through and free themselves from the cage of relationship. I am 92% sure about this until you release more information.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>*Think about this: If you don't understand him, firstly you both can work things out to solve this wor... because it isn't serious.
