            <div class='col-md body'>If u want to go overseas and study before serving your 2 year term in NS, you'll have to pay a bond. Min fee is SGD$75k unless your parents's combine income per annum is more then that !<br><br>The only way you can go ahead and study 1st without paying any bond is to become a doctor !<br><br>What i would suggest is, serve at least one year 1st. Then tell your unit, be it SAF,SCDF or SPF that you want to go for your studies then come back and serve your remainding term.. better that way !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah.They do get overtime pay you know...<br><br>Anyway, you can enlist, then defer for studies abroad after having served 1 year in NS.If you want to make the best out your NS life, i.e to have a closely matched working environment as in the commercial world, you would need to be a clerk.Only people with medical conditions which prevent them from serving in combat vocations can become service personnel.Do go for a medical checkup, think of it this way, being a clerk , at least you can tell yourself its one year of work experience gained.If you are unlucky enough to end up in a combat vocation, take it as leadership or life experience gained.Me personally, I was like you, wanting to give up my citizenship to siam NS, but NS is not worthy of you giving up your citizenship.There are things I've learnt, especially interpersonal skills and handling diffcult people from all walks of life.Serve and take the money, then do what you want with your life after that.It's your own right.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ns is a good expereince if u ask me cause u know why?...by the time u get out from NS, u have more neuro transmitters in r brain  which enable u to think,talk and work better...Life might be hard inside but t also depends on what unit/vocation u get.....Basically NS is a good training ground for a scenario where u are put at extreme vulnerability,  that  u have  not much control of yourself....Imagine NS is like POW camp some say...U are always afraid of someone catching u for something, getting extras ect........of cos there are some who have negative expereinces in NS which  might  affect their life...eg. iknow of someone who after Ns had a  psychological scar , suffering from paranoia and had a negative outlook in life....But after he went  for counselling, he was fine</div>

SO what if the pay is low and it is 2 years..It will be a training period to train u to be a better person to survive in this society! Don't ever compare NSmen to bangla. We are different.NSmen takes up rifles,artilleries,tanks,pistol and fire fighting equipments...bangla take chankol,broom,hi pressure water jet and drilling machines. Each have their parts and roles to play. Even the bangla who is making contributions to our homeland with very little pay didn't complain, what else for you, who is a true singaporean,wants to complain? Love your land and country.Running away is not the solution to the problem. Since u can run away from NS,how can anyone else expect u to be someone successful next time?

Because I believe the bond is held on to the govt. ie money is kept with the govt and the parents cannot touch it till the bond is released so as to secure a payment. I like to call it the zero coupon bond issued by your parents to the govt which has a full annuity value added to it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just serve yr NS bond. It is a really really good experience and the 2 years would do u more good then harm. For me i feel tt i have matured since coming out of army and learn to treasure life. You tend to be more appreciative of life.

            <div class='col-md body'>don't think NS is juz the army only..we still got civil defence and police..basically wat i feel that why we are asked to serve NS is because the govt wanna emphasis the importance of total defence.
