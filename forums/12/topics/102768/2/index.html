            <div class='col-md body'>Come on guys, for those who think NS is a waste of time, think again. If NS is not made compulsory, who is going to protect our country? We can't rely on allied forces to defence Sg. If Sg doesnt have its own defence forces, do you think we still can sleeping every night with a peace in mind? We be living in fear everyday. You might say, Sg is too small to protect itself. I do not think that way. Sg defence system is not as bad as what you think.<br>To add to what kindaichi83 had said. Why want to leave for other country when Sg is so safe and comfortable to live in.  What makes you think other country is better than Sg? Every guy is Sg has to serve NS. Who doesnt know he can make more money than getting those pathetic NS allowance? You can't compare in that way. Furthermore, the revised allowance is already not so bad.<br>Think of the postive side and long term. 2years is not that long. Its just another stage of our life. You'll start to appreciate once you get over.</div>

However Singapore won't let you lose the citizenship if  you owe them NS time. The government will wait like a trapdoor spider when you re enter and then *BHAM*. That brings me to the second part<br>Should you not return - you cannot land in Changi Airport to make a transit again. You have to fly across to USA or Australia to make it into Malaysia but your plane must never land on Singapore.<br><br>how I know? My building got one ex singaporean security guard who is australian, He placed NS bond (or was it sign something , I cannot remember) for his son to take him to australia where he worked 20 years ago ,when the son was a baby. The son was brought up on australian soil and became an australian citizen but the father and son cannot ever land in Singapore again ( total exile) because both will get arrested and son will be doing mandatory NS.<br></div>

I mean u need soldiers to be born to serve the nation..If u cant address that fundamental issue, then u are getting nowhere<br><br>3)if that army culture of tekan is limited only to training and not at other times...If everyone has a job scope laid down black and white to do and not a regular pushing his job to pathetic NSFs by just exercising his rank authority and a few other issues as well which gave rise to that "NS sucks" syndrome<br><br>4) early education in schools to teach  good values to younger generation  to diffenriate between right and wrong, be humble and forgiving and to treat your fellow humans well in order to be treated well....IMO our singapore education system does not really do that...it place emphasis on selfishness like cultivating a  paper chase culture by differentiating school standards ect.this forces students to be more competitive and in turn more cunning....Apart from creativit,Moral values might take a backseat...<br><br>5)have u wondered why foreigners are more creative, cause they are not bred in a ironfist culture...They had the time to be more creative when in school and ponder about things..The idea here is to cultivate citizens whoo are "thinking" rather than  "roboting"..many creative people like great poets, scientists were from other countries..But have Singapore produced any which u could identify with other than a few exceptions..Everyone here seems to be bred in  that pre-conceived idea _born,  study get degree. work governemnt stable job which is fine  but not getting involved with sociopolitics is a disadvantage...<br><br></div>

We dun have a specific job scope. SAF man management skills also sucks. Maybe its bcoz i compare to the civilian way of doing things... I juz dun like the way they command those low rank NSF to help them to do stuffs, they will use words like, HEY YOU COME HERE etc. Its like calling a dog or something. If one need help from others, this is not the way.</div>
