              <p>I like this girl who is, I guess a rather close friend of mine. She doesn't know about it. Well, reason being she's really really busy with her As recently (never keep in contact, not much) which is why I don't wanna add onto her heavy load, and also we're great as good friends; kinda afraid to ruin all this by having the risk of freakin her out after letting her know.</p>
              <p>To be honest, I don't know how she feels bout me either. Sometimes she really gives me the impression that she likes me, sometimes; well, not at all. Somehow I think it's related to her stress with As and all that CCA stuffs, or? I don't know, sometimes I feel like knowing what's goin on and all. yep, confused bout what she really sees me as.. just hope that we'll be back to normal after all that ends.</p>
              <p>Anyway, her birthday is coming up and I want to come up with a lil surprise. Knowing her she'll probably stay at home to study, though there's a tiny bit of chance that she might go out for a celebrations. Either way, I thought of gettin her a bouquet of her fave flowers and a lil cake with a candle for her to, you know, make her birthday wishes. On top of that a gift, which I haven't thought bout just yet. Bring all those and ring her door bell? *surprise!*</p>
              <p>What do you think? some of my friends say it's a nice idea while some say it would probably back fire. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>You know hor....all these things that you are planning to do for her, has all already been done and over with by all her stalkers and potential rapists.</p>
              <p>Would you like her to treat you like her stalkers and potential rapists?</p>
              <p>If NOT, then make sure you are REALLY her close friend first before you do that kind of stunt on her.</p>
              <p>Not every girls loves a surprise you know, most girls wished some random guys better don't show up at her doorstep to disturb and irritate them further.</p>
              <p>Unless you're Brad Pitt look-alike, then there is a possibility of pulling off that surprise stunt alive. Else, you need to be her close friend and 100% KNOW that she won't mind you showing your face at her doorstep on her birthday, especially on her birthday.</p>

              <p>The idea sure is sweet, but I really dunno what her family will say. Haha, will surely tease and ask plenty of questions about you. Maybe it'll be better to go with a group of friends?</p>

              <p>If you want to make your feelings known, there are better ways then to show up alone at her front door.</p>

              <p>But hey, who am I to talk. Just as long as you don't regret, feel free to try. But do take note A's are coming soon, and a r/s isn't exactly what she'll want to have in mind. Can save the more romentic stuff till after A's. (Yes, this is done by couples, not normal friends)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>yeah, now that most said it. I think it could be too much of a surprise for her to accept, considering we're only good friends. I guess I'll just try my luck askin her out on that day first, if not I'll just get flowers delievered to her instead? How's that sound?</p></div>

              <p>That's the problem with guys huh? Not knowing if she regards me as a good fren or romantic interest. And then deciding to risk frenship by doing something big to express interest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps I may share some tips on how one can deduce romantic interest from girls:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) when u tease her, does she give u the occasional slap on ur arms or shoulder?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) does she laugh a lot when with u?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) when having a conversation face to face over dinner, u sit back...does she lean forward?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) when u grab her hand to cross the road, does she shy away?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I personally never liked the idea of doing something sensational, never worked for me. It may work for others though. I would prefer to go step by step, making one transition to another smooth. If u want to jump the phases when she isn't ready yet, it may backfire. If all your answers to the above are yes, i'd say give it a shot! Cheers and hope it has helped.</p>
