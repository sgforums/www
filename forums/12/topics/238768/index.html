In a rough emotional jerk, you are made aware that is she not as sexually naive as you thought she was.<br><br>Remember the sheer heartpain you went through? The ache you were receiving second-hand goods, if I may put it forth so bluntly?<br><br>I was with her the other night in the middle of some heartland park. We were being sexually active ; she was masturbating me and as she did so, we discussed about our sexual past.<br><br>It was on that night that I confessed to her I wasn't a virgin. In the earlier stages of our relationship I had lied and said I was one.<br><br>She, in turn, too, confessed that she was not as pure as I had imagined. Her ex-boyfriend had insisted on her giving him oral sex and other sexual activities stopping short of copulation. Naturally, being a possessive male, I felt a flash of hot anger. I felt cheated, and though I revealed no outward emotional signs, my mind was in a state of mental anguish.<br><br>That night, I went home and reflected.<br><br>I slowly realized that it wasn't fair for ourselves if I were to suddenly treat her in a different light. We love each other very dearly, and I am not going to compromise that and the trust, comfort and faith we have in each other just because of things that we have had no control over.<br><br>In this way, I had passed the test and now I love her all the more because I have the innate knowledge that I can accept and respect her no matter what her past. I think after this episode we shall share an even closer bond with each other.<br><br>I am glad I had been tested this way.<br><br>So to all my brudder-brudder out there, don't feel cheated if you feel you are getting a beautiful diamond that has lost some of its shine, all the more if you are not a model of purity and chastity yourself.<br><br>My only deep regret is I now do not have the chance to give up my own "V" to her.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

In a rough emotional jerk, you are made aware that is she not as sexually naive as you thought she was.<br><br>Remember the sheer heartpain you went through? The ache you were receiving second-hand goods, if I may put it forth so bluntly?<br><br>I was with her the other night in the middle of some heartland park. We were being sexually active ; she was masturbating me and as she did so, we discussed about our sexual past.<br><br>It was on that night that I confessed to her I wasn't a virgin. In the earlier stages of our relationship I had lied and said I was one.<br><br>She, in turn, too, confessed that she was not as pure as I had imagined. Her ex-boyfriend had insisted on her giving him oral sex and other sexual activities stopping short of copulation. Naturally, being a possessive male, I felt a flash of hot anger. I felt cheated, and though I revealed no outward emotional signs, my mind was in a state of mental anguish.<br><br>That night, I went home and reflected.<br><br>I slowly realized that it wasn't fair for ourselves if I were to suddenly treat her in a different light. We love each other very dearly, and I am not going to compromise that and the trust, comfort and faith we have in each other just because of things that we have had no control over.<br><br>In this way, I had passed the test and now I love her all the more because I have the innate knowledge that I can accept and respect her no matter what her past. I think after this episode we shall share an even closer bond with each other.<br><br>I am glad I had been tested this way.<br><br>So to all my brudder-brudder out there, don't feel cheated if you feel you are getting a beautiful diamond that has lost some of its shine, all the more if you are not a model of purity and chastity yourself.<br><br>My only deep regret is I now do not have the chance to give up my own "V" to her.<br><br>Cheers.</div></blockquote>If you love her, you will be happy for her that she had some good times with another guy. Sxx is important but it is not everything. Why do you regret you did not give you "V" to her? So what if you did? Will your relationship be better? Focus on your relationship with her everyday and use all you intelligence to make it wonderful for the both of you.<br><br>Your regrets and whatever else is in your head, let it stay in your head.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To all non-virgin guys out there:<br>If you are not a virgin yourself, you have NO RIGHT to expect your gf to be a virgin... This is just fair.... Dont be an asshole... Wat about your previous gf whom you have had sex with? Does it mean that no one will want her anymore? All because you took her virginity? Please go and think about it....<br><br>And for all those virgin guys/girls out there... It's all up to the individual whether you mind your other half not being a virgin or not... Sometimes it's just not as simple as "If you love him/her, you wont mind"....</div>
