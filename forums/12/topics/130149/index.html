            <div class='col-md body'>I recently needed to go to Cantonment Police station to make a report. I wanted to take MRT but my dad wanted to send me. He dropped me off in front of the station and went off. He got a traffic fine of $120 and 3 pts for stopping those few seconds. Now he's yelling at me over it saying "i kaypo for police and he got fined".<br><br>To be honest I agree with him but I can't take his yelling anymore. It's really upsetting me. I mean its the principle of it. I was helping the police in their investigations and they can't bend the rules slightly? Whats the point in helping them then?<br><br>He already has 12 pts to his name and I just got my license so its under probhation. I would honestly take the pts if I had the normal 23 pts  but I only got 12 pts maximum. I know but its abit selfish but I don't want to take it. Do you think there;s anything that can be done to waive these 3 pts? Please help me.</div>

Especially if you try it outside a police's territory, it can really be much faster than you can imagine...<br><br>What your dad did was an offence. What the law often does is to separate out issues. If you feel that you shouldn't help them in the 1st place then next time don't? But please don't try stupid things like threats or its similar forms, as they can as easily charge you with hindering with the laws and such if they want?</div>
