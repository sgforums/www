How much U give is NEVER how much U take...<br><br><strong>another thing,<br>1.People that have lots of things didn't know how to cherish,<br>*do u agreed? y?</strong><br><br>Yes... for many. Coz they take it for granted dat dis comes naturally. Only when they lose it will they learn how to cherish.<br><br><strong>2.They can say many many things about cherish and treasure yet  they dun,<br>*do u agreed? y?</strong><br><br>Yes... for most. Its human nature to sae such &amp; forget wat they said. U cant expect 1 to remember &amp; actually comply by it all da time.<br><br><strong>3.Nowadays people take things for granted, people tend to take rather then give,<br>*agreed? y?</strong><br><br>Yes... to a certain degree. Its human desire to take rather than give. U can call it da "7 deadly sins". We cant escape it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><strong>i personally think that they r not selfish but this is actually life,<br>*agreed?.....y?</strong><br><br>Well... I cant ans yes or no in dis case... Lets juz put it dis wae. Diff ppl lead diff life. Some r born wif a silver spoon, some r born a "rat". Wat a rich person have, da poor dun have. BUT wat a rich 1 dun have, da poor 1 have. Some r evil by nature, some r raised evil. Some r good since birth, some r nurtured. U cant sae ppl r selfish all da time, but they r selfish at 1 time. So its hard to sae "dis is life" coz its inate.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br><strong>You can be very considerate to others but they never been considerate for u? after too many times will u get fed up?</strong><br><br>Yes &amp; no.

U see: every second of our lives, we r constantly changing. Not juz physically, but mentally &amp; spiritually too. I may be considerate 1 moment, I may be inconsiderate another. There is no end to it.<br><br>U may tink dat, "I have been good to others. But Y do they treat me otherwise? Wats da point? might as well be them &amp; be inconsiderate?' Chances r, by not practising a value U r closing yrself up. Ppl will never see wat a good person U r &amp; never noe yr virtues. But if U do practise, regardless of da results, ppl ard U will start to realise U &amp; yr values, yr presence &amp; importance. By being considerate, U can oso see a bigger picture in front of U.<br><br>Being considerate to others MAY not have U being repaid in kind. But 1 thing is for sure: being considerate is a virtue. It is a value dat can make us a better person, even if its "hao xin mei hao bao".<br><br>Isnt that wat we wanna be? To be a better person? We r ALL born diff, from diff backgnd, diff culture, diff belief, diff anything else  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> ...<br>But we all born here is a fact &amp; we all have our trials &amp; tribulations, our own personal tests we have to pass. Rich or poor, healthy or not, fit or disabled. We r all da same, existing here for a purpose.<br><br>Being considerate is but 1 of da many virtues. We r ALL learning everydae to further betta ourselves. We shld cherish wat we have but we muz oso learn how to appreciate others. Only then will there be more happiness ard us.<br><br>If we can truely understand wat it means to be a better person OR wat our purpose in life here. I dun tink we even bother life is fair or not, coz life is like a video game: many stages wif difficult obstacles, but we do get our ending, only diff endings &amp; possibilities. I like to tink dat those born rich or beautiful or well built or watsoever r juz "enter da game in easy difficulty" so dat wat ever obstacles they face will be easily dealt wif. (call me an escapist or watever  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )<br><br>Da above r my VIEWS &amp; COMMENTS. It is NOT based on anything or have any scientific proof to back it up. So dun get too pissed or spaced out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
