            <div class='col-md body'>Well hugz, you said what i wanted to say. Another thing i want to add is that, no point being over sensitive to criticism. In the end, you will end up being worried over nothing. Sometimes it is easier to let all the words go one ear in and leave one ear out. There is nothing wrong in being outgoing, in fact it is good, but you must learn to blend in, and at the same time, learn how to be yourself and stand your ground.</div>

The truth would surface one day... You simply can't control how people think... Even if you try some 'manipulative' ways, it'll be too tiring...<br><br>If your friends are really yours to keep, they won't just distant from you... Based on your friendship with them.. Should they trust you? Or judge you based on 1-sided stories and prejudice..? Ultimately... You should still be you... Nothing's gonna change except the way they look at you...</div>
