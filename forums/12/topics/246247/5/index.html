As I say, stand firm, since he not making move just keep trying to drag u into this kind of 'grey area' What for.<br><br>Even he 'touch' your heart, but if he not a good responsible guy, i don't really advice u keep waiting for him.<br><br>Believe me, any guy can 'touch' your heart if you OPEN your heart to them.<br>Is your choice.  Not he touch u but u make yourself get touch by him. e.g. giving him the opportunity to get closer to u, spend more time together.<br><br>As a guy's view, this guy no good. all the reply was try to flirt and keep you by side in case he's lonely and don't get the gal he want.<br><br>I believe you have your own uniqueness and beauty, why bother bout him <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>All the best. as I say, try go have your own life then you will know what i mean <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
