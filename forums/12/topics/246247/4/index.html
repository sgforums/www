If you aren't, what he conveys shouldn't matter. If you're, then make the most of the opportunity - afterall, you only live once...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Last Nite i was invited by him to Zouk.  As his fren is the organiser of the bash.  When we will inside, there are some advances across by him.<br><br>1) He try join me in body dance with me.  Which i dance halfway and i push him away.  Coz he is getting too close to me.<br><br>2) He keep trying to put his arm wrap over me.  Which i wiggle away.<br><br>3) He try to triggle my hand in the dark for a few times, which i act blur and move my hand.<br><br>I think everyone must be very puzzle why i reject all the advance ?<br>Well in my heart i thought it's abit not sincere to hook a gal who you know and some sort of buddy to you.  I will prefer him to tell me he like me or etc.. first then such a advances on me.<br>Well some gals may feel its ok .. but definately not me, coz my pride told me he is not sincere.<br><br>Am i crazy or wat ?  Or am i over-demanding for such treatment ?<br>You guys tell me ?  Tks</div>
