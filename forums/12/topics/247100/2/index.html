I think you have doubts as to whether you can tolerate this kind of love, otherwise you won't be starting this thread. If you think you are content with just this level of love and acceptance with her, then by all means make yourself happy. But if it is really causing you so much anguish, then better to let go now as ultimately it will drive you crazy. If you truly want her for yourself, no way will you be able to tolerate being her stand in only for her to leave the next available option comes along.<br><br>In your case, I say drop it sooner rather than later.</div>

But anything you do, let it be from the heart. It should be something you want to do and not something you should do. Because where relationships are concerned, it's better to be true to the heart. I'm not saying to be selfish, I'm just saying don't over-compromise yourself.<br><br>If you don't feel comfortable being a spare tyre, and it weighs down heavily on you causing an emotional strain and all, then don't. But if you're happy to just be there for her when she needs even though you know she'll leave one day, then so be it. You definite your own happiness.<br><br>Whatever you sacrifice, do it willingly and whole-heartedly, so you don't begrudge yourself later on for not having tried or not being true to your heart. If you care for her, do it out of willingness of your heart. If you deny her, it's because your heart can't bear any more.<br><br>What do you want from this relationship? Her friendship? Her company? Her wholeheartedness (doesn't seem like you'll ever get the last one)?</div>
