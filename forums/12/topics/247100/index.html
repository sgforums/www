We all live in an uncertain world.

(or you decide to leave her) then deal with that moment in the best way you know how...<br><br>hey. in life, things have a way of working themselves out... sooner or later you will find that out... how did you survive for so many years? You will continue to survive for many more years to come and so... might as well enjoy each moment, mindful of the consequences of your actions... and if you can live with the consequences... JUST DO IT!</div>

We all live in an uncertain world.

(or you decide to leave her) then deal with that moment in the best way you know how...<br><br>hey. in life, things have a way of working themselves out... sooner or later you will find that out... how did you survive for so many years? You will continue to survive for many more years to come and so... might as well enjoy each moment, mindful of the consequences of your actions... and if you can live with the consequences... JUST DO IT!</div></blockquote>thanks. i guess im taking the hard and stupid way.<br><br>thanks for all the advice u guys gave me.</div>

Because of the way she treated me isn't how any normal girl would treat a good friend. But I knew exactly how I saw her and where I where I was headed where she was concerned. Basically, I knew I wasn't going to be 'the one' with her.<br><br>My main question to TS is how does he view the lady in question and what kind of future does he expect or anticipate with her?</div>
