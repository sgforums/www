            <div class='col-md body'>1)Who did it?<br>If a rumour is circulating about you, it must have a source, and it is up to you to locate it- and to figure out the motive behind it.<br><br>2) Never confront or attach rivals directly<br>Avoid confrontation. If you confront your rival, he can always deny everything. And you will look like a fool. It is crucial to keep a cool head when under attach. When you react in anger, you allow emotions to cloud your judgment, which will not make you politically savy.Instead, you must keep your calm to explore your tactical options to dispel the rumors indirectly and emerge unscathed.<br><br>3)Where do you stand?<br>Step back and gauge how you are being perceived by your boss and your colleagues. How do you stack up against your opponent in terms of work performance, visibility and political clout?<br>It is strategic to do a worst-case scenario on every disturbing rumour you hear about yourself. Always think: " if this believed to be ture, what is the worst thing that could happen to me?" Then ask:"when should i be doing now?"<br><br>4)Don't put your boss between a rock and a hard place.<br>If you rush to complain to your boss about how you were knocked down when you were not looking, you will be told to "work itout."<br>Worse, he will think you are incapable of resolving conflicts effectively or dealing with issues tactfully. Never create a situation where your boss has to make a choice between two employees. Rather assess whether your boss is able to see through the smoke of gossip and maintain a good bearing on what is happening behind the scenes.<br><br>5) Never let your opponent see you sweat.<br>Don't give your rival the satisfaction of seeing you get upset. Keep cool and calm. Pretend that you are not affected and don't reveal that you know what he is up to. Be friendly and professional; you must keep the element of surprise as you launch the counter-strike measures.<br><br>6) Dispel rumors indirectly<br>Being upwardly mobile usually involves using contacts creatively. Tap into your network of friends and co-workers to help you dispel the rumours. If you are close to your boss's peers, confide in them. It is politically smart to relay favorable information about you to influential players like your boss to defuse the gossip indirectly. This method will shield you from permanent damage and even get you some sympathy from the top.<br><br>7) Outperform your opponent.<br>Start working harder and performing better at anticipating and fufilling your boss's requirements. Seek ways to add more value to him and the organisation. Look for opportunities to demonstrate your strengths to build up a good impression with co-workers.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">Get the inside scoop<br>It is strategic to expand your power base with other managers and employees. In particular, it pays to improve your relationship with your opponent's staff, as they are reliable source of information. To play well defensively, you must have access to internal news and strategies.<br><br>9) Don't let gossip stick.<br>Although gossip is a common phenomenon at the workplace, never underestimate the gullibility of people when it comes to believing untruths. If you let a rumour linger in the grapevine for a few days, it will be believed. If you want to be upwardly mobile, you cannot afford to allow destructive influences like gossip or lies to take root and derail your career advancement, When you find you are a victim, you must act swiftly and calmly to set the record straight or you will be exactly where your riavls want you to be- at their mercy.<br><br><a href="http://Courtesy%20of%20this%20week%20Straits%20time" rel="nofollow">Courtesy of this week Straits time</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from frustration,... to depresion,... to stress... you must understand at which level you are. See a professional, don't fully trust on people at forum, some might say whatever they think, regardless whether it's true, whether it's helpful, who cares about you, no one is family here, people just say whatever.<br>Go to GP and ask for referral letter for professional consultation. Lie down there and tell your condition. You might need a break from your career, or even a break from your daily life. You might need to change job, or you might need an overseas holiday. Let the expert that has experience tell you that.<br></div>
