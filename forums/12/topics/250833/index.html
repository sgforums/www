They spend millions of dollars for cars. Making tunnels, via ducts, link roads, and electronic signboard. But for pedestrians, they are not too concerned.<br>Something must happen, then the government will do something. If something happen like a cyclist knock down a little child, and cripple the child. When the whole of Singapore is outraged, then the government will come out sympathetic.<br>Until then, things will carry on as usual.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The situation in Singapore is like this:<br><br>Government don't know what to do with cyclists who ride on pavements.<br><br>Although the law bans cycling on the pavement, we all know that pushing cyclists to the road will result in more traffic accidents and slower traffic flow. Since the government's priority is keeping road traffic smooth, it will push for stronger enforcement against cycling on pavements.<br><br>Personally, I prefer to cycle on the road. Yes, I do encounter many inconsiderate drivers when I cycle and feel like getting into a fist fight with them sometime. I think the government should increase road tax to discourage driving and encourage greener mode of transport like cycling.<br></div>
