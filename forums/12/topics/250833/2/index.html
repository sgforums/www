They all deserve to be scolded. No doubt about it.<br><br>But what about genuine cyclists who are like me? I ALWAYS slow down to a snail's pace (little kids ard or not) and say "excuse me" to the person in front if they are walking in the same direction as me (since they can't see me come from behind). I don't have a bell because it irritates me! lol. To those who are coming in my direction, most of the times they DON'T give way to me. Although I am right in the view of their eyesight. They don't even make the little effort that is needed to step aside courteously. Worse still, some of them who have kids (not sure if you are like this too TS) don't even make the effort to restrain their kids. They still happily let their kids run about. I am forced to stop in this case, just for the safety of their kids, and let them pass.<br><br>Get my point? It seems sometimes that I care more for their kids safety then they themselves as parents!

            <div class='col-md body'>I have no problems with cyclists on the pavement. I rather they ride on the pavement than on the road. We have an average of 250 motorcyclist killed on the road yearly. I don't want a figure for bicyclists as well. I hope the government would make pavement wider for both cyclists and pedestrians. Tampines Ave 2 has a section that caters to both cyclists and pedestrians.<br><br>But what piss me off is bicyclists riding across Pedestrian (zebra) crossing.<br>They appear out of nowhere, and zoom across the Pedestrian crossing forcing a motorist to e-brake. A pedestrian you can spot when they are near the crossing, and you can be alert. But a cyclist would be at a distance when you approach the crossing and when you are near they just cut across the your front, as if the zebra crossing is a magic crossing.<br>I have been contemplating complaining to the authorities about such riding across zebra crossings.</div>

I agree that we are "guests" on pavement. But that clearly doesn't give the right to any of the pedestrians to treat the cyclists so badly as some do. Stop quoting laws. There is such thing as courteousness or mercy in this world.. Be friendly and you make both ur day and the cyclist's day as well.<br><br>To no. 2: Most don't mind? My dear friend, I can say I am almost 99% polite all the time. But I would say only 60% or 70% return the same politeness to me. Some even give that look of destest even though I am gentle and polite. And yes, there are definitely inconsiderate n extremely rude cyclists around. There are always bound to be bad eggs everywhere.<br><br>To no. 3: I'm in my uni library and I literally chuckled when I saw you say "We might as well fly". LOL!! Nice one.. I had even noticed that its not just about cycling. Even when I am walking on the pathway, you can always come across couples/pairs who walk shoulder to shoulder and don't budge even if they see you coming. Thats the height of rudeness I have encountered. They should be really ashamed of themselves.</div>
