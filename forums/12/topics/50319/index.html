            <div class='col-md body'>Apart from being lame, is she mature in her thinking?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Reason for asking if she's mature is, since both of you are good friends, even if she don't have any slightest feeling for you, things should be back at ground zero - friendship. Unless she's got a childish mentality, then I'm sorry, chances are it'll affect your friendship. Of coz the above situation is dependant on the individuals.<br><br>A girl can clique really well with a guy, yet it's purely platonic. But to a guy, there's hardly a thing call platonic r/s if you ask me. There is bound to have certain attraction, be it in its slightest form.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> You mentioned 'some feelings', how strong are these feelings? Maybe you like her as a friend and nothing more that that?<br><br>Maybe you should learn to bid for your time.. It's not as if now you must go into a r/s with her. Since both of you are good friends and chances are both of u enjoy each other's company, why not make use of every opportunity to know her better?<br><br>Stop cracking lame jokes, time to be serious if you think she's the one. Coz if you carry on being a lamer *pardon me for that* even when the day comes where you tell her you like her, she'll take it as yet another lame joke, if you get what I'm trying to say here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>How old are you and she by the way? How long have you both known each other?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ben-i:</div><div class="quote_body">I've been good friends with this girl for quite some time, we can get along very well as we both are lame persons who like to crack really lame jokes.. over the years i have developed some feelings for her , but i never told her as i scared it might affect our good friendship.

The real issue is only when you chase her and she feels it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Of course, it is modified by how exactly close you are to her and her personality.<br><br>Cheers</div>
