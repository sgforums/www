              <p>so guys, havent been here for a while now. been busy with alot of different things.</p>
              <p>anyways, lets get to the issue. The question on my mind is, do you think your children in future  deserve to get "punished" for promises that you failed to keep to God before you had children.</p>
              <p>In the bible, Abraham would do anything God asked if he was told to if God grant him a son. He did get a son but God wanted Abraham to sacrfice his son on Mount Moriah. I would find the blinding of Issac relevant here.</p>
              <p>Anyways back to topic, if you were married in a Church, i believe that one of your promises to God in holy matrinomy to your wife would be that your children would have to be brought up with a christian background. If you would to go against your promise and not bring them up God wanted to, would that be a sin?</p>

              <p><br>What makes you think your children will be "punished" by GOD?</p>
              <p>And why would you even need to make a promise with GOD to raise your children to be a Christian?</p>
              <p>Both of your questions clearly expressed the little faith you have in GOD. You know the Bible but you do not know GOD, is that right?</p>
              <p>Once you know GOD, all these questions will disappear and you can start living for real. For now, you're still a dead Chrisitan awaiting for GOD to raise you up and see for yourself that Heaven is really on Earth, but so is Hell...which is also on Earth.</p>
              <p>You're probably seeing Hell everywhere right now cos you're still a walking-dead. Please pray for GOD to raise you up and open your eyes to see the real Heaven on Earth.</p>
              <p>I'm not lying, Heaven and Hell are both on Earth. It's how much faith you had in GOD that will makes the difference between living each day on Earth like every day in Heaven or living everyday on Earth like each day in Hell. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>The Church should not be seen as made up of individuals, but as
              made up of families. Definitely the family places an important
              development in the faith. We cannot simply depend on the Church for
              the moral and spiritual education of our children. The parents must
              play a part too.</p>
              <p>The Catechism states:</p>
              <p><a name="III"></a><strong>2225 </strong>Through the grace of the
              sacrament of marriage, parents receive the responsibility and
              privilege of <em>evangelizing their children</em>. Parents should
              initiate their children at an early age into the mysteries of the
              faith of which they are the "first heralds" for their
              children. They should associate them from their tenderest years with
              the life of the Church.<sup>34</sup> A wholesome family life can
              foster interior dispositions that are a genuine preparation for a
              living faith and remain a support for it throughout one's life.</p>
              <p>If you don't bring up the children in the faith, and they go astray, then it is your fault. But if you have done all you can but they still abandon the faith when they grow up, I don't think God will blame you for it.</p>
