As much as our society make our youth feel that their acedamic results will dictate their futures when they are barely 16 years old, Life in truth is what you make of it. Not all educated and rich individuals are Happy with their life nor are very everyone else living in misery from the lack of it.<br><br>Look for your answers within yourself logically and calculate your options and plan ahead from now on, that is the best option. I will try to help with the little information i have.<br><br>Your Assets:<br><br>1) Your passion to cook. Not everyone know what they want to do in life but yet you have found your passion, that has infact placed you ahead of your peers.<br><br>2) Support from your family. Despite everything, your father is supportive and wants you to fulfil your dreams. Family support is one of the most important factors that can help someone suceed in life.<br><br>Your Challenge:<br><br>1)SGD$6000 a year in school fees(excluding transport and living expense) might look like a large number. But the trick to dealing with it is to manage it well. Some skill in controlling finances can help you greatly. Simple things suchs as breaking the lump sum into months and factor in your school fees and expense on paper will help you to plan your monthly/daily budget better. Seeking help from shatec can also be a possiblity. You can check with them if they have any finanical assistance plan for students or the option to pay fee monthly/bi-monthly.<br><br>2)Your studies. Even though you mentioned that you might be seeking two jobs to finance your studies, you have to take into consideration that the Ultimate aim of your enrollment is not to meet fee payment but rather to learn and excel in your passion of becomming a chef. Hence you will have to factor this consideration in such that you are able to excel in the course and not become too tired to learn.<br><br>Your Motivaion:<br><br>Apart from your passion, being able to motivate yourself is also very important. There will always be troubles arising from any endevor which holds true for everyone. Your family should be your greatest souce of emotional support and motivation. The desire to suceed would be greater if you realse that you are not just doing this for your own future but that of the welfare of you parents that have nutured you thus far.<br><br>Your Success:<br><br>One of the most common problems in life is that we tend to lose focus or distracted. It happens to everyone at one point or another in our lives. Always remember your goal when you start something. Infact once you have enrolled into the course, your mentality should change such that you tell yourself that you are no longer studying for the sake of studying anymore, you are embarking on a career and those skills you gain from the course will become the tools of the trade so as to speak. A clear focus on your goals will help you suceed in your passions. I wish you every success and hope that these few words are able to help you in your journey ahead to becoming a great chef.<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>L.I.P</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LoL!!!<br>i expected ppl to flame ite students, mainly from rich n "educated" kids. haha...<br>i'm from ite, i flunk my Os but i made it to higher nitec. i told myself, i needed a cert, n since i can only go higher nitec, i might as well endure it n get a cert. so i flipped thru the classifieds n see dat mechanical engineerin has the most prospective as they had many advertisements. so i made a decision on goin thru studyin agn. i had the phobia of takin exams as i alr flunk my Os. but still i told myself i need a cert. i had absolutely no interest in mechanical engineerin but it's for dat piece of paper. the paper dat i someday will nd to use to get a job.<br><br>ite is the easiest to get As if u just listen to lectures n have the right attitude.<br>my 1st semester in ite was great, had a couple of As and Bs, my gpa went up. den i suffered a breakup and my 2nd semester was bad, no As or Bs so my gpa got pulled down. my 3rd semester was only average. my last semester, i hang out with 24-26yr old lao jiao, and they ask me 1 qns dat changed my point of view. they asked me, "look at us, we're alr 24,25 yrs old n still comin to ite, bcos we didn't study last time. wld u wana end up like us?" they were a role model to me as thru out their ite life, they had mostly if not all As, gpa higher den 3.8. so from dat qns, i realised dat i needed to get my gpa up to make my cert look better. with the support of my gf, i pulled thru and got 4As, 1B and 1D. i didn't get debar on any semester. my gpa went up n it only allow me to go into 1st year poly. i'm in NS now, i might continue studyin after NS.<br><br>it's all bcos of a cert. a cert dat u might need to depend on if u can't find other jobs.<br>with the correct mind set, attitude and peers, studyin n scorin nice results is ez. so nw u decide wat u shld do. endin ur life will only make ur family, friends and ppl who care sad. tink abt them b4 u tink abt urself. tink abt hw they will feel when they lose u. it's not the end.<br>in fact, if i'm not wrong, degree holders cannot determine a place in a company. and ite students are gettin even more jobs as we r more hands on den poly students, hence our experience is more.<br><br>decide n choose ur path. dun let wat others tink put u down. show them wat u can do like me. i disappointed them b4, therefore i try harder to prove to them.</div>
