You have the support from your family and friends. That matters ALOT.<br><br>ITE may have some people like that, so does poly and JC too. Even Uni you also can find some.<br><br>All those pai kias or what you wanna categorise them hor, all originated from secondary schools. No secondary school is spared from them. And who say hooligans/pai kias are "bad" seeds? They just express themselves differently and you will find them more friendly then those "cream of the crop", stuck up nose students.<br><br>I find pai kias more sociable than those self proclaimed "elites".</div>
