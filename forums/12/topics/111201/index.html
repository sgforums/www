            <div class='col-md body'>Shall I file a complaint to CASE or making a police report? Here is my short story.... Really appreaciate yuor opinion..<br><br>Last thurs, i went to Justin salon at the HDB flat in Tiong bahru area  to re-perm my hair but I forgot to ask the cost first before perming. Waiting for my turn for more than 3 hours since 6pm with my brother, together with 3 people inside, it was quite late. It took a hairdresser to complete my re-perm for almost 4 hrs and paid unreasonable price - $130 after $10 discount. I went home at 2am by the cab fare.  Thus, I didn't have enough money left because I never expected that my hair perming cost me $130!<br><br>Two days later, i was not satisfied with my re-perm and went to the same salon again. I asked the same  hairdresser to re-do my hair. I also complained of having difficulties to comb my hair. He suggested putting a treatment on my hair and asked me to pay $35 more because he claimed that the product is imported from japan and  not found selling here. I checked out in the other salons. They did sell it. How could he claim like that?<br><br>Upon completion of my hair re-perm and treatment, I was sort of angry and only paid $25 only. I had tried to reason with him but nothing convinced him. He was only interested in making extra money. Until the night (around 10pm+), i received the sms from him, saying that  he apologised to me that the treatment was actually free and would keep $25 for dying my hair. I got angry because I never said whether I wanted to dye my hair. I replied back, asking him about the price. He responsed that the black dye (to remove my previous hair colour) and new colour dye and the colour saver would cost me $120. So he offered me to pay $95 only since he kept $25. He really abused the price of hair cost. I wanted him to return me $25 since I rejected his offer. In end, he refused and made me dye again first!<br><br>I discussed with my friends and brother regarding this issue and even showed them his sms-es. They suggested that I should file a complaint to CASE or make a police report.<br><br>Anyway, my brother told me that he just happened to see the dye products inside the toilet. All of them were already expired. No wonder all my friends' hairs which were done by him are now partly damanged or faded away in just a few weeks.<br><br>Now, what do you suggest? Is it possible to claim $25 back from him? just worth 2 cents.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by millienium_bear:</div><div class="quote_body">Shall I file a complaint to CASE or making a police report? Here is my short story.... Really appreaciate yuor opinion..<br><br>Last thurs, i went to Justin salon at the HDB flat in Tiong bahru area  to re-perm my hair but I forgot to ask the cost first before perming. Waiting for my turn for more than 3 hours since 6pm with my brother, together with 3 people inside, it was quite late. It took a hairdresser to complete my re-perm for almost 4 hrs and paid unreasonable price - $130 after $10 discount. I went home at 2am by the cab fare.  Thus, I didn't have enough money left because I never expected that my hair perming cost me $130!<br><br>Two days later, i was not satisfied with my re-perm and went to the same salon again. I asked the same  hairdresser to re-do my hair. I also complained of having difficulties to comb my hair. He suggested putting a treatment on my hair and asked me to pay $35 more because he claimed that the product is imported from japan and  not found selling here. I checked out in the other salons. They did sell it. How could he claim like that?<br><br>Upon completion of my hair re-perm and treatment, I was sort of angry and only paid $25 only. I had tried to reason with him but nothing convinced him. He was only interested in making extra money. Until the night (around 10pm+), i received the sms from him, saying that  he apologised to me that the treatment was actually free and would keep $25 for dying my hair. I got angry because I never said whether I wanted to dye my hair. I replied back, asking him about the price. He responsed that the black dye (to remove my previous hair colour) and new colour dye and the colour saver would cost me $120. So he offered me to pay $95 only since he kept $25. He really abused the price of hair cost. I wanted him to return me $25 since I rejected his offer. In end, he refused and made me dye again first!<br><br>I discussed with my friends and brother regarding this issue and even showed them his sms-es. They suggested that I should file a complaint to CASE or make a police report.<br><br>Anyway, my brother told me that he just happened to see the dye products inside the toilet. All of them were already expired. No wonder all my friends' hairs which were done by him are now partly damanged or faded away in just a few weeks.<br><br>Now, what do you suggest?

Go do something happy.. and forget about this incident... make it a lesson learnt.. so that next time you will not or never have this happen to you again.. Try to divert your anger into somewhere.. After a whole of complaining to your friends.. and people around you.. you also sick of repeating the story again and again..<br><br>Take care..
