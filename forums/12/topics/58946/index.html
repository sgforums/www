Here's something you might want to consider:<br><br>I)  you may attain certain rank during your stay there, say Staff Sergeant or something - but after you finished your bond with pay at least 2000+ to 3000+ then if you wish to work in private sector - you could probably claim wages much less than your army pay. (Staff Sergeant in army meant NOTHING in the working world). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Long range invisible effect:<br><br>II) Even if you plan to use the money earn to do business or something, by the time the bond has ended. (probably you are close to 30), you are likely to be locked in your own financial liability. Car purchase or worst if you are married - on account for all these liability, you stay. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>III) Conversation with gf/wife will be affected (Whether you want to admit or not, in all small ways). Probably no woman likes listening to the army kind of guys talk. To guys its fine, to woman is a different story. Army guys always hate admitting this possible flaw and probably rebut, but I just post it here for you to think. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>IV) If you do not have a gf - your female social circle will greatly be reduced. This may post a problem in the future. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>V) What is useful you learn in army, survival and all other army related skills are generally not very useful in urban context. (Even if it does, on small scale.) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If you do not wish to do it AS A CAREER - forget it man. Don't treat army as a Job. It has to be a career. I have people regretting, but unable to pay bond-breaking, together with car liability - its hell.<br><br>Cheers</div>

Here's something you might want to consider:<br><br>I)  you may attain certain rank during your stay there, say Staff Sergeant or something - but after you finished your bond with pay at least 2000+ to 3000+ then if you wish to work in private sector - you could probably claim wages much less than your army pay. (Staff Sergeant in army meant NOTHING in the working world). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> [/quote]<br><br>thnkx for this info......nvr knew about this........<br><br><blockquote><br><br>Long range invisible effect:<br><br>II) Even if you plan to use the money earn to do business or something, by the time the bond has ended. (probably you are close to 30), you are likely to be locked in your own financial liability. Car purchase or worst if you are married - on account for all these liability, you stay. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </blockquote>i not yet think about this 1 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br><blockquote><br><br>III) Conversation with gf/wife will be affected (Whether you want to admit or not, in all small ways). Probably no woman likes listening to the army kind of guys talk. To guys its fine, to woman is a different story. Army guys always hate admitting this possible flaw and probably rebut, but I just post it here for you to think. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   </blockquote>hhmmm......true....i also admit tat.....guys talk army things is alrite.....<br><br><blockquote><br>IV) If you do not have a gf - your female social circle will greatly be reduced.
