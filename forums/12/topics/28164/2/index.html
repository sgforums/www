Almost every guy in this world do that. You must understand that he has his own needs, sexually. I think he lied to you at first because he is shy to tell you of what he did as he is scare that you might depise him. Now he tell you the true something so personal show that he care about you. Actually you should be glad that he is only looking at porn website and not gay website. Give both of you 2 some space and maybe you can have some serious talk with him and tell him you are not comfortable about what he is doing and eventually come to a compromise.<br><br>Regards,<br>BrenBren</div>

No offence.. but there is a possibilty. My dad also watch porn... i used to find porn tapes in my house when i was young. So what....<br><br>I think u should gif ur bf some personal space. Watching porn is no big deal. even Gals have sexual needs and masturbate. What u says jus makes me feel that u r trying to find urself excuses to ditch ur guy... I'm not trying to be harsh.. but even in Science classes or bol class or whatever, ur teacher will be like telling u .. everyone has their sexual needs rite.. just that different ppl have different kind of categories... some ppl love to be tortured in bed... some like to torture ppl... but they are afterall humans... and imagine ur guy is only watching porn..<br><br>Actually, Pornography is also a sex aid which can improve your sex life. Come on' lets jus admit that in this society.. there's no more love stories without sex.. *Unless Pious christians... nothing to say*<br><br>At least ur bf tells u about it.. that means he treasure you and trust u enough to admit it. At first he deny.. but he admit it later.. u think this is lying? No .. its not.. Lying is u discover the truth yourself....<br>now u know this matter from his own mouth... u think its easy for a guy to admit ma.. can tell u no! They are so egoistic *SorrY GUys But this is the truth* Nothing matters most to them except their ego =P but he still tell u abt it... u can see his sincerity from here.<br>However, if u still brood over matters like that ... then i can tell u.. in future.. no matter how many bf u have... the outcome is still the same<br><br>we are all ladies... so i jus sharing with u my views. Be more open in ur thinking.. this is the 21st century... dun think like a grandma ya <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
