How could you? He could go LAN shop, could clear history all that shit and if he does that, this relation already lost that kind of trust because he knowing lied to you because of a fact that he wants and you don't want. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Guess one good advice here is to sit down, talk to him about it as in telling him that IF he continues, he will lose you eventually because you mind it and it is a form of cheating to you. He has to know the consequence because you don't have to go through all this shit. You post in the forum saying that it spolits your day, etc, let him know. IF he heeds, then its ok. If he caught him red-handed again or something, I guess this relation needs total reflection and reasons of staying in it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Its totally alright to have not so rich or good looking bf, but its not alright to have a bf who has never been honest to you.

He is probably at curious stage (probably a young guy 10-22 yrs), which explains why he lied (conflict of interest - embarrassed and yet curious to find out).  The point is do you enjoy his company and has not done any harm to anyone.</div>

I think it's a perfectly normal thing to do. Everyone one has sexual fantasies, be it something romantic or even sordid. Its fine to fantasize as long as it's not realized. And the fact that he is doing all these could stem from the fact that there is some sexual frustration on his part. Do remember that men are intrinsically more sexual as compared to women.<br><br>All said ... i think your boyfriend is a pretty decent guy. He's willing to try to change for you.

You get what I mean?</strong><br><br>People DO change... Do you expect yourself to be in secondary 2 and 14 every year...?<br><br><strong><br>It's not drooling at other girls. U try drooling at other girls in front of your gf and see what happens. It's looking at a naked body. So you can't compare it to girls looking at guys, unless they are looking at naked men. Anyway, girls don't drool over guys, at least not the ones I know.</strong><br><br>Some DO. But that's besides the point... Some guys don't enjoy looking at naked girls' body too..? eg. GAYs...<br><br>Basically, GIRLs and GUYs are DIFFERENT components... You can't compare them that way.... Just like guys won't understand why girls can have a WHOLE LOAD of cosmetics and still go CRAZY for those sales... And the way they LOVE shopping...? Different 'species' have different needs... Different way of doing and viewing things....<br><br><strong><br>Some things means more to certain people. And to me, honesty is very important. Just because you feel that lying is not a big problem doesn't mean others have to feel that way too.</strong><br><br>Honesty USED to mean ALOT to me too... But TRUST me, sometimes honesty's not the best way out... &lt;- Not like this can be used as an excuse for your bf... Anyway, just pointed this out because you would have to learn to ACCEPT this world as IT IS... NOT the way you WANT it to be when you're out in the society... Unless you're prepared to go into total isolation to achieve nirvana... That would another issue altogether....<br><br><strong><br>Oh, btw, he's over 22 so not at curiosity stage.</strong><br><br>You can't define a curiosity stage by age, just like you can't judge a person's mentality by that...<br><br>Besides, guys look at naked girls not necessarily solely because of curiosity...? Just like if I say women should know better than to spend (waste?) their money on shopping spree...? (heck, women and the enterprises are gonna hate me equally after this...) Well... Everyone has their needs, their reasons... Just because they cannot take the lure and temptation doesn't mean that they're immature....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></blockquote></div>
