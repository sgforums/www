If you are afraid of being rejected thus holding back your step, then you are the one who rejects yourself first. There's no right or wrong time. You just need guts. Of course you don't go up to anyone who doesn't know you well and confess to her that you like her. More likely you'll end up being slap at (assuming only). If that girl knows you well, if she likes you, she'll say "yes" but if she don't like you the way you want it to be, then even if she reject you also ok. At least you know what lies ahead. If you chix out, then sorry pal, even if the girl likes you you also won't know.<br><br>Honestly it never cross my mind that my gf loves me too but she does. When I decide to confess to her, I'm actually prepared to be rejected but lucky me she never. But even if she does, I'm fine with it cause I know this time round if I still sit and do nothing about my own feelings, then high chances I'll regret not finding the guts in the first place.</div>

Then, blind her eye with a cloth or something then ask her to stand at the sand. Use your fire cracker to make a heart shape around her. Unblind her and light up the firecrackers.. Then give her the cake.<br>If she have that slightest feeling for you, then you'll leave a very good impression on her. Then maybe go for dinner. One thing, don't go to East Coast Park for that.

(did he say it anyway? I anyhow say one)<br><br>I am sure most people have an 'ideal' that they think will make them happy. It may or may not necessarily be the ONLY thing that makes them happy. Like a lot of guys may say they like girls with long hair la.. this la.. that la.. but in the end their gf can be very different. So try anyway.. as long as she is aware that, even if you may not be the prototype she thinks suits her, and yet amazingly your presence brings light to her life, then her thinking will change too. You shouldn't need to change urself to 'fit' her role model.<br><br></div>
