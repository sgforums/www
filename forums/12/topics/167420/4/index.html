If it's too big a difference and almost like a lost cause or if she clearly rejected you, then you're barking up the wrong tree and should know when to give up, instead of dumbly banging your head on a firmly closed door.<br><br>But essentially don't pressure yourself into fulfilling the romantic ideals of "proposing", "confessing" and etc. Keep it light and easy and just get to know each other.
