            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all<br><br>Be careful if you ever stumble into a girl with the initials G.K.L or G.G.L (dialect). I have a bad experience with such a person and I wish to warn all of you to be careful with what kind of people you contact with.<br><br>Some time ago, she and my bf did some kind of work together and when the work was almost completed, she quitted. The reason she gave was that she did not like me. Now, the weird thing is I have never talked to her personally. There was only this exception that I had to call her on my boyfriend's behalf because his hp was down. She was quite rude to me in the phone and went so far as to tell my boyfriend that he had a rude girlfriend. What kind of logic is that?<br><br>So when she cited me as a reason for quitting, I was naturally annoyed. I tried to reason with her, but she cut off my call. So I went online and poured out my frustrations on this ulu storyboard. Soon, I forgot about the whole thing.<br><br>Later, GKL found out and she went around broadcasting to her friends (quite a stupid thing to do, telling people of your own gossip). She even accused me of posting her hp number online and threatened me to come down and meet her "lawyer". She said I had to apologise to her online. I did that but what was her reaction? "My SISTER said cannot accept! You have to say sorry to all my friends too! You are in the total wrong! Not me!" That is simply ridiculous, I thought and did not go and meet her "lawyer". I was also disgusted by her lack of common sense. What has her sister got to do with the affair, unless her sister was a darn busybody?<br><br>Actually, I knew she was lying about the laywer part because which laywer would be so "eng" to come and sit down, drink coffee with you and happily wait at Lips Cafe? As if they have nothing to do and as if lawyers charge a small amount! And why should I apologise to her friends? That is really insane of her.<br><br>That girl went so far as to talk about how bad we were, to everyone she knew. Even when we were totally clueless about her hp number getting published. She had jumped to her own conclusions that we were the ones when she had no evidence at all. Talk about being unfair.<br><br>Later, because I simply ignored her, she kept sending threatening SMSes, "We are going to go to your boyfriend's house now." It was 11pm at night. "His house is blk XX, XXX street right? You better come to the void deck. Don't make us go to your unit!" She had intended to harrass us. In the end, she never turned up because the dumb girl got the address wrong!<br><br>My bf and I decided to simply ignore her because we had received advice that they were just out for fun and it would irritate them if their fun didnt work on us.<br><br>Finally, the last straw came when she reported us to the police. Fortunately, as I had not included her name in the forum and there was no evidence of her claim that I had posted her handphone number online, it was not sufficient to qualify as a case.<br><br>Nevertheless, I want to tell everyone how ridiculous this person is for behaving in such a ridiculous way and daring to go the the police after countless threatening and slandering us. She even wanted to get her friends to stalk my bf. I have decided that i shall bring a case against her for harrassment if she continues.<br><br>Nevertheless, be careful of some girls. They can appear to look really docile but end up being real b*tchy. One thing I have to say is that whenever they try to be really mean to you, do not argue back but keep whatever evidence you have in order to take them on legally should the need arises for it.</div>
