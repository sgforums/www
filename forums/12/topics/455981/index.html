              Hello ppl, I am stuck in a difficult situation.. I am 30, married for 7 years... Relationship with hubby quite bad... Ever since I started my new job 1 year ago, I am attracted to my boss.. We hang around very often.. Overseas business trip were always with him.. He is married as well.. But both of us didnt express our crush to each other until the day I decided to leave the company to join another..
              
              He told me he likes me and want me to stay.. But I left to join another company. We still keep in contAct with those flirting msg. Last week, I had to go Malaysia for a conference.. N he was there.. We sort of planned this work trip.. We went drinking and ended having a wonderful night.. I thought it's just a lust.. However we continued our lust for the next 2 days.. 
              
              On the last day, he told me that we were friends with benefit.. N ask me to watch the movie friends of benefit.. I became so attached to him and I think I have fallen for him.. 
              
              We still kept in contAct due to work relationship but he was very formal to me.. I realized I don't love my hubby anymore..  And I am so lost.. Wat is friends with benefit? Wat should I do?

              <p>he's just using your body for lust without any love/ attention/ relationship.</p>
              <p>it simply means he fu-k you with no strings attached/ emotional baggage.</p>
              <p>in short, you are his fu-k buddy (FB). you are just for fu-k, nothing else.</p>
              <p>he sweet-talk/ flirt with you to get into your panties/ spread your legs wide and su-k his cock for free-of-charge (FOC).</p>
              <p>at most, he will ask you out for meals. after both stomachs filled, then go hotel room fu-k in privacy or go public carparks/ parks/ beaches/ spaces to fu-k in open air public.</p>
              <p>you are a sex object/ mistress only for sex, he expects you to just have sex without ask for maintenance money. so in a way, you are cheaper to "hire" than a prostitute because he just only need to pay for a hotel transit room. there's no need to pay you for sex. if he's to hire a prostitute, he needs to pay for her sex service.</p>
              <p>if for the past few days, his wife no mood for sex/ cannot satisfy his sexual cravings, then he will begin to call/ sms (commands) you to free up/ make time to fu-k.<br>for examples, lunch time express fu-k (bluff his wife he got lunch meetings with clients) / <br>dinner time fu-k (bluff his wife he needs to work OT/ entertain clients at nights).</p>
              <p><strong>he will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">definitely NOT divorce his wife</span> just for your sake.</strong></p>
              <p>if you pregnant with his baby, your problem. <br>keep/ abort this love/ illegitimate child, your problem.</p>

              <p>I won't probe more because it's a personal matter and it involves children. I suggest seeking a counsellor for your marital issues. As to whether to come clean with your husband about this 'dilemma', it's at your own risk and that is, if you are looking for a reason to end married life.</p>
              <p>When I asked my questions in my first post, I was looking for a hope - the hope to rekindle the love in your marriage. Some people mentioned no more love for their halves when they <em>were</em> meaning different things actually.</p>

              <h3>Marriage Counselling at Family Service Centres</h3>
              <p>Many married couples grow apart when saddled with the stresses of 
                      everyday life, differing expectations and conflicts that keep mounting.</p>
              <p>Do not wait till it is too late to go for help. Relationships do not 
                      fall apart overnight. The longer the problem stays, the more the 
                      relationship becomes strained.</p>
              <p>If you find yourself in a marriage that is falling apart, and are 
                      unable to work out your issues alone, consider seeking professional help
                       by seeing a Marriage Counsellor. You have nothing to lose.</p>
              <p><strong>A marriage counsellor can help you and your spouse:</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li>understand what could have gone wrong in your  marriage</li>
              <li>improve your marriage by working through the issue with you</li>
              <li>discover the internal resources and strengths you both have to make it work</li>
              <li>communicate and re-connect with your spouse</li>
              <li>regain trust and commitment that both of you started out with</li>
              </ul>
              <p>You can seek counselling at a Family Service Centre or any other counselling centre.</p>
              <h3>Marriage Counselling For Muslim Couples</h3>
              <p>Muslim couples who have domestic problems may first approach any 
                      Family Service Centres (FSCs).  There are trained marriage counsellors 
                      at FSCs to help you and your spouse.</p>

              <p>You have to make the decision for yourself.</p>
              <p>The boss, as the rest of the forumers have stated, want to mantain his marriage and just want to have fun with you without any attachment.</p>
              <p>Unless you can do the same thing without any emotional attachment, I advise you not to carry on this relationship as you will be the eventual loser with broken marriage and being ditched.</p>
              <p>Focus on patching the relationship with your hubby or else why would you marry him in the 1st place.</p>
              <p>Focus on his good points and encourage him if he make efforts in improving on bad habits that you dun like.</p>
              <p>It is another level of human management for marriage.</p>
              <p>If you dun learn this lesson, you will experience the same problem when you marry another guy.</p>
              <p>Feeling of Love only last for 3 years and requires consistent effort to be romantic and loving.</p>

              attached to him and I think I have fallen for him..</p>
              <p>We still kept in contAct due to work relationship but he was
              very formal to me.. I realized I don’t love my hubby anymore.. And
              I am so lost.. Wat is friends with benefit? Wat should I do?</p>

              <p>What are you not happy about your husband?</p>
              <p>What is it you get from this ex boss , you not getting from your husband?</p>
              <p>Your husband got a dik, your ex boss got a dik. Both are imperfect men.</p>
              <p>Is it because your husband not a "boss" , so you don't admire him? </p>
              <p>Yes it was fun, yes it was exciting to sneak around doing something bad behind each others spouse.... That was all... This man can cheat on his wife, he can also cheat on you. Do you really believe you are his only fling ? </p>
              <p>Who knows, you are number 30 on his list of friends with benefits. </p>

              <p>What do you mean by cannot go back to your husband.  Of cors u can.</p>
              <p>Now that u realized your mistakes, all the more you should be nicer to your husband.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, affairs like this may seem destructive at first, but it also allows rebirth and result in a stronger relationship with your spouse.</p>
              <p>Let's put it this way lah, whatever u are not happy with your husband, you had your revenge, now get on with life and stop ruining your children family.</p>

              <p>he sweet-talk/ flirt with you to get into your panties/ spread
                      your legs wide and su-k his cock for free-of-charge (FOC).</p>
              <p>at most, he will ask you out for meals. after both stomachs
                      filled, then go hotel room fu-k in privacy or go public carparks/
                      parks/ beaches/ spaces to fu-k in open air public.</p>
              <p>you are a sex object/ mistress only for sex, he expects you to
                      just have sex without ask for maintenance money. so in a way, you
                      are cheaper to "hire" than a prostitute because he just only need
                      to pay for a hotel transit room. there's no need to pay you for
                      sex. if he's to hire a prostitute, he needs to pay for her sex
                      service.</p>
              <p>if for the past few days, his wife no mood for sex/ cannot

                      meetings with clients) /<br> dinner time fu-k (bluff his wife he needs to work OT/ entertain

              <p>Unless your hubby have betrayed you or have been a lousy dad, I dun quite understand why you need to initiate a divorce cos you lost the loving feeling for him.</p>
              <p>As to what you have done, you have already did it and no point feeling guilty about it.</p>
              <p>But, it should not prevent u from pursuing a good life with your hubby and your kids.</p>
              <p>Just speak with your hubby and work things out with him for yourself and your kids.</p>
              <p>Never tell him what you have done.</p>
              <p>If it dun really work out, then you may have to adopt the eventual path of divorce.</p>
              <p>Please take into consideration on its impact of your kids.</p>
              <p>You should be pretty confused at the moment.</p>
              <p>Dwelling on what you have done will not help you a bit.</p>
              <p>You have to fill your mind to solving the relationship issues.</p>

              <p>Your affair is not without consequences. Do not think just because it is not exposed it is without consequences. You know what you have done, that is enough to worsen the relationship with your husband. He may not have a clue, but your body language will exacerbate the situation. </p>
              <p>Please know that there is another marriage involved. Do you want that to run aground as well?</p>
              <p>Meantime realise that you are just for fun for that married man, and you are being hopeful at your own peril.</p>
