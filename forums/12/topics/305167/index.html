              <p>jianjian23,</p>
              <p>Having a good rapport with her daughter is a very important step. Without her daughter's approval, the relationship will be a very difficult one.</p>
              <p>You being the ONLY SON, will pose some problem with your parent.</p>
              <p>Surely they'd want to have their own BIOLOGICAL grandchild from you.</p>
              <p>Talk to your beau if she plan to have any of your offsprings. If YES, then you should let your parents know of this, VERY IMPORTANT.</p>
              <p>Another thing is, how is she doing financially ? If she is looking for a meal ticket, your parents WILL NOT like it.</p>
              <p>So brag about her achievements and her background (if any), your parents need to know she is not out to take advantage of you.</p>
              <p>DO NOT expect your parents to treat her daughter as their own grandchild. Accept the fact that, your parents will favor your own child. So, as long as you can understand this, you will not have conflict with the difference in treatment later.</p>
              <p>Remember, it is not their responsibility to "accept" her just because you are in love with her. It is YOUR duty to "help" your parents accept her.</p>
              <p>Most important, you must be happy.</p>

              <p><br>Depends on your parents loh. Some parents are old fashion one so don't like this buy one get one free situation. Worse, some parents think 'used' goods are lousy.</p>
              <p>Anyway no matter how you must tell your parents right? After all marriage doesn't just involve the three of you oni. In Singapore sad to say, it involves everybody even though actually not their affairs.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>So, find a good day and bring them out all together for a dinner and see how your parents react loh.</p>

              What have you seriously learn?
              
              Instead feeling so devasted, reflect on yourself. Was she really worth all the trouble?
              
              learn your lesson well and you will be a better man the next time..
