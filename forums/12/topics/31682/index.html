Parents cares for their children, and when things happens, they will assume that if the conditions for it to happens occurs again... it WILL happen. But of course, condition for it to happen can be made to *seemed* like it is not happening. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The lovebite is a great catalysis that sparks that whole argument. You ought and got to learn that and have to prevent such thing from happening, so that her parents have zero excuse to even suspect you. You love your gf don't you? So the *MORE* you should protect her from such harm that may befall on her. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The solution for your problem is time. Only time can really tell who you are - remember not to let her stay with you too late, no more lovebites, she cannot get drunk, etc, because all these impression goes to YOU. You are responsible to create and generate a better picture and to make her parents feel safe to put their daughters in your hands. All these takes time. Once you prove them with time that you are DIFFERENT - you will still win this battle. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Astrological Insight - more time and patient needed for Capricorn, Leo, Taurus, Aqurius or Scorpio parents.<br><br>Cheers</div>

Only time can really tell who you are - remember not to let her stay with you too late, no more lovebites, she cannot get drunk, etc, because all these impression goes to YOU. You are responsible to create and generate a better picture and to make her parents feel safe to put their daughters in your hands. All these takes time. Once you prove them with time that you are DIFFERENT - you will still win this battle.<br></div></blockquote>Read the above... Also, don't be too defensive against her parents though you wanna protect your girl... Always try to see from their point of view too from time to time....<br><br>2 MAIN cards you should be playing over period of TIME....<br><br>1. RESPECT for her parents.<br>2. REAL CARE and CONCERN for their daughter.<br><br>Play it well, and victory shall be in your hands....<br></div>
