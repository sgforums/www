              <p>ok. so u are facing the same problem as what i faced when my ex broke off with me. i also questioned her, is it because she cant find a bf, then she decided that she wants to come back to me. we didnt patch up afterall, but we still maintain contact.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>why i asked her that, is because i know her character.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well TS, if u still like her, just apologise sincerely. or give her a few days to calm down then look for her again. but dont send emails or talk to her over msn. talk to her face to face, thats more sincere.</p>

              <p>Hi All,<br> I’m v bother by wat has happen to me lately…n i desperately trying
              to find an ans n direction to it…i hope some of u ppl out there can
              give me ur opinions on it.<br> My ex-gf broke up with me 7-8 mths back..her reason was being
              unable to blend in with my circle of friends &amp; not confident in
              herself…which i still dun really buy..we dated for 3 yrs back
              then.<br> I’ve learn to adjust my life back &amp; was getting on good. then
              she came knocking begging if we could patch back together. I was
              happy, confuse &amp; scared. Becoz i’m afraid she might just leave
              again like she did without much explanation. however i give her an
              opening to explain n worm her way back in….we went out acouple of
              times, hold hands n kiss. but i still wasnt sure i wanna her back
              in completely… becoz during our conversation she sometimes will
              joke about buying houses &amp; getting married etc…which make me
              feel uneasy, she knew i always wanted to settle down with her back
              when we are together..but i wasnt sure this time round..i needed
              time to ease in.<br> One night when we were talking on the phone, she mention jokingly
              say about getting a hse etc..then i remember seeing some of her
              party pics she posted online right after we broke off with a group
              of frds…guys n gals…but i some of them r quite intimate..like lying
              on guys shoulder, hugging etc…then in a spur of the moment i said
              whether is it because she couldnt find other better guys tatz y she
              came n look for me..n ask her to go for those guys on the pics if
              she is just looking at me as just spare tyre..</p>
              <p>yes i know i’m been a jerk n mean by saying all these…but would
              anyone of you will feel same as me? or is it just me?.. Anyway i’ve
              apologies profusely straightaway after i said it, knowing it was
              very harsh.. she took it v badly…<br> ok now..i feel that i may have made a bad remarks…but i still
              wishes we can work things out if it’s not what i thought it is…so i
              said sorry &amp; told her we can tried to make it work again…but
              she refused n got really really mad at me..saying if i really love
              her i shouldn’t have said all those…i admit i make a nasty comment
              but isn’t it natural for me to have these thoughts for wat had
              happen to me? plus when she wanna break off with she said lots of
              hurtful things to me too! n when she cant forgive me n when i
              actually gave her a chance?? I wrote her an email to explain n
              apologies…asking her to forgive me n start over…but she never reply
              me.. i ask her on msn whether have she read it she said she was
              busy so no time to read…i said if she felt that we really cannot
              work out it’s fine also…just tell me n i wont bother her anymore
              but she also never reply me….</p>
              <p>so what can do? do i take it as she couldn’t be bother by my
              email or she needed time to think about it….should i call her to
              press for an answer? or should i wait? or she not reading my email
              is an answer already? or should i just move on?</p>
              <p>I’m deeply confuse…help….<br> &amp; thanks for reading my long story…</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The reason why she said she needed time to think about it is because she is as confused as you are.</p>
              <p>She thought that you would not treat her like this because you have been together with her for so long in the past, and you have been so nice to her ( You did not mention that you are a nice guy, but I guess you are probably much better than the guys whom she meet after you ).</p>
              <p>Odds are she got played by a guy outside, and realised that you are the one who is truely caring and loving to her, that is why she came back looking for you.</p>
              <p>Putting that aside, lets get back to you. The main question now is whether are you able to accept her? There is no telling what she might had done outside.</p>
              <p>If you are able to accept her, then let her cool down for a while before you go back and apologise to her again. If you go look for her now while she is in such a state of mind, things are going to get even more out of hand.</p>
              <p>If you are not going to accept her, then forget it. Just take her as another stranger and cut off contact with her.</p>

              <p>What you have said is unforgivable if she really didn't do anything with those guys you seen in the photos, though I highly doubt that is the case here.</p>
              <p>It seems that you are going to choose the route of chasing her back after all this though.</p>
              <p>You have been with her for quite a while in the past, so you should know roughly how long it will take for her to "cool down" after a big argument ( though this is worse than an argument ). After that rough period of time, then should you go look for her.</p>
              <p>If she still refuses to talk to you, then you will have to repeat what she did to make you forgive her :</p>
              <p>Quoted from you : when she begged

              <p>After reading your post I got a few suggestion for you.</p>
              <p>1) Are you seriously in love with your ex? Think carefully first before answering my question.</p>
              <p>1a) If you cannot answer the above question, I can suggest a checklist for you.</p>
              <p>i) Are you truely happy when she is around? Or do you always worry that she will betray you one day and run away again.</p>
              <p>ii) Do you think that she will be your wife in the near future?</p>
              <p>iii) If she countinues to flirt around with her guy friends will you be able to handle it?</p>
              <p>If your answer for all the question above is no, You do not truly love her at all is just a feeling of responsiblity thats all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My suggestion for you is to forget her and start anew, your current actions only shows that you are just sorry for your words thats all, Since you have too much worries about getting back with her, why not let go?</p>

              <p>Bro.</p>
              <p>She left you because she thought she could find someone better.</p>
              <p>She came back because she realized you're the best to her.</p>
              <p>My thoughts : be careful. no guy would want a girlfriend that 'goes with the wind'. if you get what i mean. if one fine day both of you already married, then suddenly you not doing well in life cos of financial problem or career problem or whatever, do you think she'd leave you or cheat on you again?</p>
              <p>If your answer to my question is yes, then i recommend you don't take her too seriously.</p>
              <p>good luck ar ... outside got many many girls la. dun get too hard up on just one of them.</p>

              <p>She can see that, but that doesn't mean she will like you to ask such a question, regardless of whether it is true or not.</p>
              <p>Not only you, most people in a similar situation as yours will probably also think this way, but most people will also be upset when their supposedly other half throw such a question at them.</p>
              <p>The main thing now is whether you are going to really go after her again or not. Just like most of the forummers here who replied, I strongly suggest that you put a full-stop there.</p>

              <p>Hi All,<br> I’m v bother by wat has happen to me lately…n i desperately trying
              to find an ans n direction to it…i hope some of u ppl out there can
              give me ur opinions on it.<br> My ex-gf broke up with me 7-8 mths back..her reason was being
              unable to blend in with my circle of friends &amp; not confident in
              herself…which i still dun really buy..we dated for 3 yrs back
              then.<br> I’ve learn to adjust my life back &amp; was getting on good. then
              she came knocking begging if we could patch back together. I was
              happy, confuse &amp; scared. Becoz i’m afraid she might just leave
              again like she did without much explanation. however i give her an
              opening to explain n worm her way back in….we went out acouple of
              times, hold hands n kiss. but i still wasnt sure i wanna her back
              in completely… becoz during our conversation she sometimes will
              joke about buying houses &amp; getting married etc…which make me
              feel uneasy, she knew i always wanted to settle down with her back
              when we are together..but i wasnt sure this time round..i needed
              time to ease in.<br> One night when we were talking on the phone, she mention jokingly
              say about getting a hse etc..then i remember seeing some of her
              party pics she posted online right after we broke off with a group
              of frds…guys n gals…but i some of them r quite intimate..like lying
              on guys shoulder, hugging etc…then in a spur of the moment i said
              whether is it because she couldnt find other better guys tatz y she
              came n look for me..n ask her to go for those guys on the pics if
              she is just looking at me as just spare tyre..</p>
              <p>yes i know i’m been a jerk n mean by saying all these…but would
              anyone of you will feel same as me? or is it just me?.. Anyway i’ve
              apologies profusely straightaway after i said it, knowing it was
              very harsh.. she took it v badly…<br> ok now..i feel that i may have made a bad remarks…but i still
              wishes we can work things out if it’s not what i thought it is…so i
              said sorry &amp; told her we can tried to make it work again…but
              she refused n got really really mad at me..saying if i really love
              her i shouldn’t have said all those…i admit i make a nasty comment
              but isn’t it natural for me to have these thoughts for wat had
              happen to me? plus when she wanna break off with she said lots of
              hurtful things to me too! n when she cant forgive me n when i
              actually gave her a chance?? I wrote her an email to explain n
              apologies…asking her to forgive me n start over…but she never reply
              me.. i ask her on msn whether have she read it she said she was
              busy so no time to read…i said if she felt that we really cannot
              work out it’s fine also…just tell me n i wont bother her anymore
              but she also never reply me….</p>
              <p>so what can do? do i take it as she couldn’t be bother by my
              email or she needed time to think about it….should i call her to
              press for an answer? or should i wait? or she not reading my email
              is an answer already? or should i just move on?</p>
              <p>I’m deeply confuse…help….<br> &amp; thanks for reading my long story…</p>

              <p>There is no point in saying this, as most people won't realise that love is about how you can give to your other half, not how much they can give to you. The same goes for TS, though I won't blame him for that.</p>
              <p>The main issue now is for TS's mind to settle down and decide whether he still want to continue this relationship or not.</p>

              <p>Hi All,<br>I’m v bother by wat has happen to me lately…n i desperately trying to find an ans n direction to it…i hope some of u ppl out there can give me ur opinions on it.<br>My ex-gf broke up with me 7-8 mths back..her reason was being unable to blend in with my circle of friends &amp; not confident in herself…which i still dun really buy..we dated for 3 yrs back then.<br>I’ve learn to adjust my life back &amp; was getting on good. then she came knocking begging if we could patch back together. I was happy, confuse &amp; scared. Becoz i’m afraid she might just leave again like she did without much explanation. however i give her an opening to explain n worm her way back in….we went out acouple of times, hold hands n kiss. but i still wasnt sure i wanna her back in completely… becoz during our conversation she sometimes will joke about buying houses &amp; getting married etc…which make me feel uneasy, she knew i always wanted to settle down with her back when we are together..but i wasnt sure this time round..i needed time to ease in.<br>One night when we were talking on the phone, she mention jokingly say about getting a hse etc..then i remember seeing some of her party pics she posted online right after we broke off with a group of frds…guys n gals…but i some of them r quite intimate..like lying on guys shoulder, hugging etc…then in a spur of the moment i said whether is it because she couldnt find other better guys tatz y she came n look for me..n ask her to go for those guys on the pics if she is just looking at me as just spare tyre..</p>
              <p>yes i know i’m been a jerk n mean by saying all these…but would anyone of you will feel same as me? or is it just me?.. Anyway i’ve apologies profusely straightaway after i said it, knowing it was very harsh.. she took it v badly…<br>ok now..i feel that i may have made a bad remarks…but i still wishes we can work things out if it’s not what i thought it is…so i said sorry &amp; told her we can tried to make it work again…but she refused n got really really mad at me..saying if i really love her i shouldn’t have said all those…i admit i make a nasty comment but isn’t it natural for me to have these thoughts for wat had happen to me? plus when she wanna break off with she said lots of hurtful things to me too! n when she cant forgive me n when i actually gave her a chance?? I wrote her an email to explain n apologies…asking her to forgive me n start over…but she never reply me.. i ask her on msn whether have she read it she said she was busy so no time to read…i said if she felt that we really cannot work out it’s fine also…just tell me n i wont bother her anymore but she also never reply me….</p>
              <p>so what can do? do i take it as she couldn’t be bother by my email or she needed time to think about it….should i call her to press for an answer? or should i wait? or she not reading my email is an answer already? or should i just move on?</p>
              <p>I’m deeply confuse…help….<br>&amp; thanks for reading my long story…</p>
