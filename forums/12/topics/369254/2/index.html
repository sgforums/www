              <p>Whether you are to move on or not.. it all depends on how much you want her to be with you.</p>
              <p>Obviously she is badly insulted by your remarks.</p>
              <p>While you think you are the one taking a huge risk taking her back, you must understand that she is also taking a huge risk patching back with you.</p>
              <p>All returner will fear being treated like a second class human being after going back to the original partner..unfortunately you had to go and actually treat her like one.</p>
              <p>She has made it very clear to you that it is because of the way you think about the comeback relationship that made the return a difficult one.</p>
              <p>Your actions and hurtful things you said proved that you are NOT into the relationship either. So why would a girl stick around a guy who is not going to put in 100% ?</p>
              <p>So, if you want to have her back.. you must allay her fear, and give her tons of reassurance that you will not make the same mistake a second time.</p>
              <p>Giving her 6 months is too long.. anything can change the playing field during this few months.</p>
              <p>You should let her know NOW that you are willing to wait until she is emotionally ready to trust you again. And will do all you can to make it work this time.</p>
              <p>Keep the line open.. and prod her once a while. Continue to woo her like the way you used to before both of you become a couple.</p>
              <p>But if you don't want to continue .. then it's best to end it now lor. This part.. very easy lah.</p>

              <p>We can only give you advices, nothing more than that. Whether you still want to go after her again is your own choice, though we will advice you not to get your hopes up too high.</p>
              <p>Think about it, if she were to come back to you again, odds are she got played around by another guy (again). To come back to you due to such a reason is...</p>

              <p>There is no point in saying this, as most people won't realise

              much they can give to you. The same goes for TS, though I won't

              <p>well, if TS were to realize not to expect anything..he can take it...no expectations..no disappointment..i do agree with you that TS need to col and settle..but even if he wants to continue..he might not be able to..nothing is impossible unless someone gives you an opening..</p>
              <p>his gal needs to work things out with him..need to know his side of the story..they both need to see from each other's view point if they love each other..</p>

              <p>Thanks for all the advices. She has replied my email. Saying she
              cannot be with me knowing my mentally that i'm thinking she came
              back to me becoz she couldnt find anyone else. &amp; hope it's
              better we can be remains as friends. As much as i want her back i
              also respect her decision &amp; knowing her the more i press her
              the more she will close up..anyway i knew i mess up.</p>
              <p>During our last break up, she keep all the photos we had
              together posted online, statue she still put "attached"..This time
              if she also didnt remove it...(yet)...so can i presume i still
              stand a chance if i let her cool off n forget abt tis for another
              6mths or so?..abt the same period we broke off previously..while
              during this period i'll just linger ard as "friend" to provide her
              with watever she needs.. or u guys thinks that i should forget
              about the whole thing n move on..</p>

              <p>she's trying to play innocent and trying to make you feel guilty.</p>
              <p>given her track record, likely she'll just break up with you for some obscure reason later on too. Did you ever find out what shewas doing after breakup?</p>

              <p>Stop calling yourself a jerk, you were just being a tad too direct when you questioned her.</p>
              <p>When it comes to relationship, there is rarely such a thing as totally right or totally wrong. She has a right to be out with other guys after she broke up with you, she has the right to want you to settle down with her, but you also have the right to question why she came back to you again.</p>
              <p>Try to keep all these to a side of your mind, otherwise you won't be able to truly enjoy your backpacking trip across other countries.</p>
              <p>Enjoy and have fun on your trip.</p>

              <p>Trust her best friend. There is a chance that both of them are scheming this together. Even if they are not, from the looks of matters, I can assure you her best friend knows her better than you know her.</p>
              <p>Of course, the most important thing is that you must still have feelings for her too, and wishes to be together with her again. If you truly think so, than you must be prepared to be "tekkan" by her for awhile, especially if this is something which the two girls have came up with together.</p>
              <p>If you want to forget about her, then get ready your fieldpacks for your backpacking trip.</p>

              <p>Giving her flowers or her favourite cheesecake is something you usually won't even do ? What kind of a bf are you ? U don't seem to give a hoot about pleasing your gf at all.</p>

              <p>No, I think you really should just leave her alone. I'm very sure she can find a guy who will treat her better elsewhere.</p>

              <p>Instead of trusting your buddies, you should seek help from her close friends instead. They will give you another earful again, but I believe that they will be able to understand and know what she will want, and what she would not mind.</p>
              <p>If you want to take action, then go ahead. But do not take action only because you feel that you will regret it later if you do not do so. The reason for what you are going to do now, is to make her come back to your side, remember that.</p>
              <p>And please try getting a bouquet instead of a single flower. If you have the courage to do so, then kneel down on one knee, and ask for her forgiveness. Nothing is too cheesy, if you are willing to try. But of course, you know her better than any of the forummers here, so you will be a better judge of your ownself and your actions.</p>
              <p>If you do not want her to go look for another guy, then you better hurry up. This is all I can advise you for now.</p>

              <p>Sending her flowers to her office is ok.</p>
              <p>Standing outside her office is stalking her, so that's not good.</p>
              <p>Besides, how long ago is the break up already ? She probably already found another guy by now. It will be awkward if you just show up and her new boyfriend is fetching her at the office.</p>
              <p>Ofcors you need action now. Don't you even know how to woo/chase a woman ? Just treat her like you just know her and woo her from the beginning AGAIN !</p>
