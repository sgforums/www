It will pass when you wake up one day thinking is not worth it cos she had found a new bf.<br>Most important she does not love you so what even you are with her?<br>What makes you think she will not sleep around or flirt around or use you to her own needs?<br><br>If she loves you then she will do things for you if not she will dump you asap once she is done with you.

The poison is embedded within your soul and if you don't enlighten yourself, you will eventually become one.<br><br>This is because every stalker brandish, mentally, with these sort of love obsession, haunting fear and running imagination... like yourself. It will become so deadly that they will gradually fail to see through this insidious transformation they have grown into and is likely to employ bias 'logical' reasoning to back up their erratic behaviour.<br><br>Love is so natural that when it actually affects your basis relationship with her (namely friendship), something is quite wrong somewhere.

I always have fears that some other guy will appear or reappear and take her away and i want to see if its real so keep wanting to wait for her at her block or calling her on her hp mobile to see if she's home. i don't want to become a stalker!!! most of the times i mng to stop myself before i make mistakes but i've gone to her block before even though i know it is stupid n wrong....the fear n sorrow sometimes is so great that it affects some of my conversations with her. I try to go out n hang out with my frens bt once i have sum quiet time i start thinking agn. I can't say we are very close but we talk on the phone once a week and on msn. Sometimes she gives me mixed signals about us even though she said before most likely we can only b frens, and i read and think too much into her words n actions. I think we might have a chance but after all that happen i dun wanna move too fast and yet i'm afraid if i dun do anything, i will lose the chance once she starts working. why am i so suspicious???!!!!Think i'm goin mad hhhhheeelppppppp</div></blockquote>relax la brader. Take it slow and steady and try to not be a kanchiong spider. all will work out for you.</div>
