            <div class='col-md body'>We're classmates &amp; we've known each other for quite some time liao.  She knows that I have feelings for her.  When we talk to each other, I can feel that she's telling me that I do stand a chance.<br><br>One fine day when we were talking, I admitted that I had fell for her.  But I do not have the intention of wanting her as my gf.  I just let her know that I DO like her.  She's not really surprised &amp; looked rather happy in fact.  Her respond was like this...  she didn't reject me, nor did she accept me.  She still wants to remain friends with me &amp; see how things go first before making any decisions.  That simply means I still do have a chance.  We still talked as usual after that.  But after a few days, dunno for what reason, things started to change.<br><br>We don't talk like we used to anymore.  She's giving me the cold treatment,  I feel really awkward.  I asked her what's happening between us...  through ICQ.  She told me she feels awkward when I keep quiet &amp; treated her too nicely.  She hopes we can still remain as friends for now.  I told her...  Of course we're still friends.  And though I liked her, I never really had the intention of making her my gf.  But I still, DO care for her, a lot.  She seems ok after that chat.  I thought maybe things will go back to normal.  But no...  she's still treating me like an alien.  Didn't she say she still wanna be friends?!  So why is she behaving like that?!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>You see, I'm a passive kind of guy while she's the bubbly &amp; cheerful type.

She may feel that you may have the intention/motive to chase her. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Together with the fact that she is actually the one minding, because once you admitted your feelings, she will be very conscious of your every move, words, etc. She could mis-read about you and deemed it as not-being yourself - which will indirectly cause the awkwardness in her.<br><br>To save such situations, I only have two words: Act normal. When she is awkward, avoid being awkward yourself. Act normal, as if you said nothing or you had no feelings for her apart from good friends. Be generous about your situations and if people wants to alien themselves from you, don't let it affect you. Just continue to be yourself and eventually your action will lead them to be normal gradually. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You have to induce back the old times, you can't expect it to appear from nowhere.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think she is half expecting you to start to woo her ... But you din, which makes her kindda ... want to distance from you? Anyway, from most cases, if you confess that you like a girl, it will end either with both of you as a couple, or not friends at all. Unlikely you can maintain your friendship with a gal after confession. That's why if you intend to confess, be prepared to loss the friendship as well. But then, NOT all cases are the same, maybe yours is different? If you really liked her, why not give this relationship a try? The sweetest relationship developes from a hardship that was conquered.<br><br>Good luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I for myself, would just do what my good old mate told me, "sit down, shut up, stare... like them". My point is, I just shut up and let actions speak louder than words, if I love anyone, I prove it, I don't say it, because speech and knowledge of such feelings always causes these sort of problems. Its far better to show your actions of love and recieve it back from her in return rather than idle chitter chatter love talk.<br></div>
