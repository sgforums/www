Either she is trying to give people the impression that she *HAS* a boyfriend... OR trying to send mix signal to you - likely, BOTH. Think about this, if she is staying at her boyfriend house, its has nothing to do with you right?

If she wants you to be confused - be firm and sensible. When she msg you, oh, I staying over my bf house - reply as the msg back as if you don't even give a damn. 'Alright baby, enjoy yourself, but today sure too be happening one. Hehez.' kind of msg. Remember this: Who are you to her right? And who is she to you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Do not ever get xin ruan - soft-hearted, because if you do, you never know whats her intention. If you know you sure won't be able to make it through that way, commuication and settle once and for all. Talk to her, make things clear. After you do that and before you post it here to update the situation, give me a private message saying that you communicated already: wait for my reply and see if my prediction of that outcome is correct anot. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers.</div>
