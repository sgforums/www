Yes? No? Maybe?<br><br>Your friend is in a state of delusion. He forced the girl into a loveless relationship, and now he's complaining that he girl doesn't love him.<br><br>I say you should go and tell him point-blank that the girl doesn't love him at all. Tell him should just do the right thing and break up with her.<br><br>Even if it breaks his heart to do so, then he deserves it. That's what he gets for not respecting the wishes and privacy of that girl. People like him make the rest of us guys look bad.<br><br>Bottom line... If the girl wants to like someone, then it should be of her own free will. You have absolutely no right to force her into liking your friend. If you do so, then you're not much better than him.</div>
