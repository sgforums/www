              <p>I'm 29 now, she's 27.</p>
              <p>I was there for her when she broke up with her ex (of 7yrs), 3.5yrs ago. I was there when she decided to change her job, when her favourite pet died, when she got a chronic illness and got depression due to that. I did everything I could to make her feel loved, to be one to solve her problems, to travel via cab when going out because she needs alot of rest, because she gets fatigued easily, leading to more pain. To accompany her even if it meant travelling to and fro, myself often reaching home late.</p>
              <p>She struggled with her pain and depression, when nobody seemed to understand what it means to be in her shoes. It is tough on her. I thought I was on the right track or at least was close to it.</p>
              <p>She ended the r/s a month ago. Her friends and colleagues and mum and doc took her side. I know I had my failings, failings which to me could be made right given some time. But not to her, someone who thinks alot about things and usually makes negative assumptions on them, as much as I had tried to inject some positivity to her.</p>
              <p>I am totally broken now. She has blocked me on social media. She now has her colleagues and friends' support. I don't really have any.</p>
              <p>I really don't know what to do. 
              My entire life revolved around her.
              There's nothing in my life except working, eating and sleeping now. Almost everything that I see and use are related to her in some way.</p>
              <p>I NEED HELP. PLEASE HELP.</p>

              <p>Life is a learning process.</p>
              <p>True love means you will support the person you truly love without asking anything for return.</p>
              <p>She may not love you but I believe in your heart you are glad that you did all the best you could to help her. If I asked you to go back to the past and do it once again, you will do it knowing she will never love you.</p>
              <p>I know is hard, I was there too like you once seeing her with others is a like knife to your heart. Asking for an answer on why she never even care about me when I put in so much effort for her.</p>
              <p>The answer you seek is to first accept the fact you done what you could to help the girl you love so much and is time to let go. Is not easy, even I took years to let go but I finally did and saw her with her new found partner and her kids, gave me the answer that I seek,</p>
              <p>"Letting her go and be free for her to be the one she truly loves and knowing she will be happy for the rest of her life is more important than forcing her to be with someone who she do not really love."</p>

              <p><br>again here saving and amount justified to be 'more' or 'less' is subjective here. somepeople spend millions few that it si insignificant, while some people tell them to spend'1 dollar' so can get free gift that is a red herring they also will not spend. so if you do not feel a pinch really that;s is your own problem.</p>
              <p>do not trust what you see or feel, love is blind and if she feel the same way you do whu seh leave you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>now we need to know why she suddenly leave you? we need to know her side of the story. you feel sad yes, but do you think cum here cry farther and mother and get some comforting words from people you will feel better?</p>
              <p>garner pity and i read your post so many loopholes. come one own up we need to know the real truth what happened <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I'm 29 now, she's 27.</p>
              <p>I was there for her when she broke up with her ex (of 7yrs),
              3.5yrs ago. I was there when she decided to change her job, when
              her favourite pet died, when she got a chronic illness and got
              depression due to that. I did everything I could to make her feel
              loved, to be one to solve her problems, to travel via cab when
              going out because she needs alot of rest, because she gets fatigued
              easily, leading to more pain. To accompany her even if it meant
              travelling to and fro, myself often reaching home late.</p>
              <p>She struggled with her pain and depression, when nobody seemed
              to understand what it means to be in her shoes. It is tough on her.
              I thought I was on the right track or at least was close to it.</p>
              <p>She ended the r/s a month ago. Her friends and colleagues and
              mum and doc took her side. I know I had my failings, failings which
              to me could be made right given some time. But not to her, someone
              who thinks alot about things and usually makes negative assumptions
              on them, as much as I had tried to inject some positivity to
              her.</p>
              <p>I am totally broken now. She has blocked me on social media. She
              now has her colleagues and friends' support. I don't really have
              any.</p>
              <p>I really don't know what to do. My entire life revolved around
              her. There's nothing in my life except working, eating and sleeping
              now. Almost everything that I see and use are related to her in
              some way.</p>
              <p>I NEED HELP. PLEASE HELP.</p>

              <p>Where are your close friends and buddies? Confide in them. Talk to them about how you feel.</p>
              <p>At this point of time, seek your network of support. </p>
              <p>Later, some distance and time will let you heal.</p>
              <p>Then, with some introspection maybe you'll learn something from this relationship. </p>

              <p>I have no intention to calculate. I have always put her ahead of
              myself. If certain spending was required, I would spend it - I just
              spent less on myself(although I was already spending closing to
              nothing on personal 'wants' due to a need to save for our future. I
              am not well off.)</p>
              <p>She knows it. She is not materialistic and she has been trying

              <p>Later when you feel better, you'll realize with all that free time, you can focus on yourself. Spend time with family. Give back to community. Develop new hobbies, exercise and eat healthy.</p>
              <p>Breaking up with you is her choice, frankly nothing much you can do. Respect her decision. Revisiting it again and again right now is normal. The self blame aspect is alright but don't over indulge. Like fugazzi always say, emotions are like clouds. <img style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>Do you wanna post her number here?</p>
              <p>I believe she's been with too few guys in her "mature" life: just you for these 3.5 years and one other guy from the ages of 16.5 to 23.5. Therefore she does not know a good thing when it's gone. Even if you had married her, girls who have been with too few guys tend to wander about, so perhaps breaking up was a good thing for you.</p>
              <p>For you, you might have more experience but it does not hurt to get more. In the end you will still be able to select a more suitable partner.</p>
              <p>So, seriously, post her number here and see what we learn from her?</p>
