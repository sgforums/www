              That is the way it is and no one is wrong. However, I would add that is that you ''lost'' yourself in this relationship and moreover what has u suffering is that your sense of self came about thru her. What u have lost was never u and what u really lost was simply what u thought u were.  She was adding value to u, adding meaning to u .... now it is gone. In other words, the props are gone. Now u have to deal with the ''real'' u as it is and hence the immense pain and sense of loss!  Love never hurts, it is always needs/expectations that another fulfil me. Imagine both use the word love but behind it two are having needs/expectaations - it is most likely to be that of taking as much out as possible from this relationship and both have been reduced to commodities.
              Mutual benefit scheme is the reality of most relationships! Love is being vulnerable and the element of uncertainty is always there - hence the quickness of wanting to make it into a relationship or owning another one.
              Only understanding and hopefully unlearning that transforms, otherwise, that which is unreconciled will again repeat it self.

              <p>when you have done your best, and the outcome isn't what it is supposed to be, be happy anyway, because you have done your best and you still couldn't change the outcome... then it's best to move to other things... they say something like if there's something beyond your control, then there's no point worrying about it...</p>
              <p>i dun think you should be afraid sg not enough girls right... i can easily introduce you some very pretty girls but they are materialistic, you want? i siam them and dun contact them but if you want i can pass you their number. other guys pls dun pm me, i won't entertain.</p>

              @DRC - I'm not selfless, I cannot imagine her with someone else. I know it's stupid.
              
              @Kaylin - Thank you for the encouragement... with your first post.
              
              @Just_do_it_lah - Thanks, I will have a look at those 2 songs. Likely lead to tears.
              
              @jojobeach - Kind of true, but the imprints are everywhere. While life was plain previously, so many things are intertwined with her. Really many many things.
              
              @alize - I cannot confirm the effect of peer influence. But based on her side of the story, it seems everyone took their stand against me. It is sad if there was a significant effect. No, I'm not going to post her number here. Yes, from 16 till now she only has that 7yr r/s and 3.5yr with me. There's bound to be comparison, overlapping areas, sadly.
              
              @soleachip - I don't really have close friends. Maybe that's why I posted here. Can't tell the future, each hour and day seems to pass so slowly. No matter what I do, the emotions just can't be suppressed.
              
              @Fcukpap - I'm losing control of my emotions. My mind just keeps coming back to this.
              
              @Fugazzi - You are right. I lost myself in the r/s. She was the one I gave all my attention and time to. Expectations, I came to realize that near the end. There were many things she expected, some which I knew but failed to achieve. But there were some which I really did not know or had a totally wrong understanding of, maybe I feel 'aggrieved' over these.
              
              @troublemaker2005 - We weren't friends, but a couple. That is certain.
              
              @DailyFreeGames.com - Maybe I did my best for some things, but there is this deep regret over some which I failed to give my best or give what was expected. Or did but too late.
              
              I thank you all for your comforting, direct words and that you took the effort to reply. I'm taking this very, very hard right now. As much as I should try to move on, my mind is a blank and the hours and days pass by ever so slowly.
              
              A mixture of profound sadness at the outcome, anger at some of the expectations which I really didnt know of, regret and frustration at my failings which could have salvaged the r/s, and helplessness as I don't know what the near future and beyond holds...
              
              Refusal to accept the reality, possessive of her even when she's gone and knowing some guy will have her, her everything. It is so, so painful. My heart physically aches each time my mind thinks of every and any thing related to her... I can't stop it...

              <p>Your life seemed to be revolving around her totally which shld not be the way. The key here is totally thats why when things fall apart it becomes a bit hard to take. i rmb u said u did wrong things too which u'll need time to make it right? wad are these things and was these things that lead to everyone else standing on her side? What we are reading here is a victimised point of view from your side and though it can be understood because of all the pain you are feeling, but if you are hoping for better relationships, it wld be good that you really know where u went wrong this time round.</p>
