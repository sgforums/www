              <p>I am totally broken now. She has blocked me on social media. She now has her colleagues and friends' support. I don't really have any.</p>

              <p>To TS,</p>
              <p>I understand the pain and hurt you are going through, the effort, the time. Question is does the person cares? Sadly to say I ever ask the ladies how do they really feel about people like us who give so much, the answer were very shocking. Here are a few of them.</p>
              <p>1) The guys who treat us well are dumb and stupid, I never asked them to do it what, they are just willing parties who is only useful at that point of time.</p>
              <p>2) What those type of guys are the most useless type, I just treat them like dirt and they will treat me like a princess.</p>
              <p>3) These guys are so ugly, I only using them temp to get what I want. Then dump them asap before they expect anything in return.</p>
              <p>4) Why borther with them? They suck and are only useful when the one you love dumps you and they are always there for the rebound.</p>
              <p>5) They are only useful if the love of my life dumps me and the dump guy will take care of me with the and the unborn baby.</p>
              <p>There are more nasty answers which I have heard, which are more shocking and too damaging to be put up here.</p>
              <p>Question for TS: Are you sure that the gal you like is not using you as these girls did? Yes you can deny but facts of reality shows that she has dumped you after your efforts.</p>

              <p>They ask themselves earnestly, "Is this the person I want to spend the rest of my life with?" Should the answer turn out to be a "No". The relationship come to an abrupt end.</p>

              <p>2) Don't be a puppy/sugar daddy/understanding/sympathising man.It's an uttern turn off for woman. This job is left to other female friends,not for a man.</p>
              <p>3) Read 'the game' from Neil strauss.</p>
              <p>4) Get drunk,njoy life, bang a few chicks get over her.</p>
              <p>5) Don't repeat this again, ever.</p>
              <p>6)Next time when you are with a girl, lay her and fcuk her. Don't be a sympathy sponge. I am sure, you were a nice understanding guy,so never took advantage of a poor girl. THAT IS WHY IT HAPPENED. Now there is another guy who she is sexually attracted to.Don't bother checking all girls will deny it.</p>
              <p>7)Don't listen to opinions/advice of other females,will never work. Especially stay away from jojobeach's opinion.</p>
              <p>8)Move on.</p>

              <p>To TS,</p>
              <p>I understand the pain and hurt you are going through, the effort, the time. Question is does the person cares? Sadly to say I ever ask the ladies how do they really feel about people like us who give so much, the answer were very shocking. Here are a few of them.</p>
              <p>1) The guys who treat us well are dumb and stupid, I never asked them to do it what, they are just willing parties who is only useful at that point of time.</p>
              <p>2) What those type of guys are the most useless type, I just treat them like dirt and they will treat me like a princess.</p>
              <p>3) These guys are so ugly, I only using them temp to get what I want. Then dump them asap before they expect anything in return.</p>
              <p>4) Why borther with them? They suck and are only useful when the one you love dumps you and they are always there for the rebound.</p>
              <p>5) They are only useful if the love of my life dumps me and the dump guy will take care of me with the and the unborn baby.</p>
              <p>There are more nasty answers which I have heard, which are more shocking and too damaging to be put up here.</p>
              <p>Question for TS: Are you sure that the gal you like is not using you as these girls did? Yes you can deny but facts of reality shows that she has dumped you after your efforts.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> When you have position your entire life
              around a transitory figure, naturally, you are bound to be on the
              road to emotional destruction. It is not the risky preposition you
              have adopted in an absolute sense, but rather, the concept of
              giving yourself up (inclusive of your personal self worth) has a
              drastic reduction of social value, which would often transform you
              into 'something else' other than the guy she first knew.</p>
              <p>When you play the role of a boyfriend, you must understand that
              that is not a nurse, maid or personal assistant; the intensity of
              your love &amp; care might come across as potentially choking.</p>
              <p>Though it may appear that your writings seemed to suggest that
              you are more positive, subconsciously, you are likely to be
              negative (probably similar or worst). The seeming positive facade
              is somewhat ingeniously masks through overcompensating care and
              concern while the real insecurity nest within the core. If you were
              to be bluntly honest to yourself, you <em>might</em> actually
              realize that <em>probably</em> you care more about having to
              accomplish the final step to your next phase of life instead of
              your ex-gf per se.</p>
              <p>Your post does not reveal anything about your stated 'failings',
              other than a string of narcissistic perception. Perhaps, you could
              post - not what you have done for her - but her chief
              considerations to call it quit. The picture would then be
              clearer. </p>
              <p>P.S: You might have lost the relationship, but you could still
              keep those lessons. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
