            <div class='col-md body'>Aren't we missing something here, guys?  The key issue here is MidiLand's problem, not whatever's bothering the ex.<br><br>For whatever reason, the ex blew it.  He had his shot and he blew it.  It's over and someone else is in the driving seat now, so he may as well take a reality check.<br><br>Now you may well be right - the ex could simply be sitting around like the family dog at the dining table waiting for someone to feed him.  On the other hand, let's not discount the possibility that the ex is thinking that if he can't have the girl, he can try to derail things with the next guy.<br><br>In either case, it's irrelevant.  The fact of the matter is that we don't know what the ex is thinking, and it's not really part of the problem being discussed here.  The problem is that whatever the ex is doing is spoiling things for MidiLand and his girlfriend,and he's asking for suggestions to solve this specific problem.</div>

Let them settle this themselves. She has to let him know that they are OVER and it's IMPOSSIBLE for them to be together because she NO LONGER loves him. There will probably be strong resistance and conflicts, therefore it is advisable to meet in the day instead of night. She make her ideas known to him, and tells him that if she feels harassed again, byebye - level two is activated. (This is positive)<br><br>II) Complete ignore. No respond of ANY kind, even if he threaten suicide. He place his gift, it is left at where it is. Tell all your family and whoever, that nobody is suppose to touch that thingy and instruct to leave it where it is. This should settle it, if not... (This is neutral)<br><br>III) Extreme. Maintain level two, just that she become extreme and seek ways to destroy that ego of his. Smash his present outside the house and leave it that way. Still avoid contact and if circumstances is such that she has to speak, employ strong body and verbal language to fight her way through. (This is negative)<br><br>You should also give her some time to get through this mini drama. Don't pressure her to solve everything; the issue here is WORK TOGETHER to end this drama. She is probably trying to do her own method, but if it doesn't work, it is time to come together and find some solution mutually. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

But after they broke off, they still meet up as frenz and stuffs like that.. It was alright with me in the begining, but EVERYDAY CALL HER! when she ignore his call, he would go to her place at 3 AM and put a letter on her desk.. WTH! </div></blockquote>ic.. they still meet up as frenz after they broke off.. issit becos of the relationship of u and her tt stopped them from meeting up..? or even talk as fren?</div>

Our job, therefore, is to keep grilling him until we find out what he MUST be hiding - let's not give up until we find dirt.
