              <h1 class="subject">Upset...In School... desperate... Need some help... a trapped 14 years old guy...?</h1>
              <div class="content">I
              don't know if I had done the right thing... I am currently 14 and
              studying in a Secondary School of Singapore... I used to have a group
              of four friend we were is a rather good relationship... One day I try
              to help one of the guy to complete his maths project he didn't do it
              but I did it. He wanted to copy mine but it will take very long as he
              had a lot of homework which he had yet to be done and I need to hand up
              the project on that day very same day so I got a piece of blank paper
              and copy down the work that I had done for him. After I done he said
              thank you... well I must say I was quite happy but then one of my
              friend say 'see this guy is so nice, yet you are unappreciative' as I
              was very bored I started to provoke him... I said words like '
              Absolutely' for fun of course, i didn't mean that obviously but I must
              say I didn't consider his feeling.... After I said that he returned me
              the piece of paper I had copied specially for him. I didn't know what I
              was doing...I believe I was rather angry at that time, I must say I was
              rather angry at that moment... so i think i say thing like ' Why? I
              copied for you trying to help you yet you rejected my offer ' I think I
              was angry at that point of time... He also started to argue with me
              although I cant remember... He soon disliked me and never had talk to
              me anymore...Because the guy I had quarrel with had a strong connection
              with the other 3 friends, although the 3 guy who i didn't quarrel with
              was not hating me or dislike me, it was only a matter of time when that
              will happen... I don't want to be out of friends and be so lonely...
              worst still the guy who I had quarreled sit right beside me and I knew
              in long term it will be a disadvantage to me... I want to get back my
              friendship with the guy sitting beside me but just how? I am trapped...
              I don't know how I regretted my action... and I need to be friend with
              him cause I don't have a choice as they are the smartest in class and
              sort of the most popular in class... I need them... if I don't have
              them, during project work, I won't be having a group and high chance
              that I will be getting a ZERO for the project work... which I don't
              want... Dear readers what should I do? Just what to get back a
              friendship with them? I believe they like me because I am helpful? I
              just need to get back a friendship with them probably a stable one...
              what should I do? Did I do anything very wrong? I am rather straight
              forward...I really need a answer... Any answer or reply from you
              readers will be greatly appreciated..</div>
