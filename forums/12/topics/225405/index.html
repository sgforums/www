            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>GUIDELINES IN AUNT AGONY</strong></span><br><br>I) Whenever possible, try not to post people's problem. If possible, introduce them to SGF AA and get them to post instead. Firstly, it's not very nice to post people's problems in a public forum like this? And even if they allow it, I believe that they are still the best person to relate their agony?<br><br>II) If possible, write more... describe more... and explain more about your problem. Some people like to post their problem without giving sufficient information or leaving certain critical information out. It affects people's advice, because certain critical information affects the entire perspective altogether. Of course if there are things which you are not comfortable in revealing, you can opt not to. Or better still, you could PM some of the regulars, whom you can trust and speak to them.<br><br>III) You don't have to write very well, but here's two tips that forumites in AA will be grateful for.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 1</span><br><br>Please paragraph if you are writing an essay.<br><br>E.g:<br><br>this is embarrassing to say because i have never actually made public in forums what i feel...i hope some of you can advise me quite reasonably and sensibly to the following situation.I met this guy through a girl friend of mine. I didn't feel anything towards him at first sight because quite honestly he is not goodlooking but pleasant enough. After he met me and we went out together(with friends), he told my friend that he thought i was cute. My friend is really good friends with him so she told me what he thought about me. The thing is that the term "cute" is used very loosely so....i don't know.. anyway, what happened next was he asked my friend for my ICQ #. We chat occasionally but i realized that recently he doesn't talk to me if i am online. Is he being shy? or has lost interest? am i just being too paranoid about what he thinks of me? Of course when i start a conversation with him he always replies back but why doesn't he try to start a convo with me first?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 2</span><br><br>Do not attempt alternative caps writing style.<br><br>E.g:<br><br>PleAsE dO nOt wRitE likE tHat bEcAuSe It'S nOt OnlY dAmN bLoOdiE IrRitAtIng, iT aCtUaLLy AffEcTs PeOplE's mOoD iN giViNg pRoPer AdViCes. wOrSt wHen yOu CoMbiNe EsSay... ZeRo PaRaGrAphInG aNd AltErNatE CaPs TYpInG... ChAnCEs arE, yOu aRe UsUaLly fLaMed uNtiL yOu dO sOmeThIng aBouT iT.<br><br>IV) Aunt Agony do not encourage gender bashing. Although it's a common sight in AA, like cats on the street - if possible keep it minimal? Same goes for overly religious discussion?<br><br>V) Topics out of hand, multiple entries or completely irrelevant are at high risk of being locked. If the topics is slightly off (non-AA related)... it shouldn't be much of an issue (E.g. Mushy Gang Chat topic) - although this is subjected to moderator's discretion.<br><br>VI) Try not to hijack problem threads by posting another problem in someone else's problem thread. Hijack by crapping is not encouraged as well.<br><br>V) Aunt Agony ISN'T a replacement for professional counselling. Should you experience crisis that requires professional attention, please call any of the hotline available <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=238593" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br><br>VI) Every poster is ACCOUNTABLE for their own advice. Likewise, every problem-seeker is ACCOUTABLE for whom they seek advice from. Aunt Agony is NOT responsible, should any mishap/misunderstanding/misdemeanour that arise from specific advice/s dispense by individuals. Aunt Agony is merely an online forum for people to air their problems. Aunt Agony is NOT responsible for anything OUTSIDE the boundary of Sgforums - Aunt Agony. Specific individual is responsible.<br><br>Outside the boundaries of Sgforums - Aunt Agony include (but not limited to): chat program/s of any sort (MSN/Yahoo Messenger/etc), contact numbers (Mobile/Office/Home/etc), emails/friendster/etc, personal address or any meet up in reality. The decision to diverge private information or to accept private meet-ups are solely based on one's discretion. Aunt Agony CANNOT be held responsible for anything outside it's own boundaries as stated above.<br><br>VII) To err is human - nobody is perfect. Aunt Agony is a thankless job and do give credits to people who have spent a portion of their time lending someone else a listening ear. Nobody's advice is superior than another - what's more important is the willingness to lend stranger/s on the other side of Singapore, a viritual hand to lift him/her spiritually.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to add in a few too, though it may seem offensive but it is for the sake of both present and future Thread Starters aka "Tao Suans" and forumites posting in here alike:<br><br>TS - No matter what advices/comments/remarks posted in the thread started by you, you do not take it literally and too seriously. Even if it makes much sense and can help alot, ultimately it is in your onus to decide for yourself what are you going to do about it.<br><br>Forumites posting here - For issues that really warrant help and such, do observe that what we as "kind helpers" can do to help the troubled, we cannot influence the TS's views and thinkings to such an extent that "TS do exactly as I said". This normally means you are already responsible for their actions and aftermath.<br><br>Also take note that what works for you may NOT work for the TS. So you may somewhat feel "fustrated" that your opinions or advice are "omitted" but you should feel glad that you at least did a fair share of offering help. AND you may have helped someone indirectly. Not for the TS but to someone reading your post and found it helpful.<br><br>In the end, the Thread Starters who post in AA are seeking help. The least we, as readers, can do is to share a listening ear or in this case, a KEEN eye and share their troubles, NOT add more to their misery. Some people are looking for ways and perhaps answers. Others are just looking for a place of comfort.<br><br>Sometimes the best remedy to a problem is not immediate solution, but patience, willingness to listen and compassion.<br><br>P.S. If really not suitable hor, can erase.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

(Sorry no offence, its an EXAMPLE...)<br><br>Instead, post something closely to what you are about to put down, like "There is a man in my life who did this to me" or "This girl I know did something..."<br><br>As Yunhaier said, gender bashing is not encouraged in here.
