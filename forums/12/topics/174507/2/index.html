            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm to sum up what I have to say about this topic...<br><br>Sorry if I'm too critical in my previous posts ^^;<br><br>I had a friend of mine whom will only call me when he needs to borrow money from me, and his attitude is similar to Devil's friend. Really makes me pissed when he shot out the "We are friends for so long. So little money you can't even fork out to lend me?"...... Haiz, so-called friends who never contact me for a couple of years and their only calls are to borrow money... And his best statement "I know you are having a meeting now but I can rush over to your workplace and get your ATM card. Just give me your pin and I'll return to you  when I draw out the amount I need.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">So far i only one person approached me to borrow money. $50 i could still afford at that time, so I lent her. She went around borrowing from a few colleagues also.  But she returned me the money once she got her pay.  I really din trust her, but I still lent it to her coz she really need the money.<br><br>I had another colleague who really had no money left in her account and she had to borrow from her younger bro who was still schooling.  What me and colleagues did was treat her to lunch and help her cut down on expenses.<br><br>Money is a very sensitive issue.  I will not borrow unless I'm really at my wits' end.  Worse come to worse, I borrow from my parents or sister.  I dun borrow from frens.  Coz it's still a test to the frenship.. and I think my frens have the same mindset as me.<br><br>u din mention why ur fren need the money.. if he/she wants the money to get an abortion, that's definitely a no no, i wun help.  </span></div>
