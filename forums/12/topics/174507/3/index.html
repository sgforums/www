Been days and I still can't settle on a decision. Hardly like myself.<br><br>This person whom I really wish to help and almost all I've asked advised me not to... (they either asked me not to help or they just kept quiet) Been telling me lies... Usual things.. Things about the loan also... Partial truth... Partial lies... Even despite the fact that after I've told that person NOT to lie to me or it'll just result in the lack of trust in each other... The person can still continue to LIE without blinking even the eyes once... Even after I REPEATEDLY PROMPTED... SAD is the case...<br><br>Logics tell me that I shouldn't fork out that $... People around me speaks of the same..<br><br>But even though a person lies, doesn't mean that that person is not genuinely in need of such a help... In which my decision could make quite a vital change in the whole situation... OR.. I could be so easily giving a chance for myself to be cheated once again... Of the $ and trust... And the troubles I might have invited for myself....<br><br>Blind belief itself doesn't work... I wish to help... But... Why all the lies...? Why ask "You can't trust me..?? I'm so disappointed in you..." To top the truth, I'm equally if not more disappointed than you are... How to TRUST with the LOOP HOLES and REPEAT LYINGS...?<br><br>Maybe I should just 'close the case'?</div></blockquote></div>
