How do you figure out the mind of a person who can smile at u so genuinely and sincerely in front of you one moment but is constantly "knifing'' you behind ur back the next?<br><br>Some reasons i can think of<br><br>-power<br>-greed<br>-jealusy<br>-love<br>-revenge/hatred<br>-self interest<br>-self-esteem problems hence the need to show others their "capability"<br>-those who are bullied want to redeem themselves<br>-to gain advantage over others<br>-cant accomplish tasks thru the "right" channels hence hv to use underhand means/taking convenient shortcut<br><br>But then again even those who are capable and can achieve success thru hard work on their own and proper "channels" may also backstab. Why?<br><br>Is it then due to imperfections in the management or policies of the company which puts employees on a lop-sided playing field, and which spurs people to think of all kinds of ways to get a head-start over others?<br><br>This leads me thinking.

Beyond your immediate environment/successes, there will always be another in a higher place. Even stars die. Me thinks it's right to do by yourself. Do right by others.<br><br>Even when I try avoiding stand offs, even when I'm not in a position important enough to warrant back stabbing and antagonism, sure enough someone else will think of some ways to stir some trouble. These people are bored people. They are either too bored, too unimportant or they are all women.<br><br>Moral of the story is speak very little. Speak only when necessary. Maintain a safe distance from unimportant co workers. Acknowledge them, be polite but don't show too much teeth. Forget about flaunting your personality, save that for the mistress or for bed time. That is the safest way. Do not engage in too much idle banter and quietly move away in the presence of ill conversation. That means when somebody is getting fired, told off, or spoken ill of.  See no evil. Hear no evil. Speak no evil.<br><br>Either that or you listen a lot and speak little. Information is power.<br><br>Sigh...</div>
