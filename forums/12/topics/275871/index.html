            <div class='col-md body'>Why do people backstab? Be it in school or in the office. How do you figure out the mind of a person who can smile at u so genuinely and sincerely in front of you one moment but is constantly "knifing'' you behind ur back the next?<br><br>Some reasons i can think of<br><br>-power<br>-greed<br>-jealusy<br>-love<br>-revenge/hatred<br>-self interest<br>-self-esteem problems hence the need to show others their "capability"<br>-those who are bullied want to redeem themselves<br>-to gain advantage over others<br>-cant accomplish tasks thru the "right" channels hence hv to use underhand means/taking convenient shortcut<br><br>But then again even those who are capable and can achieve success thru hard work on their own and proper "channels" may also backstab. Why?<br><br>Is it then due to imperfections in the management or policies of the company which puts employees on a lop-sided playing field, and which spurs people to think of all kinds of ways to get a head-start over others?<br><br>This leads me thinking. Is it possible to be wise enough to avoid being backstabbed by others ie avoiding the arrows and "knives" etc while a person goes on as usual doing their own stuff and business and still be able to rise to the top?<br>This does not mean they will totally not get involved in office politics, but they are the "third-party" rather than the "first-party" in the game of politics  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Any comments?<br><br></div>

So most people wants to be in that level. Who do not want to command people and direct others to do all the shi-t work?<br><br>Usually people who backstab are those who do not wish to work but want to get more than others. They want to show to the boss that they are the best and should get more bouns than others. Sadly is up to the boss to see which type of person they are.<br><br>How to prevent backstabbing.<br><br>1) Do your best to get very good grades. The higher position you hold the less people can backstab you.<br><br>2) Split your friends into smaller cell groups. Do not cross introduce each different friends in each cell. This will help if a person from one cell wants  to backstab you  the damage is limited to that cell only.<br><br>3) Stick to firm friends who have been thru thick and thin with you. They have proven their loyalty and they are the ones who will not backstab you.<br><br>4) In office, work hard and be smart, if you worth the price they pay you, most likely you will not be so easily backstab cos the good boss knows your worth and will not let you go.<br><br>5) If you cannot prevent backstabbing when the person is in a higher position try to be friends with them, let them change their options of you. The less your enemy feels that you are threat the less he or she will backstab you.<br><br>6) Remember the backstabers face, yes burn it into your brain cos this are the person who nv change. try to siam them as much as possible. If you are smart enough, bring them down before they can struck again. Remember unless you are darn good at this game then try this or you will be burnt in the process.</div>

But only one person will be able to reach the top. So, on the way, other climbers are pull, kicked or stabbed down to make way for a person who wish to be on the top. He/she has to be very tactful, skill, cunning, smart, strong, intelligent to conquer all. That is where the game begin.<br><br>The only bad news is the game never end as the ladder have no end, the person in the uppermost front must be wary of the the rest coming up, he/she must be on constant alert, worry and vigilant. A poor life.<br><br>Men and women are indebt to craving, power, lust and greed. Years of education and working just to create all this sins, by then, hell await them.<br><br>666<br>Angel</div>

Make sure u rise them up the ranks with you to get their loyalty and support. Because no one man can beat them all. Thats when u start to have more control. Some allies join u for their own reason. U must be able to know their true intentions and make sure u have something they want and that ur best interests is their best interest too.<br><br>Be prepared to drop the bomb on any of them when u feel that they trying to sabo them. N make sure the rest know that its better to be on ur good side.. then ur bad side.<br><br>Thus guarantee ur climb to power.
