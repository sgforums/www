              <p>Hi gr33ndoll,</p>
              <p>Since the answers to all the questions which Mr Milo has thoughtfully posted up are no, you should have a good idea of what to do right now.</p>
              <p>I will suggest that you get some help from your friends and tell that man directly that you wish to end your relationship with him. He may attempt to beg for you to stay, but please do not be fooled by him. However, if he turns aggressive, have your friends stand together with you as a group, and threaten to call the police if he turns aggressive.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>I am confused.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I knew a man from internet 3 months ago. We decided to meet
              up. Few days later, he said he misses me, loves me and
              wants me to be his girlfriend. Each time we meet, he will bring me
              to a park, we then kiss and engage in heavy petting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From the first day we met until now, he has never ceased to
              sending sms to me every day. However, the smses he sent to me were
              either what are you doing? do you want to meet? I feel so sad
              receiving this kind of messages... He never ask about my
              condition/situation whatsoever. A simple message showing care such
              as "how are you?" is a "hopeless" to hear from him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I feel ambivalent whether he really likes me or i am just his
              tool. Sometimes he will asks me to hotel, though, i never
              agree.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, he treats me pretty nice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What should i do? Should i trust him? Should i avoid him?
              ...</p>

              <p>do u wind up in physical contact every single time he asks to meet?</p>
              <p>if yes, then stop being physically intimate. by either ceasing contact with him, or being more pro active in planning other activities for dates.</p>
              <p>apart from snogging at the park, have u guys had dinner? played sports? window shopped? seen a show?</p>
              <p>there's no harm in testing him first before making up ur mind (if u're still unsure). the best person to answer ur questions is u.</p>
              <p>but please don't be coerced into being intimate with him or put urself in a vulnerable position.</p>

              <p>It's hardly in the position as outsiders to help you decide what kind of guy he is and what he is really after. Being outsiders, we do not know the whole situation.</p>
              <p>At first sight, he may indeed be using you to satisfy his sexual desires. Or he might just be a very very horny boyfriend. There are not enough evidence to support either stands.</p>
              <p>How well do you know him before you got together with him?</p>
              <p>There's no need to get sexually intimate with him everytime you meet though. There are lots of other activities that the two of you can do together like what soleachip said.</p>
              <p>Never let youself be coerced into something that you might regret in the future.</p>
              <p>And never let yourself be easily taken in by honeyed words. Harden your heart if necessary if he is indeed using you.</p>

              <p>Well.... I think i am just bored and lonely. Maybe i was blinded by his words. But, i don't know why i have a feeling telling me that he never lied to me.</p>

              <p>In fact, he and i are still friend. I never agreed to be his gf.</p>

              <p>I need some advice and suggestion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am confused.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I knew a man from internet 3 months ago. We decided to meet up. Few days later, he said he misses me, loves me and wants me to be his girlfriend. Each time we meet, he will bring me to a park, we then kiss and engage in heavy petting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From the first day we met until now, he has never ceased to sending sms to me every day. However, the smses he sent to me were either what are you doing? do you want to meet? I feel so sad receiving this kind of messages... He never ask about my condition/situation whatsoever. A simple message showing care such as "how are you?" is a "hopeless" to hear from him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I feel ambivalent whether he really likes me or i am just his tool. Sometimes he will asks me to hotel, though, i never agree.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By the way, he treats me pretty nice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What should i do? Should i trust him? Should i avoid him? ...</p>

              <p><br>I believe what everyone has said here is the truth. He is just treating you as "sex doll". No offence intended. 3 months ago. And he claims to love you and want you to be his girlfriend? Does he even know you well enough? Has the Trust been built up between the both of you? And do you even know him well enough? And the tell-tale signs are when he brings you to the park to do those hanky panky stuff. You are letting him take advantage of you! And the final straw is the line "Sometimes he will asks me to hotel, though, i never agree." Glad you know when to say no. In your mind, you already know the answer to your own question. You are just here to re-affirm what you already know. But you have been swayed by his honeyed words and sweet nothings. Your mind tells you to avoid him, but your heart tells you to stay on. Don't let your heart take control. Be rational! There are plenty of other guys out there who would treat you better and not like some piece of meat. And always take time to know them before proceeding to the next stage. You are still young at 19 and shouldn't stick with such a horny guy. I believe we've all given our thoughts on this and the answer is cut all contact with that guy. Stay away from him. Never be swayed by such "fake" words ever again. Like some of our forumers have said, if they say such sweet words to you right now, would you fall into their lap this instant? Be smart and do the right thing... Cheers! =)</p>

              <p>Like what everyone else says, this desperate guy just wanna get into your pants. Don't get swayed by all his lovey dovey words; I guess u just wanna be loved by someone, but obviously this man is not the one for you. A person who truly likes you will not keep asking you to go to a hotel with him. That's just his ultimate motive. If every time both of you meet and engage in intimate physical acts, then something is very wrong here.</p>
              <p>At least you are not all without hope 'cos you already have doubts about this man, so wisen up before it's too late. :)</p>

              <p>Hi gr33ndoll,</p>
              <p>You may wish to consider going out more often with your friends, and perhaps have them introduce some better guys to you.</p>
              <p>Please do not trust your heart blindly, as it is easy for you to misjudge him in your current situation. Some men can be very good liars and sweet talkers, thus the large amount of conmen around.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
