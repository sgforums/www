If a guy keep asking you out and treating u very nicely, tht would be friendly + likeness too. At least this is what i felt. Know him longer to get better judgement instead of keep on wanting to let him know ya feelings yea?<br><br>I must say even if love is one-sided; it's still love. Love can never be degraded unless you intended it to be. Do you expect him to be grateful or thankful to u? I'd be deluding myself if I tell you I don't expect anything in return. If love could be bought with money, it'll be tagged as cheap love. If love is to landed into such pathetic plight, then I suppose don't ever love unless it's flows right from the bottoms of your heart. Why make things too difficult for yourself?</div>

Most of the time there's no need to say, trust me, she already knows. Saying it out will only make it awkward.<br><br><span style="color: brown;">Agree with this  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </span><br><br>Yea man. What would you do if a girl told you she like you, but just want to be friends?<br><br><span style="color: brown;">Yup, since i told her i like her and since she can't  get into a relationship due to her parents. What more can i say except being her close friends ?</span><br><br>I've been in this situation, though not exactly identical. Start from being close friends, and if she eventually feels anything, she knows you'll be there. But personally i don't like waiting, its like being her spare tyre or something.<br><br><span style="color: brown;">I've push away the thoughts of waiting for her just yesterdae after all those confession had came to an end. Totally agree with ur "she eventually feels anything, she knows you'll be there" .. cold/hot treatment will take place i suppose.</span><br><br>It means no choice, i cannot go stead with you. Sorry. The time's not right, or you're not attractive enough i guess...<br><br><span style="color: brown;">I can't even talk long on her with phone for i heard her mum screaming at her behind for using the phone, i hear liao oso sian and she can't come out frequently. Come'on, O's lvl is over.. This is the reason why she don't wanna or can't get into a r/s cuz communication is very limited  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  </span><br></blockquote></div>
