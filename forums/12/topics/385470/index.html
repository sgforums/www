              <p>Have anyone here experienced having a paranoid boss in your workplace?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am currently having such a type of boss. She will every 1 hour like that walk over to my workplace to check what I am doing. If she is busy or go for meeting or on leave or on mc, she will get her assistant manager to spy on me and than call her to report to her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyday in the morning when I come to work she will ask me to list down all the things that I have to do for the day. At the end of the day she will take the list and ask me which are the things that I have completed, why I do work so slow etc. If she is not around she will ask her assistant manager to help her to spy on me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She will ask the IT department to trace the internet to see if I got visit any websites and check my phone calls to see if I make any personal calls or surf the internet during the office hours.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Every email that I send out I have to cc it to her too so that she will know what I am doing. She also inform all the staffs in the company to cc her in any emails that they send to me so she will know exactly what I am doing and receiving.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The worst thing is that she will come and question me say what my email that I send are very brief lah and all sorts of craps.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wah. I think I am going crazy already. I only there for 2 months nia and she already like that. I can't imagine working for long in this company but I have signed a contract saying that I have to work for minimum 6 months than can leave the company or I have to compensate 1 month salary so I no choice but to tahan for another 4 months.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I am worried also that if I really do leave this company after 6 months, what should I say when I go for interviews and they ask me why I leave my ex company after just 6 months?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can't think of any good reasons to give. But I really can't tahan working at such a company under such a type of boss</p>

              <p>Hmm...this is a unique problem....</p>
              <p>I think it is very unusual....</p>
              <p>Maybe she doesnt trust you because you are new.....or something is with you....such as your long hair, tattoo, or something which makes you look suspiscious.....</p>
              <p>Or probably the person whom you replaced....was fired due to cheating or forgery......thus making her traumatized and extra careful now......</p>
              <p>Or possibly she didnt like you and manifested this negative sentiment in a deliberate or subconscious politicking against you to make you feel your life is unbearable....</p>
              <p>Lots of possibilites.....</p>
              <p>You can probably talk to your colleagues to gain more insight and see whether shes been like this all the time to everybody or not......</p>
              <p>Ok good luck.</p>
