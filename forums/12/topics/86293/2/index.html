He's really sweet and is always asking me to leave him if and when i find a better guy.<br><br>I've thought long and hard bout this before. He doesn't give me any opinion about most things and issues. So I have to make intelligent guesses. I love everything bout him, except his not-so-'smartness' and rigidity in doing things. Of cuz it can be a good thing too but that's not the point. The point is I'm convinced that I can take it along with all the other good aspects of him.<br><br>Honestly speaking, I can be truthful about C and he will juz accept it. Cuz he too, has seen me through that turbulent year I was talking about. Needless to say, he'd not divulge wat he feels and everything. He juz clams up and we've gotten into more than a few arguments bout his non-disclosure of feelings and thoughts.<br><br>So... why do I not think this r/s will last? Prolly becuz of the length of time. We'll be frequently apart as I'll need to travel. So I dun really noe if this is a good or bad thing. It's good cuz i tink it makes time move that much faster and of cuz bad as they'll be lots more temptations.<br><br>Guess I'll talk more bout this in reply to another post. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>hmm i think ur bf has an inferior complex issue, he thinks u're too good for him, u're a godsend. He's afraid u'll leave him, yet he's unwilling be a hinderance to ur "happiness". Thats why he always say go if u have a better person chasing u.<br><br>im sure he is not stupid... he does think about the relationship with u but he is not convinced that u r his. he is feeling very insecure n he's scared if he voice his true view, u'll leave him. in a way he's constantly testing u n u're starting to wear thin in patience as u wait for him to open up his mind n heart to u.<br><br>u really have to talk to him, heart to heart n convince him that u love him, not out of gratitude, but for who he is. as u said , u'll be frequently travelling so that will confirm be another mental obstacle for him to overcome. u have to be very patience with him.<br><br>only my 2 cents. good luck.<br><br>PS: ur bf character a bit like mine so maybe my insight may be useful to u. but then of course i could be wrong  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
