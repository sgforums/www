            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all...<br><br>Juz have sthg to get off my chest. Hope that someone out there is able to paint the bigger pic for me and find a way to break this circle.<br><br>I'm currently attached and have been in this relationship for 2 years. I guess it has kinda stabilised and my bf is really sweet and accomodating and it is generally thought that I have 'struck lottery'.<br><br>Before I got tog with my current bf, I had a turbulent year, full of heartbreaks and tears, booze and more tears. This person, let's call him C, helped me through the low period. He's a renowned playboy and hey he does it with skill! He simply makes you feel special and honestly speaking he was really nice to me at the beginning. Helping me with studies, my various extra-curricular stuff and all. However, more and more I had this feeling that he was with me only for sex. It was a classic case of trying to change the bad boy and I failed miserably. I made the wisest choice I ever did that year. I left him, tho we never were really officially together.<br><br>He didn't call and we juz left things as that. Occassionally we would MSN and it always ended with him asking me over to his room. And time after time i would reject him. About 1 year ago, I slipped up. My current bf and I were going through a particularly rough patch and almost broke up. I went back to him while never officially parting with my current bf. Biggest mistake. It was always about sex. And I juz let it continue, even after things got better with my bf.<br><br>U see... I guess i always had a soft spot for him. Waking up early to get him his fave breakfasts and things like that. At one point, he really really broke my heart and I confronted him over MSN, explicitly telling him I dun want us to be friends who f.u.c.k. He gave me his usual bs he gives every girl about being attracted to me and one thing led to another. Tho after that confrontation we fell into a cold period again, we still chat sometimes and I've managed to not go back to him up to the present.<br><br>Juz this past week, a close girlfriend of mine broke down and told me that she's with him. I was shell-shocked and at a loss for words. I had been confiding to her all along bout my hung-ups regarding him. I felt hurt. Not exactly feelings of betrayal but I juz feel this pain. But there was nothing i could do. I wasn't even supposed to be upset rite? I was supposed to be over him. I even comforted her and told her to be careful as we all know what kinda person he is actually.<br><br>I met him for coffee recently and i honestly told my girlfriend. She was upset because he kept it from her and intentionally didn't pick up her call when i was in the car with him. I had to console her again. Tho she says she's giving up, I noe it's not gonna happen unless something drastic occurs. And I dun want that to happen cuz I would never wanna hurt her. Now... she tells me practically everything bout him and them and I guess I juz feel so miserable.<br><br>I dunno why i'm feeling this way becuz, like i said I noe wat C is like and I dun cherish any hopes. Any thoughts of changing him had disappeared outta the window with my love for him.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you have to draw a clear line. If you love your current bf, you will not do things to hurt him. I suggest that you keep yourself away from C for a while. Moreover, your friend and C are together right now.<br><br>I know it is difficult but since you kinda started this (by engaging in intimate activities with C), I do feel that you should decide to put it to an end.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeap have been doing all of the above.<br><br>My girlfriend noes bout his pattern. In fact everyone does and they're all a lil disappointed that she let herself land in this situation. We talk about him which prolly makes it that bit harder for me. Having to cope with my feelings bout him and her insecurities and upsets. However, she is deliberately still continuing their r/s and I guess it's not my place to interfere. Can only console her and lend support i guess.<br><br>Prolly I'm being naive. I juz wanna be friends. However a part of me realises that we have no foundation at all. I doubt he even sees me as a friend tho he says otherwise. I've been true to my current bf and have not been involved with C for a long time.<br><br>But i still feel miserable. Sometimes I wonder if i'm holding on to my beautiful memories of him and blocking out all the ugly ones. But then again, I do that with all others.  I've blocked him on MSN, I've deleted his no from my hp, I've slashed his name from my ICQ. But somehow... whenever I let my guard down, he creeps back. It's tiring...<br><br>With regards to my current bf, I tink i dun really need one. The reason why we got tog in the first place was becuz he was so persistent and I dun wanna hurt him. But I can truthfully say that we have a happy r/s, albeit an independent one on my part. I can live w/o seeing him or calling him etcetc but not the other way.<br><br>Well i'm starting work soon so I hope it'll take my mind off all these.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by nymrod:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi all...<br><br>Juz have sthg to get off my chest. Hope that someone out there is able to paint the bigger pic for me and find a way to break this circle.<br><br>I'm currently attached and have been in this relationship for 2 years. I guess it has kinda stabilised and my bf is really sweet and accomodating and it is generally thought that I have 'struck lottery'.<br><br>Before I got tog with my current bf, I had a turbulent year, full of heartbreaks and tears, booze and more tears. This person, let's call him C, helped me through the low period. He's a renowned playboy and hey he does it with skill! He simply makes you feel special and honestly speaking he was really nice to me at the beginning. Helping me with studies, my various extra-curricular stuff and all. However, more and more I had this feeling that he was with me only for sex. It was a classic case of trying to change the bad boy and I failed miserably. I made the wisest choice I ever did that year. I left him, tho we never were really officially together.<br><br>He didn't call and we juz left things as that. Occassionally we would MSN and it always ended with him asking me over to his room. And time after time i would reject him. About 1 year ago, I slipped up. My current bf and I were going through a particularly rough patch and almost broke up. I went back to him while never officially parting with my current bf. Biggest mistake. It was always about sex. And I juz let it continue, even after things got better with my bf.<br><br>U see... I guess i always had a soft spot for him. Waking up early to get him his fave breakfasts and things like that. At one point, he really really broke my heart and I confronted him over MSN, explicitly telling him I dun want us to be friends who f.u.c.k. He gave me his usual bs he gives every girl about being attracted to me and one thing led to another. Tho after that confrontation we fell into a cold period again, we still chat sometimes and I've managed to not go back to him up to the present.<br><br>Juz this past week, a close girlfriend of mine broke down and told me that she's with him. I was shell-shocked and at a loss for words. I had been confiding to her all along bout my hung-ups regarding him. I felt hurt. Not exactly feelings of betrayal but I juz feel this pain. But there was nothing i could do. I wasn't even supposed to be upset rite? I was supposed to be over him. I even comforted her and told her to be careful as we all know what kinda person he is actually.<br><br>I met him for coffee recently and i honestly told my girlfriend. She was upset because he kept it from her and intentionally didn't pick up her call when i was in the car with him. I had to console her again. Tho she says she's giving up, I noe it's not gonna happen unless something drastic occurs. And I dun want that to happen cuz I would never wanna hurt her. Now... she tells me practically everything bout him and them and I guess I juz feel so miserable.<br><br>I dunno why i'm feeling this way becuz, like i said I noe wat C is like and I dun cherish any hopes. Any thoughts of changing him had disappeared outta the window with my love for him. So...<br><br>Why am i feeling so despondent now???<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>Move your life out in this guy..<br><br>you had your own r/s.. live it up to it..<br><br><strong>Don't talk.. don't msn.. don't sms.. don't see.. don't listen </strong>from this guy anymore.. soon enough you will totally forget about him.. and your feelings for him has gone with wind..<br><br>This works only if you are realyl determined to do it.. if there's a second thoughts to it.. then it wont help you either way.... you have to get yourself out of his picture first... that's the mean concern..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

He's really sweet and is always asking me to leave him if and when i find a better guy.<br><br>I've thought long and hard bout this before. He doesn't give me any opinion about most things and issues. So I have to make intelligent guesses. I love everything bout him, except his not-so-'smartness' and rigidity in doing things. Of cuz it can be a good thing too but that's not the point. The point is I'm convinced that I can take it along with all the other good aspects of him.<br><br>Honestly speaking, I can be truthful about C and he will juz accept it. Cuz he too, has seen me through that turbulent year I was talking about. Needless to say, he'd not divulge wat he feels and everything. He juz clams up and we've gotten into more than a few arguments bout his non-disclosure of feelings and thoughts.<br><br>So... why do I not think this r/s will last? Prolly becuz of the length of time. We'll be frequently apart as I'll need to travel. So I dun really noe if this is a good or bad thing. It's good cuz i tink it makes time move that much faster and of cuz bad as they'll be lots more temptations.<br><br>Guess I'll talk more bout this in reply to another post. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

The rascals as you put it are more engaging I guess... More confident, expressive and all. A 'normal guy' like my bf offers security, reliability, which becomes increasingly important to a girl as she grows older. Ask any girl. =)<br><br>My rascal bf, as you put it, is not there for excitement. I'm not even involved with him anymore if you read the posts carefully. If it's anything like wat you suggest, I muz have some sadistic urge to hurt myself cuz I dun even find it exciting. Some might thrive on drama but I dun. I guess Yunhaier hits the closest to home. Thanks for the admonishments. I really needed them.<br><br>I wasn't turning to my nice bf for comfort and neither did I plan to go back to the rascal once I've.... healed? It's not a conscious thing. As for my sincerity twds my current bf, if committment is any yardstick to go by, he's by far the longest person I've been involved with.<br><br>Honestly, I dun care what my bfs can give me becuz... I love myself. I'm a strong believer in depending on yourself and extending the kinda love to the pple around me. Ironically, that's wat prolly drew me to C in the first place. He has issues... that he's avoiding. Who doesn't anyway?<br><br>I'm not exactly straining in my current r/s, if you guys get wat I mean? We are happy together... It's the oft-quoted meandering stream of love and happiness., confortable, slow and long-lasting. It's not a problem of CHOOSING btwn the rascal and the nice guy as you seem to imply.<br><br>Peace man... and may you find a worthy girl.</div>

Your head tells you " Don't be stupid lah, he is making use of you and so and so and so " and yet you still can't get over him. Why?<br><br>This is how i see it...<br><br>You had a relationships with him, been through alot because of him. That why you will have such nostalgic/ strong memories or attachment for him and upon seeing your friend like this, remind you of what happened to you and reminded you of your hopes of trying to change him. You still believe in that hope do you?  You still have a tinge of feeling for him? ( cos he did many sweet things for you, like helping you when you are down, considering the bond that you 2 have once had )  but does he really love you or is he making use of you??? or Maybe C has problem of his own, like having a phobic to commitment; staying faithful to other party or perhap a sex addict  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> .<br><br>I must say, it's quite futile to change a person. Love is about accepting the person as who he is. An individual has his own thought, if he wants to change, it's has to be his own decision.<br><br>I think it really normal for you to feel the way you feel now. Hey you are human and has feeling. It not easy to let go off things right? even though you know that you have to.  It's take time to forget about that guy and release all the feelings you have had for him. And you have a really nice boyfriend now!<br>Why look back? Look forward, dear!<br><br></div>

Or are you trying to psycho yourself to be grateful that you have a nice boyfriend and not being true to yourself? I see you trying to be a Martyr for there C guy and now your present bf. I must say you are very noble but abit foolish. (no offence =)). i know most gers will rather have a guy to love them more than they love the guys, esp after they were hurt by a guy whom they love more than the guy do.  After getting hurt, their outlook and needs change ( can't help it at all ) but just don't end up hurting the guy and yourself, yeah? cos' the guy may again look for a girl who will love them more than they love the girl. Then the vicious cycle will ride on.<br><br>There is no such thing as the best love. Every relationships you have had is unique in experience. Your present relationships is still being experienced, it's unfair to compare it with your previous one. In addition, the previous relationship is over. Look for love? Look at the present and see your answer.<br><br></div>
