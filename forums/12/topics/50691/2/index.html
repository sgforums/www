For this world is everchanging and you can never really know what's gonna happen next...? Hate to say this... But no matter how important one thing or one person might mean to you can this point of your life, doesn't necessarily means that it'll always be the same... Though it's certainly NICE to be able to FOCUS your WHOLE LIFE onto something / someone with GREAT POSITIVE SIGNIFICANCE to you, try not to weigh your life TOTALLY onto something or someone and balance it out.... For if not, when the screw is loose the WHOLE BOAT would SINK.... ADAPTABILITY... One of the BASIC requirements for SURVIVAL..?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i guess success in life for me means when i am able to give the best for the people i loved. giving them the love they most deserved.<br><br>getting a 5 digits paycheck, living in a condo near the city, driving luxury cars, wearing designers/expensive stuff r secondary. these make them more comfortable but when all is gone, wat's most comforting is they know there's someone whom they can fall back on. success measuring by material is too unrealistic...<br><br>but of cos majority of people in this country oways measure success by ur paycheck, property etc etc... this country is too practical too fastpace where success is measurable only by wat u own.</div>
