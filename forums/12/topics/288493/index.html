            <div class='col-md body'>lol big mistake. if u like her and want to have any chance of scoring with her u shouldnt confess. girls who have guys after them all the time are interested when guys seemingly AREN'T interested in them. hard to explain complex workings of female mind but yeah im sure many girls can verify that.</div>
