            <div class='col-md body'>*pats*<br><br>Think about getting girls like how you think about winning lottery. The more tickets you buy, the higher your chance, right?<br><br>Get good with a lot of girls, and there's a higher chance for you to get a gf XD<br><br>Obviously, make sure that the girls that you're working on are the type that you would like to date. Maybe even make friends with a couple that aren't exactly your type, to see what sort of girls like your sort of character.<br><br>Oh, and btw, the question above about casino.. and losing money, and walking away or something comparing it to losing a wife or something..<br><br>I think it's because.... well, let's think about women and money as goods. Then, money is a homogeneous good, ie. $1 is the same $1 no matter whose hands it is in. But a girl.. is not the same girl as any other girls out there. So.. what I suppose the point here is, that women, as a product, are non-homogeneous and are highly differentiated from each other. Although they do start clumping into different types.. but that's besides the point XD And that's why losing money is different from losing a girl. Money can be replaced, and it's the same money. It's not like.. the $1 you lost before was any different to the $1 you have now. Whereas, the girl you lost before, is different to the one you are pursuing/have now.<br><br>And there we go, for Finance 101 (Women and Money) XD</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TS<br>In the 1st place I think you not only know that you will be rejected but the actual basis also. It is not that you are totally rejected but that the other party just has other priorities. So STOP whinning. I think if you really love this person then you should also respect her decision and concentrate on your studies as well.<br><br>The fact that you are able to accompany her home also shows that you are not on her outcast list. And stop listening to what others are saying for her, it may not be what she actually said. Use your BRAIN ok, if you still have it?<br><br>Boko, I know the casinos are coming to SG ok? But for goodness and mind sake try not to make a gambling r/s into a BG r/s. WhAT an analogy? It is totally worlds apart. They say that we Men are from Mars already but I think you are like coming from Jupiter. (Sorry no offense).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Usually, we tend to feel down when we are rejected by someone we admired.<br>This "down" came when we focus on the negative aspects of ourselves and the situation. Step back, expand your perspective and notice the positive aspects of yourself.<br><br>You can take it as it is just a pity that she rejected you cos she only see the <strong>half-person of you.</strong><br><br>cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As a gal, i can tell you that she is not only rejecting you but also finding you quite irritating. Just that out of courtesy, she find some accuses to evade you. I do that to boys who i find it irritating and not up to mark, it more nice that to tell them straight off their face, "I DUN LIKE YOU, SO please keep your distance". If you dun get the click of it, that is because you like/love her alot, but in reality, you are not in her vocabulary as a bf or even a close fren.<br><br>Failure is the begining of success<br>Reject is the begining of accept.</div>
