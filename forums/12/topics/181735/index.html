            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>Got over my sob story for you guys who frequent this forum. Not longer dwelling on the past and I guess I stepped down graciously successfully.<br><br>Now met a new shy bespectacled nerdy gal, yet I find her so cute for some reason. I sent her a online greeting card giving her my contact information whe  I learnt of her email address and she in turn added me to her MSN messenger contact list, and also SMSed me which provided me with her HP number.<br><br>Things seem fine for now. Good enough to be casual friend. I can tell she isn't really attracted to me or anything, but I guess I left her an OK impression or at least she doesn't find me irritating or repulsive. Last nite, she SMSed me to wish me good nite. Was quite a big surprise for me.<br><br>So now in a dilemma: should I be more proactive to try to chat with her more often on MSN, or not to overdo things. I read that gals hate guys who keep trying to talk to them which in the female perspective, see the guys like wussy who like to cling to them. The idea is for guys to avoid talking too much to retain some sense of mystery and to generate some interest in her mind. Yet if I sit back and do nothing also means waiting for something to happen; and to wait for the gal to express interest? Isn't this ridiculous?<br><br>I need to strike a balance somehow, to avoid being overly aggressive when I'm not close to her yet, yet not appear too aloof, distanced and cold as if I'm not attracted to her a single bit. But always feel the temptation to initiate a conversation. For the past 3 days, I've suppressed my temptation to initiate a conversation and not spoken to her at all.<br><br>How? how?</div>

Talk to her if you want to / like to and she respond equally in a positive manner.... Sometimes it's hard to state what's too much talking and what's not.... It's varies between people and even possibly within the same person.... If you're afraid that you might be pestering her too much, just set a line so that you don't overstep it... And also... You can be more senstive to her reaction and even ask her yourself (but don't do this too often or you might start to sound like yuor grandpa...)... Conversations hold so long as both patries are willing and comfortable... Better still if interested and attracted... All these don't only happen between different genders but is in fact applicable to the same gender too...<br><br>Regarding the 'drawing far' to make yourself desirable thingy... I think you can forget about it... I doubt you're really much of a 'player' yourself, so playing the court which is not your game could probably only means unnecessary trouble eventually... If you're genuinely interested in this girl, it is thus not recommended to play by those set of rules....</div>

Not longer dwelling on the past and I guess I stepped down graciously successfully.<br><br>Now met a new shy bespectacled nerdy gal, yet I find her so cute for some reason. I sent her a online greeting card giving her my contact information whe  I learnt of her email address and she in turn added me to her MSN messenger contact list, and also SMSed me which provided me with her HP number.<br><br>Things seem fine for now. Good enough to be casual friend. I can tell she isn't really attracted to me or anything, but I guess I left her an OK impression or at least she doesn't find me irritating or repulsive. Last nite, she SMSed me to wish me good nite. Was quite a big surprise for me.<br><br>So now in a dilemma: should I be more proactive to try to chat with her more often on MSN, or not to overdo things. I read that gals hate guys who keep trying to talk to them which in the female perspective, see the guys like wussy who like to cling to them. The idea is for guys to avoid talking too much to retain some sense of mystery and to generate some interest in her mind. Yet if I sit back and do nothing also means waiting for something to happen; and to wait for the gal to express interest? Isn't this ridiculous?<br><br>I need to strike a balance somehow, to avoid being overly aggressive when I'm not close to her yet, yet not appear too aloof, distanced and cold as if I'm not attracted to her a single bit. But always feel the temptation to initiate a conversation. For the past 3 days, I've suppressed my temptation to initiate a conversation and not spoken to her at all.<br><br>How? how?</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agreed with dokono too, the self-improvement part. First impression counts IMO. But I dun agree with "Women already understand Men".

Not just this "Oh, he is just some guy I met some place." Ask her out, have a TCSS session.
