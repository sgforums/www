              <p>self centered or self love? there is a fine line between the 2.</p>
              <p>the case against the chairman of Tang's? was he really wrong to fight for his life? if he was poor, he knows he cannot survive but with his wealth, he could buy a few more years. to me, in my opinion; it was a fair exchange. so much money that the Indonesian could never earn all his life for a kidney that he knows he can still survive well if he takes care of the other one.</p>
              <p>people are born selfish... but no matter what, parents still love their kids and have concern for their welfare. it is only the extremist who felt they are the reason why the earth rotates and why the sun and rain exist only for them that really pisses me off.</p>

              <p><br>but how do you really define "making use"?</p>
              <p>when i was in poly, during major project i was paired up with 2 other guys from my year 1 class. 3 of us have our strengths and weaknesses... i was good with hardware and the other 2 softwares. i hate programming anyway but there are times when one of them couldn't appear for many reasons like MC or truancy and we cover each other's backs... during evaluation, we also claimed that all 3 of us have an equal share though we know that it's not true.</p>
              <p>so how do you define making use of another person? it's a very thin fine line when you based it on friendship. to say it ugly, friends make use of each other all the time. siblings make use of each other all the time. my sister always asked me to washes dishes for her... isn't she making use of me? i've never ask anything in return. just that she is happy for having a brother like me... should i be angry that she is making use of me then?</p>
              <p>everyone is making use of everyone in this world... but it's how to accept it or take it in your stride. your very company is using you to make money... they pay you peanuts and earn the big bucks. they are self-centered for they don't care if it's public holidays. the deadline must be met and production secured. they provide medical welfare and social welfare but in the end, the company comes first. it's the same everywhere...</p>

              <p><br>While I agree some people in this world are self centered, but there are those who are truly kind and wonderful. It's funny you posted a question and then tell others not to reply if the answer is not what you want, then it's like asking how much is 1+1, if you are about to say 2, please don't even post a reply.</p>
              <p>I myself have met amazing people, chinese/malay/indians/whites so kindness is across all races. I still remember when i was young, i dun have money to take bus home and a malay gave me some money without asking anything in return. Then i also met someone a total stranger who drove me back when i lost my way. So i truly believe there are great and wonderful people around in the world.</p>
              <p>Then again, i also met ugly idiots. People who have a lack of EQ, people are pure retarded and lack of morals.</p>
              <p>My point is, there are good and bad in this world. It depends on how you look at it. Try to look on the positive side. Without evil, you cannot see the good. Without thieves, you won't have police. Without the right brain, you become too logic, like a robot, without the left brain, you become too emotional, both side of our brain helps us to balance. In life, everything needs a balance.</p>

              <p>Even though wat you say is true . There are some people out there who are not only self-centered . They would want to make u suffer every now and then . But being the small people that we are we cant do nuts .</p>

              <p>Hmmm self centredness is the basis of
              Capitalism and without captalism and the money that you so scorn we'd
              still be living in the pre-industrial ages at best without technology
              like barbarians.. Hmm so which would you prefer?? tough choice.. </p>
              <p>Kindness is nice but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">rational</span> self centredness is the basis of which kindess can occur don't you think? How can you learn to love others before you learn to love yourself first?</p>
