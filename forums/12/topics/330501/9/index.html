              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">— USAGE</span> The term <strong>Mongoloid</strong> belongs to a set of terms introduced by 19th-century anthropologists attempting to categorize human races. Such terms are <span style="color: #ff0000;">associated with outdated notions of racial types (linked to down's syndrome)</span>, and so are now potentially offensive and best avoided.</p>
