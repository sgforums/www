              <p>as with all words in the dictionary, it depends on the context of use. saying someone is a communist doesn't really sound bad to an actual communist, but people seems to shun that.</p>
              <p>1.people seldom use communist after the cold war 2. it's not a nice word to use. 3. communist is a real word.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The articles do show that the word has negative connotations, as a SIDEPOINT. Even then, it talks about racism, which is a socio-political issue. NOTHING to do with the word as a retarded insult</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The word CHINESE is a real word right?</p>
              <p>but it has racist connotations as well and in america, some (very few) people use it as an insult. walk into an exclusive caucasian bar, and they might say "go away, chinese". I'd take that as aa racist insult. I'm sure most people would.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So does that mean the word 'chinese' is an 'urbanly used insult'? NO</p>
              <p>does it mean that if i say the word 'chinese', i'd "have used it as an insult unwittingly." ? NO</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And will i sound like a retard if i go around insulting my friends with this word? YES</p>
