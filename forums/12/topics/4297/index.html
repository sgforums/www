            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I believe love can develop from first sight. I personally feel that love that is slowly built up from a purely platonic relationship is rare. Most of the time, we get interested to find out more about someone when we are attracted to that person physically. As time goes by we will have a clearer picture of the person and love may develop as a result.<br>Actually its quite true that sometimes u need to "stike while the iron is hot". When we see no action, we tend to feel that the guy is not interested and as a result our interest declines too. So it might be a good idea to let her know how you feel and things might work out well in the end, who knows?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>If I am a star, then you must be the moon,<br>I will always be by your side, showering my light.</div>

Coz I still feel that to love someone is also a feeling... I'm sure u haf heard of couples who quarrel everytime rite?? but it's just harmless quarrels, they just feel that it adds more life to the r/s.. But If u are think over it logically this kind of r/s will not work out... Or in another situation, one went overseas for quite a long period of time, if the mind rules over the heart, beginning to be overwhelmed with suspision, things will turn sour.. Or maybe u felt that u are lacking of someone to hold u or to hug u... It's not a good thing to use ur head too.. Coz, any practical person will see the worthlessness to keep the r/s.<br><br>If u feel wif ur heart, the love that u haf for him.. No matter where and how long the time of absence, u will still be there for him... Love is still a feeling. And sadly so is lust...<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I guess love is really at first sight for my case. Because when u see that gal, u really feel something, u feel that u want to know her more and wanted to be a friend at least. There are many good gals out there and it just would take time, some luck to knock into one. When I felt that something could be started if I see one, I will try to make friends first. If she really sees that u are committed and honest with her, I think u should stand a chance. I believe in making the first move as a guy.<br><br>Good luck!</div>
