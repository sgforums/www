              <p><br>Hmm...what kind of pointers do you hope to receive? There's no special magic pointers that anyone could've given you in your situation....cos there's only one way out.</p>
              <p>Face her and admit to her that you were a jerk when you sent those smses to her and sincerely apologise to her.</p>
              <p>Your fate will be determined on how's good/close/deep were your friendship with her before you sent those smses.</p>
              <p>And of course it will also depends on what kind of girl she is. Most girls would not have taken it personal and probably ignores your silly smses. But there are some girls who would have taken your smses personal. You need luck on that. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Nothing is more touching than a sincere apology....even if it is from anyone. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>To be completely honest, I am entirely amazed and amused with your concern. How old are the two of you by the way?</p>
              <p>Discounting the possibility that you were actually abusive and downright rude (I am assuming nothing like that took place since you did not go into much detail about what was actually said) in conveying your displeasure that she reneged on your date, I'd suggest you act like a man for once and move on.</p>
              <p>Unless you're prepared for more drama (think more cancellations/postponements of dates/family time for fear of being isolated by colleagues/friends/acquaintances/any-reasonable-soul who would invariably become strangers 30 years from now anyway) in time to come, it's possibly the best option to pursue.</p>
              <p><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why bother with people who can't even accord you the most basic respect and honour their word?</span></em></p>
              <p>On the basis of the reason (it's entirely another matter if she reneged on the date due to some real exigencies/emergencies) she gave, she's basically either desperately insecure or has horrendous time management - or possibly both! Are you serious about dating someone like that and potentially spending the rest of your life with her (let's assume the affection is mutual here)?</p>
              <p>Let's be honest: if you found such behaviour acceptable by your standards and compatible with your own values, you probably wouldn't have been irked by her behaviour to begin with. The fact that you're disturbed (and understandably so) already suggests an issue of incompatibility before you actually become an item.</p>
              <p>If you're trying to go out of the way to accommodate her - at the expense of betraying your own principles as your behaviour would suggest - just because she's an object of your desire, you're no different from a pot smoker trying to feed a temporary addiction without actually having considered the long-term implications.</p>
              <p>Put it another way. If the exact same scenario had been played out between you and another friend whom you had completely no romantic interest with, would you still be trying as hard to "mend this broken friendship"? If you could answer this, you probably know what to do...</p>
