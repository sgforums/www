You love your bf no doubt and as far as this post is concerned, I presume he does love you too, equally. The factors involved that made you took advantage of him are:<br><br>I) This relationship has gone for 2 years already - at risk of a routine relationship. A routine relationship (&amp; probably kinda not much problem since the beginning of your love) is always at risk to such mundane issues.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) It probably exist in your character (if you have ex - reflect and think whether such attitude exist when you are with them.) In such cases if your relationship has serious problem earlier on - that's the reason why you didn't show this aspect of your personality. When things calm down - the real self will gradually surface.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In CloUdiSm remix III - <strong>we are, but the mirror of our partners</strong>. You dislike the fact that you took advantage of him is because you won't like it if he does it to you. Your rational mind scream this warning to you and if things doesn't improve, you could lose him. You knew it - but subconsciously, princess attitude keep coming back.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>What must you do?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>There is two ways you will improve and change. At this rate you are going probably is the first way - when he leaves you, you panic and would do anything to get him back. This drastic behavior may show the declining stage of the relationship even if he may come back to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Second issue which is the better alternative: to improve gradually when time passed. The key is NOT to expect yourself to change overnight, rather to improve steadily on this negative personality and seek growth.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I) Always apologise, <strong>IF it was your fault</strong>. Never blow at him because you are having bad mood. There is no excuse for that either.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) When you know you are going to rant at him over small matters - STOP speaking for 10 seconds and just look at him. The art of cooling down will not only calm you down, think rationally and save unwanted minor problem in your relationship <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>III) Always whisper/talk sweet things to him or do something (write) to inform him about HOW appreciative you feel for his tolerence on you. Its ok to have conflict - but never sniff out his hope on you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>IV) When problem comes by and you 'performed' badly - reflect and think back on whether if there another alternative you could handle it. VOW to NEVER react the same way when similiar situation comes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>P.S: Probably if you heed this little 4 rules - things will gradually get better. <strong>Before you walk a mile, you must start with your first step</strong>. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers</div>
