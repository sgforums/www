              <p>Hi. I am new to SG forums. Just wondering where to seek constructive advice and found SG forums.</p>
              <p>I am 18/19 this year. I am a little introvert, but my "introvert-ness" came about because no one really willing to be <strong>real</strong> friends with me :(</p>
              <p>Those that so called friends with me all "left" already. They are all superficial.</p>
              <p>I realised that many of my friends befriended me because i was a little smarter than the rest in some areas; academic and non-academic. I belong in no clique like a free floating soul. I am enemies with no one but best friends with almost none. Just like a diplomat.</p>
              <p>When the event is over, like example"O-levels", they show their true face and just isolated me away. Got outing also never invite me. Slowly slowly everyone is doing this to me. </p>
              <p>Everytime/Mostly stay at home, i would like to go out with someone, but no one is there, only my shadow.</p>
              <p>Also, i have a big problem being friends with girls. I can count the number of "girl-friends" i have in a few seconds. Many of my friends all having or starting/on the verge of a bgf, and here i am still talking to the computer screen. I wonder how to meet more girls or something? I am about to enlist to NS in a few days and i feel i going mental le. With NS mental stress later on, i feel i can just say goodbye to this world.</p>
              <p>NS two years, how to meet more girls during this time (decent ones)? 2 years  meet only guys. Please dont tell me i have to wait till Uni (thats if it is possible) because by then all the nice singaporean girls within the suitable age range would be snapped up; either by locals or mostly by foreigners.</p>
              <p>Any useful advice anyone? I do not know if i am suffering from depression because i weep very often in bed at night.</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance and sorry for such a long post.</p>

              if your main worry is about girls, i've got news for you. if you got the money, you can have an actress or top model girlfriend, no problem. even blonde ang moh with big boobs also can.
              
              young boy, you worry too much. guys is different from girls, you can be very old but still have a sweet young thing as a girlfriend. if u have money, don't say 1 ah, you want 10 girlfriends also can. if u got money and no gf, let me know lah, i introduce you all my female friends, but you come find me after ur ns lah, now you find me is a waste of time because you're so young and your life focus is on the wrong thing.

              <p>Well, this is the real world, isn't it? Life is about making use of each other till the day we die. And if your friends don't invite you to their social gatherings, blame no one...not even yourself. It just means they find you helpful academic wise but not exactly one who is a joy to hang around with either.</p>
              <p>NS is a good time to reflect on life since your job inside is very very stable lol. Many people enter NS looking depressed but they come out stronger and happier. Cheers for this too shall pass.</p>

              <p>TS, you will soon find that there are many many people who face the same problem as you.....  there are many many people who face it  for some time and at some point in their life... its like a feeling that we find ourselves very much alone and there doesnt seem to be any one whom we can share our emotions and our feelings and our thoughts with.... therefore we start feeling depressed that we hardly find anyone who is interested in us</p>
              <p>how we get out of this mode or how we overcome this loneliness depends on you. only you can help you.</p>

              <p>Buddy, I oso hv the same fear as u but don't worry, u still young. NS is chance for u to make contact wif other guys n make buddies. Good chance to make frens. When ther guys get together, make longlasting frenships. So as long u dun let down everyone.</p>
              <p>People dun call u for outing bcause they assume u dun want to go. Next time if u hear anybody talking about outing, u just say u want to join in lah. If they reject u, u must be a little thick skin. Nowadays, in life, we have to take some rejection, tat way we learn n we become stronger. Take initiative lah, make some phone call to some fren, ask them how r they, what they doing, if got chance grasp opportunity to join their outing lah.</p>
              <p>Stop gripping, NS is not prison sentence. Aiyah, after enlistment, u still young ma. Also got a lot of foreign gals like Angel 7030 u can swipe off the feet, if u dun hv chance to go after local gals.</p>

              <p>Those that so called friends with me all "left" already. They are all superficial.</p>
              <p>I realised that many of my friends befriended me because i was a little smarter than the rest in some areas; academic and non-academic. I belong in no clique like a free floating soul. I am enemies with no one but best friends with almost none. Just like a diplomat.</p>
              <p>When the event is over, like example"O-levels", they show their true face and just isolated me away. Got outing also never invite me. Slowly slowly everyone is doing this to me. </p>
              <p>Everytime/Mostly stay at home, i would like to go out with someone, but no one is there, only my shadow.</p>
              <p>Also, i have a big problem being friends with girls. I can count the number of "girl-friends" i have in a few seconds. Many of my friends all having or starting/on the verge of a bgf, and here i am still talking to the computer screen. I wonder how to meet more girls or something? I am about to enlist to NS in a few days and i feel i going mental le. With NS mental stress later on, i feel i can just say goodbye to this world.</p>
              <p>NS two years, how to meet more girls during this time (decent ones)? 2 years  meet only guys. Please dont tell me i have to wait till Uni (thats if it is possible) because by then all the nice singaporean girls within the suitable age range would be snapped up; either by locals or mostly by foreigners.</p>
              <p>Any useful advice anyone? I do not know if i am suffering from depression because i weep very often in bed at night.</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance and sorry for such a long post.</p>

              <p>Haiz, wasting money go to pub. Like tat I ask TS to go to 7-eleven to buy many beer,drink until drunk then got guts to talk to gals, even better still. Cheaper than wasting money in pub. All the GRO there only want to make u spend more $$$. More $$$, the more the GRO like you. Go to Geylang better still. 290 Joo Chiat is child's play. See no touch, touch no see.</p>
