            <div class='col-md body'>Sir, In this tiny country of ours. Competition is extremely wild when you grow up. Cerfiticate is a must. You might not know this but think about the people who actually wants to take your course but were denied the chance. But my point here is'nt this.<br><br>My point here is this, They are just asking you to finish your course thats all. They aren't asking you to die, or do anything nasty. You said you do presentations alone, Is it too streneous? Think about it sir, If you can handle such tasks even at your age. Im sure in your future assigments at work, There will definitely have no problem.<br><br>In everything we do there's a reason, perhaps this thing might not just acts as a course for you to move to next time. But actually something to strengthen yourself in order for future endeavours. JIA YOU!</div>

I only enlisted eight months later, well after my A Levels. Even if they give you an enlistment date in the middle of the course, you can just get a letter from your school requesting deferment.</div>

Or are you merely contented with running a little stall for years (no offence intended)<br><br>Just get the damned cert and graduate. If you think school life's tough, wait till you work. Having work experience during your school days is nothing. Your real test is when you have to start earning enough to maintain your own life and your future family.<br><br>If it's ambition you lack, please seek motivation from friends who are constantly striving to improve themselves. There are people out there who can't afford to study for a diploma, and here you are whining away.<br><br>I'm sorry, but the harsh words are needed. Your complaint is just self-indulgent and it's not going to get you anywhere. You've come so close, just finish the race for goodness' sake.</div>
