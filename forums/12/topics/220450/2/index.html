            <div class='col-md body'>True, times are getting harder... I agree with you with that staement... But your friends with NITEC cert. cannot just stay there. $2000++ is quite alot for an unmarried person and at the same time does not support the family yet... Once he/she have support a family, $2000 is not enough... And $2000 now and in the future is different... Now seems to be quite alot, but in the future. $2000 is considered little, this is due to the development of S'pore and higher standad of living...<br><br>Must have a life long leaning attitude... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">	Learn something new.
