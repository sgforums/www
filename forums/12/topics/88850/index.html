            <div class='col-md body'>She and I have been together for years. I realllie enjoy those days when things were much simpler and carefree. As years goes by, conflicts arise and at times I give in to her. I'm also helping her as much as possible sometimes financially. I helped her pay her bills first, pay for hp, sme misc stuffs, and it chalked up to a few hundred. I dont mind cox she is really a nice n sweet girl, honest too. But, sometimes when I tell her that, she must start paying me back bit by bit, she wuld just try to avoid the topic. Kept saying she doesn't have that much money. I tell her slowly, I don't mind but not to the extent of not paying month by month. (She's working nw) I tell her, if keep delaying, it ain't doing her good at all. Sometimes, she wuld just say "ok la, I'll pay u la and give u all wan?" what is this, making me feel guilty bout taking money from her? It's my money am I wrong?<br>Just now, went to find place to have dinner, ride bike to lau pa sat but no place, never mind, I say wan go pasir panjang there eat, she say ok. Reach there give 50cent look. Ask her wan food, say don't want, what she want to drink, also dunno..Ok, I buy my own first, after that, ask her again wan me buy ginger tea from store beside, never give me reply, wat is this, talking to air!!!! Ok, I buy my own drinks, then I see more light dessert ask her wan or not? Give half fark face. ok, thats it, I'm really takin to air. The rest of the dinner, don't feel like talking to her. Sent her home, ask me why I don't talk to her. for wat!!! Talking to air fun is it....Am i giving too much, too caring and treat her too nice that I'm taken for granted? Then she will just say "ok la ok la, my fault can or not" What, then in the first place do it for what when u know it'll be wrong...<br>Sometimes I wonder, am I still clinging on becox we've been together for years? Sesh!!! I need guys and gals advice</div>

I realllie enjoy those days when things were much simpler and carefree. As years goes by, conflicts arise and at times I give in to her. I'm also helping her as much as possible sometimes financially. I helped her pay her bills first, pay for hp, sme misc stuffs, and it chalked up to a few hundred. I dont mind cox she is really a nice n sweet girl, honest too. But, sometimes when I tell her that, she must start paying me back bit by bit, she wuld just try to avoid the topic. Kept saying she doesn't have that much money. I tell her slowly, I don't mind but not to the extent of not paying month by month. (She's working nw) I tell her, if keep delaying, it ain't doing her good at all. Sometimes, she wuld just say "ok la, I'll pay u la and give u all wan?" what is this, making me feel guilty bout taking money from her? It's my money am I wrong?<br>Just now, went to find place to have dinner, ride bike to lau pa sat but no place, never mind, I say wan go pasir panjang there eat, she say ok. Reach there give 50cent look. Ask her wan food, say don't want, what she want to drink, also dunno..Ok, I buy my own first, after that, ask her again wan me buy ginger tea from store beside, never give me reply, wat is this, talking to air!!!! Ok, I buy my own drinks, then I see more light dessert ask her wan or not? Give half fark face. ok, thats it, I'm really takin to air. The rest of the dinner, don't feel like talking to her. Sent her home, ask me why I don't talk to her. for wat!!! Talking to air fun is it....Am i giving too much, too caring and treat her too nice that I'm taken for granted? Then she will just say "ok la ok la, my fault can or not" What, then in the first place do it for what when u know it'll be wrong...<br>Sometimes I wonder, am I still clinging on becox we've been together for years?

            <div class='col-md body'>err. can i write you a comment?<br><br>last time during poly days my gf also dun have much money with her. cos her bank book with her mom. then i also help her pay her hp bill etc. all with my pocket money. it all adds up to hundreds. i didn't go calculate exactly how much is it. i just feel i want to help her cos she's my dear dear..<br><br>now, she's working. she got her own income. but i didn't ask her to repay me the money. not even once. even now if she wants me to pay her hp bill, by all means i'll do it for her. not only these, i pay for all the food and expense when we go out. i just feel i want to treat her well. i want her to save up her earned money. just in case i'm not able to be with her in future, at least she has money with her(security). well i might spoilt her, but i dun want to regret why i dun treat her better when i lose her.<br><br>btw she and i are not married.</div>
