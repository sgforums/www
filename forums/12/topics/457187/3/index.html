              <p>Young and pretty girls who go for much older guys, normally these guys are loaded. If your friend wants to try, why not too? Learning curve :)</p>

              <p>I went out to drink with my friend again. He told me he just gave me a recent update.</p>
              <p>It looks like he is facing tight competition.</p>
              <p>He told me, last week, his company was having a treasure hunt outing, in car convoys. So he was in the same car as two younger guys in their late 20s and his direct boss. Don't know how they got news about my friends interest in this girl but the direct boss started to tease the two younger guys, that they are so handsome and why they didn't bother to go after the 24 year old girl?</p>
              <p>My friend was dumbstruck, he could not say anything as it was coming out of his direct boss. His boss was apparently trying to matchmake the two younger guys to this 24 year old girl and talking in the car as if my friend is not existing.</p>
              <p>So in his mind, he was thinking, is this office politics? And so my friend decided not to go after her because he didn't want to risk his office career.</p>
              <p>But in his mind, he wonders why his boss would say something like that?</p>
