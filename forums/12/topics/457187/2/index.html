              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">Do you have a sister or a niece ? How would u feel about an old man as old as her father wooing her and possibly having sex with her ? Do u see anything wrong with the picture here?</p>

              <p>Please don't flame us. My friend and I are sharing pointers. In the past, he has done a lot to help me. When I was in my rehab days from my motorbike accident, he came over to visit me and because he has qualification in physiotherapy (which he took for fun), he gave me a lot of valuable pointers on how to flex my muscles and bring my life back to normal.</p>
              <p>So, he is a great friend to me.</p>
              <p>No I don't have a sister. However my uncle is 10 years older than his wife. He married her when he was 34 and she was 24. They now got two kids together. Our family and hers didn't have a problem with that.</p>

              <p>I know moolah is an advantage , but erm ..... his reasourcesfullness would be more important in how to build up that rapport between him and her rather then say... showing your "financial" resources comparing it like that. What if some guy with a beamer drives up to pick her up one day ?</p>
              <p>Money can get her attention, but it thats all u got and all u can show... unless your friend is willing to be milked for the rest of his life, i guess its okay?</p>

              <p>From what I gather from him, she's not a money-greedy kind of girl. Although she is pretty, she does a lot of community and charity work in her spare time. She doesn't wear expensive clothes, jewellery and perfume, she just dresses professionally at her work place. Having said his, she is pretty. I've seen pictures of her, without make up, she is stunning.</p>
              <p>However my friend has one concern, he is not sure of her maturity levels. He tells me that in his conversations, in so far, it seems ok. He needs to get to know her better.</p>

              <p>Guys like u and your best friend keeps thinking that if a girl is friendly towards u that means she is interested... wrong.</p>
              <p>She has no ulterior motive, she just wants to be liked by people around her in the work place.</p>
              <p>Being friendly is not luring, please get your head fixed, stop thinking with your dick.</p>

              <p>Yes he is a great friend, unfortunately he is not the best person to get advise from regarding women. </p>
              <p>You don't go to a beggar and ask for financial advise. </p>
              <p>I have many friends who married spouse with big age gap. Many have kids, many are happily married. The comonality in every cases , All the older men are able to provide SECURITY to their younger wife. The older make spouse, look good, lived a healthy life and took care of their body.</p>
              <p>That's why the younger women choose them over younger men. </p>
              <p>All I am saying is , know your limitations, think about what u can offer and consider the long term implications. </p>
              <p>Your friend probably think he stands a chance because that lady is kind and do charity. Is your friend a Charity ? No. </p>
              <p>If she is truly that wonderful, then your friend better be prepared to have some fierce competition with other men.</p>
              <p>If she likes older men, your friend won't be the Only old guy going after her. </p>
              <p>Your friend helped you get better, you should help him shape up and live a healthier life. That's what friends are for. You help him, you also helping yourself.</p>

              <p>I have many friends who married spouse with big age gap. Many have kids, many are happily married.

              <p>That's why the younger women choose them over younger men. </p>
              <p>All I am saying is , know your limitations, think about what u can offer and consider the long term implications. </p>

              <p>I went out to drink with my friend again. He told me he just gave me a recent update.</p>
              <p>It looks like he is facing tight competition.</p>
              <p>He told me, last week, his company was having a treasure hunt outing, in car convoys. So he was in the same car as two younger guys in their late 20s and his direct boss. Don't know how they got news about my friends interest in this girl but the direct boss started to tease the two younger guys, that they are so handsome and why they didn't bother to go after the 24 year old girl?</p>
              <p>My friend was dumbstruck, he could not say anything as it was coming out of his direct boss. His boss was apparently trying to matchmake the two younger guys to this 24 year old girl and talking in the car as if my friend is not existing.</p>
              <p>So in his mind, he was thinking, is this office politics? And so my friend decided not to go after her because he didn't want to risk his office career.</p>
              <p>But in his mind, he wonders why his boss would say something like that?</p>

              <p>I don't think its impossible.</p>
              <p>The problem is, the girl my friend is going after, is really really A-lister in terms of beauty. When he showed me her pictures, I wonder why she is working in such a dead end job with corporate pay when she could actually go out there and do some modelling or even act in mandarin movies because of her looks.</p>
              <p>My uncle did succeeded in marrying somebody who was 15 years younger than him but he did that during the 1980s. So nowadays, I think the generation Y mentality could be different.</p>
              <p>Maybe my friend could hit it with somebody much younger, so as long as she is not so beautiful looking and the competition is not too tight.</p>
