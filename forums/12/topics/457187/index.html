              <p>Just the other day, I was having a coffee drink with an old friend. He is also like me, single but older, he is 40 years old. We both always share tips and notes on how to woo women.</p>
              <p>He tells me that he saw this girl at his office, she is only 24 years old. He knows she is single because she told everybody she is single. He even showed me a picture of her in one of his company annual dinner. She is very pretty, slim and attractive, look like japanese girl. Lately, my friend has been having close chats with her at the pantry and even escorted her to her car. She is quite smart, she has a degree from NUS and her position at office is executive because she only worked like 2 years at my friend's office. My friend told me that she is not from a rich family, her father pass away some time ago so leaving only her mother, sister and her. Although pretty, she is homely and nice girl.</p>
              <p>My friend is planning to go after her. However I advice him to be careful because of the big age gap of 16 years. She may want to look for somebody younger and may not be prepared for marriage until she's 29.</p>
              <p>My friend is still adamant to go after her. A lot of guys at his office are interested in her, they try to woo her but she just give them a bit of attention and then after a while, they all tire off.</p>
              <p>So what should I do? I don't want my friend to suffer humiliation of rejection. Or should he try and fail? Maybe he will learn something from this?</p>

              <p>My friend has worked for 17 years but still executive level. He has no car, plans not to buy any car although he may be able to afford it. I don't know his salary level but he has his own HDB flat and he also own another property in Johor as investment. My friend is average looking, a bit pot belly.</p>

              <p>Age is not an issue emotionally.</p>
              <p>Physically if the age gap is too big, it becomes an issue, later.</p>
              <p>Just be prepared to spend money on Viagra in the future. Or perhaps be generous enough for the young bride to take a lover. </p>

              <p>Age is but just a number. Perhaps the girl is much wiser beyond her age and prefers omeone much older???  Everyone and every relationship is different due to numerous factors.</p>

              </p><p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">     As part of this whole process,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> there occurred a dramatic event of great social significance. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">This was the<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> reversal in longevity expectations of men and women in adult life. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">A century ago (to be sure, in a largely rural context), <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a twenty-year-old man could expect to live longer than a twenty-year-old wife. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">In fact, such a man might well bury two or three wives, usually from the mortality associated with childbirth or other female problems.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Today, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a twenty-year-old man has little expectation of living as long as a twenty-year-old woman. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">To make matters worse, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">a twenty-year-old woman a century ago married a man considerably older than herself</span></strong>, at least in the middle classes, simply because future preference required that a man be established economically before he began to raise a family.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">     Today, from a series of causes, such as the extension of the female expectation of life faster than the male expectation, the increased practice of birth control, coeducation (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">which brings the sexes into contact at the same age</span></strong>), weakening of future preference and of the middle-class outlook generally, which<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> leads to marriages by couples of about the same age</span></strong>, husbands now generally <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">die before their wives.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Recognition of this, the increased independence of women, adaptation to taxes and other legal nuisances, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">has given rise to joint financial accounts, to property being put in the wife's name, and to greatly increased insurance benefits for wives. </span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Gradually the wealth of the country became female-owned, even if still largely male-controlled.</p>
              <p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">     But this had subtle results; <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">it made women more independent and more outspoken...</span></strong></p>
