              Look, I am not kiddin about this. The moment i think of my future to have such father connected with me is a torture. He is tht evil and cold blooded. Always affect my mood and life. I really hope that he evapourates in the air to ease my life and pressure. I can say tht i am unlucky to have such useless and irresponsible father. Sometimes, i have a thought of getting rid of this plaque but i know law does not allow me to do tht.
              
              I have a long story to say out loud but the public does not allow me to do so. My mind is bursting out sooner or later. 
              
              If u read my story, u will feel the pain i have and how my father is like.
              
              My father is a very poor person who does not like to save his money in the bank. He has a total of less than $10 in his bank. He also has many bad records in some banks, some of the money tht he borrowed from the bank are being paid by my mother. See, how useless he is that he has to use my mother's money to pay his debts. If my mother refuse to help him, he will either beat or pestering my mum. My parents used to have a joined acc and my mother will save a certain amt of money but my father will withdraw all out including my mum's hard earned money. The main purpose of him taking out and borrowing from bank is to gamble. He does not care about the high interest rate. All he thinks is if he gambles and win, he will be rich. 
              
              He is a big liar who keeps thinking of how to get money from my mum. There was once my relative gave us FOC to fixed the aircon. But he told my mum that needs to pay $500 for it. My mum asked my grandmother whether is it true anot and tht's how my mum knew about this. My mum's mother gave a gold necklace to my mum as a wedding gift, but u know wht, my father stole it and brought it to the pawn shop. My mum was so sad and angry bcuz tht was her mother's gift to her. 
              
              I rmb when i was 10 yrs old, my father even asked me to lend him money. He said he got no money to eat his lunch. So i lend him like $2.50. He even scolded me bcuz i gave him all coins. How will u guys feel when u read this? I was angry bcuz he did not pay me back and i could not do anything.
              
              When we are at the public, we have to pretend tht nothing happens to our family bcuz no one will want to bother and help us. We have to save a face to him and we dare not say anything to our relative bcuz they will hack care about it as it's not their problem. My mum told those incident to my father's mum but wht can she do. She will definitely help her own son. And we does not want to tell these anymore as they are too old. 
              
              My father nvr cooked for us, nvr do housework, nvr fixed anything. All he do in the house is eat, sleep, drink, watch and sex. He does not care about others but only cares about wht he wants like sex. If my mum does not oblige, he will throw temper and starts to say out nasty words to hurt my mum. He even threaten my mum tht he will kill her if he finds out something. I decided to make a police report but my mum rejected and said tht he might do harm to us. We have nowhere to go but to stay at this house. Plus we are scared that he might kill us while we are sleeping. My everyday life is like knowing i m in danger but yet we have to stay in the danger zone. There is nothing i can do but to persuade my mum to settle this asap. I am always not in good terms with father when i was at a very young age bcuz i know he's evil to live with, but for the sake of my mum, i have to protect her no matter wht and will not leave her alone. 
              
              My mum tried to forgive him and gave him a lot of chance but he does not cherish. He is already in his 50s but he still behaves like a child. One funny thing is i even have more money in the bank thn him. I even know how to think for the future before my 20s and yet he is alredy 50+ but still dunno how to think. He is a hopeless nut.No matter how hard u persuade him, he will still behave in tht manner and will not change. 
              
              I had enough of him and if i continue to live with him for the future. My life will be destroyed bcuz of him. So now all i can do is to ask my mum to divorce him. So that we can lead a happy and healthy lifestyle. And i am going to SERVE TIES with him but is tht possible?
              
              In conclusion, he is a fat, bald with a bulldog face who does not have feelings, a straightforward person who talks to hurt u, liar, gambler, always thinks he is correct, like to boast, very petty person, like to do childish action to scare ppl, a sex maniac, a rough person who talks with some low standard communcation, a bully, dirty minded, irresponsible, he is good for nothing. By looking at his face, you will have an imperssion of thinking tht he is a bad guy. His eyes are scary and his eyebrows are long n pointed down. 
              
              I could not think of anything good about him for my whole life. I think there is none at all. 
              Delete him away, GOD please.
              
              Thanks for your reading. I appreciate.

              <p>KINGYO, I feel for you. I left my home a couple of times because of my parents, and never go back. It was because their life isÂ just aboutÂ money, money is more important to them than family ties.</p>
              <p>Having said that, I just want to advise that you should forgive your father (Not forget what he did, but forgive). Given your situation, the best is to stay away from your father, not physically but mentally. Assume it's a stranger living in the same house, and do what you normally do to a stranger, ignore their bad ethics and live your own life. You can't let a stranger make you angry, if not you'll be angry your whole life because this world is full of idiots.</p>
              <p>Alot of people went through hardships, and still manage to come out successful, so I'm sure you can too. It may be hard to see how you can break out of this cycle, but trust me, if you have a plan and determination, you can break out of any bad cycle in your life.</p>
              <p>I do not have a step by step instruction to tell you what to do, because I think you have more knowledge and are better able to do that on your own.Â  One thing I can say is, life isn't as bad as you think it is. But you need to be able to find the positives in life and focus on them, rather than the negatives, such as your dad.</p>
              <p>They are born in the previous era where alot of things are different. One good example is education, majority of the older people are non-educated, so you can expect their behavior to be uncouth. Don't be offended by it. Patience is a virtue, and you have plenty of chance to practise that.</p>
              <p>Don't give up! You can succeed one day!</p>

              <p>The right word is not forgive... the correct words are "<strong>LET GO</strong>".</p>
              <p>Let go of your father. He is his own person.. he does not need your help.</p>
              <p>When he ask you for money... you just tell him " No".</p>
              <p>Learn to say NO to <strong>toxic</strong> family members.</p>
              <p>Your mother is stuck with him.. you are not .. so LET GO.</p>
              <p>Go and seek your own future.. go and build your own life , your father need not be part of it.</p>
              <p>You are old enough to stand up on your own two feet.. focus on building your life.</p>
              <p>If you fare good in your future.. then will you be able to pull your mom out of her rut.</p>
              <p>Yes it is too bad your father is a deadbeat... it's too bad your family is dysfunctional.. you are not the only ones... there's many out there....</p>
              <p>We feel your pain.. but you alone must walk the path to freedom.</p>
