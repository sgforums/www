              <p>Maybe you can send her a text after you send her home, to ask her how the date went on her part and also to say you had a great time. This is to lay the foundation for setting up the next date. From her response you can gauge how well she enjoyed herself and the level of your chances. It's also important for you to send that sms, it's only gentlemanly. Good luck.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>One who is looking for something will always be missing it.</em></span></p>
              <p>Seeing is just clarity eyes open, mind open, heart open. Not looking for something in particular; just ready and receptive. Whatsoever happens, one remains alert, receptive, understanding. Conclusion is not there! Conclusion has yet to come: by one's own eyes one will see - and there will be a conclusion. The conclusion is in the future. When you are seeing, the conclusion is not already there. When one is looking, the conclusion is already there. And one goes on interpreting according to one's ideas.</p>
              <p>ã€€</p>
              <p>A joke (parable):</p>
              <p>A child is reading a pictorial book on wild life, and he is intrigued with the pixs of lions. He reads whatsoever is there, but one question is unanswered there, so he asks his mother.</p>
              <p>'Mom, what type of love-life do lions have?'</p>
              <p>
              </p><p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><u>
              </u></span></p><p><u>'Son, I don't know much about Lions cos all your father's friends are Rotarians</u></p><u>
              </u>
              <p> </p>
              If one has<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> some idea </span>in the mind, it is bound to corrupt what IS. Then one is not listening to what is being said -- then one is listening according to Oneself ( one's mind interpretation of ... ). Then one is playing an active role. When one is looking, mind is active. When one seeing, mind is passive. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">That is the difference.</span> When one is looking, mind is trying to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">manipulate</span>. When one is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">seeing, mind a placid lake </span>-- mind is open to What IS, with no idea in particular to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">enforce on reality(WHAT IS)</span></strong>.<p></p>

              <p>TheMissus - thanks for the sms "trick" - actually this
                  was my second date with her and I got it exactly by doing the sms thing
                  ;)</p>
              <p>Jojobeach - I understand what you're saying.. just struggling
                  to draw the line between self-respect and ego... meh! im gonna ask her
                  out again tomorrow ;)</p>
              <p>fugazzi - I get your point about projecting my own ideas upon sitautions.. ill try  not to over-analyze things i guess and just go with the flow.. but its hard! lol</p>
              <p>Stimulatedfib - unfortunately , she probably doesnt like you - every chick who has ever had a thing for me has always replied to all my sms\missed calls etc.</p>

              What is the image of indian people for a chinese? how would her

              <p><strong>As a Singaporean, I can't really claim to know how PRC girls think and also China is so big, it would depend on where she comes from as well.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>You need to get to know the person. That is what dating is for, to get to know her.</strong></p>

              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">ettiquette or not, as long one is gentlemen enough would do just the trick. In anycase most PRC ettiquette are disturbingly associated with "how much money spent" </span></p>

              <p>Two wolves (being, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">INNER</span> landscape) reside in each of us, the first is needs, fears, beliefs (eg, customs, traditons, religion), jealousy,comparing sympathy,possesivness, insecurity, fear of loss , anger, prejudice, <em>always reacts</em> ... the second is love, kindness, emphaty , gratitude,unlimiting beliefs <em>always responds</em>.</p>
              <p>The one that is fed daily evolves - whom are u feeding, even as u are reading it now?</p>
              <p>Both is love - but with a <strong>BIG</strong> difference:</p>
              <p>the first is <strong>ego- based <span style="text-decoration: underline;">personality</span></strong>! - it eventually suffocates and kills the... (one remains accidental/ on the periphery) - the bird is always trying to take off but  wings are always clipped - cos love has become bondage here - the giving here is to take back (lots of expectations) - what is one sharing is this : complaining, whining, .... Here it is fear-based love and the anxiety is there to quickly make it a relationship. One is insecure.</p>
              <p>the second is <strong>soul-infused individuality</strong>! - it is everflowing abundance (essential/centre), it is a bird on a wing - one wing is love, and the other is freedom - love is freeing - the giving here is simply sharing what one is, appreciating what IS. Here it is love unto itself and one simply relates, one flows like the river and partakes of what the other is.One is abundantly rich within - hence one relates without fear and one has no reason(s) to love.</p>
              <p>The predicament of many is that they search and desire answers on all four quarters ooutside of themselves when the answers are and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have been all along</span> within; what is missing is the essential, the accidental - aplenty!</p>
              <p>The above is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">expansive</span> - not confined to relationships or marriage but other areas of one's daily ... and what have you.</p>
              <p>This is my experience observation and understanding, that's all</p>
              <p>Superimposed on a circle - one can only understand and transcend, one cannot improve on a circle!</p>
              <p>The first ripple .... watch and ....</p>
              <p>This transcends psychology!</p>

              <p>Parents concerns are understable. However, hopefully all parents can understand that it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unwise</span> to impose their prejudices, bigotry or burden their children to be what they think is 'good' for them. Of course, it presupposes that two persons (are or) can reconcile to these social divides and transcend and still be ok.</p>
