              <p>To TS.</p>
              <p>You are reading too much into this relationship. It is only the beginning. All you know about her is that she is beautiful, and someone you can talk for '7 hours' straight.</p>
              <p>But how much do you really about her? Her family, her likes, dislikes, reactions to particular situations, etc, etch. In truth, you know nothing, just as clueless as I am now with regards to who and what she is.</p>
              <p>All you see is a desirable lady that fits your imagination and eyesight. Is that true love? Are you willing to change for her, no matter what she really is, and do you think you can change her, into what you really want her to be?</p>
              <p>I am afraid the answer is no. Not because I, a nobody doubt your capability or capacity to love, but rather, because you do not know her enough to look forward to a long term committment plan.</p>
              <p>Most couples make that simple mistake of rushing into a relationship, and most end up with pain, some on both sides. There is more to love than literally sees the eyes. If you don't understand what I am writing, then be prepared for pain that will only eventually come, when you sink too much of yourself, your efforts and emotions into the relationship. This is when love becomes hate.</p>
              <p>Best just be yourself, hide nothing, and seek for friendship instead. Give yourself more time to know her, dating her only when both of you are mutually free or it will only be forced upon, and hated by either one party.</p>
              <p>Let her see you for what and who you really are, or whom you aspire to be, which will be something you can't hide forever, just as you will see her over time who and what she really is.</p>
              <p>Only then can you decide to move to the next level. Better to be sure, even if you will lose her in the meantime, than to be sorry later. Do not end up as another national divorce statistic.</p>

              <p>TS is elated by the fact its a PRC girl. If it was an Indian girl, would he be in a quandry? Remember the title: Indian Guy, PRC Girl. There is a hint of a boast there. But there is also an underlying fear in the following posts.</p>

              <p>Please keep your limited vision, overwhelming pettiness and your pathetic implied racist <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">hints</span></span> to yourself. This country has no place for the likes of you. It's people like you that makes me wonder why I should contribute to my country and not leave on the next flight.</p>
              <p>What are you actually implying about 'boast' here? That it is a big deal for an indian to fall in love or get into a relationship with a chinese? Who's the one with the big ego now?</p>
              <p>Heck, we all are one race - the human race - bleed the same and no different with each other at the very basic level where it counts the most! What the F*K are you drivelling at, petty guy?</p>
              <p>They are just 2 humans discovering each other, and sought views respectfully from others. Why denigrate them or put them down with such insults? AA is volunteerily done, if you don't like what is said, you need not be here at all. Go Speakers corners if you need to rant or put others down.</p>
              <p>Fortunately there are many others whom are not as myopic or racist as you are, and make the stay and efforts to remain worthwhile. You are just a burden we, as a society, must bear then till you and your kind die out in a natural death one day.</p>
              <p>PS: Normally, I would not comment on others' view and I would have let your remarks slide, for I am not here to argue with you, only to offer help and insights to TS and TS alone or others reading this thread whom are caught in such dllemmas,</p>
              <p>but seeing you and your kinds' personal petty prejudice and racism, espacially as we as a society had vowed under personal oaths, I had no choice but to react to you. We Chinese, espacially our forefathers, know what it is like to be racially discriminated against, by cowardly Brits and brutual Japs, and hell if we ever want it to be seen repeated, worse if comming from ourselves.</p>

              <p>U can sms her, call her, whether she reverts back or not - it's her prerogative,</p>
              <p>What's happening here is u are anxious to form a relatinship lar. Why? I surmise insecurity one your part.</p>
              <p>One who allows another to be is simply loving, and also cos love simply is</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Muse over this:</span></p>
              <p>An astrologer was walking at night, studying the stars and by the roadside there was a hole and he accidentally fell into it.</p>
              <p>The sound of his falling n crying awoke an old woman who lived nearby. She helped him and n he was very pleased.</p>
              <p>After thanking her, he told her that he was a royal astrologer - that his fees was high, that even kings/ queens had to wait for months to see him n conluded by adding that he would predict her future for no fee.</p>
              <p>The old woman laughed n said - You cannot see even two feet ahead - how you can see my future?</p>
              <p>This is the madness of today's living, what cannot appreciate what is in front, one cannot see what is - on is trapped in 'should be ... and ought to ... ie. one is caught in the duality of the mind's past/future</p>
              <p>when it perocolates/permeates into our daily living - in marriages, in relationship(s) - the endless conflict - love completely relegated to the bottomless pit.</p>
              <p>What <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one thinks is not what one is</span>, the predicament  in this instance to be love or lover!</p>

              <p>What are you actually implying about 'boast' here? That it is a
              big deal for an indian to fall in love or get into a relationship
              with a chinese? Who's the one with the big ego now?</p>
              <p>Heck, we all are one race - the human race - bleed the same and
              no different with each other at the very basic level where it
              counts the most! What the F*K are you drivelling at, petty guy?</p>
              <p>They are just 2 humans discovering each other, and sought views
              respectfully from others. Why denigrate them or put them down with
              such insults? AA is volunteerily done, if you don't like what is
              said, you need not be here at all. Go Speakers corners if you need
              to rant or put others down.</p>
              <p>Fortunately there are many others whom are not as myopic or
              racist as you are, and make the stay and efforts to remain
              worthwhile. You are just a burden we, as a society, must bear then
              till you and your kind die out in a natural death one day.</p>
              <p>PS: Normally, I would not comment on others' view
              and I would have let your remarks slide, for I am not
              here to argue with you, only to offer help and insights to TS and
              TS alone or others reading this thread whom are caught in such
              dllemmas,</p>
              <p>but seeing you and your kinds' personal petty prejudice and
              racism, espacially as we as a society had vowed under personal
              oaths, I had no choice but to react to you. We Chinese, espacially
              our forefathers, know what it is like to be racially discriminated
              against, by cowardly Brits and brutual Japs, and hell if we ever
              want it to be seen repeated, worse if comming from ourselves.</p>
              <p>Have fun digging your own grave, Mancha.</p>
