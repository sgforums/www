              bro...take it easy man. Just enjoy the dates first...might possibly scare her off if you plan too much too soon. 
              
              If she's capable and earns her own money, then i don't think you have anything to worry about. Not to scare ya, but i've seen some of my friends hook up with PRC girls who are not as well-off...during courtship, everything is fine and dandy. After the ROM, oh ho...that's it man. Every single cent is controlled by her. Freedom severely restricted, if not totally gone. Good thing for my friends is, the girls always have to go back to China once or twice a year, so when the cat's away, the mice will play. Ahaha. Though i think it's the restriction that leads men to behave that way in the first place...okay severely off topic! Sorry man. Just enjoy. Don't think too much.

                              <p>many people regards indian in singapore as a low level type of

              indian or bangala come to singapore to work as construction worker.
              the image of Indian in singapore is lousy. Indian is treated like
              criminals, we chinese call them AH NEY or KI LING KWEI, just nasty
              name, or ba bu.</p>
              <p>it's not racist, it's the culture of singapore. and our indian

              <p>For PRC, they are pretty and cheap. and yes, 3 date u can screw

              HAHAHA! "It's not racist, it's the culture of Singapore." So you're saying Singaporeans have a racist culture? Oh please. BTW, 'Ah nei' means 'BROTHER' in tamil, you cheena idiot! 'Our indians are used to it.'? I dare you to go up to any indian brother around town and say that in his face, he will gladly do cosmetic surgery for you. Got people like you around, i'm disgusted to have chinese blood

              <p><br> HAHAHA! "It's not racist, it's the culture of Singapore." So you're
              saying Singaporeans have a racist culture? Oh please. BTW, 'Ah nei'
              means 'BROTHER' in tamil, you cheena idiot! 'Our indians are used
              to it.'? I dare you to go up to any indian brother around town and
              say that in his face, he will gladly do cosmetic surgery for you.

              <p>Relax and enjoy lar - what 'moves' - if there are such ... motives/goals - no lar, love is not there! It is something else altogether. only u or the other would in all self-honesty see or can see what it is all about. I <span style="text-decoration: underline;">surmise</span> lack of self-love.</p>
              <p>PS : As for the so-called racist remarks and negativism - whoever is posting and whatever they are posting is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">projection of what dwells within him/her.</span> Eg. if i am race-conscious or bigoted (and closeted) ... i would be entangled in these web of name-calling and what-have-u.</p>
              <p> I would not say that it wrong/rite - but i would add that it would certainly weaken one without one realizing it. One cannot control what goes on outside but one can surely can what goes on inside!</p>
