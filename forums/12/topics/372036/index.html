              <p>first post here :)</p>
              <p>I'm a 26 y old guy from India. I'm well educated and very well traveled. I hold a decent job and am a Singapore PR.</p>
              <p>I recently met this beautiful 24 y old girl from China and have been on a few very enjoyable dates with her. She's well educated, smart and funny.We get along quite well as beside good looks she also has the ability to hold a meaningful conversation - a combination which I've had difficulty finding thus far.</p>
              <p>I just wanted to know more about what to expect if we keep traveling down this road...</p>
              <p>1) Expected Dating ettiquette for PRC Chinese women? - is it cool to date multiple people at the same time? how "slow" or "fast" is one expected to move in terms of physical relations?[ok that sounds like a question a 13 year old might ask .. lol]</p>
              <p>2)Image of Indian people in the minds of the Chinese: this differs vastly across countries, depending on the local populations exposure to (what is usually) a single strata of Indian society. What is the image of indian people for a chinese? how would her family likely take it?</p>
              <p>I understand that these are personal questions that differ by the family and are perhaps best directed at the girl herself. In due time I will do just that. For now, some general guidance would be helpful.</p>

              <p><br>u can typically bed a PRC china girl within 3 dates.</p>
              <p>but being a womaniser by seeing a few women in Singapore is a no-no in our local culture. u will end up poorer and if seen by other women while being with another, u will be dumped... because no security sense as seen by women's eyes.</p>
              <p>2) interracial marriage is tolerance in our society, just like a local singaporean Sarong Party Girl (SPG) be with a white caucasian man at pubs and clubs...</p>

              <p>Just to clarify: I make a distinction between dating and a committed relationship. Dating is casual - you can date 3 women at once.. just meet for food\drinks and maybe some physical relations - but its not exclusive.</p>

              <p><br>I've heard many opinions about white-chinese relationships.. the cultural issues etc. But very few about Indian (not local indian.. yes there is a difference) - chinese relationships...</p>

              <p>1) Expected Dating ettiquette for PRC Chinese women? <br>While it is common enough overseas for a person to date casually, it is not generally accepted in Singapore. Then again you're talking about a PRC Chinese woman so I can't really answer them for that. However, if it is a casual date, I think it's best that you make your intentions clear. I don't think there is a real guide to how fast or slow you can proceed in terms of physical relations. It is really much dependent on the girl. Most PRC girls don't have a very good image here in Singapore but there are the decent ones out there. You just have to discern if she is decent or otherwise. No one can tell you that. </p>
              <p>2)Image of Indian people in the minds of the Chinese<br>Ok, I'm speaking from a Singapore point of view. There is respect and tolorance between the local Indians and Chinese in Singapore. However, when it comes to inter-racial marriages (though it's really getting common between the 2 races), there is still this unacceptance from the chinese side of the family (I am not sure about the Indian side of the family though) </p>
              <p>If this relationship is serious to you, I think you really need to consider 3 other aspects:-<br>Religion, Customs &amp; Diet</p>
              <p>Religion; I don't think I need to touch upon it as that is the usual sensitive topic for all relationships.</p>
              <p>Customs; There are lots of differences between Indian &amp; Chinese customs and practices. As long as there is understanding and mutual respect, I'm sure it will work out</p>
              <p>Diet; I hope both of you are very cosmopolitian in tastes because I do know Indians like their spice and although as a local Chinese and I like spicy food, asking me to eat Indian food everyday is also too much for me to take. As the girl is PRC (depending on where is she from) she is likely to be even less used to traditional Indian food.</p>

              <p>Hi elindra - thanks for a thoughtful post :)</p>
              <p>Re: reputation of Chinese girls in SG.. well.. I'm not rich (nowhere close) and this girl knows it. She's educated enough to be able to easily get a PR on her own merit. So perhaps she's one of the rare few?</p>
              <p>Even though it is waaay too early to predict how things will go, if they do go well, I am open to a serious relationship with her.</p>
              <p>My family is cool with me getting together with anyone who makes me happy -  so no issues from my side.</p>
              <p>The 3 aspects you point to should be less of an issue in this case (hopefully!)</p>
              <p>religion - I'm not a religious person - and neither is she. Though I do enjoy celebrating festivals from all religions (food, fireworks and gifts!)</p>
              <p>customs: are there any glaring differences that I shuold be aware of? as far as I understand there are a lot of similarities (close families.. respect your elders... etc.)</p>
              <p>Diet: oh.. I eat *everything* (from bak kut teh to fried ants) and relish new food. Dont get me wrong - I love my Indian food ... but eating only one kind og cuisine every single day seems rather boring!</p>

              <p>I'm not sure about her family though as to put it bluntly, sometimes either race think that they belong to the more superior race.</p>
              <p>However, I think the biggest obsticles are always religion, culture and food/living habits, so if you both don't have an issue with that, that's like half the battle won already.</p>

              <p>If u think 'Indian' and she thinks 'Chinese' it is very difficult to  relate. It remains only superficial.  However, if u can put aside this aspect or be concious  and relate as two human beings without imposing encroaching on each other - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all is possible</span>.</p>
              <p>Love is a subjective existential expereince - it is the yearning of the heart for eternity. However, the mind(ego) interprets it as permanency.</p>
              <p>Love abides ONLY when fear and reasons are absent! When fear (of losing the other) and reasons (to love the other) are there - know this - it is not love but something else. Ego and love cannot co-exist - one has to go.</p>

              <p>Two wolves (being, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">INNER</span> landscape) reside in each of us, the first is needs, fears, beliefs (eg, customs, traditons, religion), jealousy,comparing sympathy,possesivness, insecurity, fear of loss , anger, prejudice, <em>always reacts</em> ... the second is love, kindness, emphaty , gratitude,unlimiting beliefs <em>always responds</em>.</p>
              <p>The one that is fed daily evolves - whom are u feeding, even as u are reading it now?</p>
              <p>Both is love - but with a <strong>BIG</strong> difference:</p>
              <p>the first is <strong>ego- based <span style="text-decoration: underline;">personality</span></strong>! - it eventually suffocates and kills the... (one remains accidental/ on the periphery) - the bird is always trying to take off but  wings are always clipped - cos love has become bondage here - the giving here is to take back (lots of expectations) - what is one sharing is this : complaining, whining, .... Here it is fear-based love and the anxiety is there to quickly make it a relationship. One is insecure.</p>
              <p>the second is <strong>soul-infused individuality</strong>! - it is everflowing abundance (essential/centre), it is a bird on a wing - one wing is love, and the other is freedom - love is freeing - the giving here is simply sharing what one is, appreciating what IS. Here it is love unto itself and one simply relates, one flows like the river and partakes of what the other is.One is abundantly rich within - hence one relates without fear and one has no reason(s) to love.</p>
              <p>The predicament of many is that they search and desire answers on all four quarters ooutside of themselves when the answers are and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have been all along</span> within; what is missing is the essential, the accidental - aplenty!</p>
              <p>The above is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">expansive</span> - not confined to relationships or marriage but other areas of one's daily ... and what have you.</p>
              <p>This is my experience observation and understanding, that's all</p>
              <p>Superimposed on a circle - one can only understand and transcend, one cannot improve on a circle!</p>
              <p>The first ripple .... watch and ....</p>
              <p>This transcends psychology!</p>
              <p>Lest its miscontrued, i m not against marriage or ... its the LACK WITHIN that i opine</p>

              <p>Ok...</p>
              <p>first post here :)</p>
              <p>I'm a 26 y old guy from India. I'm well educated and very well traveled. I hold a decent job and am a Singapore PR.</p>
              <p>I recently met this beautiful 24 y old girl from China and have been on a few very enjoyable dates with her. She's well educated, smart and funny.We get along quite well as beside good looks she also has the ability to hold a meaningful conversation - a combination which I've had difficulty finding thus far.</p>
              <p>I just wanted to know more about what to expect if we keep traveling down this road...</p>
              <p>1) Expected Dating ettiquette for PRC Chinese women? - is it cool to date multiple people at the same time? how "slow" or "fast" is one expected to move in terms of physical relations?[ok that sounds like a question a 13 year old might ask .. lol]</p>
              <p>2)Image of Indian people in the minds of the Chinese: this differs vastly across countries, depending on the local populations exposure to (what is usually) a single strata of Indian society. What is the image of indian people for a chinese? how would her family likely take it?</p>
              <p>I understand that these are personal questions that differ by the family and are perhaps best directed at the girl herself. In due time I will do just that. For now, some general guidance would be helpful.</p>
              <p>Thanks :)</p>
