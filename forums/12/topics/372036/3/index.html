              <p>As it ever occurred to you that your u are  being divisive as  and it is apparent (and palpable) that you seem to be harbouring some latent discontent with u.</p>
              <p>However, that is your predicament. And you are free to spout all that comes to you - it is you and u are being u what u type here. To reject outrightly, what one knows not or lacks insight is the highest form of ignorance.</p>
              <p>By judging - u are not defining what another is (in this instance, me) or . .. but defining what you are.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Like i mentioned before, i offer my views, opinions n what have u. u are free to be u just as others are. If it does not resonate of u or does not with u - lump it.</span></p>
              <p>PS - One's mirror that is thick with the dust of the past, cannot see clearly what is. One only sees what one wants to see, hence one misses! One cannot respond to what is. One merely reacts and all one does is use the past. Of course, the past is dead, it is only alive in the mind. The wise knows and accepts that the illusion of certainty cannot co-exist with existential uncertainty. At the most, one is clutching at straws of certainty!</p>

              <p>its possible that she is really busy. if you really are serious about her, just hang on a bit and approach her again by asking her out again. but just do it once more and if you get stonewalled, just back off. if she is really sincere, she'll go out with you eagerly or have a really really good reason, and she will make sure she gives that reason to you in a keen way.</p>
              <p>let's just say: if a girl reciprocates and likes you very much, you will be hardpressed NOT to know it.</p>

              <p>Do not be foolish. You don't have to give her the silence treatment just to prove anything.</p>
              <p>Do you not understand the meaning of " continuous" ?</p>
              <p>Do you want her to think that you'd keep in touch with her only when you want to hold her body ?</p>

              <p>should i *again* be the one to ask for another date? isn't that kinda needy and weird... on the other hand, isnt it childish to play such mind games? &lt;confused&gt;</p>
