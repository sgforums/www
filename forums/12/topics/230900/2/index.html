I not heer trying to tell u some lecture as i learnt it in a hard way.. I flung my O level beacuse of working... Well now, I do work but still attend lesson regularly and have since be achieving A&amp;B for all subject... I think it a priority, on whether u want it or not... Show u parent u can capable for studying and working... so they will be shame and u will be a confidence person next time.. As for they lousy teacher, don't bother about them , they only are limited to be a teacher... u can achieve must higher as u are still young.. be strong and overtake u teacher by wanting to earn more than her plus having a good cert.

            <div class='col-md body'>ok seems like you're contradicting yourself in some ways. you want us to teach you how to skip school and you still want to keep your mum happy. hmmm. not trying to condemn you here because you're some notorious boy in school but don't you think you should try and save yourself? if even you who can't save yourself what makes you think your "brothers" and your parents can?<br><br>i agree with someone who mentioned about priortising your time well. i don't see why you are facing all these problems when there are so many others who can work part-time and study and still score well. if people can do it why can't you? and what are your reasons for skipping this particular teacher's lessons? i don't believe her lessons so happened to fall on the same time for everyday right? if she complains about you i'm sure other teachers should be facing the same thing with you skipping their lessons as well. and instead of complaining about your teacher why don't you try talk to her about your problem and see what she has to say about it? i'm sure she should be old and sensible enough to reply you something decent and perhaps help you out by coming out with a solution to your problem.<br><br>basically what you're trying to do now is suffocating yourself. you're juggling between three things in your life. school, work and your "brothers". manage your time properly. so far i don't really know which job actually accepts people under 16 besides mos burger but i guess you don't have to work a 6-day work week to get your weekly allowance right? there's really loads of things you have to learn. i won't say you're young but you have yet to experience the many things tt await you. don't spoil your future  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Seeing the way you reply some of the forumers here really piss people off.<br><br>FYI, I used to work to support myself too. Though there is no need for me to do that, I wanted to try it out. My school takes up the whole day till 5pm or later most of the time, but I still can afford to work and NOT SKIP CLASS.<br><br>Admit it, skipping class is simply your own attitude problem and you do not wish to see that b***** in school.<br><br>If you do really experience a huge finiancial problem, you can talk to that b**** and explain the situation to her. And please, dont joke around with her. If the relationship bwt you 2 aint good, I dont see why you are not giving her due respect and behaving yourself.<br><br>JMHO.</div>

PROBLEM SOLVED... thanks to all for advice on this issue..<br>N those who dun fcuking understand.. get a life peeps.. </div></blockquote>hey kid!<br><br>if u want ppl to listen to u, first stop SWEARING! it pisses ppl off...<br><br>and 2nd, U asked for advices. and that's what you got! Just because you do now like the advices you hear, or that we do not agree with you, DO NOT SWEAR AND TELL US OFF! we took time and effort to analyse and give you these advices!<br><br>and Lastly,<br>whether your teacher is only looking out for her bonus or not, that's not the prob here. the prob is that u need to learn how to juggle work and sch. not whining and swearing to everyone.<br><br>find a way to balance out your wk time and sch time. if u do not wanna see your mum sad, then know that SCH is your FIRST PRIORITY!<br><br>but since you said that the issue is solved, Mods, could you please close this thread, seems like ppl here are just swearing and throwing vulgarities at each other. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
