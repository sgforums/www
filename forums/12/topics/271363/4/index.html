Most of the time, in a real world, the knowledge was hardly applied, but then the discipline stay within an educated man. His leadership, decision, judgement and thinking will be more precise in a way of getting thing done.<br><br>Nevertheless, some educated pples take their knowledge to commit crimes such as corruption as NKF shown. Having said that, most of the educated pple here are working class, because they are educated and able to understand or so call calculate the risk factors, most do not dare to set up or create business, therefore in Singapore, 7 out of 10 bosses are not educated with a U cert.<br><br>The question is, Why our education system tends to produce working class only?</div>
