            <div class='col-md body'>I guess the issue boils down to money, coz if the guy is well-to-do, I don't suppose his lower education would be an issue. So it depends on what each party expects of the other in the r/s. If it's a democratic r/s, it will not matter who has higher education, or who brings in more bacon. If the r/s is "old-fashioned " where the man (with the lower education, and assuming lower salary) is expected to provide for everything, then the gal shd not get involved with him in the first place.<br><br>It boils down to this: What does the gal want / love - the man or a certain lifestyle / status that she expects to have?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem should not be "does education matter in a relationship? "<br>It should be "does people change in a different environment? "<br><br>If the above is true, then, the answer is a big "YES"<br>People from university and people not from university's mentality are completely different... This is especially true if one is from local "ELITE" university... During the days of university, students will mix around, discuss future, discuss everything and this will cause change in them without knowing... In fact, if u look in world affairs, university is good place to brainwash students...<br>And it is also not surprising that people will change easily in Singapore coz Singapore is a fast pace society...<br><br>Therefore, from the above reason, those words below makes sense<br>"<br>one day,<br>she says that both parties come from very different worlds.<br>she says there's no future for them.<br>she says they no longer share anything in common.<br>she says she's losing the passion.<br>she says she's tired of trying.<br>she says she feel the heartache whenever she think about their future.<br>"<br><br>Most people will change in different environment in order to adapt...<br>But there are examples when people wont break a relationship because of change in them :<br>1) Some are stubborn 1<br>2) Some have family - (kids) where they treat their kids as their only drive in life<br>3) Some experience too much in life liao where they can overcome these problem easily...<br>And finally to answer, TS's question .... " Does education matters in relationship ?"<br>it depends lor...<br><br></div>
