Most probably she has found someone who is studying in the same uni, may not be scholar. The way she says it, chances are quite high, just a tactic to make you give up on her. I am not speculating but SMU programs and NUS biz programs offer double degrees......my gut feel is your sweetheart is studying in SMU.....accounting and finance are very hot now as a combination.<br><br>Y not you take a part time degree to upgrade yourself? There are many private schools that offer quality education. Just check with your civil service department which are the ones that are recognised.<br><br>No hard feelings but both of you are still young. Carve out a niche in your career. In time to come, she may not regret leaving you but hope you will not regret for wasting time and energy in a relationship that both of you know will not materialise and have a happy ending.<br><br>Wishing you the best in the pursuit of your own happiness.</div>
