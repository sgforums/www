I knew it sound stupid to adult just as my Dad, always scream at me to remove all Wang posters sticking on the wall of my room. He said it defeated his design for the room. But hell, which gal listen to daddy??. And when i look at his young photos, he looked and styled just like the so called Bruce lee.<br><br>But as we reach our adulthood, such feeling will faint away. That's is how stars and markets make money from us. It got us idolise with real and unreal personality and characters.<br><br>I am raised by a family that taught to take only what that is yours ethnically, and give whoever is needed geniunely. And i truly agree that a gal greediness for materialism by fooling a man's heart, reflect her poor parenting upbringing image, shame to her parents.<br><br>You are a fine man, dun be desparate about getting Love, Love is an emotion, there are many fine women out there, is just that good gals like to stay at home thereby preventing your chances ya. But first and foremost, learn to love yourself first ya.</div></blockquote>Well at first, i thought u are freaked out by my comments... *lol, what is this uncertain up to?*<br><br>Haha just to clarify things, U are really a gem in Singapore because ladies like u are really extinct in SINGAPORE!!! This is evident in many threads of Sgman going for oversea ladies. But most certainly, u are not the only one ya cos i found a gem too. Ok before i continue further, ya i know wang leehong is ur idol but won't it be gd that ur future hubby is as handsome as wang leehong and have ur desired hubby traits? This is my true intention.<br><br>Ok about being desperate about getting love -- yes i think i am. But then, i am currently using my mind to control my heart so that i won't fall for this particular gal friend too deeply. Well u are right and wrong that LOVE is an emotion.<br><br>I won't say about the right part, it is rather obvious. But for the wrong part, Love is about caring for that somebody without expecting returns. I care for her in the way that i rely information from her best friend. Whenever she meets difficulty, i want my friend to tell me so that i can secretly help her. If she ever got a bf, i won't say that i won't be sad but rather i should at least be happy that she is blessed with love.<br><br>When u love somebody and when is like somebody is totally different things altogether. I never do things without returns but this time round, I am really to give my help for free. BUT BUT this doesn't mean i will go and confess to her one day, i think i will never have the courage. Is stupid to say all these, but then if i am fated to be single, well why not make this particular girl i like as happy as i can? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Save thyself before saving others.<br><br>I think why these guys kena taken advantage of is because they are hoping for a chance. However, ur beautiful gal friends exploited a upon that chance to manipulate the poor guys. I wouldn't say is totally ur friends' fault as the guys are also too dumb to fall in the trap in the first place.<br><br>Hmm... what i can say is that the guys who trying to woo ur friends could be because they are gd-looking. But i should say not all guys are physically attracted to gals, at least to me, i attracted to a girl because of her character but also must be decent-looking imo.<br><br>Actually, i have already give up hope on wooing the girl i like in NTU. The silly part is it haven't even started. She seems to be shy to talk to me (people say is a gd sign that she love me) but i think she is just moody nowadays. On msn, we can talk very well but when face-to-face like cannot really communicate. I everytime initiate the conversation but she only reply me with a few sentences.<br><br>Alright, u will definitely meet ur loved one one day as long as u exhibits this quality.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
