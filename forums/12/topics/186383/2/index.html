As long as you dress decently people will make friends with you that is if you look apporachable. Poses like folding arms will make people think that they shouldn't apporach you.<br><br>You might think you are ugly but to some other people you might look ok. However what you need to do most is change you mindset that you are ugly, to one that you think that you are just like any other people in terms of looks. And if you think you are still ugly you need a makeover.</div>

And to communicate without the lingos or the Singaporean slangs. Try to do it.<br><br>And when you are behind your HP or messengers, do whatever you like.<br><br>or else, sooner not later, teenagers will all just know how to say three words " i txt you" when you ask them anything.</div>
