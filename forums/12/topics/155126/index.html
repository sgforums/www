This is his second affair.

Or is it true that a man with spare cash will start to have roving eyes? My grandfather started a family business and so my Dad and uncles are considered financially stable.<br><br>I feel sorry for the wives in my family. Can I do anything to help at all?</div>

They did not think that they have to lie and live in deceit. They did not think of the pain, hurt, shame they bring to their families. They did not think of the comfort their wives helped them secure. They did not think at all, of the good things, and appreciate the goodness their own families bring them.<br><br>All they think of is what "better and freedom" lives they have with their mistresses. Of course these men and their family pay very dearly for their mistakes. They will of couse make up excuses no matter how lame to justify for their actions.<br><br>To break this kind of cycle, takes a lot, a lot of reprogramming of the mind and thinking.<br><br>If you want, just as ppl suggest, go help aids patient. Go listen to children from such families. Or more importantly, imagine how you feel if you find out your own dad betray your family and everyone to have multiple affairs and have illegitimate kids outside whome now you have to recognise as half siblings.  It takes a lot of empathy to understand the kind of rejection one feels when one's parents does such acts. Step into the shoes of the betrayed. Read the stuff these women post up on the net and feel the issues they had to go through. The unbearable pain... that sometimes drives people towards sucide.<br>This is what people here want you to understand so as to not follow the foot steps of your relatives<br><br></div>

Go listen to children from such families. Or more importantly, imagine how you feel if you find out your own dad betray your family and everyone to have multiple affairs and have illegitimate kids outside whome now you have to recognise as half siblings.  It takes a lot of empathy to understand the kind of rejection one feels when one's parents does such acts. Step into the shoes of the betrayed.

From your advice and my family's problems in relationships, I believe I wouldn't stray..<br><br>That said, I really don't want to see my uncle's family break down. I don't understand why he would repeat this mistake, but we can't interfere too much cos my mum said it's his family affairs and it's inappropriate to probe too much into it. However, my poor aunt has 3 sons and it would be really tragic if they divorce.<br><br></div>

Like in those TV dramas, where the family is so close-knit, relationships between husbands and wives, brothers and sisters, cousins, uncles, aunties, grandparents, etc are so cordial. I wonder if it's because my Dad and uncles work together, so they tend to quarrel often, that strains the family relations...</div>
