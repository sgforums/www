A is someone whom you mention will be able to provide you well and have a good characteristics of a husband.. Although he seldome have time for you, at least he is making use of his time in work than to go flirting with other girls out there..<br><br>As for B, he is your ex sch mate.. Meeting up with him as friends everyday will not mean that he can or will be your bf or what.. You can always call him or your friends to accompany you out.. Does not mean that when your bf does not spend enough time with you.. and does not accompany you, you go around looking for another guy for companionship..<br><br>You cannot have the best of both worlds.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Guy B can make a good companion.. But that doesn't mean that a r/s has to develop from there.. He can be there anytime you wan him to be.. but then is because.. he can filled up your emptiness or loneliness.. or jus when you needed someone to be there with you...<br><br>On the other hand.. Guy A may not have so much time to spend with you.. But if he does.. he treasure every single moment with you.. And this oso keep him yearning/ wanting to see you more.. Going into a r/s is not about seeing each other.. or how much time you spend together.. Is the value of treasuring.. and the time spent each time you both are together.. how much it means to you..<br><br>Guy B ask you to be with him.. cos he knows that your bf A has no time for you.. and he oso have no gf.. got lots of time to kill.. this might be one of the reasons why he asking you this..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> Think about it.. <strong>Is this for love?? or jus for the companion/ company that both need.. </strong><br><br>Cheer...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, man is always career driven for many many reasons and one of them is about having the financial health to support his family.<br><br>Of course, you will want to be companied by your BF more often while he will has his own problems on his business.  Why not visit his work place and see if there's anything you can help out? This way, you can see him more often and understand what and why he is so busy about?<br><br>As for the ex-mate B, well, do you want another girl to stick to him or seduce him knowing that he is attached to you???<br><br>Try communicating your feelings/ problem to your current BF and try understanding what he is doing for a living.  Afterall, this is what relationship is about, isn't it?  Communicating the differences and understanding each other..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ask yourself:<br><br>- What do I want from a relationship?<br><br>- What do I expect of my boyfriend?<br><br>- Why do I need to go into a relationship?<br><br>- Can this relationship be maintained all the way till marriage?<br><br>All these questions will help you to understand what you really want from a relationship. From there, you'll be clearer of the situation and be able to make your own decisions.<br><br>Some comments: Your boyfriend adores you, and has the good qualities of a husband. But are you certain that he is showing his true personality, and not acting in front of you? Do you really love him for who he is? Are you certain that you can put up with this all the way till marriage?<br><br>As for B, do you really like him? Or are you giving in to him just because he can give you the company that you desire?<br><br>Make your decisions wisely, because you're going to live with that person for quite a long time.</div>
