Are you interested in him as well? If yes, then you should let him know by dropping a few subtle hints and signals. However, to play it safe...you shouldn't jump into conclusion and start to think that he might be interested in you until the moment he told you he like you. You certainly do not wish to be judged as an easy gal to go after, and you also do not want to be seen as a stuck up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So...if he really really wants you to be in a relationship with him, he will have to initiate the asking part. There are guys who behaves like this but are not really serious about the gal, so I hope that he is not one of them. Don't be the easy gal, be the cool gal instead. Until the moment comes, return him back his favour if you have some liking for him...be his twin counterpart instead. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>What he did doesn't really means that he likes you, just interested in you only. So what you need is a confirmation from him and it can only comes from him verbally and never from us. Don't think and analyse too much into it and continue to be yourself and enjoy your life.<br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>don't be a fool and play hard to get or make him jealous. Just be yourself. Your body language will tell him. And it seems quite obvious that he likes you, unless he is treating u as a real close friend.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what i felt after reading 3 pages of this and thats...<br><br>just my few advices from my own series of disappointments from 'thinking too much':-<br><br>Don't play hard to get. Just stay cool and drop subtle hints back.<br><br>If he is really interested to ask u to be his gf, sure he will ask one day. No matter how shy, still gotta bia for his offsprings bah?<br><br>Lastly, dont think too much whether you will be asked that qn. But you can still relish on the sweet moments...<br><br>Last last one: pray hard... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
