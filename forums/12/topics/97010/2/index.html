Everyone says so. That's what makes even harder to tell whether he is interested in me or not, because he can just be nice to me as a friend.<br><br>When he is talking to me, his friends make fun of him (As in, his friends would giggle and whisper among each other...and he would turn slightly red)<br><br>He is sometimes very shy around me. I am the one doing the talking most of the time, with him just listening.<br><br>Once I was close to crying and he went to look for me, told me not to be sad, bought me a drink and stayed on to cheer me up.<br><br>He called me sometimes to go out with him, to movies, etc. But sometimes I don't hear from him at all for a week (told me he was busy with his work) and then the next week it would start all over again.<br><br>He told me I am a very funny person, someone very easy to get along with.<br><br>Somehow all his friends seem to talk to me now and they keep saying things like, "Oh..he mentioned you last time...he said this and this about you..."<br><br>When I asked him where he is whenever I called him and he is not in, he would give me the whole details of where he went.<br><br>He just asked me out a few days ago. Then he disappeared for a few days because both of us are busy. But when I messaged him, he told me not to worry cos he would see me next week for sure.<br><br>He said he can't be with me during my birthday this year, he had wanted to bring me out for dinner but he has to go overseas at that time, so we are celebrating it early. Told me to remind him...<br><br>So what do you think? My friends all said he likes me. Said I was silly to even doubt it.<br><br></div></blockquote>Another similar post in AA.. This time is the other way round.. YOu can refer to this thread<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=96987" rel="nofollow"> Your analysis</a><br><br>If you really wan to know whether he likes you anot.. maybe can try a few ways like asking what kinds of girl he likes.. then joke with him awhile.. asking "someone like me?" All these questions you can ask him during your meetings.. but then.. if you feel embrassed asking.. then maybe ask in a different way..<br><br>Like joking manner.. or watever..<br><br>Can try.. but i cannot guarantee it will work..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
