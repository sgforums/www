              no need to push us to our limits.This is not Naval Diving Unit(if

              <p>tbh, I think that most UG group's discipline standard is dropping badly (not insulting anyone here). If he wants to bring it up back to standard, such ways might be used. Other than bringing the standards back, it's probably misusing authorises.</p>

Maybe in the example u illustrate is not yet the worst, but since u cannot change cca, why not just have a more positive mindset, like when u sec 3 it will be ur turn to lead and tgt with ur squadmates u can change the culture of ur cca? Just hang it a bit more! I think when u sec 3 u will understand why ur senior did that, but well, all the best!</p></div>

              <p>Hello TS,</p>
              <p>Understand you are having a tough time in your CCA. I feel that, if you really do not like it, you should speak to your teacher about it &amp; let him/her know how you really feel.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Due to the pressure in schools, I believe there are rules stating that every student has to have a CCA. Perhaps you could consider changing your CCA to have a change in environment. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Based on what you have written above, it seems that you're not trying to get back at whoever is treating you unfairly but more of pure disdain for your CCA itself.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Your teacher will understand that a Co-curricular activity is supposed to allow students to enjoy their non-academic time and pick up life skills that are not found in acadeimic curriculum. If a student does not enjoy his CCA, it will not help much with his school experience and his character as a person.</span></p>
              <p>Do also let your parents know that you are unable to cope with the physical and mental stress of being in a CCA that you do not favour. Remember to give your teacher some time to help you as some rules are not easily overturned. If you feel that the changes are not benefitting you, do speak to them again or you may even escalate this to the principal.</p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong or fearful with meeting a higher authority as we are all just humans. What we hope to achieve at the end of the day is a more positive schooling experience for you. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do drop me a personal message if you still require other advice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>
              <p> </p>
