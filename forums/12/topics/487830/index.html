              You should report him.
                  that's what happen when power is given to someone who doesn't know how to use it properly.
                  
                  cca is meant to round out students experience In various skills other than academic.
                  
                  It should not cause resentment and severe negative reactions.
                  
                  write down what you observed . Give truthful and objective informations about abuse. 
              Provide clear and solid examples.
              How long has the abuse been going on.
              Did the problem get worst over time?
              Did you report this problem to any superior other than him? Who else did you raise this issue to before?
              Why do you think there is an injustice? 
              Is/are there better way to discipline errors?
              Provide some solutions instead of merely complaining.
              
              present your observations to the school Principal. Request for intervention to end the abuse.
                  
                  A good principal will investigate and allow the in charge to deal with the infraction.

              You should wait and see if there is improvements. If the problem still persist after complaining to the teacher, you should escalate to the principal.
                      
                      During my school years, I had a friend who was similarly abused by their officers. It got so bad that she went home with blisters on her palms after her group was punished over the most stupidest mistakes. She had to do a lot of push ups on the tarmac under hot sun. 
                      Her parents were so mad they wanted to sue the school.
                      
                      After her parents made a huge complaint to the principal, an investigation was carried out. Many of the officers were given very stern warnings. After that, no more group punishments and they get plenty of breaks during cca 
                  
                  If the CCA is dreadful, it's not done right. The school should either shut it down or change a new in-charge.

              Whoever is dishing out those kind of punishments over a beret is obviously a sadist.

              All CCA are to be conducted under the supervision of a school official. 
              
              your school may be liable for child abuse and or negligent charges, if the principal continues to run CCA as is.

              Yes I have read your edited text. I am assuming you are not the one who left your beret in the toilet.
                  
                  Group Punishment is an injustice. Nobody punish the whole village because a villager stole a chicken. 
                  
                  Even if it's to teach a lesson, the punishment should commensurate with the level of misconduct.
                  
                  Again, any punishment meted out should be with good intent to remind, correct and improve.
                  
                  Your CLT is obviously deriving some kind of twisted pleasure when he dished out the punishments. He's a nutcase and needs to be reported so the abuse go away. 
                  
                  He needs to learn his lesson too. If you keep quiet, you are enabling his behavior.

              NS ? Please.. I've seen worst. NS is nothing compared to what you'll have to endure when you come out to WORK. 
              
              But we are talking about CCA, it's a choice. NS is no choice. 
              
              If you know this CCA has rampant abuse , would you sign up for it ? Hell no. You'd run the other way, and think anyone who goes into it must be crazy.
              
              You sign up a CCA because you believe you're getting something good out of it, an extra skill set or social development etc ,  you don't sign up a CCA to be abused by a psychopath.
              
              In NS there's an avenue for reporting abuse. Even higher rank officers must abide by a set of rules and ethics.
              
              Don't try to justify abuse. You need to nip it at the bud.

              He is likely currently living in his own karma.
              
              There are many articles out there that states, teenagers who exhibit abusive/cruel/ anti-social behaviors are often abused themselves. 
              Or they could be suffering from mental disorders that should be properly managed medically.
              
              For your CLT, he probably grew up with very punitive parents, where he gets beaten/punished over the smallest infraction. His parents may have punished the empathy out of him at a young age.

              You should go straight to your CCA teacher. 
              
              Your form teacher may not want to get into the politics of meddling with someone else's responsibility.
