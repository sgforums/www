              <p>no you are an extrovert who just have not found a good way to go full;-extrovert yet.</p>
              <p>youant to be out there, yet due to your inability (yet) to reach out you now envy the pro-extroverts who can so crazily hang out.</p>
              <p>full-true-introverts will not ponder on their status and wish to turn extrovert.</p>
              <p>in fact introverts won;t bother or post stuff like that exnvying an extrovert and wishig to be one.</p>

              <p>PS: All thanks to meeting Miss Saturday and reading her blog entries everyday he managed to enlighten an old man like me 50yrs odld about the terms introvert and extrovert and its perfectly normal to be either one or in-between.</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>To compare oneself to another is an insult to oneself and one would never feel ok and hence the misery.</p>
              <p>It is also disrespectful of oneself. How to relate, how to live - one would never feel fufilled.</p>
              <p>One who is always comparing oneself is most likely to compare another. It is so very undignifying and the insidious effect of such a stance woud certainly affect the ... in so many ways.</p>

              <p>I think i am worse woh...i hardly hang out with friends....prefering a hermit lifestyle...frankly i have never see anything wrong with that woh...when come to socializing...i have no problem at all, able to mingle around with stangers if needed....but end of the day i still prefer to be left alone especially during weekend....good thing is i come from a extremely well to do family...so i can do whatever i want with my life....and best of all i stay by myself, life has never been better for a hermit like me...FLEX...one thing i learn from life lesson is that no matter what lifestyle you lead end of the day important is you are happy.....&gt;&lt;"</p>
