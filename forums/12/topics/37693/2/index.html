Many a times in life, people haven't settle 'themselves' yet, before leaping into another relationship. The fear to be alone and to venture alone is there, which causes them to made a hasty choice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Looking for A in B, basically alot of people are doing it since they have their first relationship. Why? Because when you enter your first relationship, you will gradually understand which positive aspect you like and which negative aspect you hate. In the next relationship, you will source potential for some of this characteristic subconsciously.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Depending on how one sees it - basically, after one failed relationship that really affect you - I suggest a time to recuperate before leaping to another relation, if you want to avoid such issues.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many ppl have their own views and so do I. I've been "single" (If U r toking abt BGR) my whole life and I'm fine wif it... Even though at times I do feel lonely and envy couples out there. But hey, its our own lives and we shld accept da facts of it too.<br><br>You carve out your path and you should not regret it. Even if you are close friends with your female counterparts, you should be content. Put it this way, You don't have to have a "stead" or something to "be together". There are friends and families to accompany you. Just remember, you are NOT single in life... You have companions all over you, regardless of age, distance, race or religion...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Anywae... dis is juz my view... so U can dun bother if U like, but bottomline is: U decide yr life.

Activities would be chalets, camping trips, 1 day JB shopping trip and stay overnight at one of the nearby hotels and check out next morning (usually most of my ladies members will go for this), 2 days 1 night trips to certain parts of Malaysia where all interesting activities are seriously planned for fun...and many other activities like sky-diving lah, rollerblading lah, wakeboarding lah....get-together dinners lah and so on.<br><br>I encourage my members to know one another thru activities and not jump into relationship too soon.

            <div class='col-md body'>there is definitely nothing wrong being single. I believe that being single gives one more freedom...physically and emotionally. You can go the places u want to go, do the stuff u wanna do. It is not to say this cant happen if u're in a relationship but quite often..you have to compromise or accomodate your partner;s decisions.<br><br>Emotionally, being single means that you are spared the lovers tifts, the misunderstandings and sometimes jealousy as well as the  confusion and stress during special occasions like V-day and X'mas abt where to go, what gifts to buy and how to celebrate.<br><br>But at the same time, being single also means that theres no special someone who u can share your happiness and problems with...no sweet romantic suprises that your partner will spring for you on your birthday or anniversary.<br><br>Do the maths and choose the path to your own happiness..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cheers</div>
