Some people who enters a relation still never knew what love was and there are others who never learn anything from their past relation - a utter failure in my point of view for the latter to take place.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Most people in this world crave some form of dependancy, some form of care, concern and the need to feel loved. You desire a someone who loved you and you love her/him as much - chances are: how slim is that to really happen? It is not rare - but neither is it common either.<br><br>People face it - most of the time it started off as one sided and feelings eventually grew because you *wanted* to give a chance for a potential relation to bossom. In the end, you found yourself liking him/her very much and before you know it - this relation is gone.<br><br>In any case; once you did fell in love and enters into a relation - subconsciously you will crave for all the positive aspect that you once had after when you revert back to single status. You longing for this element will grow and like drugs to men - you are addicted to it. (Further strenghten if your relation is a lenghty one OR if you put overly dependance onto your partner OR sexual activities in relationships).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You crave;<br>You desire;<br>You want and it became a need.<br><br>There is someone there - without thinking much and within a flash you feel that you have fallen for her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Are you so sure you are falling in love with the person because...<br><br>I) she is that kind of woman/man you will love - your style of partner<br>II) There is an invisible vibes that shoot through you, telling you that she would become an important person in your life?<br><br>III) Or it is to satisfy this unseen subconscious craving for your wanting and dependancy?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In my opinion - absolutely alright to remain single. If there is a choice to fall in love with the wrong kind of man/woman OR to remain single... what would you people choose?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div></blockquote>eh since when being a single is a sin. in fact the bible says that if we can be single is good. cuz can serve God better. but its oso good to get married and stuff. after all God created woman to be with man.<br><br>and another thing. erm i think the phrase is called rebound. its like after u split up with a girl u will suddenly think that u like this girl, which u subconsciously replaced her with yr ex. thats not love. u love the girl for who she is, and not make her a representation of yr ex.<br><br>u're very knowledgable yunhaier. pls comment on this post. i would be honoured</div>
