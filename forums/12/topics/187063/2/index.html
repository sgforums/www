There have been cases of guys who make their girlfriends take naked photos of themselves. And when the relationship is over, the guys blackmail the girls using the pics.<br><br>And even if the two of you don't break up, ever thought about what may happen if your bf loses the pics and they fall into the wrong hands? (Hint: Tammy.)<br><br>In the first place, if your boyfriend was such a nice guy, he wouldn't have asked you to take naked pics of yourself. He is asking you to do this out of lust, not love. He sees you as nothing more than a sex toy for his own pleasure.<br><br>I say dump this jerk and find another guy who knows how to respect women.</div></blockquote>I concur with fudgester. Apparently, your boyfriend has succumbed to the devil's whisper of lust, possibly due to the foreign's soil he is residing, adopting the wrong culture. Remember, we are Asian who have our own values and belief.<br><br>In a serious romantic relationship, heavy petting is considered acceptable but not love making. That comes after you have signed the dotted line at ROM. For more conservative type, perhaps after customary wedding ceremony. Well, there are those who jumped into husband-wife phase of relationship by doing the reverse.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Unless your boyfriend has a strong spirituality, fudgester and others' input are more or less the truth, nothing but the truth. Of course, it is still your decision as we do not have a full picture of your relationship. We are onlookers with limited perspective but we know better because of our experience and knowledge of social norm.<br><br>You are calling the shot at this point of time.<br></div>

I don't think there is anything wrong with what he is asking - but I do think to threaten his loyalty in exchange for it is underhanded. Faithfulness should never be used as a weapon to obtain sexual favours in a commited relationship.<br><br>This is a good way of understanding your partner more, and knowing if he is the type of person you would like to settle down with - afterall you have already been together 3 years. If it isn't, better to cut the line. </div></blockquote>He mentioned that he doesnt like to search online because it is not me and he doesn't feel connected to me by looking at these pictures.  By doing this, he feels very close to me. In three yr r/s, we had sex only once and that was b/c I didnt want and he respected. When he went overseas for work and came back home, we spent holidays together, and both could not control. This was the first time we had sex after three yrs together. Then he left for overseas again. Long distant r/s is risk taking. I just have a gut feeling that it will end no where and finally remains in me a loss although we both do not have anyone at the moment (I trust him).

Sometimes long distance relationships work in strange ways. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> However, sexuality is something you cannot ignore and pretend doesn't exist. When I say sexuality - i dont mean sex but desire. And there should be nothing wrong if both are consenting adults. If you are uncomfortable with sending him photographs, but still wish that there is something you can do - try thinking of a compromise <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I dont like this idea because I think it is quite cheap for a gilr to do so. I feel ashamed to do it.

I think he is an idiot and you will be a bigger idiot if you give him those pictures. Think of what he can use against you if the relationship turns sour.</div>
