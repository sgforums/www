And it's really your own choice or torment to give yourself false hopes..<br><br>I'm not currently out of love but I'm sort of 'alone' for this period... Alot of times when she can't be around, I just realise that I need to take some time to re-organise myself and get used to being alone again... To live my life myself and do things the way it used to be.... Yup.. It takes a bit of 'adjusting' to.... And I think the real difference between my case and most of the others who have broken off would be that they still linger on the 'love'... So my love is still there just that I don't get to touch it... Any difference? It's really where you wanna focus your thoughts on... And whether you really are going in the right direction, picking yourself up in the right way....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
