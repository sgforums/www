Its just a joke to make you smile and forget about your sorrow.<br><br>Now, you seem to me like a nice girl. How he left you alone without any information of his whereabout is very very interesting. I say interesting because it may seem that he probably wants to make things clearer to you that he wants some time for himself. I am not trying to deceive you, but I gather from what I have read in this conversation that you have narrated to these nice people here, is that probably the mind of your boyfriend is very confuse like yours. So I think you have to relax and let him be by himself for awhile. I think he will call you or sms you when he feels much better.<br><br>Sayonara,<br>Joe.</blockquote></div>

Well, let say that when a guy is very busy in his work or in his business management, he usually comes back with a lack of energy and sometimes even to the extend of being depressed from friends, work and in your case, your consistance pressures of asking him to call or sms you always. Could be you and maybe not him?<br><br>I am very frank with you here. If a sweet lady keeps a guy by using the sms or phonecall, that is very inconvenient for him to feel that you trust him too like the way he trusts the beauty and heart of yours.<br><br>So, when you are back in, he likes to convey his feelings of missing you so much when you are not near him and sometimes he needs to see you because you have the notion that he is flirting around with other girls or with another special woman.<br><br>Now, how do you feel about the possibility of him having the thoughts of flirting around while you are abroad? That is plausible and he is confused because of his own stupidity mistakes of being unfaithful to you. How sure I am? I thought about the matters of the heart that you and the others have mentioned here, it leads to many answers but I see only one answer to this one man of yours, He has another congenial female companion.<br><br>I am sorry if I have offended you with my impression of you and your boyfriend. Being thirty years of age and you being much younger than him, he is expecting a lady with much greater nature of maturity and understanding. How many times you called him.... something that he disliked to hear from you?<br><br>Joe<br><br></div>

Then fortunately a good dear friend of mine introduced to cycling.<br><br>I discovered that cycling has helped to take a load of misery &amp; grief off from my mind. Since then I've been an avid cyclist; some days I ride as far as 190 - 260 kms to Desaru or beyond.<br><br>When I'm in my saddle, I feel so exhilarating and I'm in total control of my life....it's so therapeutic.</div>
