              i just need some advice and opinion on whether im doing the right thing.
              
              ive been trying to get over this guy. he made me think we had a chance but when he just didnt make a move, i knew it was either i misinterpreted what i perceived or he was just too cowardly to do anything about it. it was awkward and painful, especially when people around us noticed and kinda anticipated something to happen between us.
              
              BUT i was the subject, could you imagine how i would feel, especially when i started to like him a lot because of what he was doing to me. 
              
              so i knew i had to move on. and this is made harder because we are school mates and we see each other every single day. i blocked him on msn. i avoided going to where he was. i rejected lunches with groups of friends as long as he was there. 
              
              basically i avoided him and pretended that i wasnt. i think he didnt suspect anything becuase we kinda drifted apart. i didnt give him a chance to question about it either. basically we never spoke or interacted even though we see each other. 
              
              i would find myself getting better, less emo. but whenever i had to see him or talk to him, i would just plunge into deep sadness again. i have been having rollar coaster rides these few months with him. 
              
              i would tell myself not to sucuumb and talk to him even though i really wanted to.
              
              
              and i guess he doesnt know because i kinda have been fighting this war on my own. he probably doesnt know that ive been building a wall to keep him out. he probably just thought that i didnt want to come online anymore, or that our paths dont cross any more, by chance. 
              
              i want to know if im doing the right thing in helping me move on. is avoiding him the best option? then why do i relapse again and again after i get better?

              <p>1. Why you avoid him? You have some feeling for that guy?</p>
              <p>2. Ask yourself, do you still love him? or treat him as a casual friend?</p>
              <p>3. Did you ever talk to talk alone about this crashes?</p>
              <p>If you really dont have a liking on him, I suggest you better concentrate on your studies. Get good result is more impt than having a bf.</p>
