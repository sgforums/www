              1) i avoid him  because im trying to get over him. im trying to get over him because i need to stop allowing myself to be sad over him. because there probably is no chance since he isnt making any move. so i shall end it on my terms. 
              
              2) yes, i still like him, and thats why it hurts still. i think i dont even treat him as a normal friend. we're more like strangers. just hi-bye friends already.
              
              3) nope, it is assumed that we both do not like each other. hence we do not talk about liking each other at all

              yeah..guess if he really wants it, he will come looking for me. if i go to him, im making myself at his disposal. besides, i wont have courage to confess, because i fear rejection. so i want to end it on my terms, by getting over him. 
              
              im avoiding him like a plague. but wo bu gan xing. thats why its so hard for me to move on. deep inside, i feel like there is a tiny shard of hope, and that he did like me before. maybe not enough, thats why hes not doing anything. thats why im so heartbroken, because i have already fallen so much harder than he did.             <blockquote>

              <p>1) i avoid him because im trying to get over him. im trying to get over him because i need to stop allowing myself to be sad over him. because there probably is no chance since he isnt making any move. so i shall end it on my terms. 2) yes, i still like him, and thats why it hurts still. i think i dont even treat him as a normal friend. we're more like strangers. just hi-bye friends already. 3) nope, it is assumed that we both do not like each other. hence we do not talk about liking each other at all</p>

              <p>Did he misled u? What did he do? U neva state full detail of how he became close to u so I canot evaluate yer situation.</p>
              <p>Let be fair to yer guy fren, he is just a school kid, so he probably got no idea about you liking him. You avoiding him n boycotting him, is being a bit unfair isn;t it? I dun understanding why you say, everybody at school is talking about both of you, as if you both are the "in" thing. It is not as if, he walked away from yer wedding ceremony, rite?</p>
              <p>If this continue to hurt you. There r two ways for you to confront the matter.</p>
              <p>First - Confess yer feelings to him. Tell him, u want to speak to him privately. If u feel u r afraid to tell him, confine wif ur close fren and ask them, how you can approach him. Lets hear from him, what he thinks of it. If he is not interested - means "he is not tat into you".</p>
              <p>Second - Forget about it. Concentrate on yer studies. Your guy fren is just a schoolboy, what does he know about relationship? Dun pile all the guilt on him.</p>
              <p>I write to u to help u so that u dun turn into one of the bitter n <strong>miserable forumer here</strong>, the old lady GolumÂ (<strong>littlemissbonker</strong>) who hav been roaming around Mordor, screaming precious precious cock, bcause got dump by something.</p>
              <p>U still young, u have a future, u can change. Wat? A guy fren can hurt u so bad. I say again, if he really cause so much confusion in u, best way is to confess yer feelings to him n talk to him privately. Whatever the answer - case close - go on with yer life.</p>

              thanks julian.khor. 
              
              yup, guess he did mislead me. maybe it wasnt his intention. our friendship grew via msn chats which became very very frequent. he would initate chats, then he started talking to me very single day. i used to go to his tutorial room during our breaks to just chit chat. we became very close friends. i guess things started from there. 
              
              maybe to him, he was just seeing me a very good friend. but for me, it was like. guess it felt good to have someone pay attention to me and always wanting to talk to me. 
              
              and yup, studies more important definitely. he's an adult, im an adult. he's freaking 23 years old. i think he shouldnt be that dense as to not know or feel anything going on.

              <p>He is either just not tat into u or he may hav somebody else in mind. Like I said, if the issue is so distracting to u, why dun u settle it by asking him out privately n confessing how u feel about him? Then all clear.</p>
              <p>Look, there r other guys worse than him. Some go n con gal's money. Some go n cheat around. Some beat up their partners. All he did was being dense. Does he deserve to be treated tis way? Just act normal n forget it.</p>
