              <p>I am implying that as long as one does not <span style="text-decoration: underline;">reconcile </span>to what is lacking <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within</span> oneself (aka unrecognised/unacknowledged conditioning, expectations, needs) ,one bound to feel lonely, one is bound to be bored. The ''solution'' is to reconcile to that aspect within oneself and still have friends or whatever one does. Otherwise - whatever one does or has (is only ''good''/'workable'' to some EXTENT) - all are psychological props and sooner than one knows anxiety or anguish would the the mainstay cos one cannot guarantee that things/people outside of oneself would remain the same. This is the predicament of many and sadly many are oblivious to that aspect that dominoes <em>one's being</em>.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, the same vicious circle and cycle!</p>
              <p>PS Words in quotes cos there are no absolutes as all is relative to what is.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the replies (well some of them anyway.</p>
              <p>I already do volunteer work and have met some great singporeans who have been very welcoming.  I have to say I am somewhat surprised and a bit dissapointed by the reply of angel7030.  I thought this was supposed to be an Aunt Agony topic so I have come here for advice and support and find instead a particularly unhelpful and unthoughtful reply. It would be easy to go to somewhere with expats (singapore is full of them) and to an expat webiste but I am interested to get singaporean friends and become more involved in singaporean life (as Loor advises).</p>
              <p>Coming from a multicultural country I am not hung up about race - back home I have many friends of different races- and was hoping to make some here too.</p>

              <p>I am a nun by training, because when I was young, I am very naughty, so, my Dad decided to sent me to the nunnery in taiwan, nunneries in taiwan are very discipline, they taught you about life and how to live with the nature of it, meditation and the essence of living, it is not much about buddhism religion, you dun even need to be a buddhist to be train there, many christian ang mos gals also train with me, the idealogy is to tame a person down, so during school holidays, unlike other childrens who go disneyland or holland, I hv to go back to my nunery to attend each semester. When you are ploughed back into the layman world, you see thing different, you understand why it is like this and why it is like that, my career and work is of course different lah, but the basic understanding of suffering is there for me.</p>
              <p>Unlike singapore kids today, or even the adults, dun even know what is life, suffering and also cannot take hardship, a little problem only, complain here and there, typically speaking, no singaporean had beg for food before. Do you the skill and essence of begging?</p>

              <p>Whatever, the name is just an illusion.</p>
              <p>Lesson 1, begging.</p>
              <p>In begging, we finally come to understand the lowest of life and the give of purity, we finally learn to enjoy the food given, even if it is just a few droplet of rice, it will be the best taste and food you ever get, for that, you will appreciate foods and whatever is given to you.....</p>

Actually, we can even sponsor the nunnery, why need to beg, we can also buy or harvest our own rice, vege and fruits, why need to beg?? because begging will make you at the lowest form of life, from there you can see up and understand all other life better, people use to say, let hv a top view and see a clear picture, but in nun, we see from the bottom, looking at top mostly will miss those sheltered issues/problems. People use to say, let work the ground, but are they??? he who talk but never experience it is a train parrot rather than a caring human.</p></div>
