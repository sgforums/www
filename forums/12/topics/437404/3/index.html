              <p>I am a nun by training, because when I was young, I am very naughty, so, my Dad decided to sent me to the nunnery in taiwan, nunneries in taiwan are very discipline, they taught you about life and how to live with the nature of it, meditation and the essence of living, it is not much about buddhism religion, you dun even need to be a buddhist to be train there, many christian ang mos gals also train with me, the idealogy is to tame a person down, so during school holidays, unlike other childrens who go disneyland or holland, I hv to go back to my nunery to attend each semester. When you are ploughed back into the layman world, you see thing different, you understand why it is like this and why it is like that, my career and work is of course different lah, but the basic understanding of suffering is there for me.</p>
              <p>Unlike singapore kids today, or even the adults, dun even know what is life, suffering and also cannot take hardship, a little problem only, complain here and there, typically speaking, no singaporean had beg for food before. Do you the skill and essence of begging?</p>

              <p>I have never begged for food or money before. But dun you think that activities like going for job interviews, talking to clients to buy your products, asking boss for pay increment/promotions, etc are all part of begging? It all revolves around getting money and food on the dinner table. We can't see it because its indirect.</p>
              <p>However, I do agree with you that Singaporeans are more fortunate compared to 3rd world countries whose people face famine and natural disasters.</p>

              <p><br>we sgreans in politics alos have our own problem. in teh bigginning we had it not any easier. where you come from its your gahmen and policies that is the problem. your people on your own also need to buck up if they want a good life. going to another country to search for a better life may not always reap its sows, while i think or gahmen open door policies may not be the right solution to our own island's problem.</p>

              <p>so please don;t envy us, in a feat and split second of thoughts decide to come here and create lots more social problem for us.</p>

              <p>Master: The mortal world is nothing but an illusion and peoples are just being used as part of the illusion to make it as perfect as possible. When u seek no glory, no pride, no ego and walk out of the mortal world, you see the real you. For them sex and money play the actor and actress role, without it, the illusion vanish</p>
