              <p>I not very sure but if u feel like crying due to been too anxious, probably meaning ur body is not able to handle the stress u facing.<br><br>our body had diffent ways of telling us what it cannot handle, some will have nerves breakdown, cant stop laughing or crying. etc.<br><br>I knw myself I worried too much unnecessary and stressed myself up.<br><br>one example, while on the road to recovery, I had appointments may it be with doctors or friends or others.<br><br>Those dates will disturb me, each day, my brain will auto think about it, how many days left b4 the appointment, when, where, who, time. etc. etc.<br><br>especially at night when about to sleep, my brian will auto think about them and the more i think the more stress i became and prevent me from sleeping.<br><br>Thus, I need a planner for my daily life since then.<br><br>I set alarms on all those dates, time and places, things to do. etc. etc <br><br>I had to stop my brain from over working and stress up. too many things in head = stress...<br><br>therefore, meaning i had to change my life style from the past. rely more on tech and stop relying on my brain.<br><br>this somehow works for me, all those alarms i set, actually make me stop worying over those appointments and thing to do.<br>so now i plans everything what i will or may need to do in future all written down on my planner. <br>Thz to smartphone, I can have all set there and even all my mp3 where i can plug my ears on while travelling.<br><br><br>your case, is it serious or not, I no idea cuase I'm no doc.<br>If it affecting your daily life, then u probably need seek some kind of helps.</p>

              <p>Depends...<br><br>The very 1st few psychiatrists I seen and all those medicines didnt help me at all.<br>Reason, I was in a situation whereby i cannot get out of the environments where I am.<br>I'm being stress everyday and victimized. I was on medication for a year+<br>It never helps and got worst instead.<br><br>Only when I finally left that place and seek treatments again.<br>Then i was on medication for half to a year or so. Took me 2 years to recover.</p>
              <p><br><br>So my experience tell me.<br>to Recover, one need proper rest and and sleep.<br>medication helps to condition my body so i can have proper rest and sleep.</p>
