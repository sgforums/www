              <p>Hi x23, I was a victim of anxiety disorder before for a period of 3-5 years.</p>
              <p>My advice to you is to seek helps from doctor, doctors if need.</p>
              <p>I had went for counselling and seen several psychiatrists before.</p>
              <p>In short,</p>
              <p>2003 - things start to go wrong everyday and stressed up.</p>
              <p>2004 - seek counselling and psychiatrists</p>
              <p>2005 - too stressed, panic attack almost everyday, cant sleep, etc. until body break down. (organ shut down)</p>
              <p>2006 -  stop working and seen a private psychiatrist.</p>
              <p>2008 - finally free from anxiety disorder and cured since then.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, high chance stress is the cause for your condition. You need seek proper time to rest and stop stress accumulation and medication to assit you.</p>
              <p>I had made a post about a year ago on someone's else topic "Am I Suffering From Depression Or Mental Disorder?" You can go read about it and roughly get an idea what I had been through.</p>
              <p>I'll help with whatever I can if u need.</p>
              <p>Take care!</p>

              <p>I never said anything about IMH, and I have never seen any doctor
                  in IMH at all.</p>
              <p>when I 1st called up was to seek help with councelling party, from
                  there then I seek treatments with a psychiatrist.</p>
              <p>As I had said in my others post, I was not able to get proper
                  treatments due to the fact that I was not able to resign, thus my
                  condition got worst everday.</p>
              <p>Until oneday, I A&amp;E hosipital coz of severe pain in the
                  gastric. I A&amp;E a few times with different hospitals as they were
                  all not able to determind whats wrong with me. I also seek others
                  tradition treatments too, e.g accupunture.</p>
              <p>Finally 1 day a doctor diagnosed that it actually system
                  breakdown, which is in my case, organ-stomach. It had shut down,
                  refused to work was his ways of telling me that this body can no
                  longer take in anymore stress.</p>
              <p>my severe stomach pain started in 2005 and tormented me for about
                  a year.</p>
              <p>some friends thought I may had stomach cancer and told me to go
                  checkup.</p>
              <p>when i stopped working  in 2006, I was introduced to see a
                  private psychiatrist.</p>
              <p>From there, I started taking medicines to help me sleep and calm
                  down.</p>
              <p>There are many types of medicines for treating stress related
                  patient, there is no 1 medicine suitable for anxiety disorder, each
                  person is different and reaction to those drugs also different. The
                  doctor will start with small dosage of a drug for u to take for abt a
                  week, then he will ask u how ur days for that week and how is the
                  drugs.</p>
              <p>If he find the drug not suitable he will change to another type
                  and ask u take another week, then same thing until he found a drug
                  suitable for u to take and the dosage will increase from there on and
                  as u get better he will reduce the dosage again.</p>
              <p>Also all those drugs prescribed by psychiatrist all have side
                  effects which are bad for the human body and thus are not for long
                  term treatments.</p>
              <p>seeing a psychiatrist is not just taking medicines, he will also
                  chat with u and slowly talk to you and you slowly tell him everthing
                  about your problems. offcourse each minute and hour with him will
                  cost you money.</p>
              <p>I had seen NUH and Alexandra hospital psychiatris, but I can tell
                  and feel that they were not listening to me and doesnt care, probably
                  they had to see hundreds of ppl like me every days and not able to
                  give me their full attention. They only able to see u max of abt
                  5-10mins per visit and give u your medicines for few weeks to a
                  month.</p>
              <p>And by the way when I said I was cured, This took me 2years+ of
                  resting a home alone. I was seeing that private psychiatris for about
                  a year then stopped,</p>
              <p>It's very expensive, a few hundreds per visit for that 30mins or
                  so.</p>
              <p>my stomach no longer give me anymore pain in 2008 and that is when
                  I know I was cured, no more torture from the pain or cramps. But this
                  dont means I am back to a normal person I still cannot tolerate noisy
                  environment especially with many peoples. I travel with bus/mrt and I
                  always need my ipod with me all the time else i will go
                  h<span lang="en">yperventilation</span> again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is my experience, believe it or not. I dont need to give u all the details about what actually happens all those years.</p>

They don't realise that it really does affect a person's life until they can't function properly. Medical doctors practically don't even give a crap because when they check your body and didn't find any physical illness they will ask you to go home and not treat you seriously. I went to ttsh and the doctor practically said she cannot do anything because she is not a psychiatrist.</p></div>

              <p>I don't suffer from anxiety disorder, or any other form of depression. But someone very close to me used to. And believe me, it can be healed!</p>
              <p>As someone here correctly said, you need to see doctor or psychiatrist, medicine helps.</p>
              <p>you also should have someone close to you to whom you can confide. This is very important. They can be your parents, your siblings or your friends, someone you can really trust, someone to whom you can show your heart and mind. It is very important to speak out, don't let anything buried in you but continue to hurt you. It may be from your parents, or your friends long long time ago. It may also be your own high expectation for yourself and unknowingly you put too much pressure on yourself.</p>
              <p>My close friend got out of it, she stopped taking medicine because she had no more problem, she didn't take medicine to stop the problem. It is now 8 years since!</p>
              <p>You have to believe in yourself, have confidence. If you can get out of this, whether it is from your parents or friends, you can get out of this from your bosses, your friends, for there is no safehouse in life that you will also have love and no fear).</p>
              <p>One more thing, my friend got a religion, that helped.</p>
              <p>Good luck and have a nice day.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">First of all, Depression and Anxiety
              disorder are closely related and they are not mental disorder.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I believe IMH also hav psychiatrists
              but do we need to go IMH just for Depression or Anxiety Disorder? We
              dont need doctors who treat mad ppls in IMH cause we are not.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In order for a depressed or anxiety
              person to get better, first and foremost, the environment is the most
              important factor, the place where u spent most of your time. If its a
              hectic place you probally will get worst instead of better.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Second, Friends and Familes, they can
              be helpfully or may not at all. If u wanna talk about your stuffs
              with friends, are they able to listen and dont treat you as thou you
              are having some sort of mental illness? So choose wisely whom you
              confid with.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Lastly, it take times to heal, long
              periods from my own experience.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We are more sensitive than most common
              ppl, any slight action, expression, we already can feel and  tell in
              our heart. So most of the time is more of a dissapointment instead of
              some concern we get and in the end we stop trusting ppl to talk to.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">That is why we need seek someone who we
              can trust and slowly talk to.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">For me a third party whom I dont knw at
              all, is more suitable. After gaining my trust with this person
              (counsellor, psychiatris) then slowly I start to confid with her/him.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">There will be episode reorcurring while
              you are confiding to them. I rem my session with my trusted 
              psychiatris, after a few minutes of talking, I already into severe
              hyperventilation and the session had to end.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I told the psychiatrist STOP, enough
              for me and ran out of the room to some corner and start chain
              smoking, He then came after me and gave me medicine to calm down and
              make another date to see him again. It a long tedious precess.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Medicines only can assit us but cannot
              cure us. If you think just by seeing a doctor and get those pills for
              your depression or anxiety disorder is going to cure you, you are so
              wrong.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Those medicine only can help condition
              your body so u can deal with your problems slowly and overcome it.</p>

              <p>Her family keeps insisting she was acting up to get attention whenever her depression got really  bad.</p>

              <p>I think you are sorely misguided.</p>
              <p>Beating , scare tactics and coercion only creates resentments, not respect.</p>
              <p>children are not stupid, they will realise the BS their parents heaped on them, and lose respect and admiration for their parents by the time they become pre-teens.</p>
              <p>There are better ways to earn respect from children. Motivation, inspiration and setting a good role model helps.</p>
              <p>Fillial piety is not a one way street. It's a <strong>cycle</strong> where parents care for their children, provide guidance when they are young, when children grows up they care for and guide their parents during old age.</p>

              <p><br>I suggest you go look up internet for Bible Study Fellowship (BSF). Attend it ! It is a great mind opener, it really matures a person and help the person to see the truth in life. But it requires a lot of discipline, you have to attend it every Monday and do a lot of homework. This homework trains your mind, makes you more perseverant and mature to handle problems in life.</p>
