              <p>Well guys+gals let me be straight forward to the point.. i am planning to move to S'pore by year end to settle down there and get a job. i have choosed S'pore because i don't think i can find any other better place than Singapura after my researches</p>
              <p>Thinking somehow of leaving my current job here in Dubai and move to Singapore for a job hunt. well getting paid about 2200SGD could be a huge risk tho hein!</p>
              <p>The main question now is will it be easy to find a job ? Can foreigner find jobs in there and go through the normal procedure smoothly? (like working permit and the normal stuff when u work abroad lor)</p>
              <p>I got indonesian friends we used to study together in malaysia(Sunway) and are now working in S'pore, one of them he tried to work in M'sia but his working permit got reject (as they do to everyone recently my bestfriend from indo his got rejected too) but he is now working in S'pore .. pretty fair and  organized S'pore huh!</p>
              <p>The second question this before this job hunt i'll have to save good money incha allah so with that i can survive hopefully, if anyone can tell how much a person can spend in a month on an average spend?</p>
              <p>I have been in S'pore on Xmas 2004 and the tsunami's eve too! what a coincidence rite lool ... surely things got changed now, i am planning a trip to S'pore soon this August well if the plan goes well hor</p>
              <p>So guys  Your advice, help and point of view will be very helpful and will appreciate it, will wait till then</p>
              <p>cheers ^^</p>

              <p>Well, if like what you say, dubai is "leading" the economic world, why oh why do you have to try to come here and find a job? If they are so prosperous and successful why then must you come all the way here to find a job? Also, why must you specifically speculate that he must be chinese? Are YOU not generalising as well?</p>

              <p>thanks a lot Yunhaier, guys sometimes we need seriousness</p>
              <p>now let me reply u jojobeach, i'll provide u with the most accurate answer and things i really seen in Dubai so u can be prepared n expect them let go:</p>
              <p>How is life there ?  <span style="color: #333399;">life in here is about the same in S'pore Food-wise: seeing the currency as i remember being in s'pore u spend like 6 to 8 $ on meal so in here its the same thats like 13 to 15 $ (currency rate abt 1AED=2.23SGD) thas a normal meal, but if u go to cheap place like in s'pore got hokka n this stuff mah so here got those indian place but not too clean lor so u will have to spend at leat $6 for ur meal.. <br>Work-wise: u won't appreciate becoz u'll be out at 7 smthg be in jam then work till 6pm(mostly n sometime 7pm) hribble jam be home at 7.30 earliest or 8.30 someitmes 9pm it happen trust me u got to makan quick/checkmail/post forum(like i do) cathc the sleep at its earliest n the next day the same</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">Money-wise: they can really pay that at the position of ceo director manager n of course local... blindly.. but s'pore pays too so not a big prob beco think like this way u get 6k or 7k in dubai thats arnd 2.8k or 3.4k in s'pore no difference meh if in s'pore u get 4k to 5k there u get 8.5k to 11k same same lah</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">mind-wise: u cant relax ur mind with the routine of office traficjam sleep 5/7 or 6/7 chillin got but cant make many friends here too coz whoel week u damn bs wod ur"routine" now tell me whois ur friend ur "bed&amp;sleep" my friend</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333399;">am not discouragin but am telling u the truth Bros+Sis so u can have an idea and be more realistic than a dreamer!</span></p>
              <p>I heard, job opportunities are aplenty. Is this true ? <span style="color: #333399;">thats ya got a lot liek S'pore mah</span></p>
              <p>What is the cost of living like in Dubai ? <span style="color: #333399;">House is damn crazy nothg less than 1.8kSGD for just a room or small studio.. so thats hell no privacy must share n u know the rest mind peace =0</span>Will it be ok for me to take on a local term job ? <span style="color: #333399;">can take a job anyone not a prob working permit too easy i got mine in 3 hours done. also my country got good relation wid dubai ...that palya role dun worry s'pore very well respeted ^^ hurray</span></p>
              <p>According to my friends.. they say Dubai is one of the fastest growing economy in that region.. and living standards are pretty good. <span style="color: #333399;">thats a lie</span></p>
              <p>What do you think ? Will it be a good move ? <span style="color: #333399;">well if u think u can get ride of this obstacle i have no idea n will serve u n anyone here to move n provide help ! guys gf its hard to get ar .. n girls bf are to get ar. after my diagnosis i can say that those who r married or engaged or in a damn serious relatuonship can be a bit ok lah.. but saving the money dunt expect much am struggling aldi</span></p>

              <p>jamesbondbmw,</p>
              <p>Thanks dude.</p>
              <p>But looking at your post.. that 7am- 8pm life ain't that different from Singapore. And morning rush hours in any form of transport ain't that pretty in SG either. Unless you take a helicopter to work. or you rent a place within walking distance from work.</p>
              <p>That said.. if I rent an apartment near work.. I won;t have to deal with rush hour right ?</p>
              <p>Is it possible to do that ? Like find a nice place and work nearby ?</p>
              <p>Which place in Dubai is best to look for jobs and place to live ?</p>
              <p>I prefer to cook myself , will this help save money ? Is the cost of groceries high ?</p>
              <p>So you're saying a small apartment in Dubai about 500 sq feet.. will cost $1.8k per month ? Does it includes a small kitchenette or just the room ????? Confused.</p>
              <p>If I choose to purchase a small property .. is there any restrictions to foreigners ?</p>
              <p>And getting hitch is difficult ?.. hmmm... must consider .. very seriously..heheheh..</p>
              <p>And most important .. how much is a jug of ice cold beer there ?????</p>
