              <p><br>Arabic is their official language, although English alone should help you get by. When I was there (only for a short while though), language wasn't much of a problem because it's probably one of the most cosmopolitan places in the Middle East - then again, I'm working for an IB where the lingua franca is English anyway. I suppose you'll get by fine in your working environment if you are hired by a MNC.</p>
              <p>In some ways, it's a little like Hong Kong - or Japan (actually, Japan is worse than Dubai if you're concerned about the language issue from my experience) - where English is the official language with Cantonese being their lingua franca. While not being able to speak Cantonese isn't going to hinder your work in HK, it certainly isn't going to enable you to fully assimilate into their culture.</p>
              <p>That said, the younger generation in UAE is pretty savvy and well-versed with English, so the language issue really depends pretty much on what you get up to and the kind of people you'll be associating with in the process.</p>
              <p>Hope that helps.</p>

              <p>well well i had to cut off my sleep let me see.. first for my english guys am someone who speaks 6 languages so sometimes my cpu can runs slow but i master everygh  tho i have learned my englshi is 2004 but u c am pretty ocnfident in it.. mthe singlish or the lor lah and some lmalay qord i use it for fun only here n when i see its necessareay because i was in malaysia for 4 years almost.. as i said i will always be very confortable to speak french becase i learned it since am 3 years old its my bckgrnd educ.</p>
              <p>hey jojobeach lemme tell u than renting a place near ur work tha will depends becasue if i rent a place neat my current office its like nothg less thant 2.2k jsut a room, iknow this m'sian guy staying with his wife, sahring an apart with a s'porean couple well the m'sian pays 2.2k for the middle room whereby the whole house a 3 bedroom cost about 5.5k to 6k so they keeping one room for guest. think now!</p>
              <p>jojobeach<br>if ur place near the office of course u'll avoid the rush but not that easy to get one...</p>
              <p>"Which place in Dubai is best to look for jobs and place to live ?" i think u mean where in the UAE is best to work well dubai is good u've got abu dhabi too(the capital) but most companies are in Dubai so chances are higher there.</p>
              <p>of course u can cook thats a wise choice to save.. but groceries are abit expensive tho.. u'll still save money instead of eating outside.. a 1L milk cost abt 6AED almost=2.2SGD</p>
              <p>Dude its not an apartm that just a room shared in an appartm. dun confuse which means u'll share kitchen n bathroom. so with 1.8 thats just a small room n no garantie for the room cleanliness..let me tell u the price ins AED u do the conversion that way i'll be more accurate.. at least 5k(AED ya) that a studio with small kithcenet n bathroom excluding Water elec internet n other expense..btu u must be very luck ti get one because everyone is renting that type of studio. also the rental is to be paid yearly or quarterly some how nothing less than 170,000 a year then got to see if its furnished or not and so on...</p>
              <p>purchasin u can not a problem now tho before its was not possbiel but please do'nt tink about it its is hell a lot of money jsut soo much for a tiny place. nothing less than 500,000 for a 1 bedroom and a hall THATS IT ! u see now..</p>
              <p>I cant understand this guys can u help to explain "And getting hitch is difficult ? "</p>
              <p>well the cold beer is hard to say as i dun drink but that would be arnd 25-30SGD maybe little less or more..  done jojobeach</p>

              <p>Hi TS,</p>
              <p>TS is Topic/Threat Starter, ie you.</p>
              <p>Let me try to break down some of the cost for you as that is what you are trying to find out.</p>
              <p>For Public Transport (only buses and MRT, Taxis not included), be prepared to spent more about SGD$100-120/mth or more just from home to work and vice versa.</p>
              <p>For Food, about SGD$20/day or more and only at the cheaper places like Hawker Centres and Coffee Shops.</p>
              <p>Cost of living are going up nowadays, so be prepared.</p>
              <p>For Rental, I'm not really sure, so can't help you on this.</p>
              <p>The cost above are the bare minimum for a single, without accounting for entertainment, or wanting of a more comfortable lifestyle, better food, etc.</p>
              <p>Anything else?</p>
              <p>Lastly, no worries about your command of English, looks OK to me.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Most of the hundreds of thousands foreigners, that are working in Singapore, secured the job first before comming over. I hope that does not ruin you sleep.</p>

              <p>Well guys+gals let me be straight forward to the point.. i am
              planning to move to S'pore by year end to settle down there and get
              a job. i have choosed S'pore because i don't think i can find
              any other better place than Singapura after my
              researches</p>
              <p>Thinking somehow of leaving my current job here in Dubai and
              move to Singapore for a job hunt. well getting paid about 2200SGD
              could be a huge risk tho hein!</p>
              <p>The main question now is will it be easy to find a job ?
              Can foreigner find jobs in there and go through the normal
              procedure smoothly? (like working permit and the normal stuff when
              u work abroad lor)</p>
              <p>I got indonesian friends we used to study together in
              malaysia(Sunway) and are now working in S'pore, one of them he
              tried to work in M'sia but his working permit got reject (as they
              do to everyone recently my bestfriend from indo his got rejected
              too) but he is now working in S'pore .. pretty fair and 
              organized S'pore huh!</p>
              <p>The second question this before this job hunt i'll have
              to save good money incha allah so with that i can survive
              hopefully, if anyone can tell how much a person can spend in a
              month on an average spend?</p>
              <p>I have been in S'pore on Xmas 2004 and the tsunami's eve
              too! what a coincidence rite lool ... surely things got changed
              now, i am planning a trip to S'pore soon this August well if the
              plan goes well hor</p>
              <p>So guys  Your advice, help and point of view will be
              very helpful and will appreciate it, will wait till then</p>
              <p>cheers ^^</p>
