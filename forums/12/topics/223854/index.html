And why do you feel you'd rather go out with your colleague instead? Are you getting tired of your boyfriend? You don't want him to get the wrong idea for the sake of being loyal or because you love your boyfriend? Are you afraid of losing him as a friend or losing the chance to confide in him?<br><br>I apologise for being too direct.<br><br>doko</div>
