What they need is a caring and faithful guy.<br><br>To them money is not that critical. If u able to prove to them u r the one,even living in hardship with that guy is a blissful. I meet many of this kind of lady,finacially stable with good career but no love. They don't exepct much in money wise. If u able to make them happy enough,I think they will not even mind buying a car for u. What they really need is love stabilities cos their job r quite stressful. They just need a reliable man's shoulder to lean on when they r stressful,someone able to listen to their sorrow. Someone able to make them happy and feel really love.

Maybe this kind of career woman which you mentioned are looking for love to fill up the empty part of their life. But once they found the so called reliable guy to them (even not financially stable).. after a while, this kind of woman will have the mindset "ai seh, envy my galfriend / staff / colleague, her bf / husband is financially stable.. what she earning now is actually just extra for her extra own pocket money.. no need to worry much things such as the guy does not earn enough money and every time come and hint or take money from gf / wife. As time goes, she will start to detest him. As the saying goes, people are never satisfy with their own current achievements  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> .<br><br>first few dates with man arh, they always like to haolian by "showing off" how powerful they're in office, wahh more than 20 staffs under him, how they fear him lah blah blah blah, showing how rich he is, by flashing wallet full with cash with more than 2 credit cards and fighting with you to foot the lunch or dinner bill in a nice cosy restaurant. When they finally get your hands arh, they'll gek gek wallet got stuck in trousers' pockets when the waiter come with bills <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">. Then wait for you to foot bill.<br><br>Career / financially stable woman is still single despite in late 20s or 30s? Tell you lor, it's not because no eligible bachelors are chasing after them, it's because they're simply too picky when it comes to choosing bf to start a steady relationship. I've met both the women which you mentioned and the top which I mentioned.<br><br>you mentioned the financially stable women have plenty of money. That's because they're still single mah! They've nothing really to spent and worry for. Etc No kids' education / food / toiletries etc expenditures to worry about at the moment. They earn and spent money for their own apart from giving some money to parents. When they're married things will turn out to be on the contrary. Especially when she marries some guy who she deemed is reliable but sadly not financially stable. How many years can she work? Beyond 70? She need to save huge amount of money for her children's present and future educations also de leh. No matter how rich she is, her savings will be used out one day. And what if she suddenly lose her job? Somemore her husband has already been drifted from the working society, lose experiences etc. She will suffer a depression with all the responsibilites to earn money for family and more than 3 mouths is waiting for her paycheck every month. Tell you lor, job not easy to find nowadays, especially a good job (who will want to resign from a good job? Unless for some rare reasons like migrating, pursuing a higher paper qualification etc). A junior job post vacancy was once posted.. within the next working day, more than 30 applications came. Some of the job applicants were in fact way too over qualified for the junior post (either in paper quali, experience, salary, or all).<br><br>I can tell you lor, no women will like their husband to stay at home while the wife goes out to work. The man will not feel good too because of ego and self-esteem. If the man survive on wife's paycheck, he will have no say in most things, and wife will be talking "louder' to husband most of the time, thus men are not stupid either <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> .<br><br>Unless from the beginning the husband and wife already made a pact that husband will stay home to look after kids and do house chores, wife go out work when.. lets say if their child is born.. paranoid about a stranger looking after their baby, or elder parents don't wish to look after their grandchildren.  And the woman earn much more than the husband. And the wife happily accept this kind of woman outside man inside environment, and the man don't have any problem dealing with gossips etc from neighbours, acquantainces, friends or relatives etc, won't suffer from depression and wild imaginatons. So no talk lor  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> .<br><br>Same for most women.. most will want to go out and work and contribute money to the family also. In this way, they need not be afraid of their husband because they do not reply on their husband for money. If want to talk can also talk "loudly".<br></div>
