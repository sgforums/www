            <div class='col-md body'>i think the most important thing is that the guy must be willing to improve himself. Inside him there is a burning desire to do well in life. Let's say, he sweeps the floor and his gf is a CEO.<br><br>Obviously, he has to do spend other parts of his life to improve his career as well. It's not fair to just look at what he works to earn a living. If the woman is understanding and loving, she will have known what the guy does besides sweeping the floor. Maybe at night, he reads books a lot on setting up a small cleaning business. He's not just going to be a sweeper for the rest of his life. Maybe there's a chance for promotion.</div>
