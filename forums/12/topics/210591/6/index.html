Maybe this kind of career woman which you mentioned are looking for love to fill up the empty part of their life. But once they found the so called reliable guy to them (even not financially stable).. after a while, this kind of woman will have the mindset "ai seh, envy my galfriend / staff / colleague, her bf / husband is financially stable.. what she earning now is actually just extra for her extra own pocket money.. no need to worry much things such as the guy does not earn enough money and every time come and hint or take money from gf / wife. As time goes, she will start to detest him. As the saying goes, people are never satisfy with their own current achievements  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> .<br><br>first few dates with man arh, they always like to haolian by "showing off" how powerful they're in office, wahh more than 20 staffs under him, how they fear him lah blah blah blah, showing how rich he is, by flashing wallet full with cash with more than 2 credit cards and fighting with you to foot the lunch or dinner bill in a nice cosy restaurant. When they finally get your hands arh, they'll gek gek wallet got stuck in trousers' pockets when the waiter come with bills <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">. Then wait for you to foot bill.<br><br>Career / financially stable woman is still single despite in late 20s or 30s? Tell you lor, it's not because no eligible bachelors are chasing after them, it's because they're simply too picky when it comes to choosing bf to start a steady relationship. I've met both the women which you mentioned and the top which I mentioned.<br><br>you mentioned the financially stable women have plenty of money. That's because they're still single mah! They've nothing really to spent and worry for. Etc No kids' education / food / toiletries etc expenditures to worry about at the moment. They earn and spent money for their own apart from giving some money to parents. When they're married things will turn out to be on the contrary. Especially when she marries some guy who she deemed is reliable but sadly not financially stable. How many years can she work? Beyond 70? She need to save huge amount of money for her children's present and future educations also de leh. No matter how rich she is, her savings will be used out one day. And what if she suddenly lose her job? Somemore her husband has already been drifted from the working society, lose experiences etc. She will suffer a depression with all the responsibilites to earn money for family and more than 3 mouths is waiting for her paycheck every month. Tell you lor, job not easy to find nowadays, especially a good job (who will want to resign from a good job? Unless for some rare reasons like migrating, pursuing a higher paper qualification etc). A junior job post vacancy was once posted.. within the next working day, more than 30 applications came. Some of the job applicants were in fact way too over qualified for the junior post (either in paper quali, experience, salary, or all).<br><br>I can tell you lor, no women will like their husband to stay at home while the wife goes out to work. The man will not feel good too because of ego and self-esteem. If the man survive on wife's paycheck, he will have no say in most things, and wife will be talking "louder' to husband most of the time, thus men are not stupid either <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> .<br><br>Unless from the beginning the husband and wife already made a pact that husband will stay home to look after kids and do house chores, wife go out work when.. lets say if their child is born.. paranoid about a stranger looking after their baby, or elder parents don't wish to look after their grandchildren.  And the woman earn much more than the husband. And the wife happily accept this kind of woman outside man inside environment, and the man don't have any problem dealing with gossips etc from neighbours, acquantainces, friends or relatives etc, won't suffer from depression and wild imaginatons. So no talk lor  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> .<br><br>Same for most women.. most will want to go out and work and contribute money to the family also. In this way, they need not be afraid of their husband because they do not reply on their husband for money. If want to talk can also talk "loudly".<br></div></blockquote>Sorry,i think yr so called the type of women u met is different from what I met! From what u have been talking all along.

Basically what I'm mentioning are men and women are equal. Both work outside and bring back monthly paychecks to the household. The woman will then keep the remainings of her salary into her savings if her husband can afford to survive the family.<br><br>I don't need a sugar daddy. I'm married already.

You only meet one or two your so called career woman and you assume all career women are the same as what you so called have met. You have not see the outside world enough. Maybe your social circle is only limited to your colleagues or few acquantainces or friends. You don't have to bother to think of a reply to argue back to back yourself and your face. Because I'll never waste my time talking to someone like you again after trying out of good will to let you know what's really happening. It's a pity I've listed out so many true examples that came from friends, ex colleagues, colleagues, relatives and etc. Yet you simply don't understand at all, and only believing your own so called point of views and so called perspectives.</div>

I trying to give hope and facts of some type of women I met to prove to many disheartened guys here who has a very negeative view on our sg gal that there is still true love besides only bread and butter. If what u mean is true,then those individual who don earn $3000 and above or combine income of at least $5000 couple,no need to marry liao? U are saying marriage has now become a event reserve for the elite and rich?<br><br>Not everybody has a materialistic view on marriage? Marriage is abt compromise,sacriface,trust and depth of yr love! If yr husband met an accident and become cripple which forces u to work until no ending age to support the family. Are u going tot tell me  r going to divorce him and tell him ' Don't blame me! I not being cruel to u!'   Hey! To me this is bullish! This is not abt marriage,this is abt seeking a kind of selfish lifestye u want to sustain!<br><br>If the couple don earn much,don't overspend it. Eating at hawaker centre can be blissful too! Living in a 3 room HDB is warming too. As long as the couple has mutual understanding and know what they want. Simple can be happy too!<br><br>Cos the type of love u seek and I seek is totally different! Different people have different view on matters. I have come across materialistic gal who demand their future husband must have a management post like yr husband,must drive a 1.6L car and a minimal income of $5000 per month. There is plenty of these type of gal. I avoid them.Avoid u these type of gal. I don have such criteria.<br><br>But I have one thing,unconditional love for my future partner! Therefore I seek for a parnter who has same view with me on future.. You may not have grand feast with me everyday but i will not let u suffer hunger if u are not pricky. I hold a stable job,it may not be very prospective but it will provide the essential income for us to have a simple love and life...<br><br>At the end of the day,there is still many down to earth sg gal who don seek the 5C but  seek true love and simple life under one conditonal that u must be faithful ,love her truely and responsible. I met some of these type of sg gal and I wanted to inform the sg guy out there. THERE IS STILL THESE TYPE OF SG GAL AVAILABLE! They may not have the figure and look of a superstar but they have a heart of gold and a really decent gal. All u have to do is to have some patient,don be pricky and u will unearth many of these type of sg gal hidden in some corner. (I can tell u they r usually very shy and not that ougoing) SG GUY,don be dispair! There is still hope....</div>

Actually i agree with both ur points. Both quite valid. Hey gals take it easy. We cannot force opinions on others, and everyone is entitled to their own set of views. Its getting personal oredi. Take it as ppl have different perspectives on life cos everyone went through life differently. We are what we are today because of the mould that we are made from. And sometimes how we wish we can choose what we want our life to be.<br><br>e.g. People in India have different castes. If im of lower of caste, I will feel discriminated how the upper caste people treat me, and how they are privileged just because of the family that they are born in. Live and let live. Sigh....<br><br>Some people choose love, some choose bread. What would you choose? Until today, i am still pondering. If i can, having both is a bonus. But love conquers all, remember that. Love can bring shine and smile to your faces even the day when you have to share your last piece of bread, with ur loved one. Seeing my beloved smile wams my heart more than anything else.<br><br>Quote: "The reality is hardly ever as pleasant as the imaginary". Socrates</div>

And don't you already know that when you smile at someone in the street you don't know, your chances of getting a smile in return is something like 2 out of 10!<br><br>It's CULTURE. Or rather, the lack of it.<br><br>Simply we are largely a mixed bag of peoples and are of different faiths. To go further, let me point out that when I smile at a Malay or Indian stranger on the street, I'd very often and almost always, get a return smile. But it is not likewise if I smiled at a Chinese stranger.. I often get a blank stare in return.<br><br>We don't have it in our culture (or the lack of it), to be forthcoming with basic courtesy of a smile or a nod. Unless of course between HDB dwellers towards neighbors, but also, there are neighbors who are very much by themselves - they will never say "goodmorning", nod at you or even smile. Simply because they don't know you - not that you have done them wrong or as if you owe them money.<br><br>So often and as a daily life, people will rather stare at the floor in an elevator, or in the bus (some stare out the windows), and in trains they stare at the floor, the grab-poles, out the windows, and most commonly these days at their PDA phones and or mobile phones busy communicating to someone they don't actually bother communicating with any other time in any other places except in the train. But some are indeed busy convincing someone about being late because of a stalled train and not because of waking up late...<br><br>While sometimes, among the young, staring can lead to hospitalization or worse - the morgue. It is rude to stare at someone you don't know, but if you smile, he/she may smile back or in the case of an Asian Chinese, if it's a male and you're a male too, he might smile back in a rather sexy way, and you might stop smiling for obvious reasons, and if it is a girl and you're a guy, she might turn away in contempt thinking you are being fresh with her - but COURTESY never crossed peoples minds here. It's either you know the person, or you don't - and that you don't smile back because they both don't know each other. But we all know, we SHOULD NEVER stare at an Ah Beng.. again, for obvious reasons.<br><br>I say it again; It's culture - or the lack of it.<br></div></blockquote>different ladies have different methods.<br>to sum up the methods<br>here it is<br><br>sincerity<br>caring towards wife<br>trust-worthy<br>fillal<br>merticulous<br>family orientated<br>remembers small little details like what the gal wears on 1st date, likes; dislikes etc<br>patient<br>established career<br>cocky (arrogant) guys<br>humourous<br>thick skin<br>have same hobbies; interests as them<br>chemisty<br>bonding<br><br>i think these sums up most already.<br><br>hope it helps<br></div>
