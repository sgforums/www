For other reasons.<br>On the contrary, a girl who's interested in a guy have the tendency not to do things that seek attention from the guy she's eyeing. (i.e she may talk and joke with a bunch or common friends except him.)<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Do i stand a chance at all????<br><br>Ans: Easy Qns.......Yes, everyone who is not been rejected stand chances.<br>Even if there was rejection, You may have tried once or many times. It doesn't really matter.<br>What matters is HOW you tried and approach. And take careful notice on her respond to you.<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=107789" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=107789</a><br><br>Cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, I think that even if she doesn't like you, she'll reply, because anyway the both of you are already friends, unless she's the type who's really sensitive to this kind of stuff. And even if she doesn't, you can just stay as friends, and try to get to know her better or something. Who knows, she might just fall in love with you or whatever. Haaa.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some girls will ignore SMS from guys they don't like, some may still reply but give  brief answers &amp; excuses to end conversations quickly.<br><br>The fact that she knows u like her (V day present),  talking to u everyday &amp; agreeing to go out means she likes u.</div>
