            <div class='col-md body'>Can't find previous post where we talking about the similar topic. So, I created a new thread.<br><br>Just saw this news which might be relevant to this:<br><br>http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/123161/1/.html<br><br>Frankly, I just never see anyone who went for someone attached/married has a good ending. Either the third party killed, or the one at the middle killed, or suicided. Is that what they call happiness? Just one word to conclude them, they are Â“STUPIDÂ”.<br><br>So, for those who thought is Â“OKÂ” to go for someone attached/married, you should think twice.<br></div>
