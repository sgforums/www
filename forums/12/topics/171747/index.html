But the guys still continue to do what they do and it is still going on. Wat make me think that the girl is the wrong is that she accpets whatever the two does. Like giving them hope like that. Like accepting their gifts and just evertime let them pay for her stuffs without even rejecting them.She talks with them on the phone for long long hours. B4 the two who is trying for the girl is also very good frens. But because of her they have not been talking to each other.Many ppl don't like the attitude of this girl but they just keep mum about it.in the two guys one is my very close frens and everytime i tell not to waste his time on her he just won't listen he everytime say he feel he got a chance.I think he alr spent a fortune on the girl liao.But i feel the girl just playing with his feeling.What do u think guys is he or she in the wrong</div>
