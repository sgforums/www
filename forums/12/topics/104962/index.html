Pre-cum does contain sperms. But very little, compared to when you have an orgasm.<br><br>2) Whoa. Good question. But yes. I've heard of people who did heavy petting, and the girl still got pregnant.<br><br>3) =_="" If It can't, then how people get pregnant?<br><br>4) Sperms generally die a while after exposure to air, if you wiped it dry, chances are they're already dead.<br><br>So meanwhile, if you're really scared... You won't do anything like that again. Follow-up advice. Get your gf a pregnancy kit, and test for it a month later.</div>
