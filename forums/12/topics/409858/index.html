              <p>I think there are 2 aspects that is hard to see or recognizes...</p>
              <p>Your actual career comes much later in Life.</p>
              <p>My ex boss use to be XXX VP for Sun XXXsystem and had also worked in other Fortune 500 companies....but guess what he quit in his late 40 and became a High School Teacher and still is.</p>
              <p>Known a global sales person in Maersk quit her job in the US and when to China and became a English Teacher.....in private school in her late 30.</p>
              <p>Our notion of success isn't about getting a good pay job so that we can owned something......But rather finding what we love to do or at least find meaning in doing and get paid for.</p>
              <p>In Singapore we adopt alot of false believe. all we do is accumulate and slave for the rest of the life by the material we accumulate.</p>

              <p>thanks, i will check out Martha Beck's book. this is the second time the title has been suggested to me</p>
              <p>true lasting passion (work) is finding a fit to our natural strengths and talents.  unless and until one is reconciled to it, one will always feel dissatisfied and empty running around chasing shadows.  i am feeling so bad that i feel i rather die.  that's how empty i feel</p>

              <p>What's that one true passion that you said you found previously, before the mishap? It could be the thing that you're looking for. The mishap could just be a lesson for you, before you can hold on to your passion. Life is not a bed of roses. We need to have determination and courage before we can be happy. Most people choose the path of least resistance and end up being stuck in jobs that they hate.</p>

              <p>As you did not say exactly what that experience was, I shall not presume. But just want to say that things happen in life for a reason, as there are no coincidences. If you can understand the meaning and purpose of events and people in your life journey, you'll be able to make better choices that can give you a happier and more fulfulling life.</p>
              <p>Life is really about learning life lessons, and growing as a person. For most people, there will always be more than 1 option available to choose from, at any point in your life journey. The easiest option at the point of choosing, may be the option that could eventually cause you more pain and regrets, in future.</p>
              <p>Listen to your heart, and not anyone else. No one else in this world will know you better than yourself, assuming you can keep your mind clear from external influences. At the end of the day, your life is your own responsibility. External parties can give all sorts of fanciful advice, but eventually, you're the one who will either be happy or miserable, depending on your choices.</p>
