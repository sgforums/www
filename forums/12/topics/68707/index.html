            <div class='col-md body'>DumbDumb:  If ev. one's moral was upright, I'd say it's easy to trust each other.<br><br>RP sez:  Actually, it oso does depend on how secure 1 is in the r'ship.  If a person has been cheated on before, there cld be a certain degree of paranoia : )  It's understandable.  But it doesn't mean u hafta test the person u're wif now, it isn't fair to him/her, cosh u're judging him/her to be an a**hole/biotch juz like ur ex.<br><br>DumbDumb:  But reality is this...  Everyone of us is screwed up some way or another.  That's why there r breakups.<br><br>RP sez:  True, we're all Not perfect.  But I'd sez it's more abt wat an indiv. can accept, &amp; to wat degree the fault is.  Breakups occur when the indivs can't accept the faults in their partners (which doesn't mean they're wrong, it's juz how life is).<br><br>DumbDumb:  Testing isn't plain stupidity, it's putting to action the phrase "trust is earned &amp; built upon, Not given".<br><br>RP sez:  True, trust is earned.  But u dun hafta be tested to earn it.<br><br>DumbDumb:  Before u protest against the girl's insecurity, think abt it, wtf have u done to deserve her blind faith in u.<br><br>RP sez:  Trust is built over time, blind faith may be a tad naive.  But testing someone wld show doubt in tt person's trustworthiness &amp; integrity.  Doesn't tt person haf the right to feel hurt?  U dun hafta test a person's trustworthiness in order to noe tt the person is trustworthy.  Thru ups &amp; downs, life's experiences, thgs u share together, u'll noe if tt person's reliable or Not.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dumbdumb!:</div><div class="quote_body">reality check.<br><br>if everyone's moral was upright, i'd say its easy to trust each other.<br><br>but reality is this.. everyone of us are screwed up someway or another. tts why there are break ups.<br><br>testing isn't plain stupidity. its putting to action the phrase "trust is earned, and built upon, not given"<br><br>before u protest against the girl's insecurity.. think abt it.. wtf have you done to deserve her blind faith in you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote></div>
