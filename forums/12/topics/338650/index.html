              <p>Thing is.. now I'm 20 liao.. now taking driving lessons cos she forced me to.. i didnt want, cos i earn low pay (working aft grad from poly), no money to pay for car, road tax, COE, petrol etc etc.. den she said she will sponsor. so after so much bugging from her, i agreed, just to get her off my back. plus, she said SHE WILL SPONSOR. lying bugger. after she paid for my basic theory test (btt) fee, she said, 'since u working liao, u pay the rest'. wah say. she always promise things den retract the promise lei. fair anot? i'm now paying 80+ bucks PER LESSON for something i dont like. and i dont even have a car. so how? after get license, nv practice, den have license for what?</p>
              <p>den when i was still in poly, she said, 'when u start working liao, i dun care how long u use internet, what time u wake up (on weekdays and weekends)'. den, now lei, i'm working le. den internet she still restrict sia. 11 pm want me off liao. den i come back from work only at 7. dinner and bathtime not included. and i wanna have time to check emails, chat with friends (msn) etc, cos my workdays usually suck. my office really sucks, and its not just me feeling this way. but forgetting about problems at work, home life really sucks. and this bites, cos home is usually the place i go to to relax. but now, i avoid home unless necessary. and its eating into my pocket. all the money on dinner, transport etc.. and not to mention, driving lessons.</p>
              <p>how arh? that bugger doesnt listen to what i say, what i TRY to explain, den all my relatives side her, i'm always the bad guy. everything i say, they shoot me down. all the stuff about me being 'unfilial', 'rebellious', 'good-for-nothing', 'anti-social'. i mean, yea i may be some of that stuff some of the time, but only when im angry! and they make my angry side come out all the time. with friends i'm not as mean as with my relatives.</p>
              <p>bth liao lei. i feel so let down by my own relatives.</p>
              <p>i'm 20 liao.. den i still feel like 10 YO.. this morning i was slapped awake by her.. (slapped lor.. normally she just start yelling at me.. and either way i get a big fright..cos EARLY in the morning lei. ppl's brains still not awake yet den go and shock them lydat..) just cos i 'overslept' by 10min.. but actually i was already half-awake..just didnt feel like going to work..so lazed in bed for abit more.</p>

              <p>20 still young la. haha. if u wanna be treated like adult... better behave responsibly like adult. u have to explain to her properly in a calm and mature way, that u feel stressed at work and tt's why u like to relax by just surfing net and chatting wif ur friends online. </p>
              <p>what u mean by "angry side"? if u get angry with her, it will jus make her more upset wif u. u must touch her heart instead.. and make her realise tt u have really grown up and is not her little boy anymore.</p>
              <p>sometimes mothers find it hard to change their attitude towards their kids. but if u keep showing to her tt u can be a responsible and mature person, one day, very soon, she will realise tt u have grown up.</p>
              <p>i find ur relatives quite kay poh. who are they to criticise u? does ur mum know abt this? if i were you, i would discuss this wif her calmly.</p>
              <p>tell her tt u dun like it when relatives call u names... especially since u are her son... tell her it makes you feel sad tt she dun support u when ur relatives make these unjustified remarks at you.</p>
              <p>u can tell her... u are still young, and ur career is just starting, so they shldn't call u "good for nothing". u may be hot tempered, but it doesn't mean u are "unfilial". sometimes u're tired and dun wanna socialise, but it doesn't mean u are "anti social".</p>
              <p>explain to her tt the remarks are quite hurtful. how would they like it if u called their children "good for nothing"?</p>
              <p>i believe if u explain to her the reasons for ur behaviour, the next time ur relatives criticise u again, she will support u and shut them up.</p>

              <p>20 still young la. haha. if u wanna be treated like adult...
                  better behave responsibly like adult. u have to explain to her
                  properly in a calm and mature way, that u feel stressed at work and
                  tt's why u like to relax by just surfing net and chatting wif ur
                  friends online. </p>
              <p>what u mean by "angry side"? if u get angry with her, it will
                  jus make her more upset wif u. u must touch her heart instead.. and
                  make her realise tt u have really grown up and is not her little
                  boy anymore.</p>
              <p>sometimes mothers find it hard to change their attitude towards
                  their kids. but if u keep showing to her tt u can be a responsible
                  and mature person, one day, very soon, she will realise tt u have
                  grown up.</p>
              <p>i find ur relatives quite kay poh. who are they to criticise
                  u? does ur mum know abt this? if i were you, i would discuss
                  this wif her calmly.</p>
              <p>tell her tt u dun like it when relatives call u names...
                  especially since u are her son... tell her it makes you feel sad tt
                  she dun support u when ur relatives make these unjustified remarks
                  at you.</p>
              <p>u can tell her... u are still young, and ur career is just
                  starting, so they shldn't call u "good for nothing". u may
                  be hot tempered, but it doesn't mean u are "unfilial".
                  sometimes u're tired and dun wanna socialise, but it doesn't mean u
                  are "anti social".</p>
              <p>explain to her tt the remarks are quite hurtful. how would they
                  like it if u called their children "good for nothing"?</p>
              <p>i believe if u explain to her the reasons for ur behaviour, the
                  next time ur relatives criticise u again, she will support u
                  and shut them up.</p>

              <p>i got tell her before.. den she said, okay, u can use. but do housework first. so i do. then, left like 30 min before 11pm. so i say, let me use until 12+. my friends want to talk to me online. and i got email to check. she say no. T_T everyday this cycle. so i bth liao, den i either do housework fast fast, or i come back later (like 9pm) cos i go out with the friends that i cant chat with online.</p>
              <p>yah.. "angry side" means angry lor.. when i angry.. i know i say stupid things (cos she always jump to wrong conclusion, like 'why everyday use mp3/internet'. but thing is i nv use at all.. she just assume..all my relatives also like that. not fair larh, i nv use, den kena assumed that i use.. i say no, nobody believe me) so i just shut up.. listen to what person say.. but what i show on my face v hard to hide lor.. den she will like "why show angry face?" but i really angry.. den i tell my relatives to tell her on my behalf.. i angry but at least i shut up.. anger show on my face bo bian, but i try my v best to shut up ler. but i keep quiet also no good, say also no good, both way kena scolding lor.</p>
              <p>my mum also call me names lar. she dun care de. she hurt me but i also no choice liao, just tahan it.</p>
