              <p>there's so many complaints.. no doubt she got my well-being at heart, but i feel she overcontrol.. which parent deserving of respect will shout at the child, smack the child, use towel/keys hit the child's head? and that child in question already 20 YO. i dont think im THAT childish to warrant these kind of 'attention'.</p>
              <p>i rather she be negligent (not that she isnt now). cos when i'm on talking terms with her, anytime she shuang she just shout at me, den when i'm not talking with her, she just ignore. i find the 'ignore' easier to tolerate</p>

              <p>Ok..  My son is 20 this year.  Last year we had a chat - a chat that was supposed to happen long time ago..  just the timing was never right ..  that time was the right time where both of us open up ..  I tell him my worry, concern and I still love him dispite everything else ...  he spoke up, though not entirely ...  we had a better understanding of each other ...  now he behave much better in the sense I know he has grown up and needed his space.  He no more acted in such a way that worry me.  Our relationship is much better now ...</p>
              <p>For you, maybe you can try to talk to your mum, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">at the right timing . </span></strong>I know you will say you had tried spoken to her or had spoken.  But did you two understand each other ?  Try again ...  I took a very long time to do it... still it is never too late ...  for your information, my son used to tell people he hated me and wish me dead ...  you know how hurting it was ??  now we are friend.</p>

              <p>Haha My mom is sooo similar to your mom - lying, manipulating, breaking promises all the time, never supporting/respecting your decisions never listening to you unreasonable etc etc. All through my 20 years until recently i got sick of it.</p>
              <p>For me, whenever i argue with her and she starts bringing family members to side her argument and try to force me to do it her way, What i will do is i will rebutt every single family member/relative that side her and just shout at them all one by one. And of course finally, at her too. AND i did things my way. 'anti-social' labels are merely another one of the manipulative techniques employed to have it their way</p>
              <p>Most of the time the consequences are just a lack of monetary support from my family but thats nothing my savings, determination to spite them, borrowing of money cant solve. Way better than being perpetually controlled and manipulated by idiots who dont really care about you</p>

              <p>yup, sounds quite jia lat. maybe ur mum herself was brought up in this way. u know, the older gen has different ideas abt parenting. she's nice to ur kid cousins and puts u down... maybe because she tot tt she was being modest... a lot of mothers are like tt.. they believe tt if they praise their kid, somehow they will be viewed as being hao lian by their relatives.</p>
              <p>as for the hitting, who knows? maybe ur grandma or grand dad hit her too when she was 20 and she has never known another style of parenting. if u tink of it in this way, maybe it wld help u to understand her behaviour better.</p>
              <p>try not to do the tit-for-tat thing... tt is a reaction fr anger... but it won't achieve any long term improvement in ur relationship wif ur mum.</p>
              <p>can tell tt u really got ting jin qu (listening) to what the pple who post here are saying... u're really ok de...</p>
              <p>unlike u.. still young... ur mum's behaviour is not so easy to change. cos she's already old and set in her ways. if u wanna be filial, try to understand the reasons for her actions before u get angry wif her... at least u still have ur mum wif u... she won't be wif u forever one.</p>
              <p>how is her rs wif ur dad like? and u got any siblings? maybe can ask ur dad to bring her out more often and help her relax. usually, women who dun have a gd communicative rs wif their husbands turn their attention to their children. bcos unlike the husband, the children seem easier for them to ctrl. hope tt is not the case for ur family, but if it is, maybe u shld have a talk wif ur dad abt this.</p>

              <p>my mum nv been hit by her parents before. i know her parents' style.. they'r nice ppl.. her dad nv hit unless really over the limit and she wasnt this sort. those kinda nerd-study-hard-play-hard kinds, u know? her mum also nv discipline her unless she over limit, and she nv before..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>her problem is that she thinks all kids can have the same parenting style.. she is senior in her job, den she use same method of disciplining wayward staff..den bring back same attitude lorhx. this wo really ming bai. cos i know how she works, i'v been watching her alot (me the quiet type de..observe but nv say..bottle things up den explode..cos dun liek to express feelings..)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i got younger bro.. he those kind of mummy's boy.. until i bth.. but behind her back he also do alot of things.. but ta hui man zhe wo ma ma de.. damn good la. den everyone think he angel.. but he actually not.. my dad not around la..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>even if he is also, he talk to her no use de.. in one ear out the other.. i know she damn set in her ways.. i realised that only extreme measure will work with her.. dat why i always stubborn-stubborn.. doing me no good but when i talk to her nicely.. she change FOR A WHILE only..den revert liao.. i trying to make her change permanently so that we wont at loggerhead so much.. but realise now this cannot.. so to avoid more trouble i stay out of home.. liek that don argue so much.. den i just sms to say dun make dinner for me, i will be back by 10. kinda stuff. i really hate being at home lar.. now i using internet elsewhere, paying for it myself (should be making some of my thread critics happier =S) den lydat i use internet less.. im not using internet at home liao. later kena more.. i dun wan..</p>

              <p>really? if u don mind me asking.. how did ur son actually really sat down and took up the offer of listening to his dad/mum (duno which one u are) talk??</p>
              <p>for me, i listen to my aunt talk (well jsut had it from her ytd, but she changed tactic - used the exact opposite of what my mum uses on me.. and i told her this tactic i like better), but i dont find it easy ot listen to my mum talk. or my bro. cos they both jump to conclusions all the time, telling me i did things i didnt do, using all teh wrong tones on me, like getting all angry and stuff.</p>
              <p>but isnt it really 'humiliating' to actually 'degrade' urself, or what do u call it, 'lower ur pride' to talk to ur son in a softer tone when ur realyl angry with him?? i mean, just to get him to listen?</p>
              <p>i duno what is it like to love someone so much (im not a parent) and i cannot fathom how parents can tahan their child when their child is such a bitch (like me) or a****** or unfilial ingrate (iv been called this numerous times)</p>
              <p>i need to ask u something (as a teen to a parent) - are parents/relatives aware that if u label a teen/child/person something (positive/negative), the teen/child/person will take up that label? as in like since i'm called 'unfilial ingrate', somehow i feel that since i'm called 'unfilial', it aint gg to change if im filial?</p>

              <p>really? if u don mind me asking.. how did ur son actually really sat down and took up the offer of listening to his dad/mum (duno which one u are) talk??</p>
              <p>for me, i listen to my aunt talk (well jsut had it from her ytd, but she changed tactic - used the exact opposite of what my mum uses on me.. and i told her this tactic i like better), but i dont find it easy ot listen to my mum talk. or my bro. cos they both jump to conclusions all the time, telling me i did things i didnt do, using all teh wrong tones on me, like getting all angry and stuff.</p>
              <p>but isnt it really 'humiliating' to actually 'degrade' urself, or what do u call it, 'lower ur pride' to talk to ur son in a softer tone when ur realyl angry with him?? i mean, just to get him to listen?</p>
              <p>i duno what is it like to love someone so much (im not a parent) and i cannot fathom how parents can tahan their child when their child is such a bitch (like me) or a****** or unfilial ingrate (iv been called this numerous times)</p>
              <p>i need to ask u something (as a teen to a parent) - are parents/relatives aware that if u label a teen/child/person something (positive/negative), the teen/child/person will take up that label? as in like since i'm called 'unfilial ingrate', somehow i feel that since i'm called 'unfilial', it aint gg to change if im filial?</p>

              <p>hmmm...  I told him we need to talk..  as usual he find excuses not to be home...  I ddn't force him or make him specially to come back to chat..  I just waited... one day he was home n I just sit next to him and I started ...  how when he was young he did this n that n I apologise to him first..  telling him I was taught how to be a good parent nor are there book for reference..  so by trail n error we learn  ..  what I thought was important n I insist on it but now I know I was wrong...  he begin to understand n we continue ..  I actaul sherd tears when I relate certain incident which he remember..  he realised I didn't di it on perpose...  etc... </p>
              <p>yes, if you label a child, I supposed he or she will cary the label for a long long time...  but no parent want to condemn their own children... just that they do not know how to express..  if you know that you are not what you are labeled, then prove yourself ...  show them you are not and if you are offence with the label, let them know ...  I am sure they will change one....</p>
              <p>that talk with my son, I throw away my pride ... all I want is the confidence of my son and no pride is going to stand in my way ...  he also feel it and know that it wasn't easy for me to do that and he appreciate it ...  so for the sake of your loves one, pride can take second stage ... </p>

              <p>how arh? that bugger doesnt listen to what i say, what i TRY to explain, den all my relatives side her, i'm always the bad guy. everything i say, they shoot me down. all the stuff about me being 'unfilial', 'rebellious', 'good-for-nothing', 'anti-social'. i mean, yea i may be some of that stuff some of the time, but only when im angry! and they make my angry side come out all the time. with friends i'm not as mean as with my relatives.</p>

              <p>her problem is that she thinks all kids can have the same parenting style.. she is senior in her job, den she use same method of disciplining wayward staff..den bring back same attitude lorhx. this wo really ming bai. cos i know how she works, i'v been watching her alot (me the quiet type de..observe but nv say..bottle things up den explode..cos dun liek to express feelings..)</p>

              <p>u just gotta talk to her and tell urself tt no matter what she says, u won't lose ur temper. at tt moment when u talk, she might show her anger, or become defensive, but after tt, she will understand de. she's still ur mum, and her actions show tt she cares for u.  </p>
              <p>when u say ur dad not ard, it means he really not a part of ur lives anymore rite? i won't probe further then.</p>
              <p>since it's like this, i tink it's better u try to put her actions in the rite perspective... she's a single mother trying to bring up two teenage children on her own... and u are the eldest, of course she will have more expectations of u...</p>
              <p>look at it this way, maybe she wanna push u cos she knows tt u can do much better. because she believes tt u have the abilities. isn't tt a gd thing? better then she give up on u right? </p>
              <p>u sound like u envy ur younger brother, cos he can get away wif things. but why do u wanna envy someone who lies? he is a bit of a hypocrite right? pretend to be angel and then do things behind her back. is that the kind of person u also wan to be?</p>
              <p>to me, u're the better person because at least u were honest wif her.</p>

              <p>u just gotta talk to her and tell urself tt no matter what she says, u won't lose ur temper. at tt moment when u talk, she might show her anger, or become defensive, but after tt, she will understand de. she's still ur mum, and her actions show tt she cares for u.  </p>
              <p>when u say ur dad not ard, it means he really not a part of ur lives anymore rite? i won't probe further then.</p>
              <p>since it's like this, i tink it's better u try to put her actions in the rite perspective... she's a single mother trying to bring up two teenage children on her own... and u are the eldest, of course she will have more expectations of u...</p>
              <p>look at it this way, maybe she wanna push u cos she knows tt u can do much better. because she believes tt u have the abilities. isn't tt a gd thing? better then she give up on u right? </p>
              <p>u sound like u envy ur younger brother, cos he can get away wif things. but why do u wanna envy someone who lies? he is a bit of a hypocrite right? pretend to be angel and then do things behind her back. is that the kind of person u also wan to be?</p>
              <p>to me, u're the better person because at least u were honest wif her.</p>

              <p>yupz, he's not part of our lives liaox. got over it long ago though, so no worries about this aspect.</p>
              <p>yea, about the "single parent bringing up two <strong>teenage children"</strong> <em>yadda yadda</em>, i get that as well. as in, wo ming bai.. i know she got alot of stress... plus her work stress blah blah..but i got too..its not just her that get stress, that get angry.. (aiyo im making excuses again). but i did tell my aunt when she came over to counsel me, that she always says "i v tired, u go do everything"..</p>
              <p>i told her, why issit she always talk like shes the only one that can get tired (and i cant), why she's the only one that can make mistakes (and i cant - she always make it seem like my fault when i make mistake, even when i wanted to apologise liao, den her stupid tone and remarks make me so incensed i just forget all about apologising. and when she makes mistakes, her excuse is "all humans err". LOL) but suan le larh.. just wanted to rant. HAHAS.</p>
              <p>yea cos im super lazy so i usually don do things that benefit me..unless the results are gotten straightaway..im not good at planning for future blah blah..and i like playing better..always procrastinate..all d bad things..</p>
              <p>got lah, she got say she give up on me. den nxt day come and yell at me. wahsay. abit hypocrite hor. still dare to lecture me "must do what you say". =XX v good role-model indeed. XD</p>
              <p>aiyo, i duno my family at all..my bro also like that one. v hard to get things from him. like, i ask to borrow his book. he will say 'later later'. den nv give me. but when he ask to borrow my stuff, i give him same attitude, den he hound me all the time, until i pass it to him. if i hound him, he get angry and shout at me. den, when i complain to my mum, she takes his side. UNFAIR. my bro took the hard disk (That has all my stuff) i been asking him to pass me back so i can use, he just said "i'm using" and conveniently 'forget'. whereas, if i owe him 10 cents, he will come after me for that 10cents, even after 1 month. super selective memory hor? asking me to tell my mum is no use de. she sides him. he is soooo mean. and yet, to others, he is the best boy/cousin/son/nephew that anyoen can ask for. someone ask him for something? sure, i give to u. if i ask him for soemthing, he ignore me/conveniently 'forget'. mum also same attitude. ask *VERY NICELY* her if she saw my things (Cos i forgot where i put), den she straightaway "NO?! HOW I KNOW WHERE U PUT UR THINGS?!" bro also same. waaaaa.</p>

              <p>well just.. get the dam license... and dun buy car if u dun like the 1st choice....  just be a bad guy until one day u cannot tahan anymore and tell ur relatives how bad, how MEAN, how evil and how cruel ur mom truly is... its good if u can make that conversation obvious to ur mother who is washing the plates blah blah. let her eavesdrop and let her know how hurt u are...</p>

              <p>for eg:</p>
              <p>she's ur <strong>mother</strong>, so she got right to throw ur things cos she bought it/restrict ur privacy (and i wasnt even doing anything wrong!! im just asking for privacy to read my email in peace, w/o her looking over my shoulder)</p>
              <p>den all i said was, 'im her daughter. meaning i can throw the things she bought on my advice, and read her emails as well?'</p>
              <p>den they all got angry at me. (well im obviously only good at countering weak arguments)</p>

              <p>i know u also suffered and u also feel tired of the family squabbles... i guess ur mum still hasn't figured out how to handle situations between u and ur younger brother properly.</p>
              <p>it's common to assume that as a parent, a mother shld know everything, and be able to handle every situation adequately. she may have done u wrong, but she's still learning...</p>
              <p>my mum has always used this line on me, whenever we quarrel: next time when u become a parent, u will know how hard it is.</p>
              <p>i din have a gd relationship wif her for many years cos i stayed at my aunt's house when i was young, and i also had lots of resentment against her. i tot she din trust me and felt really misunderstood. my first job was stressful and sometimes need to work until 10pm or even as late as 1am. but when i worked late, she scolded me and said tt i lied and tt i was out "gallivanting" wif my friends. </p>
              <p>it was only until she was diagnosed with cancer and almost died last yr that i really began to regret all the times i shouted at her, and made her cry. later i realised tt she was only so suspicious of me, because she was prob having depression, unhappy wif her life and her marriage. </p>
              <p>it's not ur fault tt life is so hard for u... but it's not ur mum's fault too... have u considered tt maybe ur mum nv got over ur dad? as a woman, i can tell u it's nt so easy to forget someone tt u were married to.</p>
              <p>u can't change ur mum... but u can slowly try to forgive her... and help her find her own balance in life.</p>
              <p>have u ever considered going for counselling to talk out ur probs?</p>
              <p>or, if u feel really stifled at home, maybe u can consider moving out? or look for a job tt will send u overseas?</p>
              <p>u have nothing to lose. at first prob ur relatives will talk, but u can dun care them. </p>
              <p>sometimes it's better to apart, cos we dun see what we have until we lose it. who knows? maybe after u move away, ur mum will start to miss u, and be nicer to u?</p>
