Or that they are friends and they will give the best support?<br><br>Do you ever had a few occassions where your involvement in certain matters aggravated it? It could have been better but because of what you said or did, it got worse? If you never had one, good. If you did, then surely you would understand where people make their stand in issues like this for example.</div>
