Looks like you cant even read properly.<br><br>Let me just say one last thing, everything you read could have been one sided, your not the police. Why not dig out some evidence to prove him guilty, precisely you cant and <strong>YOU</strong> can only <span style="color: red;"><strong>READ</strong></span> and so called "conclude" that devil is the one at fault. Please, im not siding anyone here, but what you said is very much offensive, instead of a neutral view.<br><br>Your not his father, or his mother, let me emphasise that you DONT know what happened, im 100% clear of that, and your conclusion in which devil is at fault is just plain dummy. Your reasonings do make sense, but just let the involved parties and police handle it.<br><br>If everything can be concluded so easily, why do you think there are some quinny supporters and devil supporters, each having their own reasoning to defend the person, den might as well not have the police, just let him kena the sentence straight can liao.<br></div>
