It's genuinely because I don't have the habit of posting over the weekends.. Perhaps except Sunday nights?<br><br>And I admit that I've been quite inactive in AA lately. It's mainly because of political reasons. My intention as a moderator in AA was never to use my position to take advantage of anyone.<br><br>Regarding Bee_gal's incident, I'll stand firm by what I've said previously. It wasn't like what the others have accused of me. Perhaps Bee_gal herself would come back one day to clear everything if she still regards me as a friend. Perhaps she won't. Doesn't really matter now I guess?<br><br>Quinsy. Yes, we went for the movie. I seriously had the impression that she was leading me on. From my further conversations with her after (sorry, I didn't learn about all these threads until lately), I guess I could be wrong. She said she wasn't trying to encourage and lead me on. To that, I [b]owe her an apology</strong>. I'm truly sorry if I've misinterpreted you. I guess you were too quiet and casual about it so I didn't really know. I'm sorry. When I 1st asked her out, it was purely casual. No intention.<br><br>I agree with MOST here that I'm not a 'good' guy nor a 'saint' to start with. I also agree with the 'warnings' given with regards to me. Makes me think perhaps I really shouldn't be allowed to meet up with anyone online at all? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> I've not and never for ONCE claimed that I'm a SAINT.. In fact, I dread it if anyone is to define me as so. I'm just doing a part which if humans have handled a better job themselves.. I would not have even need to exist today.<br><br>I would also urge Jason to find AA a replacement for moderator soon. And should he find appropriate replacement for AA, I would like to free myself from that position and duty.[/b]</blockquote>what do you think?<br><br>i think we owe devil an apology.<br><br>he still deserves to be a moderator in my view.</div>
