            <div class='col-md body'>Have you ever been affected by something someone did or say that it made you so upset you decided to change for the better?<br><br>I have.<br><br>I used to be a home boy, I go home everyday after school and play my games, Trying to hook up online girls.<br><br>I thought in real life, With my 1337 internet speak, I could hook up girls in real life. I never really bothered with my image, Normally I lag behind trends by alot and all.<br><br>I could be labelled a nerd, geek or even loser.<br><br>Then something affected me very badly, This girl I like, Told people behind my back she thought I was extremely disgusting.<br><br>Then I was totally shattered.<br><br>Very upset but I didn't show.<br><br>Then I slowly tried to change myself and during the process, Alot of people started to hate me for it but I had a couple of friends who continued to encourage me on and showed approval. I didn't give up and this is where I am now.<br><br>At least, To me, I am in a better position than before. I actually put things in motion rather than sit in a corner and cry about it.<br><br>Although I still know that some people hate me for my change and such, At least I have the confidence to face the world, I no longer have to look down on the ground when I'm walking and I am able to talk to strangers with ease and look them straight in the eyes because I know I am good looking in my own ways.<br><br>I am no longer the extremely disgusting guy.<br><br>I totally love (not in a gay manner) my best buddy for all he has done for me. Thanks for the encouragement and help you've given me. Though we still have our quarrels, I know we will be friends to the end.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes.. i guess i can say i was affected .. or else i wouldve seen things more differently and experienced a whole different life. People , situations sometimes are out of your control. And that very decision will forever change ur view on things and especially if left alone to fend for urself in the real harsh world and no one to help n guide u but urself u only have urself to believe in.<br><br>Up to today,  i always wondered whether i shouldve acted the way i did on that very day. But then u think about it again , without those painful memories and decisions will u be the man u are today ? for better or for worse u will never know. But just hope that u can pass on ur experience to someone who will need it n be there for the person that needs it. Or hope ppl will never have to experience what u have.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Agenda,<br><br>I'm responding only to the thread title you started. It's great to know you're making real efforts on improving your image, a quality not many of us are capable of.<br><br>Like the rest of my peers, we usually wind up complaining about discomforts in life over cups of teh tarik on Sunday evenings before returning to our old lives for the better or worse of what it has to offer.<br><br>A little over a year ago, my father was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer and given 6 months to live. That being said, I've never been close to my mother and elder sister, I spent the most part of my juvenile delinquent days dropping in and out of polytechnics, eventually landing myself odd jobs at the occasional pub and cafe in my late teens. He was an old man making 3 bucks an hour at fast food restaurants. And she as well. My sister left home to be with a boyfriend. While I continued drifting in and out of jobs with no stable income. I relied on my parents for money, food, even cigarettes and I was already 22.<br><br>I checked the only person I ever loved into the A &amp; E by myself 2 hours past midnight. They reeled him out the ambulance and I was told he would die in 6 months. I stayed home for 3 months feeling very broke, very jobless, very young, very uneducated, extremely lost and very hopeless because seeing him wither and thinning from the dying made life very bleak for a 22 year old back in those days. Try chopping pills from a dirty blade for a dying man with 2 bucks in your pocket and a heap of bills to pay with a clueless mother and non existent sister around for support and I call it the lowest point of my life. I contemplated suicide but even at 22, I was too damn proud to kill myself.<br><br>So he died a Tuesday morning alone on his bed because I was the only one else around and at 22, I was far too young and too afraid to look at a 40kg father gasping for his last breath and till now, I regret never having held his hand to see him through his last moments. I filed the death report alone. Called for casket alone. Called HDB by myself. And arranged for the wake by myself. We had many great laughs many mornings before the moment he died and afterwards nothing else really matters.<br><br>Life turned around afterwards with projects coming in and more opportunities to furnish my work with more skills, more money to be made, more backpacking travels and I've fallen into rapids several times almost drowning during heavier storms. During times when I fall into the water, I would remember my father and  kin and of the simpler days when all worries were limited to a zit on my arse or whether the boy in the next class gave a damn about me in the canteen.<br><br>Perhaps his passing hasn't really changed much of me. Just writing about it makes me feel a little better now and wishing the years ain't passed.</div>
