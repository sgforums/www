              <p class="first">HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) — A Harvard-educated biologist was sentenced to life in prison without parole Monday after being convicted of going on a shooting rampage during a faculty meeting at an Alabama university, killing three colleagues and wounding three others in 2010.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_22_1348547414497_211">The jury deliberated for about 20 minutes before convicting <span id="lw_1348532428_0" class="yshortcuts cs4-visible">Amy Bishop</span>. The former professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville showed no reaction as the verdict was read. She did not speak in court, but her attorney said she has often expressed great remorse for the victims and their families.</p>
              <p>"She is shattered beyond belief," attorney Roy Miller said.</p>
              <p>Bishop avoided a death sentence by pleading guilty earlier this month to the shootings on Feb. 12, 2010. Before the guilty plea — which she signed with a barely legible scrawl — her attorneys had said they planned to use an insanity defense.</p>
              <p>However, she was still required to have a brief trial because she admitted to a capital murder charge.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_22_1348547414497_217">And she still could face a trial in <span id="lw_1348532428_6" class="yshortcuts cs4-ndcor">Massachusetts</span>, where she is charged in the 1986 killing of her 18-year-old brother. <span id="lw_1348532428_2" class="yshortcuts cs4-visible">Seth Bishop</span>'s death had been ruled an accident after <span id="lw_1348532428_1" class="yshortcuts cs4-visible">Amy Bishop</span> told investigators she shot him in the family's Braintree home as she tried to unload her father's gun. But the Alabama shootings prompted a new investigation and charges. David Traub, a spokesman for <span id="lw_1348532428_4" class="yshortcuts cs4-ndcor">Norfolk District Attorney Michael Morrissey</span> in Massachusetts, said Monday evening that Morrissey expects to make an announcement by the end of the week.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_22_1348547414497_218">Bishop killed her boss, biology department chairman Gopi Padila, plus professors <span id="lw_1348532428_3" class="yshortcuts cs4-ndcor">Maria Ragland Davis</span> and Adriel Johnson. Associate professor Joseph Leahy, staff aide Stephanie Monticciolo and assistant professor Luis Cruz-Vera were shot and wounded.</p>
              <p>Leahy said he was satisfied with the verdict and life sentence, but no amount of remorse by Bishop could change what she'd done.</p>
              <p>"She has just sort of ceased to exist for me," he told reporters after the brief trial.</p>
              <p>A police investigator testified that Bishop initially denied having anything to do with the rampage. And during the trial, Bishop shook her head anytime the judge or prosecutors described the killings as intentional.</p>
              <p>District Attorney Rob Broussard said Bishop's reaction in court didn't make sense.</p>
              <p>"You can't take a loaded 9 mm and hold it inches away from human beings' heads and tell me you didn't mean to do that," said Broussard.</p>
              <p>Investigator Charlie Gray also said police believe Bishop opened fire during the faculty meeting because she was angry over being denied tenure, which effectively ended her career at the University of Alabama in Huntsville.</p>
              <p>"She would say, 'It didn't happen. I wasn't there. It wasn't me,'" Gray said.</p>
              <p>Bishop wore a red jail uniform in court and was shackled at the feet, seated between two attorneys at the defense table.</p>
              <p>Also in court, sitting behind prosecutors, were relatives of the people killed in the rampage.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_22_1348547414497_219">The only other witness to testify was <span id="lw_1348532428_5" class="yshortcuts cs4-ndcor">Debra Moriarity</span>, now the chairman of biological sciences at UAH. She testified about how a routine Friday afternoon faculty meeting turned into a scene of carnage with no warning.</p>
              <p>Moriarty testified that Amy Bishop sat unusually silent during the nearly hourlong faculty meeting, during which discussions ran from a spring open house to plans for the following fall. People were seated around a crowded conference table in a small room on a chilly, overcast day, she said.</p>
              <p>Moriarity said she glanced down at a piece of paper on the table. "And there was a loud bang," she said.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_22_1348547414497_318">Moriarity said more shots followed in quick succession without Bishop ever saying a word. Moriarity said she was looking directly at Bishop when she shot professor Maria Ragland Davis, who was killed instantly while still seated at the table.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_22_1348547414497_317">Moriarity said she dove under the table for safety and tried to grab Bishop's legs, but the woman stepped out of her grasp. "I was saying, 'Stop, Amy, stop. Don't do this. I've helped you before, I'll help you again.'"</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_22_1348547414497_316">Moriarity said Bishop pointed the gun at her and pulled the trigger, but nothing happened. She said Bishop continued trying to shoot her in a hall outside, but the gun had jammed.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't worry you still young  [imdestinyz] there are many years ahead of you and there are many jobs available when you return to Singapore. Maybe I suggest that you plan a backpacking trip from Singapore all the way to Phuket. You will see lots of interesting places in Malaysia and Thailand, and meet many people....and perhaps during the trip you will see something and make you even more wiser person.....thats how you letgo of yourself and go with the flow...if you wish to see who you are..</div>

              <p>The bystanders were most likely wounded by police in the 9 a.m. incident in the shadow of one of the nation's most recognizable landmarks, authorities said. All but one—a 35-year-old female tourist from North Carolina—are New York City residents. They are expected to live; six were discharged from the hospital Friday.</p>

              <p>Tourists and harried commuters ran in fear when shots erupted in the packed Midtown district. "I heard the shooting and people started running toward here," said Mohamad Ragab, a breakfast vendor. "I jumped outside my cart to take a look. I saw one body."</p>
              <a name="U71230318300S6B"></a>
              <p>New York Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly identified the gunman as Jeffrey Johnson, 58, a Manhattan man who was fired about a year ago as a designer at a women's apparel firm, Hazan Import Corp., on West 33rd Street across from the Empire State Building. The victim was identified as Steven Ercolino, 41, a Hazan account executive, by his sister-in-law.</p>
              <a name="U712303183004PD"></a>
              <p>Authorities said Mr. Johnson blamed Mr. Ercolino for the loss of his job, accusing him of not doing enough to sell the T-shirts and women's accessories that Mr. Johnson designed. A building official said the men once had a physical altercation in the building, and Mr. Kelly said the two men had filed formal harassment complaints against each other in April 2011.</p>

              <p>Dressed in an olive-green suit and tie and carrying a black bag, Mr. Johnson hid behind a van outside the firm's office, then approached Mr. Ercolino and shot him once in the head with a .45 caliber semiautomatic handgun, authorities said. Mr. Johnson then stood over the body and shot several more times, authorities said. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
              <a name="U712272515962ZF"></a>
              <p>Mr. Johnson walked "very calmly" away from the scene, said police spokesman Paul Browne, but was followed by two construction workers who called for help to two police officers posted at the front entrance of the Empire State Building. The officers confronted Mr. Johnson, who took out his gun and pointed it at them from a distance of about eight feet, authorities said.</p>
              <a name="U71230318300YVG"></a>
              <p>"He had the gun out and he pointed it right at them," Mr. Kelly said, citing surveillance video. Officers "returned fire when he pointed the gun at them." The officers fired a total of 16 rounds, striking Mr. Johnson at least seven times and killing him, authorities said. Police were still investigating whether Mr. Johnson fired at the officers.</p>

              <p>According to his online LinkedIn profile, Mr. Ercolino worked at Hazan Import since December 2005. "He had an incredible life ahead of him. He was an incredible person," said a woman who identified herself as his sister-in-law, Andrea.</p>
              <a name="U71230318300OUC"></a>
              <p>Mr. Johnson was a Coast Guard veteran, serving from 1973 to 1977 with an honorable discharge, the Coast Guard said. A law-enforcement official said Mr. Johnson had no prior criminal record. Neighbors said he lived alone in an apartment with his cats. He bought the Spanish-made .45 semiautomatic handgun legally in 1991 in Florida, but wasn't licensed to possess the weapon in New York City, the official said. Mr. Johnson was carrying an extra magazine of ammunition in his bag, the official said.</p>
              <a name="U712303183009YB"></a>
              <p>A Hazan employee who answered the phone at the office Friday declined to comment. Malkin Holdings, the controlling owner of the Empire State Building, said the building remained open throughout the day.</p>

              <p id="yui_3_5_1_21_1349055648546_220" class="first">MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — An Israeli immigrant who started a signage company in his basement and spent decades building it into a successful business was among five people slain by a fired employee at a <span id="lw_1348907500_2" class="yshortcuts cs4-visible">Minneapolis</span> workplace, authorities said.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_21_1349055648546_296">Also killed were an avid sculptor and painter with a day job there and a UPS driver who made pickups and deliveries to the company for years. Police said he was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_21_1349055648546_214">Six people — including the suspected gunman — were shot to death Thursday afternoon at <span id="lw_1348907500_0" class="yshortcuts cs4-visible">Accent Signage Systems</span>, located in a quiet residential corner of northwest Minneapolis. Police say <span id="lw_1348907500_1" class="yshortcuts cs4-visible">Andrew Engeldinger</span>, 36, was fired from the company that afternoon and responded by fatally shooting others there before he turned the gun on himself in the building's basement.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_21_1349055648546_224">Among those killed were Reuven Rahamim, 61, the company's founder; Rami Cooks, 62, of Minnetonka; <span id="lw_1348907500_7" class="yshortcuts cs4-ndcor">Jacob Beneke</span>, 34, of Maple Grove; Ronald Edberg, 58, of Brooklyn Center; and Keith Basinski, 50, a Wisconsin native who was the UPS driver.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_21_1349055648546_223">No details were immediately released about why <span id="lw_1348907500_8" class="yshortcuts cs4-ndcor">Engeldinger</span> was fired, but <span id="lw_1348907500_5" class="yshortcuts cs4-visible">Minneapolis Police Chief Tim Dolan</span> said it appeared he singled out some victims and spared others. Engeldinger's family offered sympathy to the victims in a statement through the <span id="lw_1348907500_6" class="yshortcuts cs4-visible">National Alliance on Mental Illness</span>. It said he had struggled with mental illness for years.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_21_1349055648546_297">"This is not an excuse for his actions, but sadly, may be a partial explanation," the statement said.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_21_1349055648546_225">Rahamim's family asked that the focus of the tragedy be on those killed rather than the gunman. Rahamim's son-in law, <span id="lw_1348907501_1" class="yshortcuts cs4-ndcor">Chad</span> Blumenfield, wrote in an email that he was born and raised on a farm in <span id="lw_1348907501_0" class="yshortcuts cs4-ndcor">Israel</span> and was a soldier in the Israeli Army before leaving for the U.S. after the Yom Kippur War, which occurred in 1973.</p>
              <p>"He loved spending time with his children and grandchildren and especially loved to take his grandson for bike rides," Blumenfield wrote.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_21_1349055648546_222">Beneke had a wife and a young son, said Lorrie Link, who heads the Maple Grove Arts Center. She said Beneke was a volunteer there, where he displayed his work and promoted the work of other artists in the suburb northwest of <span id="lw_1348907500_4" class="yshortcuts cs4-visible">Minneapolis</span>.</p>
              <p>Beneke's Facebook page said he worked as digital imaging manager at Accent Signage Systems.</p>
              <p>"He was just a very cool guy. He was very creative and expressive," Link said of the New Albin, Iowa, native. "His sculptures and paintings and drawings made us laugh."</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_21_1349055648546_298">Basinski was a Wisconsin native dedicated to the Green Bay Packers. Dolan said he likely wasn't one of the gunman's primary targets but was killed simply because he happened to be there.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_21_1349055648546_299">Minneapolis Police Capt. Amelia Huffman said the scene at Accent Signage Systems was "very chaotic" and that it was taking time for police to put together a comprehensive chronology. She said there were more than 20 people scattered in the building when Engeldinger began firing, and witnesses only saw bits of what happened.</p>
              <p>Huffman said police believe Engeldinger got a letter of reprimand in the mail and came into the office Thursday afternoon. At that point, he was terminated.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_21_1349055648546_300">"From the best we can tell, the incident started right after Mr. Engeldinger had been fired," Huffman said. She said there was a struggle in the office and shots were fired, which employees elsewhere in the building heard. Dolan said Engeldinger used a 9mm Glock semi-automatic pistol he had owned for about a year.</p>
              <p>"And Mr. Engeldinger left the back office area and fired additional shots throughout the building," she said. Victims were shot throughout the building, she said.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_21_1349055648546_301">Police said the first 911 calls came in about 4:30 p.m. Thursday. Initially, three officers responded; Dolan said the shooting was over by the time they got there, and they entered the building to find a scene he described as "hellish." Dolan said those three officers were put on leave to give them time to recover.</p>
              <p>"This scene is by far the most traumatic these officers have ever encountered," Dolan said.</p>
              <p>It took officers a long time to secure the very large building, he said. The company had no security, and Dolan said tactical units found two people hiding "a very long time" after the attack began.</p>
              <p>Later Thursday, SWAT teams and investigators searched Engeldinger's home in south Minneapolis. There they found a second gun and packaging for 10,000 rounds of ammunition in the house.</p>
              <p>"He obviously had this gun and was practicing how to use this gun," Dolan said.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_21_1349055648546_302">Sue Abderholden, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness' Minnesota chapter, said Engeldinger's family had sought help from the group two years ago, with his parents taking a 12-week course on recognizing and dealing with mental illness.</p>
              <p>She said their concerns were "much more centered around paranoid thoughts. No violence or anything like that." The Engeldingers were not able to convince Andrew to seek treatment, she said.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_21_1349055648546_221">Andrew Engeldinger's uncle, <span id="lw_1348907500_3" class="yshortcuts cs4-visible">Joe Engeldinger</span> of New <span id="lw_1348907501_2" class="yshortcuts cs4-ndcor">Germany</span>, Minn., called his nephew a "good kid" who broke the hearts of family members when he broke off contact with them about two years ago.</p>
              <p>"When I would see his family, I would ask them about Andy and nobody could ever tell me anything," Joe Engeldinger said.</p>
              <p>Chuck and Carolyn Engeldinger raised Andrew and his two siblings in the Minneapolis suburb of Richfield, Joe Engeldinger said.</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_21_1349055648546_303">"He wasn't a monster. He wasn't," Joe Engeldinger said. "He was a real good kid, a real good person. He had a real good heart. I don't know what made all this transpire. Hopefully the truth will come out and won't get twisted into some demented thing."</p>
              <p id="yui_3_5_1_21_1349055648546_304">The Minnesota Bureau of Labor and Industry said it was the deadliest workplace shooting since the agency began tracking such events in 1992. No more than two workers had died in such a shooting before this week, according to the St. Paul Pioneer Press.</p>
