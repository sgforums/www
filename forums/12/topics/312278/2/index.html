              <p>5. Is there a return air ticket to this person's country?</p>
              <p>To have overstayed for 3 months is not a joking matter and for
              that matter may even jeopardize the person whom this foreigner is
              with (that is you at the moment) - harbouring an illegal. So you
              had better take some action and not hesitate any further.</p>

              To give you the info.
              
              1. It is a UK passport. Male aged 24.
              2. Visa was for one month - nearly 5 months over now.
              3. Liked the country and started seeing a local girl but that's over now.
              4. No extension to passport.
              5. Not yet but will get one if it helps.
              
              Been working casually but employer thinks it's a differnt visa.
              
              I know the right thing to do is go to immigration but hearing about what could happen with jail and the cane is hard to think about.

              <p>The longer you drag the worse it gets</p>
              <p>It's better for you to approach immigration then wait for them to catch you.</p>
              <p>Seriously I don't know what your excuse is for not extending your visa but ignorance is not an excuse.</p>

              <p>I think you should not hesitate anymore and make a visit to the Visitor Services Centre, 4th Storey, ICA

              <p>I do not think there will be a harsh punishment for you if you own up. I think the caning is for those who are caught in a sting operation and/or spot checks. I am sure the officer in charge will give you a chance to explain yourself and review your case. Just remember to bring your passport and valid documents along i.e. the disembarkation card and other documents.</p>
              <p>I suggest you do not mention about your temporary work and staying arrangements to implicate people and yourself. I am sure you are not staying in a hotel as they will be sure to know that you have overstayed. Whatever, it is please do not delay as you are in a very precarious situation.</p>

              <p><br> Thanks for that - just a case of getting things together to go
              there. Makes it better to know what you said about the caning being
              for if you get caught. Anything else isn't so bad.</p>

              <p>MattUK,</p>
              <p>Something just occured to me the other day after I had posted but as I got caught up with my work I just came across another idea to solve your problem. Please PM if you are interested and sincerely would want your problems resolved without implicating anybody.</p>

              <p>I think the TS is between a rock and a hard place. The devil and the dark blue sea. He has to decide which.</p>
              <p>To attempt escape, comes with it certain risk, i.e. to be caught means mandatory canning.</p>
              <p>But to surrender, leniency is possible, and still it may not mean no canning.</p>
              <p>How?</p>
              <p>See a lawyer, see a diplomat, contact Amnesty International, get publicity and hope the canning is not administered.</p>
              <p>When you don't give a damn, you get into deep shit.</p>

              <p>U think it will help?</p>
              <p>think Michael Fay.</p>
              <p>if I remembered correctly...the US president also made appeal for him...but he still kenna the rotan...which I think is correct.</p>
              <p>Now best choice is to take it like a man...within the confines of the previleges allowed under the law...i.e legal advice from a lawyer,etc.</p>

              <p>In the event that you have not presented yourself before the authorities, I would recommend that you speak with your Counsellor / Embassy Staff prior to acting on the advice of presenting yourself to the local authorities.</p>
              <p>As you come from Europe, there would most certainly be an avenue that you may turn to seek advice prior or provide "notification" prior to acting on any of the earlier given recommentions.</p>
