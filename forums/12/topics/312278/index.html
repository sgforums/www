              Iâ€™m really worried now after reading this. I know this is a bad situation but would the cane be always a punishment for overstaying on a visa. Does it make a difference is if somebody is from Europe? I thought that the worse that could happen would maybe be held for a few days and then deported but Iâ€™m obviously wrong. 
              
              Do you think this law is fair?

              <p>I think it would help if you could supply us with more details:</p>

              <p>2. Social Visit Pass granted was for how long?</p>
              <p>3. What was the reason for the overstay?</p>
              <p>4. Has there been any extension on the passport before?</p>
              <p>5. Is there a return air ticket to this person's country?</p>
              <p>To have overstayed for 3 months is not a joking matter and for that matter may even jeopardize the person whom this foreigner is with (that is you at the moment) - harbouring an illegal. So you had better take some action and not hesitate any further.</p>

              <p>Is that right about ‘a caning not less than 3 strokes’ – surely

                  with the immigration authorities or would they just let you go and

              <p>of course U will be arrested at the airport for overstaying....an offence has already been committed and it would be up to the courts to determine ur penalty....</p>
              <p>having a ticket out of singapore doesnt make the overstaying problem go away.</p>
