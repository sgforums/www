            <div class='col-md body'>ya .. this is extremely true .. it will reflect on hw bad a gal can be .. let me tell u a senario tat happened recently .. we , a group of guys n gals went to do a cip .. so it lasted quite a while .. after it ended .. we went to a food court n eat .. the gals however , did nt eat n ended up going to window shop e whole shopping mall . our earlier plan was to eat n go arcade n relax as a group .. when we hav finished eating , we waited for like 20 mins b4 calling them up (this shows hw gals can take their own sweet time even through ppl can be waiting for them )<br><br>so nvm .. we gave them a call n they were supposed to come up to the food court n grab their belongings b4 we go up to the arcade together ( they had left their belongings with us so they can shop freely without hassle ) . guess what the fark they did to us ?? they went up to the arcade themselves n didnt bothered to tell us n we hav to call n ask where the hell r they after 5 to 10 mins ..<br><br>so we , the group of guys had to carry the things for them all the way up . of cos this little chore doesnt mean much for us , but this shows hw spoilt n hw we r taken for granted . if they jolly well asked , we would hav gladly helped them with no regrets , but imagine the time wasted n the irresponsiblilty of the gals , which leaves me to sigh .</div>

Maybe not really many but enough for me to give advice... for me, there are two choices, one is i give in for the first time but there wont be second time going out with them. Second choice is just talk straight in her face that she is too much.
