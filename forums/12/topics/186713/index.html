            <div class='col-md body'>Nevertheless, lodge a police report, report to eBay and set an ultimatum of deadline. No response by the due date/time set, initiate your next logical action.<br><br>Obviously, you are in the wrong in the first place by not abiding to eBay's terms and conditions of conducting auction. So, expect to write off the item you sent if all fails. It is classified as internet fraud, but sadly with your knowledge to do so because of your shortcut in getting payment. Ever heard of Cash-On-Delivery or PayPal? Use them in future.<br><br>I do not see any issue at all since it is between the buyer and the seller in a commercial transaction bounded by eBay's terms and conditions.</div>
