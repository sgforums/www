            <div class='col-md body'>My ADVICE? Be REALISTIC.... How can you expect to be doing such a thing without causing her ANY PAIN...? ~Sigh...~<br>MAKE SURE you DON'T regret this AGAIN and ask her back...? Or I'll HANTAM you man...<br><br><strong>PROPOSED METHOD:</strong><br><br>INDULGE in your PERSONAL INTEREST and FRIENDS.... SLOWLY neglect her and eventually turn cold to her.... The IDEA outcome is to have her leave you by herself because she feel that you're no longer loving her (or loving her as much as before...) If she wants you PERHAPS you can still think TWICE about your DECISION...?<br><br>NEVER MIND, I ADVISE you to THINK over this CAREFULLY as ONCE you're SET to go, don't turn back or you'll only hurt her even MORE.....<br><br>This is a GENERAL PROPOSE, I can give you a MORE 'DETAILED' method IF you really wanna minimise the pain for her (Or issit for your own guilt?)..... Oh well.... GOOD LUCK....? ~Sigh...~<br><br>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT. FOR what I AM is CUT so DEEP inside of ME.<br>I LIVE my FLESH and SOUL ONLY to BLEED for the OTHERS.<br>FEAR ME NOT. FOR I AM YOUR 'MASTER'. GIVE YOU STRENGTH. FOR YOU ARE MY 'ENEMY'.<br>DEVIL PHRASE I<br><br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....  DEVIL PHRASE II<br><br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>

U are also incapable of maintaining persistence on activities.<br><br>U are the one who made the decision to win her back. And now u are the one who wants to terminate the relationship just because u want to enjoy the freedom of singlehood.<br><br>My advice:<br><br>There's no way u can minimize the hurt. U have to break it to her gently, telling her that you have no more feelings for her. It's a harsh approach, but if she is sensible enough, she would understand the fact that if either one party has lost the interest, there's no point carrying on.<br><br>PS: And I believe a lot of people won't like to see u going after her again. U are wasting her time, much less of yours.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well...there is a proverb that goes like this: " A sad thing in life is when u meet someone who means a lot to you, only to find out in the end that it was never meant to be and you just have to let go " But do be happy that at least your paths cross. Choose ur path &amp; just don't regret. =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>didn't expect to see so many replies... thanx guys for the advice/scoldings... even those who basically ripped me into shreds for following my heart.<br>anyone here who had gfs/bfs b4? was ur breakup purely due to reasons like ur partner being unfaithful to you or cos he/she has to migrate? most likely, the answer is no. feelings do change. mine did. but pls do not stereotype me as a 100% jerk who plays games with a girl's heart. or a young 13 yr old who is just following his hormones. what i typed is real. the feelings are real. there is no need for me to lie on the internet under the cover of iz_diz_rite.<br>but yes, your scoldings did wake me up... i've decided to break it to her. still not sure how to do it though. i'll most probably just ask her to my house and tell her the truth... even if the truth hurts for us both (you can flame me for being a hypocrite or bastard i won't care cos i'm saying the truth)...the proverb mentioned by girrafe really does explain how i feel now. and rest assured i am thankful that me and her paths crossed...<br>thanx again to you peeps for trying to understand my situation and actually giving me constructive advice... i was really expecting more of a flame fest then a counselling post =)...<br>hmm betta go still got a GP paper tommorrow...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey hey...it is really not a good idea to get her to your house to talk things out... either u guys meet outside at a quiet place to talk, or u go her house. ah bo, u finish your talk wif her liao, she sad/angry den she go home alone mah? confirm she won't allow u to send her liao mah..dangerous &amp; more hurt u will be...<br>anyway I do have a break-up wif my partner cos I got no more feeling. Really..we have been together for 3 years...but really lor, no more feeling for him...=) But still I tell him honestly instead of letting it drag &amp; we both suffer. Well, I use the method of over the phone.<br>Hope to hear that it is a smooth talk for you.... =)</div>
