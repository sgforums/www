              <p>Points to note:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>On the surface, you're trying to warn us about such people. But in actuality, you're sore that one of your classmates just screwed your grades up and you're looking for people who agree with your views about her. That alone makes me doubt your claim that you have high self-esteem.</li>
              <li>You said that your classmates made fun about your grandma's condition. Two possibilities: 1. your classmates are a bunch of 9 year-old kids, or 2. you have been ticking everyone in the class off. I believe that the former wouldn't be true with them being NUS students, though you may believe otherwise.</li>
              <li>"...<span style="color: #333333;">singing and acting cheerfully</span>" is not acting indifferently, but rather subserviently and hypocritically. If you are indifferent to her actions, you shut up and ignore her, but you did not do so simply because you were afraid of being perceived negatively by others. That shows that you're low in self-esteem and you have little, if any, friends in your class, which is why you're seeking affirmation from a bunch of strangers online.</li>
              </ol>
              <div>Suggestions:</div>
              <div><ol>
              <li>If you don't like her pestering you (I'm assuming you're not being oversensitive), tell her to get off your back in front of everyone. That should get the message across.</li>
              <li>If you've been pissing everyone off, be nice to them, and stop being a hypocrite.</li>
              </ol>

              <p>My answer:</p>
              <p>1. High self esteem is not to sit there like a rock and do nothing. I am an activist, I lobby for something. Are you saying that those people like Martin Luther King have no self esteem? We got to stand up for what is right and express ourselves.</p>
              <p>2. Your first answer is correct. They are behaving like a bunch of 9 year olds. Me? What did I do to them? There's this two idiots, I helped them throughout the whole assignments. I lead our group assignments and typed out the stuff for them. And what have they got to show their gratitude? None. I also took the initiative to attend open house organized by one of our classmates so i can get to know people better.</p>
              <p>3. Nope, I am not seeking affirmation. I do not need affirmation from a bunch of haopor losers. I vary my tactics between acting indifferently and acting cheerful to fool them nice nice. There is no way you can act indifferently when during group discussions, they purposely ignored my contributions and even deleted my portion in the assignment. You have to act out in action. Have you watched Adam Sandler's "Anger Management". Ok, granted that Adam Sandler was wrong to release his anger, I didn;t agree with the movie on that part. But one thing I agreed with the movie was that the Adam Sandler character was a quiet and petit person, so he allowed everyone to push him over without any expression or avenue of anger. Then one day, he accidentaly released his anger and got some people hurt and also got him into trouble. It was like a water dam holding all the rain water until it could no longer hold. Then it burst. That is the haopor tactic. They all know too well that our first natural reaction to repel them is to act indifferent. So, their tactic is to pair up with their koncos to provoke us continously. You cannot keep quiet on that. It will get to you whether you like it or not. So you got to find an avenue to release the rain water slowly. Laughing, singing and dancing is the way to do it. Only when I have blitzkerg my way to shutting down the haopor - then only I revert to acting indifferently. The Germans use blitzkery through mobile heavy armour to crush enemy defensive lines and race to the capital city, then infantry is used to surround existing pockets of resistence and destroy them.</p>
              <p>Your flawed suggestions:</p>
              <p>1. Telling her to get off your back is a suicidal strategy. Haopors want face, a lot of face. They got a lot of fall back strategy. First if you say this, you will fall into her trap. She would go on to lie that she already has a fake boyfriend. But wait, why is all the provocation haven't stopped? Second, she would get other haopors to cover her tracks and disturb you. Then you start looking ridiculous telling one by one to get off your back. Third, she would lie that she is not attracted to you and tell you that you misunderstood. Next day you get a lot of mocking and fun making from your classmates and then a few more haopors would come after you to cover your tracks.</p>
              <p>2. Their strategy is to piss you off and make you get into a haopor rage. How can you be nice to them when they are acting like jerks? Hello? Piss them off? More like the other way around. They are masters in fooling you to think that you did something wrong while you never did anything wrong. They will trick you into thinking that you did something wrong so that you are filled with guilt and then that is where the haopor will attack ! It is a big mistake to be a nice guy. Be a repelling and sensible guy.</p>

              <p>1. Please don't insult the activists by calling yourself as one of them. Activists don't come to online forums to rant and make petty arguments.</p>
              <p>2. You have been using derogatory terms to describe your classmates, so it's obvious how your attitude towards them is, hence don't expect them to treat you any better as well.</p>
              <p>3. If you're the group leader for the projects as you've mentioned, how could they get the chance to delete your contributions? Secondly, if you're not, are you sure what you've submitted would be truly beneficial to the group? I'm sure the group leaders have made the best decisions, considering that group project grades are shared among group members...unless you're really <em>that</em> detestable.</p>
              <p>Let me tell you how I see this whole thing. It's not about haopors, their strategies to screw you up and whatnots. It's just that you're getting picked on by the whole class. Why so? Let's just say that as someone who only have interacted with you via text alone, I dislike you, so I can imagine that I will burst out in rage if I have to meet you in person for 5 days a week. Of course, I may be biased, but only because I'm taking what you wrote with a pinch of salt until the other side of the story is offered.</p>
              <p>Maybe you should start reflecting upon yourself instead of trying to put the blame on others.</p>

              <p>1. Please don't insult the activists by calling yourself as one of them. Activists don't come to online forums to rant and make petty arguments.</p>
              <p>2. You have been using derogatory terms to describe your classmates, so it's obvious how your attitude towards them is, hence don't expect them to treat you any better as well.</p>
              <p>3. If you're the group leader for the projects as you've mentioned, how could they get the chance to delete your contributions? Secondly, if you're not, are you sure what you've submitted would be truly beneficial to the group? I'm sure the group leaders have made the best decisions, considering that group project grades are shared among group members...unless you're really <em>that</em> detestable.</p>
              <p>Let me tell you how I see this whole thing. It's not about haopors, their strategies to screw you up and whatnots. It's just that you're getting picked on by the whole class. Why so? Let's just say that as someone who only have interacted with you via text alone, I dislike you, so I can imagine that I will burst out in rage if I have to meet you in person for 5 days a week. Of course, I may be biased, but only because I'm taking what you wrote with a pinch of salt until the other side of the story is offered.</p>
              <p>Maybe you should start reflecting upon yourself instead of trying to put the blame on others.</p>

              <p><br>Answer to your replies:</p>
              <p>1. Why not? Everyone is an activist. I read a forum here about a guy who can't stand his neigbour stomping on the top floor of his HBD, he is ranting about it - obviously he is activising. Do we need a certificate, a government approval or a license to be an activist? Do we need to be a member of an association or a union to be an activist? No. One thing is for sure - you are very naive.</p>
              <p>2. Doesn't mean I am using derogatory remarks, I show it in front of them. Its being smart while actively reminding yourself about their not very good intentions. Have you heard about what Hitler did to the jews, poles, artistic people and romas during the holocaust? Hitler did such cruel acts and yet till today he is still worshiped by Nazis and White Supremacist. What about Saddam Hussein? Even after exposing his cruel lobotomy of the Kurds in Halabja - he is still widely respected among the Sunni community. Life is not cause and effect, my friend. It doesn't mean just because somebody treats you well, you treat them back the same way. Also, sometimes, people who are cruel are widely respected, worshiped and supported.</p>
              <p>3. Yes you assume again. Again you are extremely naive. I have contributed some of my ideas, but the leader obviously took my idea and turned it into his ideas. He was obviously trying to play the haopor game at me by trying to isolate me and make me frustrated so I can concentrate on the haopor. But I smart, I didn't and he couldn't make me even though that idiotic construction guy tried to say all sorts of degrading things at me. In the end, it only reflected how low a person he was and is.</p>
              <p>You dislike me? Ho ho, I feel your pain. But I think the pain's more on your side. You haven';t met me and just by reading this you dislike me? Hah, I will continue my activism. To me, it is such a tragedy that you don't get to know such a good guy like me. For your information, I am a really great person, I am not going to say much but I do get involve in a lot of social community whereby i help the socially poor. It is your loss. Too bad, I could have taught you a lot of things about life. Once you get to know me better, I am very sure you would like a person like me. But too bad, you are quick to judge without thinking or analysing. Again naietivity on your part.</p>
              <p>Of course I get picked lah, it is natural among people that they like to play haopor games because its entertaining to them. But today, I got to proof to them that I am not naive and I got the better of them by rejecting the haopor and showing my dexterity and commitment to the project. Its a good thing that the semester is about to end. We've only got one seminar left and then the rest is history.</p>

              <p><br>You don't get my point do you?</p>
              <p>Are they difficult people? No. They are trying to implement the haopor game on me. Don't you understand? I have done whatever a normal person can do. Attend their boring lunches, listening to that construction guy bragging, contributing to the project, etc. What possible thing could I do to change myself?</p>
              <p>You see, the thing I hate about our society is the tendency to blame yourself for whatever happens. So the earthquake in haiti killed thousands of people, is it anyone's fault? Of course not ! Why is it that whenever anything bad happens, everyone tends to blame themselve?</p>
              <p>Yes, I am changing myself but not to the haopor's whims and fancies. I am not going to fall into their trap of manipulation. I won't change for the sake of the haopor. During one of the lunches, that indian construction guy was trying to ridicule my outlook by saying that I wore old shoes and I used my cellphone as a watch. He then proceeded to show off his golden ring, his expensive Rolex and his Blackberry and bragged about his Lexus. He told me that I should change my outlook. For obvious reasons, he was trying to trick me into buying expensive things to impress the haopor. But I wasn't dumb to fall into his trickery. This kind of haopor not worth a cent of my money. Sheis not genuine, only want sugar dadies to pour $$$ at her.</p>
              <p>For me, I improve myself on MY OWN TERMS. Yes, I volunteer the homeless shelter, I even go to Johor to do social work and I am mentor for school kids. I took up this degree because I wanted to improve myself. I am already doing it. So thanks for your advice but it is long expired because I know what I am doing.</p>

              <p><br>You are not being impartial. Your comments are clouded by your wrong first impression of the person. If you disagree, say so. However, you are resorting to personal attacks such as expressing your resentment of the person and not the person's expressions in the threads.</p>
              <p>Let me give you an example. In my office, there was this influential manager who was cheating the company out of pocket claims or reimbursements. Everyone liked him because he was good with his diplomatic skills. He was especially good with the ladies in the office. A whistleblower came up and reported this manager, the manager was forced to tender his resignation. Company didn't want to pursue a CBT because they didn't want news of their manager spending out of pocket claims from the customers out of control. So case close. On the other hand, the whistleblower was reviled and hated in the office. Because he took away other people's illegitimate ways of making extra pocket money and he caused the removal of a hated manager. Yet, he was strong and he "believed in himself" and he stood on even when he was often boycotted for lunches and some staff didn't want to cooperate with him. 3 years later, he got promoted. Yes - "Being Blind and Deaf" to others is sometimes the right thing to do.</p>
              <p>It does not mean that just because the majority are doing that - it is the right thing to do. Yes, he sounds a bit egoistical but he is standing up for himself. Perhaps he should look at things on a lighter note but it is no cause for you to dislike him. Forums are for people to give feedback not offer their personal opnion of that person.  </p>

              <p>2. In short, you're being a hypocrite. And I fear for the organization that you do social community work for if you're someone who actually worships Hitler and Hussein.</p>

              <p>1. Yes for my own sake I will continue to activist. Angelina Jolie is 34 and she is only a popular actress. After going through a tumultous divorce with Billy Bob Thronton and dubbed by the media as "wierd" because she wore vials of blood of BBT, Angelina Jolie went through a smooth transformation to be a UN ambassador for peace. Since then she has activist for peace and humanitarian efforts. You don't need to be a Nobel Prize winner to be an activist.</p>
              <p>2. There you go again. Taking poke shots at other people. I think you're the bigger hypocrite, you don't even know me and you start hurling stones. And yet another desperate attempt to move me into anger by connecting my good faith work to help the socially poor and less fortunate to dictatorial bigots such as Hitler. I laugh at your attempt to insult me - almost childlike and immature indeed.</p>
              <p>For you information - I have helped raised thousands of dollars for the poor through telethon and going shop to shop asking for donations. I have personally gone to the old folks home - clean the drainage and repainted  their home. I also been to Cambodia to do some work to help the poor. Good deeds that are way way higher to the social garbage of Hitler.</p>
              <p>3. Again your exposure to the real world is really naive. Your method to implement your troubles is to spot the blame on yourself. You believe if somebody is bad to you or somebody is "acting" bad at you - you think it is a cause and effect relationship.</p>
              <p>I can very assure you all this is not imagination. If you continue to blame yourself, your self esteem would suffer. I am by no means not imagining at all, all this is real. People do play politics and it is up to me to make the best of my situation. I chose to reject the haopor and it is the right decision to make. Of course, the haopor is pissed because she lost her face. Do you expect her not to do anything back at you?</p>
              <p>I did the right thing. Let me teach you something. You always need a framework as a starting point to analyse the people, the environment around you, the politics and people's intention.</p>
              <p>Your first impression is to blame people on their imagination. Its a real pity that you got such shallow sense making approach. I bet that if a car run you over - you wouldn't even know that you are in a hospital.</p>

              <p><br> You are not being impartial. Your comments are clouded by your
              wrong first impression of the person. If you disagree, say so.
              However, you are resorting to personal attacks such as expressing
              your resentment of the person and not the person's expressions in
              the threads.</p>
              <p>Let me give you an example. In my office, there was this
              influential manager who was cheating the company out of pocket
              claims or reimbursements. Everyone liked him because he was good
              with his diplomatic skills. He was especially good with the ladies
              in the office. A whistleblower came up and reported this
              manager, the manager was forced to tender his resignation.
              Company didn't want to pursue a CBT because they didn't
              want news of their manager spending out of pocket claims from
              the customers out of control. So case close. On the other
              hand, the whistleblower was reviled and hated in the office.
              Because he took away other people's illegitimate ways of
              making extra pocket money and he caused the removal of a
              hated manager. Yet, he was strong and he "believed in
              himself" and he stood on even when he was often boycotted for
              lunches and some staff didn't want to cooperate with him. 3
              years later, he got promoted. Yes - "Being Blind and Deaf" to
              others is sometimes the right thing to do.</p>
              <p>It does not mean that just because the majority are
              doing that - it is the right thing to do. Yes, he
              sounds a bit egoistical but he is standing up for himself.
              Perhaps he should look at things on a lighter note but it is
              no cause for you to dislike him. Forums are for people
              to give feedback not offer their personal opnion of that
              person.  </p>

              <p>Who are you to determine whether my impression of him is right or wrong? I'm simply using the fact that I dislike him through this conversation alone to show him the possibility that he could have done something (or many things) in class which pissed everyone off and he himself is not aware of, and hence resulting in the way they're treating him right now. Yet all he did was to went on and on about how everyone is trying to tear him up for his or her own entertainment, as if every human on the planet is a sadist.</p>
              <p>As for the whistle blower story, the way you're trying to link his promotion to him ignoring the treatment of his colleagues is flawed. He could simply be hardworking and efficient at work, and still be promoted within the same amount of time even if he did not blow the whistle on his manager.</p>
              <p>And yes, I agree with the fact that the majority is not <em>always</em> right. But don't you think the majority is right most of the time? </p>

              <p>Sorry if I sound like I am trying to promote Mr Tan but I caught some things he said that exuberate good self confidence and positive thinking. But the trouble is, he sounds a bit egoistical. I am not sure if he really is. Look, that person really suffered a lot of abuse in the office. He really felt like resigning but he felt he had a statement to make and something to prove himself to. It was not until the company was bought over by a multinational that few of his troublemakers left the company due to work conflict.</p>
              <p>Majority is not always right most of the time. Haven't you heard of minority shareholder rights? If majority is right all the time then there is no point for the SGX to implement rules to protect minority shareholders from the onslaught of dominant shareholders.</p>

              <p>2. So acting nice in front of them while calling them sluts elsewhere is not being a hypocrite? Wow, tell me, which dictionary were you referring to for the word "hypocrite"? Oh, as for the Hitler and Hussein example, guess who said this:</p>
              <p>"<span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 14px; color: #333333;">Have you heard about what Hitler did to the jews, poles, artistic people and romas during the holocaust? Hitler did such cruel acts and yet till today he is still worshiped by Nazis and White Supremacist. What about Saddam Hussein? Even after exposing his cruel lobotomy of the Kurds in Halabja - he is still widely respected among the Sunni community. Life is not cause and effect, my friend. It doesn't mean just because somebody treats you well, you treat them back the same way. Also, sometimes, people who are cruel are widely respected, worshiped and supported.<span style="color: #000000; line-height: 20px; font-size: 16px;">"</span></span></p>
              <p>Someone who believes that people who are cruel are actually respected and worshipped couldn't be any good himself, don't you think so?</p>
              <p>3. Let's say your assumption is true for a moment. Everyone arounds you is a monster playing politics and ultimately wants to screw your life up. Now, your class consists of dozens of people, ask yourself why did they just pick on you. There's gotta be a reason to it, yea?</p>
              <p>I understand that for each of many things happening to and around us, sometimes we aren't the cause of it. But you know, sometimes it is. Instead of imagining you're living in a world of monsters, why not just spend some time alone and think about what you've did to see if you really did any wrong?</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 24px;">And yes, I agree with the fact that the majority is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not </span><em style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span></em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> right</span>. But don't you think the majority is right most of the time? </span></p>
              <p>Oh yes, "<span style="color: #333333;">Majority is not</span> <span style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 15px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">always</span></span> <span style="color: #333333;">right</span> <span style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 15px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">most of the time</span></span>" sounds paradoxical. You may want to fix that.</p>

              <p>Well, whatever, its been nice knowing you.</p>
              <p>You are saying that majority is right most of the time. That's exactly what I am saying "Majority is not right most of the time". Simple as that.  </p>
              <p>I realise that you are a person who easily gets offended and you start berating other people when you are unhappy when people don't agree with you. You ought to douse your anger. Please don't be negative and have a bit more self confidence. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Of course! If people don't agree with me, I want to know why. But no, I'm not unhappy, but rather curious in the way how different people think. This is what understanding each other is all about, isn't it?</p>
