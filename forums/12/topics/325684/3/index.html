              <p><strong>"I did mention about the 'block number' calling thing to him; but
              he dismissed it as his family's just pulling my legs. But, pulling
              my legs for so long?</strong>"</p>
              <p>There, you realize it yourself. There is no way his family will joke about this kinda thing for so long if they respect you. And someone who respect you will stop joking about it the moment they realize you are not happy about it.</p>
              <p><strong>"A friend told me to hang on to the first attraction which
              attracted him to me; it was his friendliness and simplicity in
              life.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>But, do these two points supercede all that he had done?"</strong></p>
              <p>No, they do not. You can find other guys out there who are friendly and simple MINUS the bad points that he has.</p>
              <p><strong>"Yes, my mum did told me to let go when it's still early; but
              ultimately, do I have the courage?"</strong></p>
              <p>Yes, you do. You just need to find it within you. Try not to think too far into what is going to happen after you have broken up with him. Let nature take its own course. Do not stay with him just because you do not have the courage to let go otherwise you will regret it even more later. You have already had one regret, do you want to end up with more down the road?</p>
              <p><strong>"When his old flame text him at 3am, he felt he was 'needed', he
              needs to go down the next day and see her immediately. It's fine,
              maybe she really needs a company."</strong></p>
              <p>This is really the last straw. I don't think I can even be so generous as to let my boyfriend, let alone fiance, do this kinda thing to me. It proves to you how little he holds you in regard to his old flame.</p>
              <p>I think deep inside, you know you will be happier without him. You just need to find the courage to take the first step towards a happier future. Maybe it is because youhave been with him for so long so it is hard to break that habit. But you know you have to do it otherwise you are in for a lifetime of suffering. He has done this for the past 4 years, so you know he will not change in the future.</p>

              <p>Besides, guys, do you mind if ur gf start spending on facial

              <p>But once I started working and juggling between my studies and
              work, I started to get facial stuff to reduce the puffy eyes.

              that I have changed because I buy facial products more frequent
              now. He said the me four years ago wasn't like that; said I am
              spending a lot on facial stuff now.</p>
              <p>Ermm~~ between 50 to 100 bucks a month is alot??</p>

              <p>Simply tell him he is not your mother, and you are an adult, you can spend on whatever you like.</p>
              <p>Plus you are the one earning the money, he is not even your husband yet, how can he control the way you spend your money?</p>
              <p>Be assertive and show him that you are not scared of him...and don't be scared when you did nothing wrong!</p>

              Hey shuibianni05,
              
              Sounds like the problem I had a couple years back.
              
              Except we were together for 8 years. 
              
              You sound unhappy, and the guy is still clueless. Talking to him doesn't help, so you get to go into the downward spiral in the relationship. My downward spiral lasted for 4 years. The worst 4 years of your life. 
              
              I know the situation, you are sad/disappointed/angry with him, then you forget about it, then he does something to make you sad/disappointed/angry again, just a viscous cycle. Each time you feel more and more hurt.
              
              The end finally came when I just couldn't take it anymore. So when she said let's break up (for the 10,000th time), I said ok, and I've never talked to her since.
              
              In your heart, you know if the situation is going to improve, and you know if you can continue to take this situation for the rest of your life. No one knows this answer but yourself. With the answer you have, you'll just have to do what you have to do. If it is to break up, then just do it. No but, no if, no maybe. If not you might just suffer needlessly for another 4 years like me.
              
              Good luck

              <p>Thanks all~~ Though I have spoeken out how I been feeling, but courage is another issue to overcome.</p>
              <p>Besides, guys, do you mind if ur gf start spending on facial products? Not those expensive ones, just simple ones.</p>
              <p>When we first got together, I was not a everyday user of facial stuff.</p>
              <p>But once I started working and juggling between my studies and work, I started to get facial stuff to reduce the puffy eyes. Whenever we start on the topic of his behaviour, he will insist that I have changed because I buy facial products more frequent now. He said the me four years ago wasn't like that; said I am spending a lot on facial stuff now.</p>
              <p>Ermm~~ between 50 to 100 bucks a month is alot??</p>

              <p>Dump the guy - Stop the vicious cycle of emotional abuse. If he does not respect you when you're his gf, what makes you think he will hesitate to use physical abuse on you when the both of you are married?</p>
              <p>There are much better choices out there. Like the saying goes, good women no need scared no guys go after. You should not submit yourself in a life of servitude (endless errands, nonsensetical ones included) and abuse (threatening to break up countless times) and he obviously will NOT be a good father (super obvious and disgusting biasness - your niece vs his brother).</p>

              <p>Hold on? your reply to the TS really surprises me. The actions of TS's boyfriend borders on psychotic possesiveness, from attempting to control her STUDIES (stop TS from going to US, waste her time even though she has exams), to FRIENDS (feel threatened by other suitors, her guy friends, etc), her TIME (do all kind of errands), MONEY (facial products also want to control spending), FAMILY (does not visit her family, obviously no respect for her parents), her SAFETY (dont bother to send her home late at night). What other aspect of her life do you want him to control?</p>
              <p>And you advocate HOLDING ON?</p>

              <p>May I ask in what way does lack of security in a relationship correspond directly to 'relationship stalling', or in the first place, exactly what is a relationship stall? Similarly, your statement about emotional balance as opposed to her conscience being guilty does not make sense at all; so does your statement about lowering down her love towards him. Your reply is incoherent and illogical. Your language skills leaves much to be desired, and your advice in effect advocates male chauvanism as well as whole and complete posession of a partner emotionally and psychologically in a relationship, clearly demarcating a master and slave anological relationship whereby one party is inherently superior while the other party is incessantly inferior. </p>

              <p>Shuibianni,</p>
              <p> Your bf shows no respect to you, and neither does his family members.</p>
              <p> Are you sure you want to marry him ? Marrying him won't make the problems go away. He and his family is not going to treat you better after you marry him.</p>
              <p>Now he thinks you won't leave him.. that's why he takes you for granted.. after you are locked in a marriage with him.. it will only get worst.</p>
              <p>Never marry a guy if you have doubts. Listen and trust your woman's instinct.</p>
              <p> Your bf .. is also emotionally abusing you.</p>
              <p> Why are you so afraid of leaving him ?</p>
              <p>Are you so unattractive.. you don't think a better man will fall in love with you ?</p>
              <p> You lack self-esteem.. that's why you are still chained to this relationship.</p>
              <p> You've survived before you met him. You ain't gonna die after he's gone.</p>
              <p> Have some confidence in yourself girl.</p>
              <p> If you are just afraid of the loneliness after the breakup.. get yourself a rebound guy.</p>

              <p>Next time when he threatens you again, walk way, do not relent and give in to him again he is not worth the effort. You as his girlfriend should be given the respect and love you deserve. If he can emotionally blackmail you now whilst still in the "courting" stage, i can't imagine what will happen when both of you are married. I think he may turn out to be 1 of those abusive husbands.</p>
              <p>He has no right to stop you from buying anything as you are using your own money and not his. Why is he stopping you from looking good. Could it be that he thinks if you being as unattractive as possible will reduce your number of suitors and there will be less chances of you leaving him for another guy?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you take a walk in gardens/parks and you see those old couples who are still loving towards each other and holding each other's hands while walking, can you picture youself and him in that scenerio in future? Meaning do you think both of u can bai tou dao lao?</p>
