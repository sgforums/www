              <p>Agree with White and Brutus. Don't want to sound rude but i think he is a loser.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who won't talk his girlfriend home when she reaches home at 4am? Even if it is not a girlfriend, i'm sure most guys will send their female friends to at least the lift because they go off home at that ungodly hour.</p>
              <p>If he loves you, he would have told his family to calling you by your block number and instead your name. Love and Respect goes hand in hand. You can't bring yourself to like someone whom you don't respect much less love.</p>
              <p>Kids are still young and should be indulged once in awhile. Even if he doesn't want to buy the toy, he could have put it in a more diplomatic way or divert the child by saying let's get ice cream or something.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He definitely is a special case. 1 in a billion i might add.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Agree with Yan about the ditching part too</p>

              <p>You don't have to immediately step into another relationship if you decide to end your current 1. Enjoy your freedom and get to know more people 1st.</p>

              <p>Later on if there are guys who like you, give them and yourself a chance. Don't give up on the forest because of 1 rotting tree. I'm sure there will be nice guys out there who like you too.</p>

              <p>The only sane thing to do now is to get out of your comfort zone and leave him; take it as a failed investment, cut your losses and gain a new wisdom.

              <p>You gave in too much to him. That's why he is asking for more and more because he knows that you will never let him go. You have simply tolerated too much.</p>
              <p>What's the point of hanging on to someone when you are feeling insecure? Look at how many times he has promised you something and nothing has happened. A real man stands by his words and show you the action.</p>
              <p>Sorry to say but talk is cheap, gal.</p>
              <p>And regarding the almost rape issue by your friend, I understand how you felt. I was in that kinda situation once and no, we are not to be blamed, regardless of what we wear, etc. Don't let your fiance bully you into thinking otherwise.</p>
              <p>You have given up so much for him but what do you get in return? As yourself, are you truly happy with your current relationship or are you just "settling" for him because you have both been together for a long time? If it is the latter, better break up rather than drag it on and on because the longer it takes, the harder it is to make that decision.</p>

              <p>Wa his family called you the block number you live in and he never said anything? If anyone dares to do that to me I would have slapped their mouth. Lolz.</p>
              <p>It is total disrespect. Not only he is not respecting you, his whole family sees you as a joke as well. Otherwise they wouldn't have called you that and he wouldn't have allowed it to happen at all.</p>
              <p>So wake up and break up with him. I don't think you will have much problem finding someone much better than him, given the low standard he is setting here (no offense).</p>

              <p>hey..this is my opinion</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He is taking you for granted. The 'lets break up' is use oftenly as he knows u wont break up with him or you would take him back.</p>
              <p>Ask youself, do you love him or are you jus treating him as someone u need to 'babysit'?</p>
              <p>My advice - move on. Everyone deserves the best in terms of love and relationship. he aint giving you the best.</p>
              <p>Good luck - J</p>

              <p>I did mention about the 'block number' calling thing to him; but he dismissed it as his family's just pulling my legs. But, pulling my legs for so long?</p>
              <p>I was seldom addressed by my actual name; mostly block number or 'that person'.</p>
              <p>I don't really have a high expectation of bf; as long as he dote, love, care and concern and protect; it's more than enough. Or am I asking for too much?</p>
              <p>A friend told me to hang on to the first attraction which attracted him to me; it was his friendliness and simplicity in life.</p>
              <p>But, do these two points supercede all that he had done?</p>
              <p>*confused* *dilemna*</p>
              <p>Actually, to make myself not to think too much, I have filled up everyday of the week with activities; work, studies, volunteer and freelancing.</p>
              <p>A few of my friends understand and are willing to meet me at odd hours for a coffee or jus some shopping.</p>
              <p>Yes, my mum did told me to let go when it's still early; but ultimately, do I have the courage?</p>
              <p>When his old flame text him at 3am, he felt he was 'needed', he needs to go down the next day and see her immediately. It's fine, maybe she really needs a company.</p>
              <p>But, to the extent of forgetting I am in hospital? I was admitted the night his old flame text him; I told him my ward and bed no, he said he would pop by tomorrow. He remembered only after he had met his old flame and had a good night's sleep.</p>

              <p>i feel he is a very selfish person. and i have a feeling his family is the arrogant type.</p>
              <p>it's basic manners to address a person by his/her name and by referring you as a number or 'that person' is just plain rude.</p>
              <p>if you marry into his family, you might be bullied.</p>
              <p>every person deserves to be love and doted on, if he can't do that, he don't deserve you.</p>

              <p>Thanks all~~ Though I have spoeken out how I been feeling, but courage is another issue to overcome.</p>
              <p>Besides, guys, do you mind if ur gf start spending on facial products? Not those expensive ones, just simple ones.</p>
              <p>When we first got together, I was not a everyday user of facial stuff.</p>
              <p>But once I started working and juggling between my studies and work, I started to get facial stuff to reduce the puffy eyes. Whenever we start on the topic of his behaviour, he will insist that I have changed because I buy facial products more frequent now. He said the me four years ago wasn't like that; said I am spending a lot on facial stuff now.</p>
              <p>Ermm~~ between 50 to 100 bucks a month is alot??</p>
