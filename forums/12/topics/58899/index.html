Don't you agree?</div></blockquote>Gonna answer this in summary form:<br><br>Just in case you din realise, it has <strong>ALWAYS BEEN THERE</strong>. Rise of people going pubs and seeking for ONS? Its has ALWAYS BEEN THERE. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Abandon marriage? That's insanely stupid. What you see is only half the glass; the idealogy of true love will ultimately lead into marriage, which will be the classic case of 'once there, forever will be'.<br><br>The theory of sex and nature works close to one another, while the theory of love and spirit is another altogether. Man by nature is born to mate and provide, while woman is to nuture. Man are 'taught' by nuture to spread its seeds around, to propagate and ensure humanity continues, while woman are 'taught' to cater and nuture the young, also to ensure the young ones survive and humanity continues. By nature you fark, by spirit you make love. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Example: Man patron bar. Man attracted physically or sexually to any woman, man wants to screw her. (literally - spread the seeds theory). Woman on the other hand, resist because woman has more to invest (nuture nature). - This is provided external factor is not considered to overweigh on both side. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Love is spiritual. Probably only human could attain such level in emotions. Marriage is the acknowledgement of your love blossoming into something. NOW, marriage has merely became a certificate. Physical evidence of superficial love - shotgun marriage, or for any physical &amp; measurable reasons (Wealth, financial and probably career stability). This is the nature side of love. Spiritual love needs no such conditions. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Human's mind affects this as well: Psychological needs (Status, looks, 'feel', etc) conjunct with morals, values (Responsibility, religion teachings, etc). The spiritual side: Cosmic lesson &amp; karma. In a nutshell of 100% - all these factors contribute into the person's attitude towards relationship. (Subjective and differ from people to people)<br><br>All these affects one's fate in any love relationship. If people wants to screw around, Physics Law states that there will be an equal opposite force (check out people who cheat on their marriage, do you think they are truely happy?). Love cosmic lesson stated that one comes into this world to learn something, repayin or collecting -if it must involve sexuality - it will. (Check out the chance of you marriaging your first love and happy-ever after is like how fringin` impossible in today's context?) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: I type a whole list of sh|t, however I think its far too nagging. Anyway, marriage will and should never be abolish  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>People tend to beautify marriage eg. the happily everlasting  Cinderalla story - which is just a fiction.

In reality, people of this era feels that marriage isn't a forever thing. Under theory of Love Law nine - Marriage is not forever. Sad to say, but its true. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Broken marriage and adultery can be minimise and if it happens, it's truly one (or more) criticial stage that one have to go through before reaching to the next phrase of your relationship destiny. If one has to undergo divorce before ending in his/her next marriage where he/she will realise the partner he/she really wants to spend the rest of the life with - in this case, divorce can be a loving thing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>However, majority of people ended up in marriage due to incorrect timing which constitute to the lack of maturity. Environmental factors creeps in and its difficult to avoid marriage, together with the cosmic lesson you ought to learn, one can never predict the trend that is coming for you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The thing about love is that nobody except yourself can enlighten your personal views, attitude and preception about love.<br><br>I am debating towards your views about loveless marriage, which is the current trend, yet its doesn't speaks about the whole picture of marriage generally. There are millions of loving couples out there, just that when it comes to the negative side of love, the tendency to exaggerate is there.<br><br>What makes you think that marriage hasn't done any good for the society?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Like I had said, sex trades existed thousands of years ago -Nobody is surprise nor is this anything new.<br><br>Cheers</div>
