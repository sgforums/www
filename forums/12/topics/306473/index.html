              You want subsidized psych help? Okay, if you are a tax-paying member of the Singapore community, you can approached polyclinic for specialist reccomendation.

              <p>I'm sorry to hear of your problem. Mental illness can be caused by a chemical imbalance in your body which will require you to be on medication for the rest of your life. In which case, no amount of counselling can help.</p>

              <p>I developed excema about 6 years ago and the doctor at the skin clinic basically told me I'd have to live with it. After reading about Food Intolerance, I tried cutting out some food groups out of my diet over time and one food I've identified is tomatoe. I've been off tomatoes for about a week now and so far the open sores I used to get periodically on my neck which I thought were razor burns on my senstive skin has cleared up without medication.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying it will work for you but you may wish to give keeping a food diary and monitoring your symptoms a try to see if it is food/diet related.</p>

              I really wonder if phil30k is intending to help or just trying to increase his post number count via offering nonsense information? First, if the problem is dietary, then a battery of blood tests are needed to procure the real underlying reason/s. Eczema is a skin condition that can have a number of reasons and a dermatologist is talking nonsense if he or she says phil30k is going to live with it.(Of course, there are risks involved in the treatment.) Secondary, psychiatrical problems can be genetic or hormonal, so please pop by a GP and ask for his or her opinion. If you are not satisfied, go to another polyclinic and ask for another GP.

              <p>Nope not nonsense information. It was the national skin centre and I was disappointed when they gave up. Three different doctors examined me. I thought of all people, they would have the solution. But when I researched it on the internet, I found that it is a real problem with little information on cures. Basically if steroids don't work, modern medicine provides you with no other option.</p>
              <p>I have been living with the condition and would use antiseptic wipes and antiseptic moisturing creams whenever it occurred and the condition would still last for a couple of weeks or so at a time. I would develop weeping sores around my mouth and neck as well that dried into very unattractive hardened crusts.</p>
              <p>I developed it really badly during one reservist stint and the doctor thought I was suffering from AIDS. He actually asked me in front of others if I was suffering from AIDS and asked me to go for an AIDS test. So you can see how bad it must have looked. I couldn't complete and had to come back later in the year to redo my reservist.</p>
              <p>I had to carry wet antiseptic wipes with me and constantly clean the areas, even while on the MRT, while people watched me nervously. Mothers would pull their children away who sat next to me on the MRT. That was depressing.</p>
              <p>So yes, I take this very seriously and I'm not posting for fun.</p>
              <p>And no, a battery of blood tests don't work. Food intolerance blood tests are not the same as for Food allergies and have a high false positive results. The best way is still to keep a record of what you eat and controlling your diet to try to identify foods.</p>
              <p>I appreciate your skepticism and like I said it may not be the answer for him but examining and changing my diet worked for me and I'm sharing it with him.</p>

              well that dried into very unattractive hardened crusts.</p>
              <p>I developed it really badly during one reservist stint and the
              doctor thought I was suffering from AIDS. He actually asked me in
              front of others if I was suffering from AIDS and asked me to
              go for an AIDS test. So you can see how bad it must have looked. I
              couldn't complete and had to come back later in the year to redo my
              reservist.</p>
              <p>I had to carry wet antiseptic wipes with me and constantly clean
              the areas, even while on the MRT, while people watched me
              nervously. Mothers would pull their children away who sat next to
              me on the MRT. That was depressing.</p>
              <p>So yes, I take this very seriously and I'm not posting for
              fun.</p>
              <p>And no, a battery of blood tests don't work. Food intolerance
              blood tests are not the same as for Food allergies and have a high
              false positive results. The best way is still to keep a record of
              what you eat and controlling your diet to try to identify
              foods.</p>
              <p>I appreciate your skepticism and like I said it may not be the
              answer for him but examining and changing my diet worked for
              me and I'm sharing it with him.</p>

              <p><br>It sounds like you're suffering from depression brought about by stress. That's not the same as being mentally unstable. There is medication for that. It won't make your problems go away but will put you in a better frame of mind to deal with them. You should go see your GP for an accurate diagnosis.</p>
              <p>They may initially prescribe something to help you sleep because sleep is a big factor in allowing your body and mind to heal itself. If there is no improvement they may direct you to a specialist who can examine you and decide if you need other types of medication.</p>
              <p>I'd advise you not to wait. The feeling of hopelessness / helplessness may get better on it's own but it's better to get help sooner then later. You can develop other illnesses from lack of sleep or a poor diet that may complicate the treatment.</p>

              <p><br>Yes I think sephiroth should see a doctor.</p>
              <p>Yes they took me off steroids because I wasn't responding to the treatment.</p>
              <p>Actually the diet change wasn't drastic. There's a list of foods that people are commonly intolerant of. Eggs, tomatoes, dairy, legumes, yeast etc. You cut one of them out of your diet for a week (not a drastic change) and monitor if there are changes in your condition. However some intolerances are commonly associated with some symptoms. Dairy with stomach conditions, Yeast with bloatedness etc. So you get an idea of what to try cutting out first.</p>
              <p>I went though dairy then tomatoes because those were associated with skin conditions and stopped with tomatoes because I saw an improvement. Tomatoes also are differentiated between cooked and raw tomatoes but I'm going to continue keeping it out of my diet for another couple of weeks to see if there is a recurrence before taking that step. They also believe that the effects stack so a small amount may not provoke symptoms but a combination may.</p>
              <p>For me, my specific tomatoe food intolerance may be shared between tobacco, eggplant and potatoes but I haven't cut those out yet. I hardly ever eat eggplant and potatoes anyway but I love tomatoes and used to eat them all the time. I'm going to stop smoking over the chinese new year also to see if that helps. (dam! why did it have to be tobacco!!)</p>
              <p>I also found out that dairy makes me burp and fart a lot, but I can live with that. I used to have cornflakes with milk for breakfast on some days and did not make the connection to the discomfort later in the day. I just thought of it as "good" days and "bad" days. I have much more comfortable office meetings now that I know not to put milk in my coffee at meetings. I seriously hadn't realized before how much of a difference diet makes.</p>
