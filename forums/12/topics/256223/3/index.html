She's helpful in the sense that she'll help her frens, brother who are not very good in their studies whenever they have problems. A typical kind and responsible model student. And she's the kind of goody two shoes girl that mums will like bah.. That's y she attracts alot of pple, guys, girls and every1 juz want to befriend her. Considering she's quite pretty, a lot of guys will somehow wanna woo her as well..<br>However, it seems to me that those pple closer to her will get the not so good things abt her... At times, she's kinda emo, bad tempered and she's very frank, wun spare a thot for others b4 she do or say things. Not picking up calls, not replying smses, and slamming down phone are the things may do if she's emo.. Luckily, i didnt get the slamming down phone part, only her best fren experienced before =S Compromise for others is not something she will do, and breaking promises is the latest thing i discovered abt her.. I strongly believe in jun zi yi yan, si ma nan zui.. but she's a girl, so dun apply to her ba.. But all in all, it's juz her...<br><br>Has my life become a standstill when i meet her??<br>definitely not.. there are so many things i'm occupied with.. in the past, work, sch work, frens, family is not smth i will be stressful abt, i'm confident i can handle all this things well... But when it comes to r/s issues, i'm quite helpless though... maybe as a single child, it's the kind of emptiness one will experience.. it's not that i dun hv loving parents, or buddies but i kinda put a higher importance in r/s. I have this thinking, maybe u'll find tt i'm stupid, no matter how well ur parents or buddies treat me, i'm very appreciative of wad they've done for me over all the years and i do repay their love and concern for me, but they're not the ones who's going to live with u for the nx half of ur life till ur deathbed.. maybe it's that i'm too demanding on wad i expect from my gf.. but i realised now that having too high hopes will only result in disappointment as no one is obliged to do wad u wish they would do.<br><br>What else she can respect or admire abt me?<br>i duno wad other good points i have but i strongly believe that i'll treat my other half truthfully, fooling around is not something i'll do.. well, i rly duno wad's good abt me.. i'm not rich, no car, avg looks, stubborn nature and kinda overly dependent on her sometimes.. the only thing i can give her now is my heart..</div></blockquote>From the above statement only shows the follow things<br><br>1) You like her cos she is pretty.<br><br>2) You said she is not your first but how many exs do you have before?<br><br>3) You can give her your heart but does she care or needs your heart?<br><br>4) goody two shoes girl ? Have you seen a goody two shoes girl treat their bf like this?<br><br>5) You are just a fling to her thats all. How do we know ?<br><br>a) Has she done anything big for you?<br><br>b) Has she told her parents that she wants to be with you no matter what?<br><br>c) Are you paying for all her expenses?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Brother Clueless,<br><br>I experienced somewhat simliar situation as you when i was young. SMS her to finding out the reason for breakoff and ignoring my msg. I chose to let go,<br><br>Dun waste your time on immature girls if she is not ready for relationship, and she may not be your type. Just move on, and you will get a better one.<br><br>In midst of finding a new one, go and upgrade urself and develop your own personal character. Find one day meet up with her and tell her abt your personal achievement. Even though she is not yours nw, make her regret. Jus too bad tat she had MISSED you. BEST you had a gf, jus tell her or show her that wat she is missing... HAHA..<br><br>Its hard to forget a relationship, when you once love her. As an old saying, " if you love her just let her go ba" no point persist if the other side is nothing willing to.. GOod luck for your future!</div>

Just not this portion.<br><br>Such is childish behaviour.<br><br>What happens if she achieved more than you. What happens if she has a better partner than you.
