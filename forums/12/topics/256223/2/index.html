You have to ask yourself whether the juice is worth the squeeze after making an assessment.<br><br>Besides, you cannot make an accurate assessment of a person over a few months.<br><br>So donÂ’t be too eager to answer that question.<br><br>All I want you to realize is that you cannot blindly invest your time and effort without jumping out from your infatuation mode.<br><br>Make the assessment from time to time. The process takes time. People change.<br><br>We should be talking about years here.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by clueless007:</div><div class="quote_body"> maybe it's that i'm too demanding on wad i expect from my gf.. but i realised now that having too high hopes will only result in disappointment as no one is obliged to do wad u wish they would do. </div></blockquote>Your disappointment is a result of your infatuation.<br><br>Having said that, I think it is good to have expectations.<br><br>In my case, I will not attempt to change anything about her if she deviates from my expectations.

Experience new things and challenges instead of worry about things you cannot control.<br><br>DonÂ’t get too hung up about what she is going to do after the exams.<br><br>If she wants to continue the relationship, learn to be more understanding and fair. She is only seventeen; give each other more space for personal development.<br><br>If she wants to bail out, at least you can use what I write as a reference for your next relationship.<br></div>

You must understand that this relationship is giving her a little stress at the moment because she don't want her parents to find out about this relationship. She loves u, that's why she is with her, but also because she is afraid of her parents finding out, she's in a fix.<br><br>Try to understand that she needs a little time to herself to sort things out. You smsing her and asking her how's she is comforting to her, but try 2 understand that she probably never reply u because she is thinking of what to do next. Try 2 be supportive. Tell her that u will be there for her no matter what, but at the same time tell her u need 2 know if there's anything bothering her. This is probably her first relationship, so she don't know what to do. Be patient with her, be there for her. That's what she needs most. Don't because of a trivial matter then think of breaking up. That will only make u be seen as a jerk who walk away when she needs u most to give her support and help.</div>
