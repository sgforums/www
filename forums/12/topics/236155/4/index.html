            <div class='col-md body'>I believe you and your bf need to have a good talk about the whole issue.  If he's not even ready to talk about and tell you about the separation, he shouldn't go into a relationship because it means that he still feels hurt.  Unless he is completely over with the relationship with his ex-wife, it will continue to haunt him and affect your relationship with him.<br><br>Please do not get me wrong, I am not trying to be a wet blanket but I just don't want you to get hurt.<br><br>It's like a physical injury like a deep cut on your finger.  If you don't nurse the wound and let it heal properly, it will always cause pain at the spot.  The same thing applies to human emotion.  If you don't let your emotion wound heal properly, you will always tend to get hurt easily as that wound becomes a permanent weakness in you.<br><br>Hope you understand what I am trying to say here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

Am i being over sensitive or is he just being insensitive?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I supposed it's not a matter of what you could have done or what choice you could have made that could possibly salvage your situation. Frankly speaking, this man spells doubts in bold print to me - I don't understand why people are claiming him as 'honest', when in fact he's actually playing the 'honest wildcard' as a calculated resort when he's left with no choice.<br><br>In fact, he has actually deceived her.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sggirl07:</div><div class="quote_body">i knew him for 3 months before we were tog.  during the first two dates, i asked him specifically if he was married, he said he is divorced.  asked him if he had kids, he said no.</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Your case reminded me of the frog theory of karmic relationship thesis I wrote in CloUdiSm - When you heat a pot of water till boiling point and throw a frog in it, it will leap out instantaneously. Interestingly, when you put the frog in the pot of water and gradually heat the pot of water, the frog will not escape and instead, allowed itself to be boiled to death.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sggirl07:</div><div class="quote_body">...Where is the line?  when is it that i can start saying i am not ok?<br>i only knew about his wife and seperation after we were together.  i said i was ok.<br>he wife came back with son, and they staying under one roof,<br>i have to say i am ok.<br>we cant meet up often (max once a week), and i have to say i am ok.<br>and now they are goin away for CNY, for an overseas trip, with both sides family, can i be not ok now? </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> This phenomenon is found on you, as quoted by the paragraph you have posted above.<br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Personally, I cannot condone deception on any level, especially when it's proven to be false later on. I think you have contributed a portion of your own plight by suppressing your voice and emotions. It's obvious that he wants to seek out a best of both world solution for himself and because you are able to accept, however reluctant you are, by remaining silence, the advantage goes to his 'separated wife'.<br><br>Understanding this, I will talk about the moral conflicts appearing in your case:<br><br>Yunhaier believes that Love and Moral has little connection between them. One might argue that it's only morally right to allow him to go on a CNY trip because someone is dying in the house (which could possibly be a lie... nobody really knows) or even put you out of the picture when his son becomes part of the equation.<br><br>When you want to love someone, I say hell with external consideration that adds 'no value' to your relationship. Meaning, you do NOT have to put up with considerations that degenerates your overall well being and serve no greater purpose in your relationship - it becomes a choice when you decide to endure, therefore you face the consequence of your choice. Perhaps, it would be the best if you are accepting towards this issue. But if you are unable to, it would be even wiser to cut your loses now before you truly burned out. I hope you do understand that your love is <strong>NO </strong>way a simple/conventional sort of relationship - it is fraught with difficulties and challenges that promises emotional hardship and torrent of tears. I agree with ChocoB - if you are unable to picture this, then this relationship is probably not for you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Tell the guy you want no more of him. Let this go, slowly. Get back your life as a single when you enjoy all the freedom and such. Know more people and make new friends. Leave BGR issues aside for the time being. You deserve something different from this.</div>
