            <div class='col-md body'>Have you ever thought about his child?<br><br>That's probably the reason why he's going. He obviously separated from his wife for some reason; separation is a big deal - it's not some relationship breakup but an annulment of a sacred/legal bond - I very much doubt you have anything to be worried about. I believe the only reason he's there is to give his child some memories of having a real family.<br><br>I don't think your fears are unjustified as well; I may say this now but that's because I'm not in your position - if I was I'd probably freak! Best you can do is just call him every night, and once or twice in the day just to let him know and subtly remind him that you're still here.</div>

Sometimes there are unfairness around. He did not clarify with you properly during your 1st date or meeting, that puts him into a potential mistrust state. If he can "lie" at that time, he can do it again in the future.<br><br>Frankly speaking: do you still have hope you can be with him together?</div>
