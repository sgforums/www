              <p>Recently, I have been chatting with this unknown guy for quite a period of time already and I had fun chatting with him. however it was only through email. he didnt see me before , i didnt see him before, we don know each other moblie number and anything else. only by hotmail. We always mail each other whenever we receieved each other reply. I find him a nice guy and also get along well with me. He's smart and had a degree already.</p>
              <p>after a few mails, i realised even when i'm out, i want to be home soon to check if there's his mail reply, or any news of him. I feel like asking for his picture to have a look at him but i'm afraid he has wrong idea that i have intentions and blahblahblah.</p>
              <p>Did i fell in love with him? crush on him? or jus normal human reaction/thinking too much?</p>
              <p>im quite a realistic girl, i need a guy who has at least a cute or a little above average look, what if he turns out to not as I expected or up to what kind of expectation I like?</p>

              <p>never assume he's a nice guy until u really noe him in and out.. some guys may sound nice online but when u met them in real life, it'll be a different issue.</p>

              <p>Sorry to burst your bubble. And yah lah.. admit it lah.. you DO have intentions ok ?</p>
              <p>I've had that kind of experience before lah.</p>
              <p>Then when finally meet up... sibeh sian lor.</p>
              <p>That guy is totally different from what he describe himself lor....he claim to be charming.. tall and athletic looking. Wah.... then meet up hor.. only the back look very athletic hor.</p>
              <p>when I told him he is not my type, he scolded me wor.. say I shallow and think too highly of myself leh. like that also can wor.</p>
              <p>I think you better exchange picture first lah. If you don't like .. then don't go and meet up lah.</p>
              <p>People behind computers all act nice nice.. later meet up.. totally different hor.</p>
              <p>When meet up.. you the girl must always pick the location you are comfy with. Always in a busy public place... and go meet him at the location yourself.. don't let him pick you up from your home.</p>
              <p>So many times.. these secretive guys want to date me out go dark dark places. As if we are really so innocent meh ?</p>
              <p>So ah... nowadays.. I ask the guy for his picture lah.. if he refused.. then I will simply don't bother meet him lor. </p>

              <p>what's up with everyone who has posted in this thread? while it's great that there is such emphasis on caution, please don't patronise the threadstarter by fuelling her fantasies of an online romance.</p>
              <p>don't get me wrong, i'm not saying love cannot eventuate, but rather, it cannot develop without meeting the person first - until that happens, u're chasing an illusion. in other words, meet this guy, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">as friends</span>, and take things from there.</p>
              <p>please, don't prepare yourself for quashed expectations - there's no need to! i doubt this guy has actually said he's interested in you - if he has, ts should be very wary of this joker - and since he hasn't, ts please don't assume that he is.</p>
              <p>all this talk of cam/pics will most likely freak the guy out - i know i would. just go for lunch at a public place. meeting him at a public place means u're safe, and if he turns out to be douche, it's easy to make a quick getaway - but for all u know, u might be pleasantly surprised.  </p>

              <p>Recently, I have been chatting with this unknown guy for quite a period of time already and I had fun chatting with him. however it was only through email. he didnt see me before , i didnt see him before, we don know each other moblie number and anything else. only by hotmail. We always mail each other whenever we receieved each other reply. I find him a nice guy and also get along well with me. He's smart and had a degree already.</p>
              <p>after a few mails, i realised even when i'm out, i want to be home soon to check if there's his mail reply, or any news of him. I feel like asking for his picture to have a look at him but i'm afraid he has wrong idea that i have intentions and blahblahblah.</p>
              <p>Did i fell in love with him? crush on him? or jus normal human reaction/thinking too much?</p>
              <p>im quite a realistic girl, i need a guy who has at least a cute or a little above average look, what if he turns out to not as I expected or up to what kind of expectation I like?</p>

              <p>Audrey,</p>
              <p>I tell you ah. Online and in real person can be very different hor.</p>
              <p>The only way to confirm your feelings is to meet up, then maybe your feelings will change alredy. But this kind of thing.. is hard to say one ah.</p>
              <p>I used to chat with this very funny guy online hor.. wah.. then later meet up.. he more quiet than a mouse !!</p>
              <p>If you scared ah.. he only want to be friend with you.. then you offer your picture to him lor.. if he see already gets horny.. then he sure wants to meet up with you one.. then hor.. you can demand he send you his pic lor.... if no send.. then no meet lor. Then continue just be friend lor. Even if he send you a fake pic.. so what ? He cannot get a face transplant mah. </p>
              <p>If he ugly.. then he is ugly.. cannot run away one.</p>
              <p>But ah.. I tell you lah.. you are probably not the only girl he met while playing online game lah... so ah... I think it is best you keep a low expectation of him.. if he turns out to be a knight in shiny armor.. then good lah.. if not... ah just smile smile make friends lah.</p>
