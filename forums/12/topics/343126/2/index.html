              <p>oh .. i'm not "angry" .. it's just that i'm very realistic - i just don't believe you can fall in love with someone without meeting him/her first. i think you can become fond of someone without ever meeting him/her, but the spark that becomes love can only happen when eyes meet. this is why i think it's wrong that some of the forumers have asked you to get a photo/cam - to me, it's like fuelling ur already somewhat deluded (no offense) pov that you may be in love with him.</p>
              <p>i don't have any experiences to share .. i've never come close to falling in love with someone i've met online. i have made friends through the internet though .. which is why i think for a start, just meet the guy, as friends, and see how things go from there.</p>
              <p>if he's really ugly .. u guys will still remain friends?</p>
              <p>if he's a douchebag .. u can make a fast escape.</p>
              <p>if he's prince charming .. then u would have had the first hand experience of evaluating whether he's a genuine prospect, and not some player with too much time on his hands. i pray he's the former - and if he is, u can take things further the natural way, that is, through actual dating, and not emails.</p>
              <p>btw, what makes u think he's just as interested in u, as u are him. for all u know, he only wants to be friends .. not all single sg men are desperate/horny &gt; &lt;</p>

              <p>If you were wondering how he looks like, why not just ask him for his pictures? Exchanging pictures is damn common what. Just say hey, we have been chatting for some time, yet i dont know how you look like.... etc.</p>

              <p>Just exchange pics lor, and if you see he's quite ok, then meet up for a drink lor. Dont worry so much la. It's not like you 2 are meeting at his house.</p>

              <p>It's almost like your travelling back in time when <strong>Msn chatrooms</strong> were popular.</p>
              <p>Well there's a difference between being genuine and being fake. Not all people out there will tell you the truth about themselves. Anyways you might like him and he might like you, you guys should meet up and see what happens next. Since you already mentioned you guys have been emailing each other for quite other.</p>
              <p>And to be on the safe side, bring a friend along to meet up. Your choice.</p>

              <p>Its the doubt.</p>
              <p>You don't know the truth.</p>
              <p>Is he for real, or just a pretender? Therefore caution is advised. We have heard of online tragedies. BTW he is also wondering, whether you are a 40year old, beer bellied, sweaty singlet wearing, male. He don't know too.</p>
              <p>Therefore, should you take the risk? That is the agony.</p>
              <p>Risk are to be avoided, or taken with care.</p>
              <p>If avoided, status quo. Things will be just like that.</p>
              <p>If taken, the result may be....... ?</p>

              <p>I find this somewhat funny as the feeling of de javu is present when I read your question.</p>
              <p>Does it matter at all how he looks? In your case it is almost entirely virtual. You have no intention to meet up and I dun think you are falling in love. For once I have to agree with parn, it's curiosity.</p>

              <p>Sorry for not reading all the replies but just though of sharing, I was once in your situation, but well im on the other side the guy. LOLS Initially i though it was just all out for fun and all. Before all it was just u know msging one another, not knowing how each of us look like and all, I didn't pay much attention to her looks, (I didn't care) The relationship between me and her it's just like friends who talks about anything under the sun, thou I've got a real girl friend out there and all not knowing my "weird relationship" with this other girl.</p>
              <p>Til like 1 year down the road, we start to realize that we've already fall for each other(yeah that happen after me and my GF broke off) ,I need to know how she look like and all. Nevertheless we decided to meet up, I told her just a meet up like as if we're normal friends and nothing else. It turned out soooo bad, seriously she look just like a witch (no i dun like to insult but... SHES REALLY worst den FUGLY)! It was such a bad idea, I was dam confused at that point of time, she fking put her hands around me and of cus i ran off! (ok im a big bastard) I told her not to contact me anymore... however when im home I started thinking of the things she said to me, the things i said to her in the past...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I tried to love her again, but i just can't really just i started to turn myself into a total different person... well, i guess it wouldn't happen if right from the start I've know how she look like and started accepting her day by day... it'd be so much worst if she'd to come up to u 1 day and "Hi im am the so-and-so u've been mailing everyday nice to meet u" den u realize its too late... The impact stays with you forever, both parties =)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well but all in all these are parts and parcals of life! do what you think is right!</p>
