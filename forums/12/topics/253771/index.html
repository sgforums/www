Brandishing such deep affections, why do want to bereave yourself and her from revelling in those final, precious moments together? By being an escapist, you not only resign to your fate of an impending doom, but also, you have subconsciously planted a seed of guilt into her life.<br><br>Do you seriously think that by accepting option II, you could free her from this relationship easily to another love? In fact, when she realised the REAL reason why you ditch the relationship, the truth would probably torment her for the rest of her life and how do you think it would affect her future relationship?<br><br>Selfish I say!<br><br>You are NOT dying unless you gave yourself up! At this current stage in life, who cares about what the doctors say?<br><br>Does Doctors = God? They can forecast your remaining life, but do they have the final say?<br><br>There are people who survived through health crisis, despite certified death cases, or even having longer life expectancy simply because of sheer willpower. You don't have to be delusional about your situation; accept the reality that your body is weak and may cease to function, but as long as you still breathe the air around you and have all your senses working, you earn another day to create values and meaning to those around you.<br><br>So what if you have brain tumour - does that make you demented and lose the ability to love?<br><br>If her presence in your life is so important, then you must fight to earn everyday of your life for your stay on Earth. Everyday lived is everyday gained.<br><br>You have absolutely nothing to lose my friend.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Every man will die, but not every man truly lived</strong></span>; you will be in my prayers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

What do you mean by a what if scenario?<br><br>When faced with a possibility and an actual fact, I think people may react differently.<br><br>Put it this way: If someone asked you "What if you strike lottery tomorrow?" Your response would probably be a half-hearted reply indicating what you would spend the money on. But if you really struck lottery and is now contemplating what to do with the money, you'll really sit down and think what's the best way to deal with your windfall instead of really going out to get that sports car or piece of property.<br><br>That's just what I feel.</div>

Suddenly she went away and disappear from your life. You try to find her but you just could not. You wept everyday wondering what you have done wrong. Five years later after all the pain and suffering, you meet her parents only to find out that she died from an illness and do not want her to suffer.<br><br>Do you really think that option B is the best option now?<br><br>P.S the story above is a true story thats why my advice is a)<br><br>Is better to let her know and let her decide. Cos even when you died is a closure for her instead of waiting in vain and in pain.<br><br>Is your life, so you got to chose.<br><br></div>
