It depends on your own personal beliefs and values system and how strong u hold onto them. As long as you firmly believe in your own principles, whatever it may be, as long as you respect yourself, people will respect you.<br><br>Why bother as long as you use common sense and think you are correct ? As the old adage says, "you cannot afford to please everyone." Listening to her doesn't mean you have to agree to her whole-heartedly. Put yourself in her own shoes. That's all there is to it.<br><br>So, just ask, provided it's not a stupid question. Asking doesn't mean you have to listen and follow.</div>
