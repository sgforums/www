              <p>i have been with my boyfriend for 6 months. during this 6 months, he has been breaking a lot of promises. each time i forgive him because i thought that he would learn from his mistakes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>he lie abt a lot of things, until to the point i dun knoe wat is real and what is unreal. he is self-centred and thinks that he is the center of the whole world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>he treats his friends better than he treat me. we go dutch all the time. i understand that at that point of time, he is still clearing his debts. but now that he has cleared finish, he still go dutch with me and keep saying he's on budget. i do not wish to eat expensive food, but at least when we go out, just want to be pampered by him. is it wrong of me to even want that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>he also admit to the statement that if i was a pretty girl, he would not treat me like this. that <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">makes me wonder why is he with me in the first place?</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>he is obviously not mature in his thinking, and a show-off in what he say and what he do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i thought of us just remaining as friends once again and let nature takes its course from there. if i'm going to marry such a guy, i cannot imagine what would happening. am i not being understanding enough?</p>

              <p>I had the same situation as you. But mine worse, he even ignored me and don't even try to contact me at all. He only contact me when he needs help or when he's bored. Life have been miserable for me and I cried almost everynight because I realised he don't even care.</p>
              <p>Until recently, on our second month, I was waiting for him to say " happy 2 months baby " to me, however, something unexpected (or should I say expected) happened. He decided to break up with me and giving me excuses like " I don't want to hurt you more".</p>
              <p>After the break up, i cried terribly, partly is because I love him too much and don't wanna lose him. I also realised he actually woo others girls while being with me. In another words, I'm cheated. But now, thinking back, I realised, I shouldnt even hold on to me because he don't even cherish me and I know there's better guys out there who are willing to cherish me more then he do.</p>
              <p>If you don't even feel happy with ur current bf, why carry on?</p>

              <p>I think he is very rude to say that if you are a prettier girl, he would treat you better. This is very rude, extremely rude. You should just break off from him.</p>
              <p>Spend some time thinking and evaluating....and if you have come to a conclusion...take action, just break off.....trust me you can find other guys out there......and since you have experienced a very low quality guy, the next one is likely to be better....law of statistics....</p>
              <p>OK good luck.</p>

              <p>I'm not talking in terms of experience but instead in my own point of view.</p>
              <p>You do not deserve the treatment that you're getting now, needless to say you're his GF. Whats the point of continuing this relationship if it makes you sad or down all the time? Like what the others say, don't waste your years on him.</p>
              <p>Whenever I'm out with the girl that I like, I'll request to foot the bills unless she doesn't want to, so we either go dutch or  we'll pay for each other on different occasions.</p>
              <p>Good luck in your decision!</p>

              <p>Get him to sit down and try to work out this relationship bah. Tell him how you truly feel about all that he has done and try to work a solution together.</p>
              <p>But in my opinion, he isnt fit to be your boyfriend.</p>
              <p>Who would ever say that if his girlfriend is prettier, he would treat her better? What kind of absurd reasoning is that?</p>
              <p>Since he wanted to be with you in the first place, he shouldn't have said all these hurtful things to you.</p>

              <p>I think you know what you should do, it's a matter of whether u have the heart to do it...or rather you are just waitin for him to end it so it makes it easier for u to handle it..</p>
              <p>You can think forever and question yourself for the longest time but things will still remain..</p>
              <p>The more you put in, the more he will treat you like that. Why not jus take a break, and see how it goes like that..</p>
