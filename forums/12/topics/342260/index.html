              <p>i have been with my boyfriend for 6 months. during this 6 months, he has been breaking a lot of promises. each time i forgive him because i thought that he would learn from his mistakes.</p>

              <p>he lie abt a lot of things, until to the point i dun knoe wat is real and what is unreal. he is self-centred and thinks that he is the center of the whole world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>he treats his friends better than he treat me. we go dutch all the time. i understand that at that point of time, he is still clearing his debts. but now that he has cleared finish, he still go dutch with me and keep saying he's on budget. i do not wish to eat expensive food, but at least when we go out, just want to be pampered by him. is it wrong of me to even want that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>he also admit to the statement that if i was a pretty girl, he would not treat me like this. that makes me wonder why is he with me in the first place?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>he is obviously not mature in his thinking, and a show-off in what he say and what he do.</p>

              <p>i thought of us just remaining as friends once again and let nature takes its course from there. if i'm going to marry such a guy, i cannot imagine what would happening. am i not being understanding enough?</p>

              <p>Well it's only just started, you might as well end the relationship now than later. If you end it now, you won't think much about him nor will you give a shit that much. But if you dump him later like a year time, it will be much harder to forget about him.</p>
              <p>Besides I take it that your young, as everyone knows here, they are plenty of guys or girls out there. So why waste the opportunity with being with one guy where you can find a guy out there who is 10 times better than your current bf?</p>

              <p>sorry to say this.... But before you point at him... <br><br>Sometime you have to sit down and evaluate your feelings towards him.<br>Maybe you do not love him anymore. you are now with him not to break his heart and maybe you are not sure yourself.</p>
              <p>because you are not sure, you do not treat him well also. <br>Have u ever asked him about his feelings?</p>
              <p>But then you say he likes to lie. Then I would really say, there is no point in staying together with someone who has no intergrity. Now no money can, but no integrity is very bad.</p>
              <p>These things u have to sit down and think.<br><br>If no love then...</p>
