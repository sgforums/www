I know her for abt 7months already. Not long after i met her, Okay, we r actually in a steady relationship but i changed my mind. Then we both be friends first..<br><br>Abt her, u know as usual... U know guys/gals kiss tgt... *<strong>okay , gonna say out</strong>*<br><br>ya, we did kiss, and etc.. but not into the extreme, i find her the hardcore type and im really nervous.. She even whispered to me once if i ever make &lt;3 before.. so i told her NO... I asked how abt her, she said once.. And she loves the feeling a lot... ermm.... then she kept pester me , keep asking me to have *** with her, but i didnt agree. C0z i dun wanna bear any responsibilities or suffer any consequences..... Becoz i dun want to have *** with her, she now pester me / sms almost everyday to at least have **** *** with her, if not cyber*** with her... Im getting really cripped out ~ I dun wanna lose her as a friend, and i dun wish to see her like that. <strong>I know its a fashion these days to lose ur virginity....</strong><br><br>Also, im wondering does she really love me or only interested in ***...<br><br>So okay im wondering now, im really confused..What can i do to maintain the stable relationship... ? i know im stupid that i dun want this oppotunity but i dun care. haiz....... I know this case seems rather rare but im speakin it out truthfully.. BTW, if any of u guys wants her number: its a no no~ Thanks~ [/b]</blockquote>I see a lot of rubbish replies and very few genuine replies. Oh well, that's sgforums for you.<br><br>Back to topic.<br><br>I think this particular girl defines relationships very differently. Maybe she feels that sex is a justification or measure of relationship, or that sex is a measure of her closeness to you. I hope I'm making sense coz I'm typing after a long day out.<br><br>You need to think about what does this relationship mean to you and what is it about? If you feel you're in no way going into it for the sex, then you should stand your ground. Perhaps you can persuade her to look at this relationship in another way.<br><br>Try to assure her that you will remain as much a friend to her without getting physically involved with her. Let her know that all this pushing and pressure from her is only making you feel more negative about her and would only push you further away from her.</div>

Its not exactly a good or bad thing, but its a natural process of growing old and doing away with inhibitions of the mind.<br><br>In the meantime, if you really did give in to her request and had sex with her, then you are no better than a teenage girl losing her virginity for the first time without a complete understanding of what you are doing, and it will suck. So stick to your original position. No one will laugh at you except your future self. Any horny girls like these do not have what we call "Jing Chi". Not a very desirable trait if you ask me, from an evolutionary standpoint.<br><br>So, my take on this is, if you wanna do her, just do it. If you don't want to, then don't.
