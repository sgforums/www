Pearl's mother in law was not properly cared for by the maid and had very serious bed sore, so much so that doctor diagnosed that her blood was poisoned.  In the end, she passed away.  They regretted as a maid is trained to do household chores and not nursing, hence she advised that for non-bedridden old folks, maids might be alright but definitely not for the bedridden ones.<br><br>I tried calling a few placement agencies, but it seems that a nurse coming to my house to work for a 12-hour shift would cost between $120 to $150 for day shift, and more for night shift.
