            <div class='col-md body'>dude... do not wait for her.. what happened to you happened to me, if you feel you are feeling miserable now, you will feel even worse after the two years.. and you will find it very hard to pull yourself out of your sorrow because you have spent so much time for her, investing so much time for her while things remains the same for the both of u.<br><br>i confessed to the gal(1 yr younger than me) i like before when i was in j2 and she said she wasnt ready aso. I didnt push her and decided to wait for until her 'A's is over while i'm in NS. The wait itself is already very miserable, but the real torture comes after your wait.<br><br>U would naturally expect more from her since you invested so much for her. When her 'A's is over, you will try to commit even more effort and time with her to make up for the lost time. And you would naturally expect even more from her due to this. You will find yourself growing dependent on her replies and her attention because you have been deprived of it for so long. Soon, you'll find yourself becoming more and more needy. And soon you'll find her getting further and further away from you.<br><br>Besides that, you have already committed yourself emotionally that she's the perfect one for you. Once you have that emotional commitment, you will be blinded and not be able to see clearly her character and her flaws, because everything about her will be flawless to you. and when that happens, you will not be able to understand her clearly, and she will tell you again that the two of you r still not ready to be in a relationship becuase she finds you do not know her well enough.<br><br>Furthermore, the your fear of losing this friendship will amplify because you have invested so much in it. And with fear, you will not be able to completely be yourself and let her see the real you because you will do things out of fear of losing her and not because that's just you. That will also create problems.<br><br>I do not wish to see history repeats itself.. do not follow in my footstep. i'm still trying to move on after my third confession to her after her 'A's. And her reply is still i dono.. which makes it even harder for me to move on.<br><br>DO NOT wait for her. Wash off all your thoughts that she's the perfect one for you. Don't fear losing her. You can still keep in contact with her and be her friend, and she will be yours if she's meant to be yours.. hai.. sad..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys, I have another question to ask you all.<br><br>I asked her whether she wanted to meet up with me 1 last time next weekend before I go in for BMT in April. She kept quiet and didn't give me a reply. But just today, I found out from her nickname over MSN that she is organising a chalet with her 1st 3 months friends. This is not the first time she has turned me down(not that she has said anything yet), but I feel terribly hurt. I'm going in for NS soon &amp; she doesn't want to meet up with me for the last time. And she wants to have a chalet with her same group of friends again? The reason why I said "again" is that she recently had a chalet during her holidays a few weeks ago with that same particular group of friends. I gave her my assurance that we'll just be meeting up as good friends, nothing else. So why is she still avoiding me? (We have not gone out since I confessed to her...) She can spend 2 days with her group of friends that she just met up with 2 weeks ago but she spend 1 day with me, someone whom she has not seen for a month. I feel that she is not respecting me as a friend at all!<br><br>These feelings are what I'm experiencing currently. Can you guys tell me if is she really trying to make me give up on her by avoiding face-to-face contact with me? And can you guys also tell me whether am I starting to sound like I'm being selfish and obsessed with her? I can take the criticism but I just want to know your take on this... Thanks!</div>
