              <p>I don't know what I want in life. I just keep changing job 1 by 1. Problem is that during the 5 or 10 minutes of interview you can't really tell much and know much about the work scope and the people taht you will be working with.</p>
              <p>When you enter into the company than you realise that what they tell you during the interview is not the job scope that you have expected. Plus other issues such as your boss and collegues don't want to teach you etc.</p>
              <p>Than you resign or your boss don't want to confirm you after 3 months probation and than you start the process of finding another job and the same problem happen again.</p>
              <p>You keep on changing job until you get very demoralised and don't know what you want in life.</p>
              <p>Because of the job hopping, you have no time nor money to do other things in life such as finding a gf/bf or further your studies and you are stuck in the vicious cycle of finding a new job every time after a few months.</p>

              <p>An interview is the best chance to get to know more about your future job scope. If you're telling me you do not not much about what you're apply for, I see that you have room for improvement in your interviewing skills.</p>
              <p>Interviewing is a process where empolyer gets to know better about employee, and for employee gets to know more about the jobs that they will be taking.</p>

              <p>A few possibilities</p>
              <p>a) Your interview skills got problem</p>
              <p>b) You suay as the interviewers think you are not suitable but they call you down for fun because they don't need to pay you and they do not lose anything by asking you down for interview</p>
              <p>C) You lose to the many foreigners who are applying for the same jobs as you. Most likely they are young, got a degree and is willing to accept a salary half of what you quote</p>

              <p>however due to low pay,you cant go anywhere even after werking fer the companyÂ u have been in fer Â 10 years.and also u doÂ get replaced by cheaper younger foreigners n fresh grads in pvt sector by companies using all sorts of dirty tricks.</p>

              <p>Problem:Â don't know what I want in life. I just keep changing job 1 by 1. Problem is that during the 5 or 10 minutes of interview you can't really tell much and know much about the work scope and the people taht you will be working with.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>solution:thats why the interview last about 30 mins n more for you to ask and tell.it dun matter who u werk with.just do it well!</p>

              <p>solution:never come across it.only saw work colleague who was sidelined n sacked as they got even cheaper workers when he was on 3mth probation.asking pay too high by like $100 per month.</p>
              <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Problem:Because of the job hopping, you have no time nor money to do other things in life such as finding a gf/bf or further your studies and you are stuck in the vicious cycle of finding a new job every time after a few months.</p>
              <p>solution:it should be after a few years.most companies get rid of staff when there is a recession every 3 years or even reservist trainings !!!and they use all means to accomplish it.you from which government department one???how come u everything also dunno one???</p>
