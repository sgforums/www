            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm.... thanks for all the views!<br><br>SlkyLucifer, your views on stocks and love sounds interesting.  Let's imagine CSM is love<br><br>CSM was a highly regarded stock with many pple going after it, many speculations. But it went all the way down to less than $1 and many felt betrayed. They gave up hopes on this stock. Though this stock is now climbing slowly up, some pple who are burnt by it refused to touch it anymore. Some pple continue to speculate it based on hopes of economic recovery. Some pple are new to tthe stock market and found this an interesting stock cos it flutuate, very exciting. so they invest heavily on it.<br><br>Did you buy CSM when it was $7? that is why you are very pessimistic abt it?<br><br>Mayb this is not a good eg to say. anyway, mayb a bit tired liao, anyhow say say. by the way, SlkyLucifer, are you into stocks? anny recommendations? my hands are itchy to buy now!<br><br>I m still now with 2 guys. but i think the other guy knows that i will leave him some day. He is like trying to cherish the times together with me and he told me "to like someone not nec must be with her. as long as she is happy, he will be happy" sounds a bit crappy but it does touches me......<br>I think right now, if still associate love with stocks, both guys are actually blue chip stocks. they have the potential to yearn good returns in future. Just that the other guy is venture, with very fast fluatuation, with lots of highs and lows. my bf is Singtel, rising slowly yet steadily. so which stock do you think i shd put my $ in? assuming tat i only want to conc on one stock.<br>hmm.... am i being too financial now? think my brains are not working liao. have been working too hard at office....</div>
