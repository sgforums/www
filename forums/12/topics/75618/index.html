In fact it can be pretty common to like 2 or more people at the same time... Look at 2 scenerios...<br><br>1. You like 2 or more people at the same time, but you're not involved with more than one of them (The more common picture of the 2 scenerios)....<br><br>2. You in 'a relationship' or relationships involving 3 or more parties (inclusive of yourself) for BGR....<br><br>And as your instinct is probably telling you by now? You'll burn yourself a hole by the way you're handling the current situation... As it's just like a walking time-bomb... One you'll have to hide him from the truth till? The other, frustrations and confusions brewing within the relationship you're having with him.... Pretty obvious where you'll be heading? Unless all luck's on your side..? Well... More like it'll take a miracle to me to be honest?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

According to CloUdiSm remix III: On the surface it may seemed that you like two guys - but actually you are trying to maintain this love model called LXB Model to <strong>protect yourself and to be in the best of both worlds</strong>.<br><br>Securities comes from your old love - you know he wouldn't leave you, but the flame is weak. He falls under the Plain Water theory (PWL) - tasteless but cannot live without.<br><br>The excitement comes from your new love - but you cannot gauge/see long term future with him. He knows about your situations, knows that you have a bf - but made mutual choice to be together. This deceptive relationship cannot see much fulfillment.<br><br>In maintaining LXB model, people always place much empathy on their partners - thinking that it will hurt them if you fail to upkeep this model. <strong>But in reality, it causes more hurt</strong>. Psychologically, at least 50% of the reason contribute to the fact that you don't want to be label as a 'bad egg', plus the above false empathy - you remain where you are. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>One interesting note here: You mentioned you will probably stay with your bf because he loves you so much. Then you go about saying how gulity you will feel when that happen to the other guy... you spoke everything about them - nothing about you. So you are staying in the relationship because your bf loves you alot and knowing that he couldn't and wouldn't leave you at all? Now my question:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Are you still in love with him or are you in love with security that he could give?</strong> </span><br><br>Advice?<br><br>Like both of them? Why not see who is more suitable for you? In my years of relationship analysis, I have learn this: <strong>No two person are equally suitable.</strong> You can't quantity love, therefore you can judge who you love more, but you can certainly know in ALL aspects on a person, if he is more suitable and blends with your emotions, lifestyle, mental frequency, and everything else essential.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> This suitability has to be JUDGE by current present standard and NOT the past. (E.g. your bf may be suitable in the past, but as time passed, people changed, habits formed, etc - this may not be the case)<br><br>Drop the defensive preception of yours, thinking that they will be hurt when you make your choice. What makes you think both of them are damn happy now? You made a wrong move and you completely feared regrets - but let me tell you: face them. Deception in relationship will crumble from within. If this is a lesson for you to learn, embrace them.<br><br>P.S: Are you a Pisces, Scorpio or Libra? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Stop your silly thoughts and make a fast decision before much damage is made and situation get drills deeper..<br><br>Your 'basic'. No good. Please make up your mind as to what you want, you're not good at having lengthy thoughts over such matters and playing a lengthy game...

            <div class='col-md body'>I wrote an article on dating gals based on a investor approach two years back, read the extracts:<br><br><span style="color: green;">I have people telling me that they date exclusively, meaning that they only date one at a time and held the strong belief of faithfulness to their girlfriend/boyfriend. If only their partner think the same as they do, then I have nothing more to say. Love is just like the stock market, fluctuating every single minute unpredictably.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Like an investor who include many different financial securities in his portfolio to protect himself against market risks. An individual can too consider a few potential boyfriends/girlfriends on a dating list so that when a relationship with any of them sours, you still have another to fall back on. </span><br><br><span style="color: orange;">But all these require a lot of time and effort since you will not be devoting your energy on only one person but two or even more. In addition, more financial resources have to be pooled to sustain this course of action in the long run. </span><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>Remember this, when it comes to boy-girl relationship, it is not worthwhile to give your all to one party without knowing whether he/she is willing to do the same in return</strong>. Even if your partner is faithful to you now does not necessarily imply that he/she will still remain true in the days to come. The future holds too many uncertainties.</span><br><br><span style="color: black;">It really saddens me whenever I see suicide, assault and even murder cases resulting from failed romances. If only these jilted Â‘has-beensÂ’ have an alternative, they would not have taken it so hard. So do you understand the advantages of diversification now? </span>   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">So what's the big deal of liking two gals or guys at the same time? In the past, I even dated three gals simultaneously to protect myself from being hurt. 2 Hearts, you are doing it right, Just Bring It!</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </strong></div>
