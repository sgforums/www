But have u given tots to what u write? Have u given tots on ppl and their feelings?<br><br>There is nothing wrong with liking a few girls or guys BUT when u are with one of them in a relationship, and stil u go out loving other girls or guys, isnt tt betrayal to ur gf/bf?<br><br>We are toking about ppl's feelings here and not a piece of business deal. No matter how u feny it, we humans have feelings and we CAN get hurt by betrayal.<br><br>In a relationship, whether its worth it to give ur all is up to the individual and the situation. If everyone doesnt give their all, where do we find true love? Where do we see the maricles that happen in a relationship at times? Where do we see a bf doing something to make his gf feel better at times of sadness? We can never predict the future and what happens. How do we know the future days are full of uncertainties? We live in the present, not the past, not the future. And I think we should treasure the present and not think of what uncertainties in the future. We do plan ahead and at times our plan meets with some problems. But we also fight to overcome them and not just say I am facing uncertainties in the future so i dun wan to commit to anything.<br><br>There are failed relationships that lead to undesired endings. A diversion is a way to avoid such endings but it is not solving the root of the problem. People are emotion filled and at times when they come to a cruel fact too harsh for them to accept, something happenes. No doubt u may say he/she is silly but at least he/she faces the problems and made a decision although its not good. I am not encouraging anything here, i am just making a point. A diversion is only a way to delay the problem.<br><br>Imagine urself in a relationship with a girl who u really love and u cant live without. And suddenly she turns out to be togther with many other guys. How will u feel? U can tell others whats the big deal but when it lands on u, will u feel the same thing? What if that person turns out to be ur husband or wife? U protect urself from being hurt by not hurting others. U DUN protect urself by doing things u dun wan them to do to u and hurting them in the process. If u do tt, one day u will incur their wrath and ultimately, the one whos hurt the most is urself.<br><br>Treat others the way u want them to treat u. 2 Hearts, my advices are aready up there. Its up to u to take them or leave them.</div>
