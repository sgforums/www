            <div class='col-md body'>how about going to ite wif the course u like?<br><br>it may sound stupid to lower ur standard. but afterall ur advantage getting a itc in infocom-tech will give u a higher chance of going to poly since it is relevant to ur course. the route may be long but it definitely worthwhile.<br><br>or just stick to the stink course u at n graduate wif a diploma. n use tis diploma n apply for infocom-tech again. but keep in mind dat there will be no more tuition fee cut since ur second attempt of getting another diploma.</div>
