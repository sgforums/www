            <div class='col-md body'>At least it shows that you care about her and want to know more about her, but just try to lay off. Its nice to know that someone really cares, but not until to the point where he/she is breathing down ur neck and squeezing every little detail out. She might be doing this out of jealousy, did you forget her birthday or something? haha, so for now relax dood, watch and see for awhile if its keeps up then slowly get her to tell you more about that guy.</div>

I believe that people who have possessive tendency (which also means petty jealousy), can only reduce it to a certain extend because MCP has this gnawing insecurity and love=possession-like attitude and justify them psychologically as love for the other person.<br><br>In the end, from thoughts, it sews into habit and personality.<br><br>They may not be entirely wrong, but definitely, there are much healthier way to lead a relationship. And 'healthy' living for the relationship could be the key to life and death of the BGR.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
