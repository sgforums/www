If i am the guy, I would do the same as well when i got all the time in the world to. I mean, who wont when going after a gal?<br><br>Going out with him again? Alone? Dude. I sense trouble here. I am going to be mean and tell you the what I THINK. If I am the rival guy, after these few months and the holiday period, MOST PROB I would have already held her hands, maybe kiss even. Anything beyond that is not very me but I aint sure about the guy. Plus, WOW, its my birthday. What a great chance to make my move isn't it?<br><br>Think about it. The guy reserved that date just for your gal. And your gal HAPPILY agreed to spend it with him. Any guy would use that chance rite? I am afraid you will lose her on that day. She might not tell you on that day, but you have to be prepared. I dun like to dampen people's spirit. but bro. In your case, you stand like what? 10% of her heart and that guy? 60-70% i think.<br><br>I advise you to talk to your gf again. and convince her to tell that guy that she is attached to you. If she refuse and or kick up a big fuss, I am sorry brother. Chances are that you lost her already.<br><br>But fret not my friend. Girls like her aint worth your tears. Really. I think most people here would agree.<br><br>However, this is what we are assuming. Maybe she really loves you and tat guy is just a friend to her. Maybe she aint saying that she is attached because she cant afford to let her faimly or friends know etc due to personal reasons. You need to know. If that is it and she loves you dearly, then i congratulate you.<br><br>Good luck brother.<br><br>We are here if you need us.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>And to put you at ease.

Rather, they should do the other way. A princess in the making here.<br><br>Take note: she is 21 years old. Old enough to have a boyfriend. Do you know youngsters nowadays as young as 13 are going steady and are sexually active? What more is 21 years old?<br><br>Plus, I think the girl must have been a gorgeous woman for her to be stringing two puppies along. And if she did loved him, why would she be doing such a thing? Either she don't love him or she is childish. In either case, do you like to be with people like that?<br><br>But apparently, when you are love mad, you can take any pain.<br><br>Haha..<br><br>doko</div>

She is just f*cking with your head.<br><br>Just go straight to her and give her an ultimatum to make a choice instead of hanging on like a pathetic lost puppy.  So what if you waited for her ? Means nothing if her heart is not with you. If you break up with her and no doubt you will feel hurt about it , you are at least free to look for someone else who would not do this kinda sh*t to you.</div>
