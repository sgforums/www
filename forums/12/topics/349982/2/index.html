              <p>in the ferst place why would i have an issue with someone i barely noe? ok truth is i dun hev any prob wit the girl, but i do hev a prob wit my fren instead. i dun agree wit him jumpin into a relationship wit a girl to soon after bein rejected by the girl that he likes. you see the prob is; i dun quite like the idea that this new girl il only be a temporary phase where now i see her wit us, later i wont be seein her anymore... and the bigger prob is, be it her or any other girl, to be used as a tool/rebound to mend a broken heart is a total unacceptable</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I ask u, can u actually claim you love A soon after bein rejected by B?</p>

              <p>Thks keii.  that is very insightful :) and im sure of the
              whole situation. it's all platonic. No romantic feeling
              involve here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Andrew, yes im kaypoh for that matter. I shud have just
              sit one corner, smoke one side while watchin
              him do all his mistake.. watch him drop to the ground and do nothin
              but watch him only..... that shud be fun..  I suppose
              that is the kind of friend we should all be from now on...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you all for the kind input but the quest now is
              not bout how i feel for him and whether i shud start question my
              platonic rs wit him.. but the thing is now.. how do
              i tell him that im not comfortable havin his gf at our usual
              hangout yet.. i nd time to adjust to it without hurtin his
              feeling... as we all noe: Men and Ego; they are inseparable</p>

              <p>After reading your replies, I believe you are mature enough to understand your feelings, or at least cope with it.</p>
              <p>When things happen, sometimes we cannot do anything about it. What I assume, positively, Andrew would mean is that, he needs to get a slap in the face or take a fall in order to learn.</p>
              <p>It is a learning process which one must go through in order to realise, no matter how much advice or suggestions have been thrown around.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By you being uncomfortable of her intrusion to a special place shared by you and him. You just need to tell it to his face. Be tactful. You understand about men and their egos, which is good, so be subtle.</p>
              <p>Any relationship, be it platonic, family, friends, lovers, whatever, any human relationship requires constant communication.</p>

              <p>Give the guy a break. He just got rejected. It hurts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Male or female, rejection is something we carbon based lifeforms find it difficult to accept. We are not ferrous atomic structured beings which cannot feel beyond its metallic frames.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are chemical bio beings with the ability to sense, see, touch and feel. We are only human, male or female, with self esteem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He just wants to feel wanted. Be it a random girl or anyone of the female sex. But not from you. You are probably just like 'one of the guys' to him. And guys would never want to develope the kind of feeling one feels for the opposite sex with another guy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's a guy thing. Girl, back off. Before you destroy the friendship both of you had built up. Give him support and let him find his own way. You cannot decide what is right or wrong for him. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Totalitarism is no way to continue a relationship. Be a safety net for him if you truly care. Help in anyway you can to build up his sored self esteem, not by words but by actions....but as you are a 'guy', stand back.  </p>
