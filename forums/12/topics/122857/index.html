            <div class='col-md body'>All the time, we(men) get bashed from those feminist-pig... Its not about women-bashing, but the retaliation that we(men) finally did after tolerating all these years.. so those feminist wants equality.. but cried foul when guys back-lash at them..<br><br>Girls likes to assume being in a stronger position, but when presented in such a situation, they find those guys as wimps or not assertives enough.. when going for a date, they like guys to treat them as their equals, but when it comes to payment, they expects guys to pay.. It's officiate as 'correct' or a must, but when urge their counterparts to foot the bills, girls lament them as 'stingy and 'ungentlemen'.. comments like this have become so common place that nobody stops and thinks how 'unequal' or 'unfair' this is..<br><br>I wish I can logically explain this phenomenon, but it's beyond my ability to fathom what's going on in their pea size brain.. They have no problem to treat men as their equals, but they got a big problem in behaving like a gentlemen..<br><br>Apparently, we guys are supposed to take insults 'like a joke' or 'like a man', but when a guy says something about girls, he's label as 'sexist' or a chauvinist.. Girls like to project themselves as independent when around with guys, but when in the presence of ang moh, singapore women turn into submissive sl_uts.. All that 'modern independent woman' crap goes out of the window the moment they start licking the boots of the ang moh..<br><br>But one thing I can do, is say that the phenomenon doesnÂ’t last forever.. As more local guys are marrying overseas, its only time before those feminists, intellectual wh0res finally woke up to find themselves in a 'solace' situation and realise they should remain less vocal and in less unassuming position.. Until then, I propose a toast to all the guys.. You know who you are, and I know you are sick of the double standards thats been practising by the local ladies.. Fear not, as your well deserved vindication is coming..<br><br></div>

Its not about women-bashing, but the retaliation that we(men) finally did after tolerating all these years.. so those feminist wants equality.. but cried foul when guys back-lash at them..<br><br>Girls likes to assume being in a stronger position, but when presented in such a situation, they find those guys as wimps or not assertives enough.. when going for a date, they like guys to treat them as their equals, but when it comes to payment, they expects guys to pay.. It's officiate as 'correct' or a must, but when urge their counterparts to foot the bills, girls lament them as 'stingy and 'ungentlemen'.. comments like this have become so common place that nobody stops and thinks how 'unequal' or 'unfair' this is..<br><br>I wish I can logically explain this phenomenon, but it's beyond my ability to fathom what's going on in their pea size brain.. They have no problem to treat men as their equals, but they got a big problem in behaving like a gentlemen..<br><br>Apparently, we guys are supposed to take insults 'like a joke' or 'like a man', but when a guy says something about girls, he's label as 'sexist' or a chauvinist.. Girls like to project themselves as independent when around with guys, but when in the presence of ang moh, singapore women turn into submissive sl_uts.. All that 'modern independent woman' crap goes out of the window the moment they start licking the boots of the ang moh..<br><br>But one thing I can do, is say that the phenomenon doesnÂ’t last forever.. As more local guys are marrying overseas, its only time before those feminists, intellectual wh0res finally woke up to find themselves in a 'solace' situation and realise they should remain less vocal and in less unassuming position.. Until then, I propose a toast to all the guys.. You know who you are, and I know you are sick of the double standards thats been practising by the local ladies.. Fear not, as your well deserved vindication is coming..<br><br></div></blockquote>"but it's beyond my ability to fathom what's going on in their pea size brain..

" once again u are more or less using Compton Mackenzie's quote without giving credit where it's due.<br><br>3rdly, u're still living in the 1930s because thats when good 'ol compton said his quote.<br><br>4thly, once again u're saying the same old Shit u've repeated many times over in other of your equally useless, meaningless, Shitty crappy posts. u're sounding like a broken record and in case u think u're speaking up for men and u didn't actually notice, most guys here think u're a Fuckwit too. maybe u might wanna shut up b4 u scupper your chances with gay men too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
