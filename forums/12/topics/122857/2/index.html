May it be for a particular forumite or the general females. So where did you got the term 'dinner wh0res' from? Is it a recognised term? I doubt you would even dare to speak openly in the public about this as you would probably only be detested BOTH by the females and the males alike.... So much for equality?<br><br>2. Personally, I've came across quite alot of ladies who are generous enough to buy me drinks and offer to foot the bill 1st. Obviously. You've either got not enough chance to come across women or perhaps not even a chance to start off with? My personal advice for you is.... Try to mix around with the right group of people. And yeah. Change that mentality and mindset of ya if it's of any good to you in the 1st place?<br><br>3. There is NO LAW in Singapore stating that a MAN has to pay for the female counterpart at a dinner. Why pay up in the 1st place when you only wanna come into the forum to complain about it? Just don't pay up for the lady if you don't wanna, nobody's gonna sue you for that?</div>
