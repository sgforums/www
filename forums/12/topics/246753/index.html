            <div class='col-md body'>I got offered a job recently and agreed too quicky on the phone although I was unsatisfied with the pay package.<br><br>Despite that little tinge of unhappiness, I went down to sign the letter of offer.<br>I had to do so on the spot as they did not allow me to take home the contract and benefits appendix - approx 10 pgs, font size arial 8 or smaller) photocopied twice or thrice from original staff benefits booklet so that the words were all smudgy and blurry and not updated at all as the HR officer made amendments and cancellations in blue ink on the benefits appendix as she spoke to me.<br><br>Note: The benefits like medical leave &amp; 13th month bonus that were conveyed to me verbally were not seen on the short 1 1/2  page contract that did not even state my date of commencement. Is this appropriate?<br><br>I hesitated in signing on the spot. (my gut instincts went all awry when I picked up the pen, just could not sign it)<br><br>The job prospects are pretty good for a greenhorn like me in the mid-twenties. However, are they compromising on the lack of professionalism/ quality in presenting the contract/offer to me in such a way precisely because I am not so experienced?<br><br>Should I take up the offer without furthur questions or look for another job?</div>

The HR officer got pretty worked out and told me they even had my e-mail account set up already.. Howver, she would give me a few more days to rethink my decision.<br><br>I have shown unprofessionalism in turning up, not signing the contract and telling her that I wanted to reconsider... (I only found out about the loopholes in the contract when I was chatting with a friend that night...)<br><br>The HR officer later informed me that she had conveyed the message to the upper management of the company that I was reconsidering this position. I fear that even before working for this company, my "good-name" has been tarnished...<br><br>If I proceed to tell her to amend the contract, will I furthur frustrate her and my goodwill/ relationship with the company?<br><br>This is my key problem... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi JW19,<br><br>I am also in the midst of looking for a new job. Was offered a post in the west area. Pay wise seems reasonable but it as an executive in the construction industry doesn't seem to bode well on my future. Went for another 2 more interviews one of which has a much higher pay while the other is what I really hope to do.<br><br>But job market seems pretty good now. As I have been to 1 interview every week ever since I started looking for a job 3 weeks ago and 1 of them already offered.<br><br>Look around more. It is not good to rush into things. You're in your mid 20s now, so it's very important for you to plan your route now and do something worthwhile. You will not enjoy the essence of your youth by your mid 30s when everything start slowing down. If you really feel that the job is not for you, it doesn't hurt to look for another one.<br><br>Also don't accept the job yet quit it 1 or 2 months later. It's not going to reflect well in your resume Stick with it at least for a year.</div>

That's pretty impressive! I have been actively applying for a job since January this year and only managed a pathethic 4 interviews.<br><br>I feel I might have no choice but to take on this job for a year and gain more experience/ income. Also, time is running out as the next batch of poly and uni grads will be coming out to join the jobhunt soon <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>duotiga83&gt;<br><br>Better luck in your next job!<br><br>walesa&gt;<br><br>I agree with you. What pisses me off is that I can't bring the contract and benefits home to go through. It's not that I'm not interested in the job but faced with so many pages (the appendix for example) to read, I should be able to carefully go through every single point before I sign &amp; reconsider the deal if need be.<br><br>However, the HR officer told me that the contract is private &amp; confidential and that I can't take it home to read. Is this the norm?<br><br>FireIce &amp; Airbus330Captain&gt;<br><br>I don't think I'm in the position to be choosey after sending out nearly 100 resumes and only getting a paltry 4 responses. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

You are usually not allowed to bring the document home, although you'll be given a copy - at least an abridged one, if not the full copy - of it to keep once you've signed it for your reference. In fact, that's not restricted to employment documents - it's the same for people accepting scholarships too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>That's why I suggest you should not feel compelled to rush through the terms and sign it even if you feel pressurised. Take the entire day if that's how long you need to go over every term and clause - that's your prerogative and your right. At the end of the day, if you don't look after your interest, no one will.</div>
