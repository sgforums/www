            <div class='col-md body'>I have a Singaporean Guy friend, say Kenny(cannot say real name) ") who i know outside. To me,he is a average looking,not very tall, average income guy, kind and courtesy, athough he may be a bit quiet and abit old fashion type,speak slowly. A Nice Guy,Gentlemen, Guai Guai type one. i said. He resemembled a doctor act in Holland V(He Lang Chun) with Chen Li Ping, have stuttering problem.<br><br>But Kenny is 26 but had never had a relationship before. I am thinking such a nice guy, why no girls like him. It is so pity to be single. He told me that he had been so lonely for so many years. His expectation is not high, as long the girl is sweet and able to communicate is enough.<br><br>Kenny told me he had try to find girls on friendster,and dunno other websites(those can find friends one). Even on the street or friend's friends, Either he get silent treatment or rejected. So sad of him<br><br>As for me as a girl, I am not really understand what other girls think too. What problems is Kenny facing, what should Kenny do for relationship to come to him? What should he change?<br>Is it instead of being a Nice Guy to have relationships, he got rejected? No Look like 5566?Talents? No vocal speech like the speaker?<br><br>I am surprised that no other gals ever sms him nor call him. But i take initiative to call and console him.<br><br>Any guys also suffered from this problem can stand up and discussed<br><br>Gals can post your feeling/opinion/suggestion on this Nice man,Kenny.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>Add on:<br><br>Do you guy and gal feel insecure when an opponent with better capability,looks and talent targeting your love one?<br><br>In Kenny's case, he had like a girl, Soria so much. Soria aslo quite like him too. Too bad, there' s a guy say Mike with better conditions: Rich, Talented in music, intelligent, talkative, popular,Cars, dunno what OCS with swords, with these conditions, Soria would not contact Kenny, no matter how many greeting sms sent to her and in msn.<br><br>I just realised when Kenny told me that this Mike is flirty, most of his Friendster profile are girls. I guess Mike must have many relationship before, popular among gals<br><br>Mike do have many advantages like OCS, many prize for sports and talents to girls, while on the other hand, Kenny is in a worse state, poor and useless.<br><br>How about you guys and gal think? Does it happened to you?<br></div>
