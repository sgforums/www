But it's might also be because u're already attached and kenny feels easier to really open up to u since he's less afraid that u will mistaken him as having a liking for u.<br><br>if everything goes back and kenny really like you, he might just be as quiet and reserved to u as to the others now, u probably won't have known his character as well as u knows now.<br><br>so the baseline is, as a first step, kenny still needs to open up more to others so that there will be more who can understand &amp; appreciate his good gentlemenly natured like u</div>

Most girls, who are very practical, who wants handsome hunks and Jerry Yen face types, will most likely not fall for him. But it is still not entirely impossible for Kenny win them over.<br><br>Why is it that only you find him ok? Why is it that other girls find him a turnoff? What is the reason here? Is there something special about your eyes? Or is it Kenny only can talk to you because you are open and friendly to all guys? Or are most girls close-minded and easily freaked out? Or are you different from most girls?<br><br>What about Kenny himself? Is he low in confidence? Then why can he talk to you but not others? The fact that he can hold a decent conversation with no motive in mind shows something. Maybe he can apply the confidence he has communicating with you on other girls?<br><br>doko</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Meilin<br><br>I have a friend like yours.<br>I had such a hard time trying to get him to open his mouth to talk.<br>Neither interested in basketball or soccer, not into arts or anything. Just live<br>life plainly. Simply .... Boring....<br><br>The big issue is not him talking. It's him finding the right topics to talk about.<br><br>Your friend  has been given silent treatment a few times. Why?<br>Something he did not do, or something he had done wrong?<br>Using the wrong words?<br><br>I only managed to help my friend, by introducing him to a foreign person.<br>They are both not talkative, but they do know they have something<br>in common. GETTING MARRIED next year! Damn! Ang bao give a lot.<br>NO Mei ren hong bao.... Hai...<br><br>Anyway, the toast masters club might help me open up and talk first.<br>Perhaps after that, work out his mis-toned body if needed.<br><br>Best wishes for him.<br><br></div>
