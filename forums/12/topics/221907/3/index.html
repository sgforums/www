And learn from experiences. In fact, you will have to go through a certain amount of rejection, time and effort in sales before you can make a decent income. Same thing with women. You face the same thing. Everytime she throws you a rejection or objection, you must be thinking on your feet and learn how to counter. Even in office jobs.<br><br>It's like Wei Xiaobao.

And learn from experiences. In fact, you will have to go through a certain amount of rejection, time and effort in sales before you can make a decent income. Same thing with women. You face the same thing. Everytime she throws you a rejection or objection, you must be thinking on your feet and learn how to counter. Even in office jobs.<br><br>It's like Wei Xiaobao. He is quick thinking. That's how he win women's hearts. Salespeople make the best sweet talkers. They know what to say and how to say. They know how to get an idea across.<br><br>It is in this learn-by-failing mindset in sales that I find that provides invaluable lessons, that's why I recommend it, not to mention the chance to earn money. He has to try it if he like it.<br><br><span style="color: red;">On the other hand, if he really wants an alternative, there are always alternatives like clubbing, joining clubs, taking a language class, dancing class.<br>He has to be more proactive. The community centre has tonnes of programs.<br><br>I see no problem with this guy communicating. If not, how is it that the threadstarter is able to communicate with him?

You will never know if he's drawing strength (and good income) from his current career, doing something that he does best and probably feel positive out from it.<br><br>I will never request someone to be a wei xiao bao if he even got problem in communication - that's so idealistic. I rather focus on him as a person and expand his potential based on HIM as a centric force and not based on an idealistic, bizare model that will probably bring about disastrous result?<br><br>Change is necessary - but I would see changes as necessary changes and not mundane changes.<br><br>Pursue interest and expand social circle? Necessary (low cost high returns) as it address the problem and is actually a direct solution by itself.<br><br>Career switch? Unneccessary (High cost low returns) as we are on the assumption that he learns the skill of his new trade and by the time those skills trickle down into BGR skills... he would still have to expand social circle and that would take him years before he sees the fruit of that choice (that's of course if we presume nothing goes wrong along the way). That's an indirect solution - if you are telling me that kenny is under 20, then maybe? But certainly not for a guy at 26? It makes so much sense to learn communication as he expands his social circle and should he even faces rejection, his learning is closer to the crux of his problem, rather than being a little far-fetched?<br><br>Like I have said, this kenny guy isn't here to reveal the actual picture. And you are on the assumption that he feared rejection, while there might be a possibility that the root of problem isn't so much about the fear of rejection, although there might be some elements of it because the man himself isn't here to talk about it?<br><br>P.S: I don't usually reply to topics speaking on behalf of a third party, for most of the time, it's based on assumption and whatever replies being posted here isn't read by the man/woman themselves?
