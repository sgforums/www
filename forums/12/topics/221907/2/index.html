You are attached to another guy and he knows that it's sort of "impossible" between you two so that he can "act" himself. I suspect that he might have sort of unable to be himself when he knows other girls who are "available". In another word, I think he's too tensed when facing single girls.<br><br>Get him to socialised more and meet more people be it guys or gals. It'll boost up his social skill and hense his confidence level.
