              <p>you scare of people beating you up. Well, get fitter, join martial art or something. learning some self-defense is always good for health, fitness and protection. </p>
              <p>last time in sec school, there is also a lot of paikia from sec 5 and normals stream. usually they dont bother me. if they do offend me, I will look straight into their eyes, using the eye contact to tell them they are messing with the wrong guy. they will back off. they actually run away but when I try to make friend with them, their excuse is, "we are not the same type, we cannot mix and we dont want to teach you the bad things !!" huh?   </p>

              <p>You must be one those pampered kids. Mom and dad always at the forefront to protect you from harm, giving you a sheltered life, and constantly telling you never to resort to violence.</p>
              <p>You are not alone. Majority of parents are like that nowadays, and had experienced the bad old days of gangsterism in schools by dropouts and repeat students in public schools. It was rampant back in the 70s to the 80s when street gangs were rounded up by the police, leaving the 4th rate leaders looking at the young students for recruitment.</p>
              <p>Many of them are now being eradicated, both by the police and by society as we progressed and seek instead for academic achievements than the brawns displayed by mentally challenged ah bengs. They are a dying breed in schools. Only those suffering from inferiority complex would strut around showing off brawns by claiming to belong to gangs, which is actually street corner brats and not the fearsome monsters of their predecessors, are laughed at for their stupidity.</p>
              <p>By our protective parents still have such mentality of gangsterism in schools, and would not want their kids to be exposed in any way with such rabble. Your parents did a fine job, which accounts for you being unwilling to fight, a wise decision anyway.</p>
              <p>However, the question begs, why are you being bullied in the first place? No one, not even the fearsome gangsters of my past school years would just bully anyone for the sake of flexing some muscles. Most would be busy studying for tests and exams to bother about bullying or fighting nowadays.</p>
              <p>What had you done to deserve yourself to be specifically targetted for bullying?</p>
              <p>Are you a motor-mouth, the kind who open his mouth without engaging the brains and thus insulted others, an insensitivity you cannot feel about others? Are you the disgusting kind with equally disgusting habits that makes others pissed off and need to beat you into submission? Are you the kind that habitually 'sabo' others in games and class?</p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong in being peaceful and avoid fights. I grew up without violence in school as my interest was more in brainwork than brawns, even though I excelled in the swim team, never the first in inter school competitions, but at least within the top 3 and in relay team challenges. I was never involved in fights nor need to fight with anyone to pursue my goals. The only time i fought was during TKD and unarmed combat trainning during my army stint, and any further sanctioned violence was part of my duty to the country.</p>
              <p>Thus i find it hard to comprehend why you would be bullied, and for such a long time. Take a long hard look in the mirror and ask yourself why, and within that unvarnished truth will you be able to help yourself and overcome your sufferings.</p>
              <p>No one, absolutely no one, would simply bully another for no reason at all. Not even naive kids to another, even if the boy is slightly feminine which is not a sure sign of being a growing up gay, perhaps just a bit nerdy.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>You must be one those pampered kids. Mom and dad always at the
              forefront to protect you from harm, giving you a sheltered life,
              and constantly telling you never to resort to violence.</p>
              <p>You are not alone. Majority of parents are like that nowadays,
              and had experienced the bad old days of gangsterism in schools by
              dropouts and repeat students in public schools. It was rampant
              back in the 70s to the 80s when street gangs were rounded up by the
              police, leaving the 4th rate leaders looking at the young students
              for recruitment.</p>
              <p>Many of them are now being eradicated, both by the police and by
              society as we progressed and seek instead for academic achievements
              than the brawns displayed by mentally challenged ah bengs. They are
              a dying breed in schools. Only those suffering from inferiority
              complex would strut around showing off brawns by claiming to belong
              to gangs, which is actually street corner brats and not the
              fearsome monsters of their predecessors, are laughed at for their
              stupidity.</p>
              <p>By our protective parents still have such mentality of
              gangsterism in schools, and would not want their kids to be exposed
              in any way with such rabble. Your parents did a fine job, which
              accounts for you being unwilling to fight, a wise decision
              anyway.</p>
              <p>However, the question begs, why are you being bullied in the
              first place? No one, not even the fearsome gangsters of my past
              school years would just bully anyone for the sake of flexing some
              muscles. Most would be busy studying for tests and exams to bother
              about bullying or fighting nowadays.</p>
              <p>What had you done to deserve yourself to be specifically
              targetted for bullying?</p>
              <p>Are you a motor-mouth, the kind who open his mouth without
              engaging the brains and thus insulted others, an insensitivity you
              cannot feel about others? Are you the disgusting kind with equally
              disgusting habits that makes others pissed off and need to beat you
              into submission? Are you the kind that habitually 'sabo' others in
              games and class?</p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong in being peaceful and avoid fights. I
              grew up without violence in school as my interest was more in
              brainwork than brawns, even though I excelled in the swim team,
              never the first in inter school competitions, but at least within
              the top 3 and in relay team challenges. I was never involved in
              fights nor need to fight with anyone to pursue my goals. The only
              time i fought was during TKD and unarmed combat trainning
              during my army stint, and any further sanctioned violence was part
              of my duty to the country.</p>
              <p>Thus i find it hard to comprehend why you would be bullied, and
              for such a long time. Take a long hard look in the mirror and ask
              yourself why, and within that unvarnished truth will you be able to
              help yourself and overcome your sufferings.</p>
              <p>No one, absolutely no one, would simply bully another for no
              reason at all. Not even naive kids to another, even if the boy
              is slightly feminine which is not a sure sign of being a
              growing up gay, perhaps just a bit nerdy.</p>

              <p>actually kids or people bully because they can. and a lot of these bullies don't care about their studies so they won't be busy studying. They derive some form of satisfaction from the bullying.</p>
              <p>Anyway what the person needs to do is to stand up the bullies. It's actually much easier if they beat him. mental and psychological abuse is the harder one to confront, prove and punish.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px;">I can guarantee you are being bullied because of your reaction to bullying, not for any other reason. The advice seems trite, but you need to ignore the barbs directed at you.</span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Some hard and fast advice:</p>
              <p>1. Watch your body language.</p>
              <p>Keep your shoulders back, your head high and your eyes up. Any other posture is submissive and invites abuse. </p>
              <p>2. Do not react.</p>
              <p>If someone steals your bag and hides it. STOP. Have a brief look for the bag, if it is not where you expect to find it. Politely and CALMLY, without over reaction, ask if anyone has seen it. If nobody helps you locate the bag, wait patiently until they do, or in the worst case scenario report the loss to a teacher. AT NO POINT INDICATE TO ANYONE THAT YOU ARE EMOTIONALLY UPSET.</p>
              <p>If someone deliberately bumps you into a wall. Do NOT REACT. Stay calm, follow the advice in 1. and move on without retort. If you trust your voice, then ask directly and without emotion "What was that for?" The tone should enquiring, NOT emotional. This question does not have an answer. The real answer is "To see how you'd react," but most bully's don't realize or understand why they bully, only that it gets them attention and it feels good.</p>
              <p>If someone is verbally upsetting you, or commenting on deficiencies you believe you have. Do Not React. Do not clench your jaw. Do not roll your eyes. Do not hang your head. Do not take a deep breath. Do not get angry. Do not TRY to smile when you don't feel like smiling. ACT AS THOUGH NOTHING HAS HAPPENED. Your lack of response will deter future abuse much better than anything else.</p>
              <p>3. Look people in the EYE.</p>
              <p>Frank, unwavering eye contact will halt most non-aggressive abuse. However it will escalate physically aggressive abuse. Take care to ensure that your face does not reflect anything but askance when making eye contact. You are asking for the abusers response, rather than supplying your own. If you can force them to respond first, then you will have won the encounter, and they'll know it.</p>
              <p> 4. If you don't have something to say, keep your mouth shut.</p>
              <p> </p>
