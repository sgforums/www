Once bitten,twice shy.<br><br>I know u are a sentimental guy but she will never appreciate yr love only until the day. U stop loving her and the day she realise her mistake and know u are the one for her that she will turn back for u. Isn't it ironic?<br><br>Both of u are not fate together. Move on bro!</div>
