              <p>And yet you are resistant.</p>
              <p>Is that trying?</p>
              <p>I think first up, remove that wall of resistant. Understand that no matter what people suggest to you, <strong>they cannot force you to do what you do not want to do.</strong> You do not have to please all people. Do what you think is comfortable for you to try out gradually since you are going to be resistant to what you don't feel comfortable anyway.</p>
              <blockquote> I feel like I cannot be myself.</blockquote>
              <p>Then that's more reason to be yourself! If you feel trapped, depress and sad, that's the reason why!</p>
              <p>Find a time and place, alone or with friends (it is easier these days on the internet to find like-minded new friends, of course safety cautions still apply, always meet in public places), try something new, watch a movies, or do whatever you like. Join a CC or volunteer for an event (one-time affair only) and see if it helps boost your self-esteem. You can perhaps google for volunteer events such as <a href="http://www.childrensociety.org.sg/volunteer/concerns.htm">http://www.childrensociety.org.sg/volunteer/concerns.htm</a> (I typed in volunteer and click to find pages from Singapore)</p>
              <p>Or perhaps other forumnites have other events to suggest or other suggestions?</p>

              <p>For me, watch some nice drama on Youtube (this is one of my fav: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jICO-GUJYTk">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jICO-GUJYTk</a> Total 24 ep) and get inspired by the characters. And especially for girls who need to feel loved and pampered, doll up, get dressed, and do not feel guilty about it! And learn to ask for help in little ways and do not feel ashamed just because the society/media make us girls seem as if some super incredible superwomen who are supposed to be good at EVERYTHING! IMPOSSIBLE!</p>
              <p>Do something nice for yourself too because you deserve it. Tell yourself you're the sweetest being and because you are now empty and depleted, you need and deserve more love than anyone else. You're worth it.

              <p>Many people just don't get to become who they wish to be. And I mean MANY. If it's of any help or console at all, I'm just telling you you're not the only one. In fact, there're people who fall back into deeper sh|t holes than you do.</p>
              <p>You can just sit around get all UPSET and FUCKED about it. Or you can think of what you want to do about all these contructively next. Give yourself some time and opportunity. What I wish to say is that if you're genuinely putting in your efforts, all should not be just wasted with time. The least ya gain is experience. Sometimes luck is just not on your side. Other times there might just be something very wrong with you which you could probably make changes about. Find out which is which.</p>
              <p>I've been through sh|t too. If I've not waited this long and worked so hard, I won't have been who I am today. And no, I'm not saying I'm someone great, but at least there's improvements and achievements in my life. The rest of the things are just next steps to me. Even today I can tell you honestly I'm no longer an always very happy person I used to be. Sometimes like yourself, I might ask myself why. But the truth is often there're just too many theories contradicting themselves. Afterall, sometimes when life gets too complicated and overwhelm us, we should realise that we're just not super-computers made to solve everything in every aspects of our lives....</p>
              <p>In fact I'd been so suicidal that if I had let life take over me, I would not live to see who I am today...</p>
              <p>In life there'll always be ups and downs... It's just a matter of whether you're strong enough to see what's up next. And your own personality belief, perception and mentality towards life.... Perhaps you'll ask even if I keep up long enough to see what's next, how would I know if it's for better or worse...? Well... I'll say on the long run it'll depends on what you do about it.....</p>

              <p> Are you afraid of being judged? You said "my grade <strong>reflect </strong>so badly of me". Does your family or relatives and friends around you look at great school grades in awe? Do you have something ambitious you want to achieve in your lifetime that requires people to look up to you as some strong character for help? What is it deep inside your heart that you really want? Have you ask yourself? And <strong>is there really only one way to go about achieving your dreams?</strong> Is it more important for others to recognize you than for yourself to validate you?</p>
              <p><strong>What is it that you really want? </strong>Are you ashamed of yourself? Have you been made to feel ashamed of yourself? Don't hide. It seems to me that you have not been in honest touch with your true feelings. Pardon my presumptous deduction, but what impresses other people may not be what you are truly looking for <strong>deep down in your heart</strong>. Forget about family, friends, relatives or societal expectations! If this is exactly what you want for yourself, your <strong>mind and heart</strong> would not have such agonizing <strong>conflict</strong>. Let me give you an example. Several years back, I used to find it demeaning when my dad suggest I go into childcare. I thought a real woman of substance these days would not stoop herself to such a lowly qualified job when she could be out there pursuing a prestigious high-paying career. Thinking back now, I realized, <strong>no matter what qualifications one have or not, one shouldn't feel ashame to venture into one's own interest.</strong> Only back then, I was too snobbish (and  I consider myself a very humble person) to have even considered a career my dad suggested. Hence, in pursuit of what people might be impressed by and acknowledged, I did not even stop to think that I might really love to get in touch with the children or not. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"></p>
              <p>Maybe it's because <strong>you feel trapped. You think </strong>that in a mercenary society like this, we<strong> "need" </strong>good grades and excellent career in order to move ahead, to pursue "happiness". Well, that's usually the main objective in life isn't it? To be happy! We fall in love in hope to<strong> find happiness</strong> with our partner. We advance in our career or upgrade ourselves by taking more courses, in hope to <strong>provide more happiness </strong>to our loved one and ourselves.</p>
              <p>Ironically, this pursuit of "happiness" often leads us to the very abyss of unhappiness. Not only that, many of us, lost in this urban jungle, lost track of the reason <strong>WHY </strong>we are frantically working so hard in the first place.</p>
              <p>Therefore, I conclude, <strong>if you are not happy</strong>, even if you managed to achieve the grades you desire,<strong> it doesn't matter.</strong></p>
              <p>But how to be happy, you might ask. Well then, I guess, only you will have the answer because only you will know what is important to you. Is it to be able to enjoy the love and friendship with your loved ones by just being yourself? Then I guess, you'll have to find the right company to provide that. Not everyone gives us the validation we need and it is within our own self-respect that we decide to find the right friends who will acknowledge us instead of putting us down constantly. Or is it making a worthwhile contribution to society while you are still alive and healthy? Many organizations are looking for volunteers and you'll be moved by the delight you see on the faces of those being helped with only a little that you do for them.</p>

              <p>Subconsciously, this could also be your choice perhaps at this junction where you do not know what to do.</p>
              <p>So open up not only your eyes, but your heart. Ask yourself what do you really want for your happiness. Remember, misery is only a transition. This part of your life, is a growing platform, to propel us in the direction, of the pursuit of happiness. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
