            <div class='col-md body'>This man is possessive and is a control freak. He tried to dominate his woman. He may have won the girl by being nice initially but in due time, he has thrown his own pattern of tantrums which will deteriorate over time. When vgal stayed with him and rejected him later, he became very nasty because of his huge ego and because the man is uptight. This explains why why he got very uptight and stifled when he see other guys near his girl.<br><br>Vgal, you took the right choice. It may be painful at first but you won't get hurt by a possessive and jealous man.</div>
