How many gfs he had before and all dropped him ? Has he been doing this to all his gfs/wife? He is what I call a potential stalker.<br><br>What I feel is that he is desperate and doesn't wish to lose you. And he is doing a last ditch attempt to get you back, at all costs. What you are saying is logic to him but logic and emotions do not go hand in hand. Emotions always go against logic. His emotions had got the better of him. (Maybe he realised that he is fighting a losing war and knew that even though he can't get you, it is probably some kind of revenge for ditching him.)<br><br>Anyway, I believe you have made it clear to him. All that has been done has been done. The man seriously need to work on himself. All the education he has had gone down the drain. All the previous experiences with women all mean nothing except for sex. Why don't you just ask him to visit the sgforums Buddhist forums?(just kidding!)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>vgal,<br><br>From the look at it, it's best you run far away from him.  Don't care whether he's ok or not.  He's a grown-up.  He knows how to care for himself.<br><br>There have been cases whereby the guy doesn't want to let go the girl and ended up hurting the girl physically.<br><br>I am not certain whether he is capable of doing that.  But just stay away from him, cut off totally from him.  You have nothing to lose anyway.  After all, you have broken up with him.  This way, both you and him can move on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just ignore him. This kind of people are influenced by power and domination. The more you give him room to dominate or to play games, the more he will think he can play a fool.<br><br>Don't feed him. Best to just ignore him. At most change phone numbers and if you see him loitering around your place, immediately call the police and see who has the most fun then.<br><br>With regards to the video. Did you engage in sexual acts with him? If not, there is minimal risk of being compromised with any video.</div>
