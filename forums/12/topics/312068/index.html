              Hi all,
              
              http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/303413
              
              It had been in a pain for quite sometime,
              Ever since december last year,
              she ignore me, I didnt know why,
              I thou its because of something I done,
              and as per some people in the forum had say
              its because of the 3rd party.
              
              after suffering a few months,
              she finall told me, there is a 3rd party,
              but it ended quite sometime back,
              She avoiding me because she can't face me.
              
              I know she is in pain, and Im willing to forgive her
              as we were aready planning for married soemtime back,the planning stop will she start to ignore me.
              
              after a few chat with her,
              She say she can't face me.
              Is there anyway I can change her mind?
              I know she still got some feelings towards me but
              the guilty she have make us hard to be together again.
              
              And ofcause,
              if this things happen how many people here will 
              forgive his/her parthers?

              <p>maybe the reason that make her have a 3rd party is why she is reluctant to go back to the previous relationship you both have.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Either she cannot trust herself to be committed to you or she feels that there is something missing and marriage is for life u know..</p>

              Wat you have say make sense,
              beening with her for 3 years, It hard for me to move on,
              I wanted her back badly,
              Im so lost that I dunno what I can do, or what I can say to make her come back.
              
              Both of us cry..
              
              Now im only thinking that will she be happier if we break up.
              
              If she will be happier, I dun mind the pain.

              I will forgive her,

              <p>Are you sure you wanna continue this kind of relationship that has been scarred? The scar will forever be there, even if both of you will never talk about this issue anymore.</p>
              <p>She said she cannot face you, meaning that she feels that she's not worthy of your love. How long do you think this kind of relationship can last? 1 year or 2 years more?</p>
              <p>It's not about whether she will feel happier without you. It's the matter of whether she really loves you, although you said she "still got some feelings towards you".</p>
              <p>I just think that it's better to let go of her since both of you know that this isn't going any further.</p>

              <p>wow , u still like her after what she did to you???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U sure she still likes you? how sure are you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bad feeling bout this , dude. After she never get good ending with the 3rd party and now she told the truth?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TO me , she sounds like nobody to depend on and feeling lonely and this lead to finding you back. Perhaps she knows u still like him , and taking you for granted. but since u proposed to marry her, of course she doesnt feel good cuz its for life and she might not wan to dissapoint u.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IMO, the new r/s between u both wont b good... there will be many questions and doubt especially after what she did.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If i were you, i wont even start this r/s again. Ppl said, the person who betrayed you will likely to betray u again. Sometimes its the best to not be even friend with that person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The best for you. Whatever is your decision, hope you wont regret and hope there wont be any 3rd party again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U can forgive her but to be together with her will be a hard journey though.</p>
