Sometimes when you treat someone too well, they may NOT learn to appreciate you. Trust me. Maybe its time to seek another one, a replacement, you will feel much better and soon, you will be able to forget her. Trust me. There will be a time, when this another her replaces her. Maybe when she realise that shes losing you, she will then rein in. ANd come for you. that occurs 50% of the time. If she doesnt, I think Its time to get go.</div>

She (currently 29 yrs of age) is a very nice, thoughtful, pretty and caring. Through this 5 years we enjoyed each others company. Spend alot of our time together. Sometimes I sleep over at her place, whenever time is in favour. Come 3 and a half years of our relationship, I popped the question, asking for her hand in marriage. She mentioned that she is not prepared and not ready to commit, not because she comes from a broken family or had bad experience before. Relative and friends of ours are in favour. Finally abt a year ago, she decided to go ahead with the wedding plans.<br><br>We talked alot and decided to live together with my family and have the ROM in the first week of June 07. She and I were looking forward to the big day.<br><br>All arrangements has been made; JP, venue of ROM, invited guest, catering, ROM gown, flowers... everything... even collected the cert from ROM.<br><br>Then 3 days just before the ROM, she decided to call it off... She says she is not ready. She mentioned that she feels obliged to get married rather than wanting to get married.<br><br>She says that it is not my fault. She mentioned have been good to her and it is more than she asked for. She knows that I have been wanting to start a family with her but she is not ready and she also mentioned that she might not even want to get married...<br><br>The wedding day is over.<br><br>I met her 2 times to talk about the current state of our relationship. She mentioned that she needed time to think... needed 6 months or even longer... or even never to come to a solution. She added that during this period she wants me to seek for better pasture... and does not promise that we could be an item again.<br><br>I do not know how to discribe our current state of our relationship. She does still address me as baby, shows concern for me, sents me SMS/ MMS like we used to...<br><br>I may sound childish in this... I was allowed to hold her hand and stroke it not allowed to interlock our hands together...<br><br>I actually am at a lost of what to do of our relationship...<br><br>Her only explaination was that she is afraid to get married... with no deeper reason why...<br><br>Her 2 ex-bf had treated her badly. Not spending enough time with her, asking her for money.<br><br>During this past 5 years... I have always been assuring her and been faithful to her. As time went by my world revolves around her. Spending much of our time together when we are free.<br><br>Now that we are taking this time off. I feel like a part of myself missing.<br><br>She told me that she knows that I have been good to her and she could not find anyone else that treats her so well. If she is to go through this ROM it will be more of a obligation rather than love. And there is no other guys in her life currently. She asked me to look for other pastures during this cooling off period... I was dishearten. If I meant so much to her why would she asked me to look for other pastures...<br><br>I also have another interpretion of her asking me to look for other pastures... I worried that it might be as she does not want to hurt me so badly now... hopefully it does not hurt that much in 6 months.</div></blockquote>frm the day my ex broke with me, i spent much more time here in AA..<br>everyday, there's at least 1 thread abt r/s.. mostly is a never happy ending..<br>and i assume, and agree to some1, tht girls very hard to fathom..<br><br>yes u can say i think like this becoz of my ex broke with me..<br><br>and my feeling just exactly like how u feel now.. so sad, indeep inpain, and cant get her out frm mind... but time really can heal everything...<br><br>my ex broke with me just 3 weeks ago..<br><br>now i dont miss her like how i miss her last time, but i do still care and love her.. but i choose to not contacting her anymore..<br><br>last night, i just happen to saw her with her bf when i stepping out frm the lift, and she hide besie her bf dont even dare to look at me...<br><br>but wat can i do? still have to move on...<br><br>let me tell u,<br><br>no matter how many reply how we suggest, u will still inpain, the more u reply, post here will make u more sad.. but always remember, speak it out rather thn keep in ur heart..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>take care..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>R u willing to walk thru her ups and down without getting married? Loving a person doesnt mean u HAVE to get married.. Is base on 2 person willing to commited to each other.. If u r then dont presure her into marriage. Let the topic go and stand by her and prove it to her that u r willing to love her and stick with her even without the marriage commitment. Juz my opinion.. Good luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MetalGear:</div><div class="quote_body">bro..<br><br>Sometimes a girl is with a guy out of being used to the norm, vice versa. So when you proposed to her, it was like the jerking point of her to wake up and evaluate her position. I can even tell u that she might not really love love you. But more of like you coz of how you showed concern and attention to her. It does happen bro.<br><br>Anyway, you are 32. You can always seek other pastures easily. It's a fact that guys have the upper hand in marriages, they can marry much younger girls but it does not work vice versa. Sad, but true. So what I would recommend you to do is, be there for her. But dun be overwhelming and pushy. But start looking elsewhere. You have your priorities (find a good wife and start a family) etc, if she is not up to that, seriously, be honest with yourself and let her go.<br><br>A good analogy is stocks (i am a trader, so I think in terms of markets). You are like an investor. She is like a stock. Your love, time and effort for her is like your limited pool of funds. She was supposed to be a good stock but now she is put off by marriage and ask you to seek other pastures. So you should do as she says, start finding other 'stocks' to invest a little on standby. Whilst this girl takes her time to think through things, you just wait around n see if she is up to it. If she's not able to perform, you gotta 'pull out your funds from her and put it into another stock'.<br><br>You have your priorities, she is entitled to have hers too. If she can't meet yours forever, you can't stay around forever right? Cut your losses and move on. Remember the good times but really, be practical. Just like you gotta be financially stable to get married <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck</div></blockquote>oakley, i've been in your shoes and i know how you feel exactly. Of all the answers I've read, MetalGear has the best response.<br><br>One of the things you've got to understand is that women have this commitment fear right before marriage. I have heard this exact scenario happened to at least another 5 female friends of mine (and it happened to my ex-fiancee too)<br><br>The main reason stems from the fact that her heart is not ready to settle down. She does not want to tell you the truth because she's afraid to hurt you, but the truth is that she still wants to explore and she wants you to do the same to be fair to you. The reason why she agreed to ROM in the first place is probably because she was scared to say no to you because you're too nice to her and she does not want to hurt you with the truth.<br><br>I know your heart must be ripped to pieces now and you are probably thinking what the f**k have you done wrongly to deserve this treatment from her. The one thing you did wrongly was that you love her too much and was too nice to her. Sounds crazy, but women freaks out if their man is too nice to them.<br><br>You got to force yourself to stop communicating with her. Stop all SMS, ignore all her phonecalls, don't see her for 6 months. Don't let her take you for granted anymore. If she still loves you truly, she will come begging to come back together again and she will then dedicate her life 100% to you. If you carry on like this, it will be a worse problem to find out that your wife is cheating on you with another man.<br><br>Let me know if you want to have a drink together and need a listening ear. I can fully appreciate what you are going through because i've been in your shoes before. Sigh, women are complex creatures. Men are ok with stable relationships but women cannot take stable relationships.<br></div>
