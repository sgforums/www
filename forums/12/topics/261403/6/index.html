However, most importantly, you have to gain a control on your emotions and move on without thinking much about her.<br><br>You can move on by not really getting into another relationship immediately. Focus your attention in your career and your family members. I guess your parents also do not want to see you in this state. Spare a thought for them. Your friends support is also important but they will also get tired if you keep harping on the same issue. Dun look back.<br><br>If you have contacted her these past few weeks, it would have aggravated your opportunity to move on. For guys like us, you are still young and establishing your career and confidence is the most important.<br><br>I myself have been taking courses for my CPA and also taking CFA Level 1 exams this dec and also solely concentrate on my career. I also spend more time talking to my folks and visited my sister in Australia and her family. It was really a joy to see them there. Also got more opportunities to meet some of my friends that I have not kept in contact and also the current ones and that took a load of my mind.....<br><br>I am also moving on from a miss opportunity 6 months back and I admit it has not been smooth sailing but at least I am progressing to my objective.<br><br>The most important is to be accountable to your own mental well being, confidence and self esteem. She will not pity you if you are in your current state. In the first place, it was not meant to be and so please move on.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oakley1976,<br><br>look at the bright side. she decision to meet another gentleman was perhaps she just didn't want to feel obliged to be STILL with you. one of the easiest ways to get off the status-quo is by focusing on someone/somewhere else.<br><br>as mature a guy as you're, considering the fact that you planned for the marriage, wanted to start a new family, you know better what you're seeking after right this moment. perhaps you should just refocus your priority now.<br><br>i really think you may just do some scenarios planning now to get yourself off your misery, or so you think. let start with just one here:<br><br>work your a$$ off now even harder than before, imagine you just have to make $500k in the shortest time frame so she will come back to you. it really doesnt matter if she does or not. the idea is to put the energy of feeling upset on somewhere else.<br><br>or if $$$ is something less interesting to you now, try a new sport, pick up a new course, or etc. i strongly advise you not to DATE anybody as you will only feel more sad. you may act like you're in nirvana with the new gal, but you know deep down inside you will still miss her. that's not a good move as it may end up like the same circumstances in 5 years. just that your position may be the opposite.<br><br>do think positively and try to change the misery into someplace more valuable to you at this point of time. after all, you're 30's and i am sure you feel a little mid-life crisis, no?<br><br>do come back here to tell us your recent stage of mind so we will know you have been moving on well. perhaps you may just start by telling us jokes in here first?<br><br>take it ez, dude!</div>

Look at the bright side. Isn't it good to realise this problem and end it quickly rather than after marriage then witness it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sorry to say she dun love u. Having sex doesnt means equal to love you.<br>Women have their needs. Treating a women well doesnt means she will love you from the heart. You did not do thing that moved her or love you with her heart throughout those year. That why man should test ur girl whether she love you or just need company only. So you would not invest much time on a person that dun love u. Anyway u have her body but not soul. Dun worry, at least u got the body right ^^ Move on and dun waste ur time on her.</div>
