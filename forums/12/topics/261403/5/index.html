She found a guy that she think is much better and more handsome than you, so it time to jump  ship.<br>4. Her parents may think that your dowry is not enough.<br>5. She found out your bad habits and unheathy lifestyle, so she rejected you.<br>6. She maybe a lesbian<br>7. Her long lover may have return from overseas and for you, game over liao.<br>8.

I am a sentimental<br>woman and extremely sensitive and exquisite when it comes to relationship<br>and feelings, I yearn for romantic moments, as though a little boy yearning<br>for candy. And my husband, is just a contrast of me, his lack of<br>sensitivity, and of all, inability of bringing romantic moments into our<br>marriage has disheartened me about love. One day, I finally decided to tell<br>him my decision, that I want a divorce.<br><br>"Why?" he asked, shocking.<br><br>"I am tired, there aren't reasons for everything in the world" I answered.<br><br>He kept silent the whole night, seems to be in deep thoughts the whole<br>night<br><br>with cigarette lighted all the times.

Look deep into his eyes and I<br>slowly answered : "Here is a question, if you can find the answer in my<br>heart, I will change my mind, Let say, I love a flower at a mountain cliff,<br>and we both sure that the making you to pick the flower will cause death,<br>will you do it for me?"<br><br>He said :" I will give you your answer tomorrow....";; My heart just sink by<br>listening to his respond.<br><br>The next morning, he was not around, and I saw a piece of paper with his<br>scratching writing, underneath a glass of warm milk,<br><br>It goes....<br><br>"Dear, I would not pick that flower for you, but please allowed me ! to<br>fu rther explain the reasons "<br><br>This first line has already break my heart.
