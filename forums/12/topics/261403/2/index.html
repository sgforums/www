            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting thing is.<br><br>Her previous relationship, she never marries those guys. So why does it affect her current relationship which the TS mentioned, are totally different from the 1st 2 guys?<br><br>TS, her calling off the marriage like that, meant that she has not evasioned living her rest of her life with you.  Nor can she imagine her children to be liked you.<br><br>Asking you to seek greener pasture, just means that she is conscientious enough to tell you.<br><br>She cant settle with you.  You may be a great guy, may have been the best kind of guy any gal can wish for.  But at this time, at this stage in her life.  You arent that much of a ideal for her.<br><br>My favourite description has always been: Being the right guy, at the wrong time of her life.<br><br>If you are still available maybe 5 years later,  you might just be in time for when her biological clock is ticking, and both your pherohormones might match enough to give both of you a reason to get married, have kids and settle together.<br><br>Dont give up hope yet, because there has been examples of people breaking up. calling off weddings, and eventually still getting back together and raising a family.</div>

It is sad but true. She does not deserve your love. As mentioned by jojobeach, she is a romantic at heart. Also, the gal is already 29 and to make such a hugh decision not to go ahead with ROM shows that she is not ready to settle down because she feels you are not the guy for her.<br><br>Also, what is she thinking, after you propose to her and she agreed and later called off after so much preparation work was being done. I mean cant she take more time to consider about the proposal first? If I am that gal's parents, I will be angry with that gal. Pardon me for being traditional but some parents will be happy for their children's decision (to call off) cos they also do not want their children to have unhappy marriages.<br><br>I know you will be disheartened but the best thing to do is to move on. Go and find younger gals. I am around your age so I will more or less guess your financial position. If you are graduate and is at senior management position, you will be financially stable to provide a comfortable life for her, as mentioned in your response yourself that you have stable income. I am not trying to influence you to be selfish but I believe you deserve someone better.<br><br>Do not let her have the notion that you are still her "back up" plan. Thats why she proposed a 6 month "cooling off" period. The truth is she still cannot forget about her ex-bf who treated her badly. Maybe in that relationship, she has given her all and her supposely "Prince Charming" did not turn out to be a happy fairy tale ending. I believe there is no third party and she is just not ready to settle down because of her past failed relationship.<br><br>Be kind to yourself and get attached to younger and prettier gals. Let her regret for what she has done. As mentioned by jojobeach, if you stick around, she may eventually accept your marriage. But seriously as a guy, would you want to accept someone again who has rejected you big time before? What would your relatives and frens ask you....."Is she very sure now????"<br><br>I hope your mentality will not be like this "You have everything that you wanted in your life, a stable job, you being a nice and eligible bachelor; just that you cannot have the gal that you want (at this moment), that makes you feel at a loss or disheartened".<br><br>Move on, be it in your career or social circle of frens.<br><br>Disclaimer:<br>Btw I hope my comments are not strong and heaily bias against the gal and that the gal is wrong and also I have not experienced rejected proposal/ROM. My frens always commented I am a MCP and I do not disagree with them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>I wish Oakley1976 all the best in finding someone who will appreciate and treasure him. I believed his frens will also advise him the way I did.</div>

Think you must be patient. Don't give her so much pressure for now... wait a while... be a friend for now... don't bring up marriage. Go for vacation, take the time to focus on your career ok? Make some good money and bring her out for vacation, loosen up a bit.<br><br>If you really want to make this work you mustn't be too occupied with getting hurt. Must hurt then can find love. Everything in life is a gamble. Everything. Including love and being with the woman you love. That is all you can do for now.<br><br>There are other factors beyond your control too.

The previous times u talk with her, it seems she is being vague about certain things. Tell her that no one is forcing her to get married, that you will be by her side when she needs u. However, it is unfair for the both of u to carry on in this ambigious state.<br><br>Ask her what she wants. More importantly, ask her if she loves u still, or is she just being with u in this relationship just because of "xi guan" I hate to say it, but it sounds to me that it is the latter. She said that is more of a obligation to get ROM with u. If she's in love with u, she won't say that. Ask her what's the most important thing in her life right now. Is it work? Freedom? Or you? Tell her(but only if u yourself can handle it) that you are willing to let her free, and break up with her just as long as she ask for it. Just do not keep quiet, and let time solve everything, because it won't.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>My husband is a scientist by profession, I love him for his steady-being<br>nature, and I love the warm feeling while lean against his broad shoulder.<br><br>Three years in the courtship and now, two years into marriage, I would have<br>to admit, I am getting tired of it, the reasons of me loving him before has<br>now transform into the cause of all the restlessness. I am a sentimental<br>woman and extremely sensitive and exquisite when it comes to relationship<br>and feelings, I yearn for romantic moments, as though a little boy yearning<br>for candy. And my husband, is just a contrast of me, his lack of<br>sensitivity, and of all, inability of bringing romantic moments into our<br>marriage has disheartened me about love. One day, I finally decided to tell<br>him my decision, that I want a divorce.<br><br>"Why?" he asked, shocking.<br><br>"I am tired, there aren't reasons for everything in the world" I answered.<br><br>He kept silent the whole night, seems to be in deep thoughts the whole<br>night<br><br>with cigarette lighted all the times. My feeling of disappointment is<br>getting intense, a man who can't even express his detainment, what else can<br>I hope from him? And finally he asked :" What can I do to change your<br>mind?"<br>Somebody said it right, it's hard to change a person's personality, and I<br>guess, I have started losing faith in him. Look deep into his eyes and I<br>slowly answered : "Here is a question, if you can find the answer in my<br>heart, I will change my mind, Let say, I love a flower at a mountain cliff,<br>and we both sure that the making you to pick the flower will cause death,<br>will you do it for me?"<br><br>He said :" I will give you your answer tomorrow...."; My heart just sink by<br>listening to his respond.<br><br>The next morning, he was not around, and I saw a piece of paper with his<br>scratching writing, underneath a glass of warm milk,<br><br>It goes....<br><br>"Dear, I would not pick that flower for you, but please allowed me ! to<br>fu rther explain the reasons "<br><br>This first line has already break my heart. I continue reading.<br><br>"You can only type with computer and always messed up the programs in the<br>PC, and cries in front of screen, I have to saved my fingers so that I can<br>help to restore the programs. You always left the house key behind, I have<br>to save my legs to rush home for opening the door for you. You love<br>traveling but always lose your way in a new city, I have to save my eyes to<br>leads you the way.<br><br>You always has the cramp whenever your "good friend" approach every month,<br>I<br>have to save my palm so that I can calm the cramp at your tummy. You like<br>to<br>stays indoor, and I worries that you will be infected by infantile autism.<br><br>I have to save my mouth to tells you jokes and stories to cure your<br>boredom.<br>You always stared at the computers, and that do no good to your eyes, I<br>have<br>to save my eyes so that when we grow older, I can help to clip your<br>nails,and help to removed those annoying white hairs. I will hold your<br>hand,<br>stroll down the beach, enjoying the sunshine and the beautiful sands...<br>tells you the colour of flowers, just like the glow on your young face...<br><br>Thus, my dear, before I am sure there are someone who loves you more than I<br>do... I would not pick the flower, and die.. "<br><br>My tears drops on the letters, and blurred the ink of his hand writing...<br>and I resume my reading...<br><br>"And now, dear... you have finished reading my answer, if you are satisfied<br>with these answers, please open the door of our house, I am standing<br>there,with your favorites bread and fresh milk... I rush to pull open the<br>door, and saw his anxious face, with his hand holding tight on the milk and<br>bread.... Oh I am sure no one ever love me as much, and now I have decided<br>to leave the flower alone...<br><br><strong>That's life, or some said, love, when one is surrounded by love, the<br>feeling<br>of excitement fade away, and one tend to ignore the ! true love lies in<br>between<br>the peace and dullness.</strong><br><br>Love shows in any form, even a very little and corny form, it has never<br>been<br>a model, it could be the most incurious form.. . flowers, romantic moments<br>is only the buckish formed on the surface of the relationship.<br><br>Under all these, the pillar of truelove stands... and that's our life... I<br>hope everyone enjoy reading it... love, but not words win the arguments...</blockquote>A very old story but meaningful as ever.<br>Many people tend to over look peace and dullness.<br>Jia you!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think it's a blessing in disguise the ROM didn't materialise. Can you imagaine the agony and the suffering TS have to go through if after a few months or worse a few years later into the marriage wants a divorce?<br><br>TS should feel lucky no major damage was done to him emotionally yet. He should go out and give himself a chance to truly look for someone who is more worthy of his love and affection.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you want my opinion... it would hurt.<br><br>I feel that the girl is merely taking a liking to TS and not actual love itself. She do not dislike him but it does not meant that she really love him.<br><br>I think that she discovered it long ago and thus had been avoiding the commitment. It could be the fact that TS is treating her too well that make her wanting to commit to repay his kindness.<br><br>I think that she was fooling herself all along and finally when the date drew near, her feet became cold and decided to back out of the commitment.<br><br>Do not feel dishearted. The cooling period could be a good step. It allow her to think thoroughly and decide who is the one for her. That is provided that no one is actually present in her life now or comes into her life during this period.<br><br>It would be better to end as it is then to drag on with years of sorrow and bitterness that actually will smear the least friendship that could actually exist between you and her.<br><br>So, for now. You can either wait for her reply or look for a new love. Do not add pressure on her as it will only lessen the chance of her coming back for you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
