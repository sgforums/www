She (currently 29 yrs of age) is a very nice, thoughtful, pretty and caring. Through this 5 years we enjoyed each others company. Spend alot of our time together. Sometimes I sleep over at her place, whenever time is in favour. Come 3 and a half years of our relationship, I popped the question, asking for her hand in marriage. She mentioned that she is not prepared and not ready to commit, not because she comes from a broken family or had bad experience before. Relative and friends of ours are in favour. Finally abt a year ago, she decided to go ahead with the wedding plans.<br><br>We talked alot and decided to live together with my family and have the ROM in the first week of June 07. She and I were looking forward to the big day.<br><br>All arrangements has been made; JP, venue of ROM, invited guest, catering, ROM gown, flowers... everything... even collected the cert from ROM.<br><br>Then 3 days just before the ROM, she decided to call it off... She says she is not ready. She mentioned that she feels obliged to get married rather than wanting to get married.<br><br>She says that it is not my fault. She mentioned have been good to her and it is more than she asked for. She knows that I have been wanting to start a family with her but she is not ready and she also mentioned that she might not even want to get married...<br><br>The wedding day is over.<br><br>I met her 2 times to talk about the current state of our relationship. She mentioned that she needed time to think... needed 6 months or even longer... or even never to come to a solution. She added that during this period she wants me to seek for better pasture... and does not promise that we could be an item again.<br><br>I do not know how to discribe our current state of our relationship. She does still address me as baby, shows concern for me, sents me SMS/ MMS like we used to...<br><br>I may sound childish in this... I was allowed to hold her hand and stroke it not allowed to interlock our hands together...<br><br>I actually am at a lost of what to do of our relationship...<br><br>Her only explaination was that she is afraid to get married... with no deeper reason why...<br><br>Her 2 ex-bf had treated her badly. Not spending enough time with her, asking her for money.<br><br>During this past 5 years... I have always been assuring her and been faithful to her. As time went by my world revolves around her. Spending much of our time together when we are free.<br><br>Now that we are taking this time off. I feel like a part of myself missing.<br><br>She told me that she knows that I have been good to her and she could not find anyone else that treats her so well. If she is to go through this ROM it will be more of a obligation rather than love. And there is no other guys in her life currently. She asked me to look for other pastures during this cooling off period... I was dishearten. If I meant so much to her why would she asked me to look for other pastures...<br><br>I also have another interpretion of her asking me to look for other pastures... I worried that it might be as she does not want to hurt me so badly now...<br>hopefully it does not hurt that much in 6 months.</div></blockquote>Sad to read this.....<br><br>but at least she was being honest with you..<br><br>and yet the truth hurts....<br><br></div>
