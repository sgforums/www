When I first got to know her, they were still together, so I just didn't bother to hit on her or tried to get close to her out of respect to my friend.<br><br>Later on, some stuff happened, and they broke up. I took the chance and decided to hit on her. And yeah, slowly, we started chatting thru MSN, had webcam/audio sessions etc.<br><br>I was getting to know her better and she was doing the same with me...Both of us being very honest with each other, telling stuff and all. I was truly falling head over heels with her each day, and she likes me as well. I would be so happy to talk to her each day, listen to her problems, call her "dear" etc... With<br>the utmost sincerity in my heart...<br><br>Yeah, I guess I forgot to mention... She's a Chinese girl who immigrated to Perth since young, so she's pretty much an Australian now, grew up with the culture there and all...heck, accent is there as well. So yeah, this is a long distance relationship...<br><br>Anyways,...the MAIN point of this long story is that... one night, we were chatting, and I decided to be really nice and devote my full attention and seriousness in answering her questions and listening to her.<br><br>Afterawhile, she decided to tell me something that left me quite stunned. Well, being the noob here (she's sort of like my first gf, I've never been in a relationship before) I didn't know whether it was right.<br><br>Basically she told me that she had sex with her former bf (my former guild leader, he was her first), and naturally that means she's no longer a virgin and well, her first time has been taken by that guy.<br><br>I felt quite angry and upset about it. After that night, I've been trying to tell myself that it's no big deal and all. Sometimes, I managed to stay cool and normal for the day, but at other times, I get relapses of anger and feel upset...the thoughts keep haunting me... She even told me that people there pretty much lose it during their teens...<br><br>Right now, I just can't seem to shower her with that sincere love, affection and attention like I used to... I've thought of dropping her to end this internal hell within me, but yet, I tell myself the reason I'm feeling this way is because I love her... But yet, the pain can be so unbearable at times...<br><br>I'm not some holy, faithful Catholic that goes to mass every Sunday. On the contrary, I rarely say a prayer  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> So, this is nothing to do with religion, but either my personal beliefs or my newbishness to being cool with such things...<br><br>Can you guys tell me what should I do? Whether or not I'm being an idiot making a big deal over something small?</div></blockquote>Noone is perfect even when comes to Love &amp; Relationship..<br><br>Is a psychology barrier.. if you can break it thru.. you won't be pondering over these matters.. But also don't try to force yourself to do something which you think you won't be able to make it.. Don't lie to yourself and her! It hurts.. Since you both ain't even officially together.. then is time for you to seriously think about this matter..<br><br>Whether you can or cannot accept is your decision.. She has made a choice of telling.. i bet she has also prepared something bad to come out.. Either she will have you.. or she'll be left with nothing.. She's brave enough to tell you what has happened.. And not until the day you both were together...<br><br>Imagine she tells you this after not long you both are an item.. Will you feel betrayed.. A knife piercing thru your heart.. Ouch! that's gonna hurt!<br><br>Either you have it all or nothing.. is all up to your decision.. whether you can break thru these barrier yourself anot.. There's noone can help.. Only you can help yourself.. In any case.. is her virginity really that important to you?? If in this world there's no more virgin.. and you really found someone who you think can spend your life with till death..

When I first got to know her, they were still together, so I just didn't bother to hit on her or tried to get close to her out of respect to my friend.<br><br>Later on, some stuff happened, and they broke up. I took the chance and decided to hit on her. And yeah, slowly, we started chatting thru MSN, had webcam/audio sessions etc.<br><br>I was getting to know her better and she was doing the same with me...Both of us being very honest with each other, telling stuff and all. I was truly falling head over heels with her each day, and she likes me as well. I would be so happy to talk to her each day, listen to her problems, call her "dear" etc... With<br>the utmost sincerity in my heart...<br><br>Yeah, I guess I forgot to mention... She's a Chinese girl who immigrated to Perth since young, so she's pretty much an Australian now, grew up with the culture there and all...heck, accent is there as well. So yeah, this is a long distance relationship...<br><br>Anyways,...the MAIN point of this long story is that... one night, we were chatting, and I decided to be really nice and devote my full attention and seriousness in answering her questions and listening to her.<br><br>Afterawhile, she decided to tell me something that left me quite stunned. Well, being the noob here (she's sort of like my first gf, I've never been in a relationship before) I didn't know whether it was right.<br><br>Basically she told me that she had sex with her former bf (my former guild leader, he was her first), and naturally that means she's no longer a virgin and well, her first time has been taken by that guy.<br><br>I felt quite angry and upset about it. After that night, I've been trying to tell myself that it's no big deal and all. Sometimes, I managed to stay cool and normal for the day, but at other times, I get relapses of anger and feel upset...the thoughts keep haunting me... She even told me that people there pretty much lose it during their teens...<br><br>Right now, I just can't seem to shower her with that sincere love, affection and attention like I used to... I've thought of dropping her to end this internal hell within me, but yet, I tell myself the reason I'm feeling this way is because I love her... But yet, the pain can be so unbearable at times...<br><br>I'm not some holy, faithful Catholic that goes to mass every Sunday. On the contrary, I rarely say a prayer  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> So, this is nothing to do with religion, but either my personal beliefs or my newbishness to being cool with such things...<br><br>Can you guys tell me what should I do? Whether or not I'm being an idiot making a big deal over something small?</div></blockquote>It is not her that is making u angry. Its u urself that is making urself angry over the matter. Coz u compared the her u perceived in ur mind against ur beliefs and values and the discrepancies make u angry. Its time u revise ur beliefs and values, looking at them what is alr obsolete and so discard them. If u still think that a virgin is impt, then look for one.<br><br>The actual her, and the her perceived by u may be different coz u will interpret her with ur thinking.<br><br>Good luck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AlexJS, I can understand ur situation. I am also a guy who places significant importance on a girl's virginity.<br><br>My view is, if u cant change ur perceptions and cant compromise and not willing to accept her as she is less than ideal in ur view now, then just treat her as a good friend. U can try finding a life partner who is a virgin. So u have to change gear, from treating her as a GF, to treating her as a good friend now.<br><br>If u can compromise, then u may continue treating her as a GF.<br><br>So the question is, can u change ur perceptions? How valuable is this girl for u to change ur perceptions? If u cant, treat her as a good friend. It's still a form of love, but not like that kind of love.</div>

I totally understand what you are saying. It's true that my thinking has been rather shallow, probably due to the noobishness in me.<br><br>Yeah, you are right about that... I have to stop looking at such small things and look at the bigger, more important picture. And to know what matters most :]<br><br>I've been thinking about it for the whole day, and I kinda realised that maybe, I'm like this because I've yet to experience the simple joys of going out with her...watching a movie with her..having lunch with her etc... and some other thoughts  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And that's why... I have decided to stop being an idiot, and not let such a thing come between us.
