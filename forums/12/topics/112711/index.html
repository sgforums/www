            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I decided to join this forum hoping to find people who could guide me to a decision or at least make me clear of what's in store for me for whatever choices there are...<br><br>I got to know this girl thru playing an online game, as her bf was like my guild leader. When I first got to know her, they were still together, so I just didn't bother to hit on her or tried to get close to her out of respect to my friend.<br><br>Later on, some stuff happened, and they broke up. I took the chance and decided to hit on her. And yeah, slowly, we started chatting thru MSN, had webcam/audio sessions etc.<br><br>I was getting to know her better and she was doing the same with me...Both of us being very honest with each other, telling stuff and all. I was truly falling head over heels with her each day, and she likes me as well. I would be so happy to talk to her each day, listen to her problems, call her "dear" etc... With<br>the utmost sincerity in my heart...<br><br>Yeah, I guess I forgot to mention... She's a Chinese girl who immigrated to Perth since young, so she's pretty much an Australian now, grew up with the culture there and all...heck, accent is there as well. So yeah, this is a long distance relationship...<br><br>Anyways,...the MAIN point of this long story is that... one night, we were chatting, and I decided to be really nice and devote my full attention and seriousness in answering her questions and listening to her.<br><br>Afterawhile, she decided to tell me something that left me quite stunned. Well, being the noob here (she's sort of like my first gf, I've never been in a relationship before) I didn't know whether it was right.<br><br>Basically she told me that she had sex with her former bf (my former guild leader, he was her first), and naturally that means she's no longer a virgin and well, her first time has been taken by that guy.<br><br>I felt quite angry and upset about it. After that night, I've been trying to tell myself that it's no big deal and all. Sometimes, I managed to stay cool and normal for the day, but at other times, I get relapses of anger and feel upset...the thoughts keep haunting me... She even told me that people there pretty much lose it during their teens...<br><br>Right now, I just can't seem to shower her with that sincere love, affection and attention like I used to... I've thought of dropping her to end this internal hell within me, but yet, I tell myself the reason I'm feeling this way is because I love her... But yet, the pain can be so unbearable at times...<br><br>I'm not some holy, faithful Catholic that goes to mass every Sunday. On the contrary, I rarely say a prayer  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> So, this is nothing to do with religion, but either my personal beliefs or my newbishness to being cool with such things...<br><br>Can you guys tell me what should I do? Whether or not I'm being an idiot making a big deal over something small?</div>
