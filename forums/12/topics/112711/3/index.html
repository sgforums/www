When I first got to know her, they were still together, so I just didn't bother to hit on her or tried to get close to her out of respect to my friend.<br><br>Later on, some stuff happened, and they broke up. I took the chance and decided to hit on her. And yeah, slowly, we started chatting thru MSN, had webcam/audio sessions etc.<br><br>I was getting to know her better and she was doing the same with me...Both of us being very honest with each other, telling stuff and all. I was truly falling head over heels with her each day, and she likes me as well. I would be so happy to talk to her each day, listen to her problems, call her "dear" etc... With<br>the utmost sincerity in my heart...<br><br>Yeah, I guess I forgot to mention... She's a Chinese girl who immigrated to Perth since young, so she's pretty much an Australian now, grew up with the culture there and all...heck, accent is there as well. So yeah, this is a long distance relationship...<br><br>Anyways,...the MAIN point of this long story is that... one night, we were chatting, and I decided to be really nice and devote my full attention and seriousness in answering her questions and listening to her.<br><br>Afterawhile, she decided to tell me something that left me quite stunned. Well, being the noob here (she's sort of like my first gf, I've never been in a relationship before) I didn't know whether it was right.<br><br>Basically she told me that she had sex with her former bf (my former guild leader, he was her first), and naturally that means she's no longer a virgin and well, her first time has been taken by that guy.<br><br>I felt quite angry and upset about it. After that night, I've been trying to tell myself that it's no big deal and all. Sometimes, I managed to stay cool and normal for the day, but at other times, I get relapses of anger and feel upset...the thoughts keep haunting me... She even told me that people there pretty much lose it during their teens...<br><br>Right now, I just can't seem to shower her with that sincere love, affection and attention like I used to... I've thought of dropping her to end this internal hell within me, but yet, I tell myself the reason I'm feeling this way is because I love her... But yet, the pain can be so unbearable at times...<br><br>I'm not some holy, faithful Catholic that goes to mass every Sunday. On the contrary, I rarely say a prayer  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> So, this is nothing to do with religion, but either my personal beliefs or my newbishness to being cool with such things...<br><br>Can you guys tell me what should I do? Whether or not I'm being an idiot making a big deal over something small?</div></blockquote>Hi dude,<br>Let me give you an example of myself. I was..and I mean 'was'..an ultra traditional guy..I always 'wanted' a gal who is a virgin..so that I will be her 'first guy' to be 'so-called physically intimate' with.<br><br>I used to ask my friends.."Hey..will you ever accept a wife/gf who is a non-virgin??" Most of them replied "Yes". Whenever I hear this, I will always laugh it off and said "Yeah sure! Haha..now you can say this..few years down the road..when you are making love half-way wif her..then you remember..this woman has already been touched/intercourse/kissed/banged etc etc..by a guy/few guys before me...When the fresh puppy love dies down..over the years..when you are tired of the relationship..you will regret.."<br><br>And then I will also think of the fact that one day..the guy standing next to you and wife/gf will be her ex who has already seen/touched everything that has of her body.. etc etc.....<br><br>So when my 2nd gf (current one) told me she has never had sex but has been 'touched' before by her ex....I was initially in a fit of storm. I was so frustrated..so angry..so jealous..so uncertain..that I initially wanted to break up just because of this........anyway, I decided not to..and carry on with her daily.......though I dun desire really that she will be my future wife..no matter how much we love each other...<br><br>Now..here's my turning pt......after months together.....I realised that those 'ultra traditional' thoughts of mine..................were JUST PLAIN SELFISH AND COMPLETE IDIOTIC of me!! I start to realise that as the days passed..i dun seem to mind all these anymore...i asked myself why?? why??<br><br>Simple.................because there is this thing called 'REAL LOVE'....I finally get to realise....when someone loves the person so much...all those so called 'virginity issues'....are just plain BULLSHIT...<br><br>It doesnt matter the fact that my gf is a virgin in the first place. Even if not, I wouldnt mind now. Why? Because life is so short..nobody knows when we will leave this world some day......to find a person who is able to love you..who is willing to share all times together with you..then even if we were to leave this world one day..it will be without regrets....<br><br>I was totally wrong and ignorant in the past...we learn from our mistakes..don't live to regret it. There are still so many things in this world that we can look forward to or bother with....why care about a thin piece of skin??<br><br>Trust me dude..now you tink of this becos you have not really gone into a relationship with her yet.......that's why there are uncertainty within you....<br><br>When it really happens....and your love for each other grew.....you will begin to see  the same things...all these are just superficial...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I reviewed the first post and decided to jump in with my two cents. (I have not checked other responses yet. And in the event that I post something similar if not identical to someone else previously, I take no responsibility for which I am about to say. Whatsoever.)<br><br>I think she's having fun with you. And I think you should just try having fun with her. She's telling you things, being honest because she wants to set the record level with you. In that way, you'll be under no illusions that all she wants with you is your companionship, coupled with sex, if its do-able.<br><br>You should therefore, brood no further, and committ yourself to a fb relationship. Take it any further and you are fried, toasted and next morning's breakfast.<br><br>In the grand scheme of things, the first girl you sleep with would not be doing it the first time with you. Somewhere, someone can probably post some figures. But let's just put it at 10-15%. I have no idea where I pluck this figure from but if you wish to call me out on that, by all means. I have no evidence to show for.<br><br>Therefore, I shall not digress. Please do not fancy virginity to be some gift, purely on the basis that you retain yours, waiting to offer it to the "right" person. In fact, I would very much rather be broken in by someone who's experience in this matters surpass at least 4 events. I say, now's a valuable chance for you to do just that.<br><br>So there, stick it! Do the fb thing. And if anyone needs to know what fb is, it refers to a f-buddy. Or if you are more prudish, you can use bonk buddy. sama sama lah.<br><br>OTOH, if you let her, she can and will break your heart. Cest la vie.<br><br></div>
