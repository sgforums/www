              <p>hi all asking this on behalf on my cousin<br><br><br>she's a part timer with one of those counter brands and was caught when she tried to bring out some samples when knocking off. happened yest night only so right now no actions have been taken. <br><br>just wanna ask what the possible consequences are (first time offender)? cos right now the company have not yet been informed by the departmental store since it was after office hrs. my cousin is unsure of what to do. should she:<br><br>1) inform the company 1st thru email and apologise etc<br>2) wait for the departmental store to inform the company then see how it goes.<br>3) the manager from the store might call her b4 informing the company (hopefully) to clarify stuff so she shld talk to the manager and ask for another chance etc. dont inform the company...<br><br>the above are all thought by me so dunno if they work.<br><br>the thing is, my cousin has alr tendered her resignation (working till end of sept) so it doesnt really matter if the company terminates her employment. in fact, no contract or whatever was signed since the job offer was verbal. she jsut hopes that things would not blow up or worse, become a police case. <br><br>what i suggest is that she wait to see if the manager calls then try to see if they can just give a warning and not report to company. if they wont, she shld then immediately let her company know (but this will be hard to put across so i suggested email). in the email she can then explain things and most imptly, request to bring forward the resignation since under such circumstances it will be inappropriate for her to comtinue working, even if it's only till end of the mth. aplogise and offer to compensate for not serving the notice period etc. basically be really sincere and hope that the company would not report to the police. <br><br>what do u all think?</p>
              <p>right now she hasnt heard anything from either the company or the departmental store and it's almost half the day alr. my cousin is getting pretty anxious and unsure of what to expect. and she's not sure if she shld still go to work.<br><br>i was thinking shld she confess to the company 1st (though not sure if the store reported this incident to the company)? or pretend nth happened and wait till someone contacts her... </p>

              <p>last day of work so she was thinking if she took something it will be difficult to trace back to her right? looks like it was premeditated IMO.</p>
              <p>if she hadn't been caught she probably would have done it again. or gotten bolder and steal more valuable items.</p>

              <p>I don't think it is going to become a police case because she took away samples, not sales products.  She might get a reprimand or they might close one eye, depending on the department store mangement. </p>

              <p>just to clarify...it wasnt her last day of work. and i used the term petty theft bcos it's really calssified as that, as in theft below a certain amt is known as petty theft, as opposed to grand theft. not trying to make it sound nicer..</p>
              <p>so far till now she hasnt heard anything from either the management or the company...so she's really uncertain. not knowing what's gg on</p>
