              <p><br>Look at it this way. When you fall for someone, u fall for someone. Its all up to the individual to determine if he/she should end the relationship should the person they love turned out to be someone already married. It is only when you go all out to wreck someone's marriage/relationship just so u can be with that person do i disapprove totally.</p>
              <p>Besides, if the married person knows well enough where his/her priorities lie, then they would never end the relationship/marriage just to be with someone else. Temptations are everywhere, its only in times of crisis do we know one's true strengths.</p>

              <p>.....a woman who had self confidence will not go round snatching other people's husband, just to make herself feel desirable. The women you mentioned certainly had low confidence. Women with low confidence always find a way to make themselves look good by buying expensive and branded products.

              <p>You are correct. Just because a woman looks good on the outside.. does not mean she is just as flawless on the inside.</p>
              <p>Some women do suffer from self-confidence or self-esteem problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One night stand or fark buddies are not always available. The easiest are the married ones who is ready for a extra marital affair.</p>
              <p>Let's face it.. married men are not as picky as single guys. Even a one night stand or fark buddies has a higher requirement than a married man. So yes.. married men are easier to bag.</p>
              <p>There's nothing to do with the woman's level of intellect, rather the level of self-centered thinking she possess.</p>
