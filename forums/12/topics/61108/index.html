Though of course, it's always easier said than done?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>However, understand that no relationship is usually a perfect sailing... Whatever adjustments you've made for the relationship or your partner, you'll still expect some changes from time to time... In other words, if you fall? Get up and LEARN from your mistakes again... No SHORTCUTS, sorry... You want shortcuts? My personal advice.... DON'T fall in love....</div>

You feel that going through an online relationship with a Malaysian over a LDR wouldn't be that as well? Fear that it would fail? Here's a truth -once you entered a relation, like condom, even the best ones have 0.01% of failing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Your ex is your first love; in the first place, without her, do you actually think you will know what you really want in a girl? Or do you not know even now? You have difference with your ex - do you understand that such are inevitable events in love and have you actually realise what are the learning pointers behind the conflicts?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You want a good, fulfilling relationship and this requires constant enlightenment. Nobody can enlighten you to path of a happiness relationship - you are the only driver. Love without making too much mistake is the goal everyone is seeking - you are of no exception. You admit you are suspicious and possessive - you have ever done anything to correct it? These are flaws to create cracks in your possible love and many others, whom you never state or never knew.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Your current situation? LDR is difficult ball game. You met her through internet and you said you have problem trusting woman, then what makes you trust her? Online, overseas and preception based purely on her words and voice? My view is that chances are, you will triggering what you feared; futile relationship.<br><br>P.S: Again like condom, the freak cases have this 0.01% of making it work. I am not saying that the figure above represent your hope in maintaining this relationship with her - however, if you chose to seek lower risk relationship, in the first place, you wouldn't and shouldn't even have consider this proposal at all. I understand your conscious and subconscious needs - she could be just around.<br><br>Are you a Scorpio or a Libra?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

You are doing yourself a dis-service and being unfair to yourself and ppl affilated. What you think is always faster than how you feel in your heart. It takes time to accept the pasts and find true love...Give yourself a chance by allowing time and love around you to recover.<br><br>You will become unpossesive when you know deep inside your heart that you can't live without this person, yet you accept who he/she is and really want him/her to be truly happy(of coz he/she must feel the happiness).... to understand and to know her more....become happy when she's happy..sad when she's sad...Then she  most probably The One if she feels the same for you and able to complete you.Making her happy sounds really simple but the most important and the hardest during the crunch.<br><br>My personal view is, no offence to anyone.....why depend on astrology as a 'mirror' where you already have 'mirrors' inside yourself and ppl who really understands you.
