It just pains to see the guy wasting his time when all he needs to see is a sign that you're the least bit interested.<br>This, coming from the point of view from that guy's perspective. After so long wooing this gal, i thought she just wanna remain good friends cos she never show any signs or hints. And i had to find out later that she actually has feelings for me. What to do, i already lost feelings for her so no point pursuing.</div>
