Dont waste your life away like this...<br><br>btw, your symptons might be a result of just psychological effect if you said that doctors cannot detect what is wrong with you. When people feel -ve, they have an "imaginery" discomfort, pain, uneasiness in them which they feel like exploding..<br>The more you try to assess whats wrong with you, but cant find any illness, the more depress you get.<br><br>You may like to sit down, mediate and relax in a quiet place, and think of incidents that had happen lately which affected you? Sometimes, if you dont think of the pain, it will just disappear away...<br><br>However, maybe like one of the forumer mentioned, you can see a chinese physican first..Well, if the pain/discomfort pesists, go see another western doctor again, tell him/her the problem, and say its affecting your well-being, moods, etc..he will understand what you mean..<br>get well soon!</div>
