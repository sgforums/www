            <div class='col-md body'>You made time for him. This is something you need to inform him. Because he's wasting your time making you wait. No one likes to wait. And also that his actions makes you feel he takes you for granted. All this you need to inform him.<br>Now if he can give a very good reason for missing the calls. Then its ok.<br>Next is to work out a good time slot where he can call you. Of when you free, SMS him and see if he is also free to talk. Maybe he's the sort who does not follow time table well.<br>Anyways, its not a small issue, its not a big issue. But leave it alone this will eat you from inside out if you do not talk with him. Then when you explode, he will wonder where all that came from.</div>
