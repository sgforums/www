            <div class='col-md body'>Let's not forget that parents are human too.  They are how they were brought up.  Look around, you will know what I mean...  People doing thing in front of the kid and so the kid learn from there.  Just like someone say, monkey see, monkey do...  So your grandparent did that to your parent and of course they shouldn't.  In your heart you'll say, you won't do that to your children.  I said the same thing.  I swear I didn't do to them what my parent did to me.  I gave my children, more freedom, things that they asked for and be ready to lend a ear anytime they may need it.  But these thing never come.  I know I err somewhere but where and how....  how come my son don't want to talk to me ??  Perhaps it is the way I treat my parent in front of them ... isn't it ???   So my action is different from what I had said and now I am paying the price of it...  Perhaps someone can tell me what to do now... I did not go through my children things and evedrop on his conversation but still they find me a nag and don't want to talk to me ....<br><br></div>
