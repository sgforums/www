            <div class='col-md body'>Hello,<br><br>This is my first topic in AA. Have read alot of AA thread ever since i have join sgforums. Well, now its my turn to write now. Not really into BGR though  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Well, i used to be a gamer, ever since i was 13 (sec 1). I began gaming when i got to know my new classmates from my secondary school. Ever since, i can be call as a gamer, as i play in almost all rpg game in both PSx and SS Console. I even play alot of arcade games, from racing game, shooting game to fighting games. Therefore, i was always the Gaming Boi in my friend's eyes. I have also stuck to Online game at the age of 17, but luckily... I only get addicted to a few games like Pristontale and TsOnline. Even during my Ns, i continue to play game! Either arcade, or home console. As for my BGR, I still have a few girlfriend before, even though I spend most of my time gaming. They understand that gaming is my life and still stay together with me. But they are all history, cause we already broke up. Ok, here comes the Main Point.<br><br>Problem#1<br><br>I do not know when it starts to happen... but i think i am starting to get tired of playing games, but not giving up. How do i explain this... Example, i am still keen on getting the latest Console (ps3) getting the latest PC Game (C&amp;C3) and also upgrading my com to the highest when possible for perfection in gaming mmorpg. But when i start to play the game i wanted, i grew tired easily... Its not physically tired, its mentally. I can't concentrade on the game that i wanted to play. Therefore, As new games came out, i Still buy them. But they are all played once and left in the shelf. There are still alot of titles that i didn't even touch them yet... lolx.<br>After my work, i can't find things to do. Try to play game but grew tired. Nothing to surf from Internet also. Not interested in Tv Shows. Thats the problem...How can i kill time?<br><br>Problem#2<br><br>This is a BGR problem loh, I have this girlfriend that have been together for 3 years coming October. We do not quarrel nor fight. We do not have any problem with each other as well, no major arguements. The problem i THINK i am facing is... lack of topics to talk, lack of activites to do during weekend. And, there are times that I had alot of things to say to her. But when i see her, i juz don't have the feeling to say or explain what ever i wan to say. Don't know whats wrong with me...How can i improve myself?<br><br>Problem#3<br><br>Now the last problem is with my temper. I can say that i have a short and hot temper. I can get upset and angry when irritated. I can list a very good example... My girlfriend's english's level is not that high, and when she ask me how to spell or whats the maining of a quite basic english word... I will feel irritated about how come she don't know such a basic easy word. And my temper will come and i will not explain to her. Strange of me rite? I have always told myself to change my temper, but its hard for me to control. I do not wish to regret in future, due to my bad temper. How can i control my temple?<br><br>Well, thx guys for those who have spend sometime reading all my 3 problems.<br><br>Cheers~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>one of the reason u are short temper is becos of gaming, all the killing and fighting makes u flare up easily in real life, try to go out more often so that u have less time to touch the comp and ur addicition will be lesser.<br><br>Set a goal in life, u are at a phase where u don't know wat to do becos u have not goals in mind. Set a goal, like wan to earn $x amount of money or become a CEO of a company and work towards it, u will then live a more fulfilling live. Period.</div>
