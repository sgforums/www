So i think is fair as she might not feel comfotable going out alone with me so fast.

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's see, you said her character is outgoing yet she's not willing to go out on a date with you alone? Doesn't sound outgoing to me.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Anyway, let's assume that the girl is really shy and requires company. How do you persuade her to go on a date with you? Easy, you gotta have a sweet tougue.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Alright, maybe that takes time and requires some skill. What I would suggest is to take things slow. Let her get to know you better. When she's comfortable being with you, getting her out for a date alone won't be a problem. Just make sure you don't let her know too much about yourself, gotta maintain a tint of mysteriousness.

Your first step would be in speech - she must be able to speak to you without stress and conversation with you should ideally be interesting and on-going. After achieving it - you could then attempt and try to ask her out on a 1 v 1 date.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>By then you could employ some strategy in asking her out. (Need to look for a present for your mother/best female friend/etc and need some lady's advice in getting the appropriate gift kinda stuff?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ) Only attempt when you know that she is comfortable with you already - and probably made good friends. Keep this friendship's flame burning through <strong>occasional</strong> phone calls, emails, sms, etc (do in moderation. Do it too much its very turn off) - with some luck and skill, you would be a higher level closer to your goals.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Her impression of you is not really good so she doesnt feel safe going out with you alone on a date. I assume she doesnt know you well too and you dont know her as well. Girls usually are a bit defensive to guys whom they are not close to. I suggest you get to know her more and let her know you more some other ways making her feel comfortable talking and going out with you.<br><br>This is a boundary only for her trusted friends, you are not there yet. Gain her trust and you will take one step forward and into her boundary <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Thank you so much.<br><br>Brendon</div></blockquote>If you're really interesting in her, it's important that you keep correspondance between you and her ACTIVE... In e-mails, phone calls, whatever ways which is convenient for the both of you and which she's comfortable with... But DON'T overdo it.... It might IRRITATES her, and IF it does... It'll simply spell GAME OVER....<br><br>While doing the above (WELL....) can bring you to get to know each other better... It might even increase the chances of her agreeing on a 1 on 1 date with you... And if not, at least it should make her feel more comfortable when you're both out together...<br><br>Regarding your meeting up with her... You can TRY the 4 Pointers....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>1. <strong>Simple outing.</strong> Make your outing SIMPLE and SHORT. Like just a lunch or dinner... You might not be able to get everybody to come (see pointer 2), but at least it's a START... Some of them in the group might rush off for other things while you can suggest something or a programme for those who can stay back (and hopefully it'll include her..?)... (also see Pointer 3) The MAIN thing about this point is that when the outing is SIMPLE and SHORTER, the chances of turn up would usually increase relatively if the main reason for the people to come is just simply meeting up....<br><br>2. <strong>Partial Attendance.</strong> Have you organise outings or gatherings before? Usually it's quite often that you can't get a big group of people to turn up on the same date and at the same time... And a few of them last minute simply can't make it.... As described in your post, many simply can't make it... If you can't get EVERYBODY, get SOME of them.... It's still a gathering? Ask her out on that... During the meet up, just explain why 'who &amp; who' can't make it etc.... It's common....<br><br>3. <strong>Partition of a day's programme</strong>... If you wanna make it a long hours gathering but the group can't afford the kinda time, DIVIDE out the programme... (refer to Point 1) Like if Mr 'X' says he can't make it... Suggest he just join the group for lunch or dinner... Explanation to the group would then be... "Oh.. He can only join us for lunch and got to rush off later..." or... "Oh... He'll only be joining us for dinner later..." You still can wish that the girl would be there throughout (if she's really interested in you and she's not occupied with other things...)....<br><br>4. <strong>Take it as a 'yes'?</strong> It's quite often that people can't confirm their attendance at some gatherings... Take it as a 'yes' from them 1st and encourage them to come... Any last minute changes there'll be no obligations... At least you'll still manage to get your girl out there...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Well... That's all the pointers for now... Good luck to you but please understand that some things cannot be forced...? Just take things naturally...? And seems like you should not rush for this girl... So take your time and also seize appropriate opportunties...?<br><br>Oh ya... And regarding your questioning her about her bf...? I think you should just take her answer as she wants you to find out for yourself...? It could be a hint that she want you to more PASSIVE in your moves for her... Do things for her during outings and show her the appropriate attention, she should appreciate that if she's giving you a chance...<br><br>I wish you luck?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From a gal's point of view....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> <span style="color: blue;"> looks are deceiving</span>... how do you consider if one is outgoing? *Becoz she goes out all the time?*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To put things simply, when she said she dont mind going out with u provided it's not a single date, it means one of these:<br><strong>1)</strong> She's worried either you or her have/has no self control and decides to do things on impulse.<br><strong>2) </strong>She wants to go out, but she don't quite enjoy your companion and wish for more people to join in, in case both of you got no topic to talk abt and things become awkward.<br><strong>3) </strong> She hopes thru the grp outing, she can have a better opportunity to cast her net and thus know the rest better and make a better choice from among the rest of the guys.<br><strong>4)</strong> She likes another guy from the grp and knows that you'll include him, but she's shy to approach him, thus asking you to do the liasing.<br><br>If I'm you, I'll tell her not to play mind games. By telling you things like 'It's for me to know, for you to find out' She probably has someone outside, yet waiting for a potential candidate to come by so that she can make her selection. She has got the upper hand. She knows how to keep you in suspense so that you are unable to make a sound decision. She wants attention, thus if she indeed has a bf and tells you abt it, she know she'll lose you.<br><br>I just want to caution you, she may not be the girl she appeared to be, look harder and you'll see clearly. Don't be blinded by what you see superficially.

By telling you things like 'It's for me to know, for you to find out' She probably has someone outside, yet waiting for a potential candidate to come by so that she can make her selection. She has got the upper hand. She knows how to keep you in suspense so that you are unable to make a sound decision. She wants attention, thus if she indeed has a bf and tells you abt it, she know she'll lose you.<br><br>I just want to caution you, she may not be the girl she appeared to be, look harder and you'll see clearly.

I am rather shy guys by nature.I always shy away from gals all this while.Thus until now, i had not gone out on a date with a gal before. But i kinda of like this gal and i think i am not young already, so should not continue to be like that anymore.<br><br></div>
