              <p>I initiated breakup for 3 times during this relationship cos he made me angry. But well, those weren't really what i really want. I jus said it out of spite.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>If you treat these kinds of things with contempt they will be taken away from you one day.</p>
              <p>The hard truth is, I think he is just hurt and tired by your behaviour, and don't know which part of what you say is true anymore. And the thing is... do you know?</p>
              <p>I understand because I had a similar experience with a person who just didn't seem to know what she wants. One moment she's nice and good to me and the next she tells  me that you're just wasting your time on her and that she does not feel anything. One moment she snaps at me for being too close and when I give her space she gets angry because she thinks I am ignoring her. I don't really blame her in some sort of way, I just kind of realized that she didn't really know what she wanted and was just trying to protect herself at each and every moment.</p>
              <p>But the fact remains that such behaviour hurts the other party as well, and it reaches a point where the other person just feels that he cannot be played as a fool anymore and decides that such a thing cannot carry on. It's not about giving you chance or not, it's about stopping this whole vicious cycle.</p>
              <p>Do you really think he feels good everytime you initiate a breakup? And three times you did this to him, and as you said it yourself out of spite and not really on a real reason. Simply because you needed something to win the argument, to get the final word in.</p>
              <p>I am not judging you, don't get me wrong. But if you really want this to work then you need to take a honest look at your own behaviour and anything else. Because such things cannot be based on lies.</p>
              <p>If you really want him back, and there's no certainty of that... then you really have to swallow your pride, admit what you did to him and clear the air about it. If not then it's really selfish and unreasonable to expect him to open himself to you and more hurts again when you are not ready to stay your hand from plunging the knife into his heart again.</p>
              <p>You really got to be serious about this...</p>

              <p>The hard truth is, I think he is just hurt and tired by your behaviour, and don't know which part of what you say is true anymore. And the thing is... do you know?</p>
              <p>I understand because I had a similar experience with a person who just didn't seem to know what she wants. One moment she's nice and good to me and the next she tells  me that you're just wasting your time on her and that she does not feel anything. One moment she snaps at me for being too close and when I give her space she gets angry because she thinks I am ignoring her. I don't really blame her in some sort of way, I just kind of realized that she didn't really know what she wanted and was just trying to protect herself at each and every moment.</p>
              <p>But the fact remains that such behaviour hurts the other party as well, and it reaches a point where the other person just feels that he cannot be played as a fool anymore and decides that such a thing cannot carry on. It's not about giving you chance or not, it's about stopping this whole vicious cycle.</p>
              <p>Do you really think he feels good everytime you initiate a breakup? And three times you did this to him, and as you said it yourself out of spite and not really on a real reason. Simply because you needed something to win the argument, to get the final word in.</p>
              <p>I am not judging you, don't get me wrong. But if you really want this to work then you need to take a honest look at your own behaviour and anything else. Because such things cannot be based on lies.</p>
              <p>If you really want him back, and there's no certainty of that... then you really have to swallow your pride, admit what you did to him and clear the air about it. If not then it's really selfish and unreasonable to expect him to open himself to you and more hurts again when you are not ready to stay your hand from plunging the knife into his heart again.</p>
              <p>You really got to be serious about this...</p>

              <p>Ar.... your fault ba... who ask you always quarrel you use break up to threaten him... maybe he is sick and tired of your tactics and wanna let you try the real feel of breaking up.</p>
              <p>Sometimes i just dont understand why girls like to break up over small little things e.g. the guy dont wanna give in to her etc. I mean its not a very healthy relationship if either party keep mentioning the word break up over small issues.</p>
              <p>Anyway your relationship is only 2 months old.. It is not that painful to just forget it and move on.</p>
              <p>This teaches you something.. dont always expect people to give in to you... sometimes you have to appreciate their presence and effort. Cherish them while they are still with you.. not when they are already gone. Hope you learn this lesson.</p>
              <p>Last piece of advice.. dont not use the word break up to threaten guys.. if they really love you they will feel very hurt by your usage of the taboo word so frequently whenever a quarrel emerges... This is your retribution now that your guy has really broken up with you.</p>

              <p>Giving you the benefit of doubt, I'd still advise you to move on.</p>
              <p>This whole thing had been, pardon me, quite a clown show from the start. From your "just-trying-out" to your multiple threats, pardon me again, your actions proved juvenile and your disregards to the relationship.</p>
              <p>You complained that he had been unfair... Well actually, it had been just, for the three times you called it over, he came back pleading with you for a chance to salvage whatever you guys had left... You had 3 chances then, to realize your mistakes and to set this thing straight...</p>
              <p>You mentioned that he has been ignoring you, he's either probably too busy trying to get over it or already had lost interest in this whole thing. Right now, your best bet is to put aside your pride, apologize and befriend him again. If that doesn't work, then it's time for you to learn a hard lesson and move on.</p>
