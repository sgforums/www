We've been friends for more than 4 years, and throughout this period, I've only consciously thought of her in 'that' way once or twice. The last time I thought of her in 'that' manner was... At least 3 months ago.<br><br>In the dream, the furtherest we went in terms of physical intimacy was to hug and hold hands. She has lovely brown eyes, and in that dream, I can recall myself gazing straight into them!<br><br>Frankling speaking, I was rather freaked after waking up. You see, she has been attached for the past four years, and I know her beau too. My principle has always been to not think about or woo attached women. Hence, this sudden dream about her proved a little too much to handle.<br><br>She's a rather elegant and alluring person, that I grant you. Still, I can't help feeling a tinge of uneasiness.<br><br>I wonder if anyone else here has a similar experience to share?<br><br>Cheers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
