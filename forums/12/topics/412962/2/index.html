              <p><strong>Very hard even sometime GOD hard to change. Got Christian Serial Killer. His name is BTK: </strong></p>
              <p><strong>
              </strong></p><p><strong><strong>Dennis Lynn Rader</strong> (born March 9, 1945) is an <a title="United States" href="/wiki/United_States"><span style="color: #0645ad;">American</span></a> <a title="Serial killer" href="/wiki/Serial_killer"><span style="color: #0645ad;">serial killer</span></a> who murdered ten people in <a title="Sedgwick County, Kansas" href="/wiki/Sedgwick_County,_Kansas"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Sedgwick County</span></a> (in and around <a title="Wichita, Kansas" href="/wiki/Wichita,_Kansas"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Wichita, Kansas</span></a>), between 1974 and 1991.</strong></p><strong>
              <p>He was known as the <strong>BTK killer</strong> (or the <strong>BTK strangler</strong>), which stands for "bind, <a title="Torture" href="/wiki/Torture"><span style="color: #0645ad;">torture</span></a> and kill" and describes his <em><a title="Modus operandi" href="/wiki/Modus_operandi"><span style="color: #0645ad;">modus operandi</span></a></em>. He sent letters describing the details of the killings to police and to local news outlets during the period of time in which the murders took place.</p>
              <p>After a long hiatus in the 1990s through early 2000s, Rader resumed sending letters in 2004, leading to his 2005 arrest and subsequent conviction. He is currently serving a life sentence at <a title="El Dorado Correctional Facility" href="/wiki/El_Dorado_Correctional_Facility"><span style="color: #0645ad;">El Dorado Correctional Facility</span></a>, with an earliest possible release date of February 26, 2180</p>

He enrolled at <a title="Wichita State University" href="/wiki/Wichita_State_University"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Wichita State University</span></a> that same fall. He graduated from there in 1979 with a <a title="Bachelor's degree" href="/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree"><span style="color: #0645ad;">bachelor's degree</span></a> in Administration of Justice. He married Paula Dietz, on May 22, 1971, and they had one son and one daughter.</p>

He then worked for a short time for <a title="Cessna" href="/wiki/Cessna"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Cessna</span></a>, in 1973. From November 1974 until being fired in July 1988, Rader worked at a Wichita-based office of <a title="ADT Security Services" href="/wiki/ADT_Security_Services"><span style="color: #0645ad;">ADT Security Services</span></a>, a company that sold and installed alarm systems for commercial businesses during Rader's years there.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></span></a></sup> He held several positions, including installation manager.

              <p>Rader was a <a title="Census" href="/wiki/Census"><span style="color: #0645ad;">census</span></a> field operations supervisor for the Wichita area in 1989, prior to the <a class="mw-redirect" title="United States 1990 Census" href="/wiki/United_States_1990_Census"><span style="color: #0645ad;">1990 federal census</span></a>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>

In this position, neighbors recalled him as sometimes overzealous and extremely strict; one neighbor complained that he <a title="Euthanasia" href="/wiki/Euthanasia"><span style="color: #0645ad;">euthanized</span></a> her dog for no reason. On March 2, 2005, the Park City council terminated Rader's employment for failure to report to work or to call in; he had been arrested for the murders five days earlier.</p>
              <p>Rader served on both the <a title="Sedgwick County, Kansas" href="/wiki/Sedgwick_County,_Kansas"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Sedgwick County</span></a>'s Board of Zoning Appeals and the Animal Control Advisory Board (appointed in 1996 and resigned in 1998).

              <p>He collected items from the scenes of the murders he committed and, reportedly, he had no items that were related to any other killings. He did have other intended victims, notably Anna Williams, 63, who in 1979 escaped death by returning home much later than he expected. Rader explained during his confession that he had become obsessed with Williams and was "absolutely livid" when she evaded him. Rader spent hours waiting in her home but became impatient and left when she did not return home from visiting friends.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>

              <p><span id="Investigation" class="mw-headline">Investigation</span></p>
              <p>By 2004, the investigation of the BTK Killer had gone cold. Then, Rader sent a letter to the police, claiming responsibility for a killing that had previously not been attributed to him. <a title="DNA" href="/wiki/DNA"><span style="color: #0645ad;">DNA</span></a> collected from under the fingernails of that victim provided police with previously unknown evidence. They then began <a class="mw-redirect" title="DNA testing" href="/wiki/DNA_testing"><span style="color: #0645ad;">DNA testing</span></a> hundreds of men in an effort to find the serial killer. Altogether, some 1100 DNA samples were taken.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>The police corresponded with the BTK Killer (Rader) in an effort to gain his confidence. Then, in one of his communications with police, Rader asked them if it was possible to trace information from <a title="Floppy disk" href="/wiki/Floppy_disk"><span style="color: #0645ad;">floppy disks</span></a>. The police department replied that there was no way of knowing what computer such a disk had been used on, when in fact such ways existed. Rader then sent his message and floppy to the police department, which quickly checked the <a title="Metadata" href="/wiki/Metadata"><span style="color: #0645ad;">metadata</span></a> of the <a title="Microsoft Word" href="/wiki/Microsoft_Word"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Microsoft Word</span></a> document. In the metadata, they found that the document had been made by a man who called himself Dennis. They also found a link to the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Lutheran Church" href="/wiki/Lutheran_Church"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Lutheran Church</span></a>. When the police searched on the Internet for 'Lutheran Church Wichita Dennis', they found his family name, and were able to identify a suspect: Dennis Rader, a Lutheran <a title="Deacon" href="/wiki/Deacon"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Deacon</span></a>. The police also knew BTK owned a black <a title="Jeep Cherokee" href="/wiki/Jeep_Cherokee"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Jeep Cherokee</span></a>. When investigators drove by Rader's house they noticed a black Jeep Cherokee parked outside.</p>
              <p>The police now had strong <a title="Circumstantial evidence" href="/wiki/Circumstantial_evidence"><span style="color: #0645ad;">circumstantial evidence</span></a> against Rader, but they needed more direct evidence in order to detain him. They obtained a warrant to test the <a title="DNA" href="/wiki/DNA"><span style="color: #0645ad;">DNA</span></a> of a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Pap smear" href="/wiki/Pap_smear"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Pap smear</span></a> Rader's daughter had taken at the <a title="University of Kansas" href="/wiki/University_of_Kansas"><span style="color: #0645ad;">University of Kansas</span></a> medical clinic while she was a student there. The DNA of the Pap smear was a near match to the DNA of the sample taken from the victim's fingernails indicating that the killer was closely related to Rader's daughter. This was the evidence the police needed to make an arrest.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>On February 25, 2005, Rader was detained near his home in Park City and accused of the BTK killings. At a <a title="News conference" href="/wiki/News_conference"><span style="color: #0645ad;">press conference</span></a> the next morning, Wichita Police Chief Norman Williams announced, "the bottom line... BTK is arrested." Rader <a class="mw-redirect" title="Guilty plea" href="/wiki/Guilty_plea"><span style="color: #0645ad;">pleaded guilty</span></a> to the murders on June 27, 2005, giving a graphic account of his crimes in court.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></span></a></sup> On August 18, 2005, he was sentenced to serve 10 consecutive <a class="mw-redirect" title="Life sentence" href="/wiki/Life_sentence"><span style="color: #0645ad;">life sentences</span></a>, one life sentence per murder victim. This included nine life sentences that each had the possibility of <a title="Parole" href="/wiki/Parole"><span style="color: #0645ad;">parole</span></a> after 15 years, and one life sentence with the possibility of parole after 40 years. It meant that, in total, Rader would be eligible for parole after 175 years of imprisonment, in 2180.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Rader was ineligible for the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Death penalty" href="/wiki/Death_penalty"><span style="color: #0645ad;">death penalty</span></a>, because Kansas did not have a death penalty during the period of time in which he committed his crimes. Kansas reinstated death penalty laws in 1994.</p>

A search of the church website turned up Dennis Rader as president of the congregation council. Police began surveillance of Rader.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Sometime during this period, police obtained a <a title="Warrant (law)" href="/wiki/Warrant_(law)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">warrant</span></a> for the medical records of Rader's daughter. A <a class="mw-redirect" title="Biological tissue" href="/wiki/Biological_tissue"><span style="color: #0645ad;">tissue</span></a> sample seized at this time was tested for DNA and provided a familial match with semen collected at an earlier BTK crime scene. This, along with other evidence gathered prior to and during the surveillance, gave police <a title="Probable cause" href="/wiki/Probable_cause"><span style="color: #0645ad;">probable cause</span></a> for an arrest.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Rader was stopped while driving near his home and taken into custody shortly after noon on February 25, 2005. Immediately after, law enforcement officials, including a Wichita Police <a title="Bomb disposal" href="/wiki/Bomb_disposal"><span style="color: #0645ad;">bomb unit</span></a> truck, two <a title="SWAT" href="/wiki/SWAT"><span style="color: #0645ad;">SWAT</span></a> trucks, and <a title="Kansas Bureau of Investigation" href="/wiki/Kansas_Bureau_of_Investigation"><span style="color: #0645ad;">KBI</span></a>, <a title="Federal Bureau of Investigation" href="/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation"><span style="color: #0645ad;">FBI</span></a> and <a class="mw-redirect" title="Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives" href="/wiki/Bureau_of_Alcohol,_Tobacco,_Firearms,_and_Explosives"><span style="color: #0645ad;">ATF</span></a> agents, converged on Rader's residence near the intersection of I-135 and 61st Street North. Once in handcuffs, he was asked by an officer, "Mr. Rader, do you know why you're going downtown?" to which he replied, "Oh, I have my suspicions, why?" Police searched Rader's home and vehicle collecting evidence, including computer equipment, a pair of black pantyhose retrieved from a shed, and a cylindrical container. The church he attended, his office at City Hall and the main branch of the Park City library were also searched that day. Officers were seen removing a computer from his City Hall office, but it is unclear if any evidence was found at these locations.</p>
              <p>After his arrest, Rader talked to the police for several hours. He stated he chose to resurface in 2004 for various reasons, including David Lohr's feature story on the case and the release of the book <em><a title="Nightmare in Wichita" href="/wiki/Nightmare_in_Wichita"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Nightmare in Wichita: The Hunt for the BTK Strangler</span></a></em> by <a title="Robert Beattie" href="/wiki/Robert_Beattie"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Robert Beattie</span></a>. He wanted the opportunity to tell his story his own way. He also said he was bored because his children had grown up and he had more time on his hands.</p>
              <p>On February 26, 2005, The Wichita Police Department announced in a press conference that they were holding Rader as the prime suspect in the BTK killings.<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Rader was formally charged with the murders on February 28, 2005.<sup id="cite_ref-charges_23-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-charges-23"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>

              <p>Hi...</p>
              <p>In my humble opinion.....</p>
              <p>You are still lucky and fortunate.....because you are still only in the dating phase.....</p>
              <p>You have not married him yet.....</p>
              <p>In my opinion....</p>
              <p>It is better to seek other better men...for your life partner....</p>
              <p>If you stick with him.....it will be tiring and draining....</p>
              <p>Why should you do that...?</p>
              <p>You have to decide and think very carefully, and you have to plan your life, your future......You have to think deeply about some consequences and some paths that you take.</p>
              <p>I think you need to take action and try to change path.</p>
              <p>It is unfair for you.....</p>
              <p>You still can get thousands of other men out there......dont choose a life of sacrifice....thinking you can change him......thinking that love conquers all, etc......it need not be this way.....</p>
              <p>Please......life is short.....this guy has problems and he is a problematic man with issues.......you need to surround yourself with good people, optimistic and uplifting people, with people who can motivate you and make you improve....people who complete you, protect you, support you........all these.....and not someone who is a burden, to be honest.....</p>
              <p>So my advice is to break up with him, as soon as practicable.</p>
              <p>Dont waste anymore time......</p>
