            <div class='col-md body'><p>it goes like this. my boyfriend and i have been dating for around 9 months already. and when we were together for around 2 months, he suddenly went missing for 3 weeks. only to know from his parents that he had been arrested for fighting. when he came out, he told me that he had gotten into a fight where a group of gangsters had beaten him up and he had retaliated, thus charging him in court for fighting. around august, he was sent into changi for a RTC report for 3 weeks as well. he then was sentenced in september, for "fighting" as he claimed, and he would spend his next 2-3 years in RTC. however, a few weeks after his sentence, i found out that he had not been charged for fighting, but had molested some girl and was charged for outrage of modesty in some news article, which also quoted his name, as well as sentence date, which i could not deny was "so coincidental" that it IS him. i was shocked at first. he was always tolerant and nice to me, and he never hurt me physically. and i found out that he had committed the offence before we were together, but he didn't tell me the truth. his lies were full of loopholes, but i chose to trust him as trust is the most important thing in a relationship. after finding out, i went to clarify with his mother, with her constantly calling me after every prison visit and telling me how he misses me, how he cried when she merely mentioned my name etc.. and kept telling me how much he still loves me and hopes for me to wait for him. i have sent him a letter to prison, asking him what was going on 5 days ago, but yet to receive a reply from him. what should i do now...?</p></div>

              <p>Chikatilo did not kill again until June 1983, but he had killed five more times before September. The accumulation of bodies and the similarities between the pattern of wounds inflicted on the victims forced the Soviet authorities to acknowledge a serial killer was on the loose: on September 6, 1983, the Public Prosecutor of the USSR formally linked six of the murders thus far committed to the same killer.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Red_Ripper.2C_p._253_30-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-The_Red_Ripper.2C_p._253-30"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></span></a></sup> A <a title="Moscow" href="/wiki/Moscow"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Moscow</span></a> police team, headed by Major Mikhail Fetisov, was sent to <a title="Rostov-on-Don" href="/wiki/Rostov-on-Don"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Rostov-on-Don</span></a> to direct the investigation. Fetisov centered the investigations around Shakhty and assigned a specialist <a title="Forensic science" href="/wiki/Forensic_science"><span style="color: #0645ad;">forensic analyst</span></a>, Victor Burakov, to head the investigation.

The Rostov Police sent bulletins to all forces throughout the Soviet Union, describing the network of wounds their unknown killer inflicted upon his victims and requesting feedback from any police force who had discovered murder victims with wounds matching those upon the victims found in the Rostov Oblast.

Chikatilo's penultimate victim was a physically strong 16-year-old youth. At the crime scene, the police had found numerous signs of a ferocious physical struggle between the victim and his murderer. Although a finger bone was later found to be broken and his fingernail had been bitten off, Chikatilo had never sought medical attention for the wound.<sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>75<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Police knew their case against Chikatilo was largely <a title="Circumstantial evidence" href="/wiki/Circumstantial_evidence"><span style="color: #0645ad;">circumstantial</span></a>. The strategy chosen by the police force to make him confess included one of the chief interrogators telling Chikatilo that they all believed he was a very sick man and needed medical help. The strategy was to give Chikatilo hope that if he confessed, he would not be prosecuted by <a class="mw-redirect" title="Insanity plea" href="/wiki/Insanity_plea"><span style="color: #0645ad;">reason of insanity</span></a>. Nine days went by without a true confession of his crimes, only vague hints and evasions. Finally, at the request of Burakov and Fetisov, the psychiatrist who had written the 1985 psychological profile of the then-unknown killer for the investigators, Dr. Aleksandr Bukhanovsky, was invited to assist in the questioning of the suspect. Dr. Bukhanovsky read extracts from his 65-page psychological profile to Chikatilo.<sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-75"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>76<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Within two hours, Chikatilo confessed to the 36 murders police had linked to the killer. On November 30, he was formally charged with each of these 36 murders.<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>77<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>

              <p>Chikatilo confessed to a further 20 killings which had not been connected to the case, either because the murders had been committed outside the Rostov Oblast,<sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>78<span>]</span></span></a></sup> or because the bodies had not been found. In December 1990, Chikatilo led police to the body of Alexey Khobotov,<sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-78"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>79<span>]</span></span></a></sup> a boy he had confessed to killing in 1989 and whom he had buried in woodland near a Shakhty cemetery, proving unequivocally he was the killer.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Killer_Department.2C_p._205_79-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-The_Killer_Department.2C_p._205-79"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>80<span>]</span></span></a></sup> He later led investigators to the bodies of two other victims he had confessed to killing. Three of the 56 victims Chikatilo confessed to killing could not be found or identified, but Chikatilo was charged with killing 53 women and children between 1978 and 1990.</p>

              <p>Special precautions had to be taken while keeping Chikatilo in prison; violent and especially sexual crimes against children are taboo in the Russian underworld. Prisoners accused of <a title="Rape" href="/wiki/Rape"><span style="color: #0645ad;">raping</span></a> and/or killing children in Russian prisons are usually "cast down" (Ð¾Ð¿ÑƒÑ‰ÐµÐ½Ñ‹) to "untouchable" (Ð¾Ð¿ÑƒÑ‰ÐµÐ½Ð½Ñ‹Ð¹) status, <a title="Prison rape" href="/wiki/Prison_rape"><span style="color: #0645ad;">sexually abused</span></a>, and sometimes killed by their cell mates. The problem was complicated by the fact that some of the relatives of Chikatilo's victims worked in the prison system.</p>
              <p>While in his cell, Chikatilo was placed under round-the-clock video surveillance. While the suspect often acted bizarrely in front of his investigators, his behavior inside the cell was normal: He ate and slept well, exercised every morning, and extensively read books and newspapers. Chikatilo also spent a lot of time writing letters and complaints to his family, government officials, and the mass media.</p>

              <p>The trial of Andrei Chikatilo was the first major event of post-Soviet Russia. Chikatilo stood trial in Rostov on April 14, 1992.<sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>85<span>]</span></span></a></sup> During the trial, he was kept in an iron cage in a corner of the courtroom to protect him from attack by the many hysterical relatives of his victims. Chikatilo's head had been shaven - a standard prison precaution against <a class="mw-redirect" title="Lice" href="/wiki/Lice"><span style="color: #0645ad;">lice</span></a> - which had the effect of making him look evil.<sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>86<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Relatives of victims regularly shouted threats and insults to Chikatilo throughout the trial, demanding the authorities to release him so that they could kill him themselves. Each murder was discussed individually, and on several occasions, relatives broke down in tears when details of their relatives' murder were revealed; some even fainted.<sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>87<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Chikatilo regularly interrupted the trial, exposing himself, singing and refusing to answer questions put to him by the judge. He was regularly removed from the courtroom for interrupting the proceedings.<sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-87"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>88<span>]</span></span></a></sup> On May 13, Chikatilo withdrew his confessions to six of the killings he had confessed to.<sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-88"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>89<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In July, 1992, Chikatilo demanded the judge be replaced for making too many rash remarks about his guilt. His defense counsel backed Chikatilo's claim. The judge looked to the prosecutor and even the prosecutor backed the defense's judgment, stating the judge had made too many rash remarks about Chikatilo's guilt.<sup id="cite_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-89"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>90<span>]</span></span></a></sup> The judge ruled the prosecutor be replaced instead.</p>
              <p>On August 9, both prosecution and defense delivered their final arguments before the judge. Chikatilo again attempted to interrupt the proceedings and had to be removed from the courtroom. Final sentence was postponed until October 14.<sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>91<span>]</span></span></a></sup> As the final deliberations began, the brother of Lyudmila Alekseyeva, a 17-year-old girl killed by Chikatilo in August 1984, threw a heavy chunk of metal at Chikatilo, hitting him in the chest.<sup id="cite_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-91"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>92<span>]</span></span></a></sup> When security tried to arrest the young man, other victims' relatives shielded him, preventing him from being arrested.</p>

Chikatilo kicked his bench across his cage when he heard the verdict, and began shouting abuse.

              <p>So my advise to you is to go to RTC, visit him and break up with him. Show your middle finger as a parting shot.</p>

              <p class="introduction">When gunman Raoul Moat recently left prison, he believed that he had "lost everything".</p>
              <p>Within days he had gained national notoriety and for almost a week he became the subject of a huge police manhunt. It ended in him apparently shooting himself dead after a six-hour stand-off with armed police in the market town of Rothbury, in Northumberland.</p>
              <p>On 1 July, the 37-year-old was released from Durham Prison, following an 18-week sentence for assault.</p>
              <p>Days later, the father-of-three was being sought by armed officers in connection with the shooting of his ex-girlfriend, her new partner - who was killed - and a police officer last weekend.</p>
              <p>Before the attacks started the suspected gunman's Facebook status was changed to read: "Just got out of jail, I've lost everything, my business, my property and to top it all off my lass has gone off with someone else.</p>
              <p>"Watch and see what happens."</p>

              <p id="story_continues_1">Moat was described as 6ft 3in tall and of muscular build and relatives painted a picture of a man who was prone to "eruptions of anger".</p>
              <p>They also revealed that he used body-building steroids, which some research has linked to aggressive behaviour.</p>
              <p>It has emerged Moat previously had a girlfriend in Rothbury, where the manhunt for him came to a conclusion.</p>
              <p>During that time he is understood to have camped in the area and got to know it well.</p>
              <p>The woman, Yvette Foreman, 35, spent weekends camping with him when the pair were both were in their 20s.</p>
              <p>She said her ex-boyfriend had been a "lovely lad" and a practical joker who was "daft as a brush".</p>

              <p id="story_continues_2">One of the letters, which is among a number taken from Miss Foreman by police, contained a violent fantasy in which he described plans to beat a rival.</p>
              <p>"The only time I saw his dark side was in his letters. I remember he once talked about someone who was going to get done with a baseball bat," she said.</p>
              <p>"He was saying how he and his mates were going to take a bat to somebody because they'd fallen out with somebody.</p>
              <p>"I never really paid it any attention, until now."</p>
              <p>Raoul Moat was raised by his grandmother in Newcastle's West End, close to where his father and mother both lived.</p>
              <p>His uncle, Charlie Alexander, 72, told the BBC he had offered to go to help police negotiations with his nephew on Friday night.</p>
              <p>He said: "He was asking for us. He said he had no family and he had no dad.</p>
              <p>"If I went up he would have had someone that loves him and it would possibly have turned him that little bit that he needed to, to say, 'I'm going to give myself up'."</p>
              <p>Mr Alexander, whose late wife Barbara was the sister of Moat's mother Josephine, described his nephew as a "soft" figure.</p>
              <p>"He was so gentle with us. There was no aggression, no fighting, no arguing, he was so soft.</p>
              <p>"My family called him the gentle giant. Where it's all gone wrong has changed him.</p>
              <p>"But I am still shocked that he's dead, he's gone."</p>
              <p><span class="cross-head">Police arrests</span></p>
              <p>Prior to Moat's term in Durham prison, he had worked as a doorman at a nightclub in Newcastle's Bigg Market, an area of the city famous for its nightlife.</p>
              <p>His life in recent years appears to have been punctuated by a number of encounters with police.</p>
              <p>Northumbria Police confirmed he had been arrested on 12 occasions and was charged with seven separate offences as a result.</p>
              <p>At his trial for possession of an offensive weapon - a knuckle-duster police had found in the car he was driving - he told the court he would not have considered using it as a weapon.</p>
              <p>"My hand barely fits through it," he said.</p>
              <p>"It is an ornamental item. I wouldn't like to hit someone with this.</p>
              <p>"I am a big lad and I would have thought if I punched someone with this it would take the skin off my knuckles right down to the bone."</p>
