Peer pressure may be tempting but If you are going for a long term, don't jump into it. Things come unexpetedly, especially love. Like and love is not the same, admire and love is not the same too. True Love is something that bring two souls together, but waiting for that is unpredictably difficult  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> all the best</strong></span></div>

I must say this century girls dont go for looks la, they majority go look the inside.
