            <div class='col-md body'>A couple of days remaining to the end of 2005. I just wants to share about my story that take place this entire year. Basically, at the start of this year, i set my goal which i wants to fufill but however, it leads everything into disaster. Relationship is one of my goal that i wants to achieve. I tell myself that i wants to settle down in a permantle relationship with a girl regardless of race, languages and all religion, but however i failed myself miserably.<br>Let me kick off, I'm 19 this year, must admit, not too young for a relationship but i do see people around me having a relationship and that makes me have a strong urge of having one as well. All my siblings have one, more than half of my friends' have one and i was curious why i doesn't have one? So without furthur will do, i try my luck. I like 3 girls this year but all rejected me. Each of the girl i like, I had invest feelings for a couple of months before confessing to her, I even date her out, send her home, treat her meals, buy her gifts and many things just like any common guy would do and yet still fails.

LIKE should be more appropriate.</div>

Just one to feel what does love feel like. Then one came. And i got hell lots of trouble with that gal.<br><br>Thts history, anyway my friend... the right one will come. You dun want to be stuck in a relationship when the right one comes along. I sometimes feel that once you start having the 1st gf. The 2nd and the third one comes along. For starters, you can widen your social circle by having tons of female friends like I did. In abt 4 months i had a gf.<br><br>The art of xian char bor, must psyco the girl to like you; Buy gift and all that is nothing, ger is all about feeling de..

How to win a girl heart?</div></blockquote>just want to say a few things<br><br>1) Relationship is never goal. How can you treat relationship like some kind of work problem that must be solve in a year? The more try to rush into finding any girl the more you will not find the right one. If you seriously want to find the perfect one then do not set a time limit for yourself. Find someone who you can connect well. Stop say you will accept any gal who comes along. Set a rule saying which type of girls you like and go for the type you like.<br><br>2) you dated girls for a few months and ask her to be your stead after a few months? come on you hardly know the girl well enough of course the gal will reject you lar. Some gals need more time to accept you and some girls need more asking to be your gf. It takes time and effort and there is no short and fast way.<br><br>3) Before you feel sorry for yourself about not getting a gf. Ask yourself how hard have you really try? I have seen people who had wait for a single gal for 9 years and he is always there for her no matter how she reject him. Sadly you should learn from others mistakes and note that why guys fail and think of ways to prevent yourself from making the same mistakes.<br><br>4) "What you want, you applies with effort and patient to it, it certainly yours, you can change it from not yours to yours.<br><br>Want to know why you always failed? Is this mindset of yours which I feel that is not right. Love cannot be force and the theory above should not be use for finding a love one. In love is best to apply effort and patient and wait for the girl to feel the same way for you, if you try to force the girl to love you or try to change something which is not yours the girl will be the first to run.<br><br>5) "Sigh~ is liking and loving a girl so difficult? Everything when fails in a attemp to win a girl heart can leads me to have phobia about girls. Seems like I can't understand/imagine/predict/tell a girl feelings.<br>What is love exactly? what does it contains and mean? How to win a girl heart?"<br><br>Liking and loving a girl is not difficult but it takes time, effort and understanding . Everytime you fail to win a gal you should try to understand why you fail and not repeat the same mistakes again.<br><br>Love means giving your time and effort to the one you feel so much for. You will not regret your actions when you fail to win the girl's heart and you will always be there for her no matter what happens. Please do not think that love is a game like after winning a girls heart you can just dump the girl asap after having fun.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a relationship is not something that you should rush into it. so what if most of your friends and relative have gfs or bfs already? You can wait for years and see if they'll marry their bfs and gfs in the future. I think most of them will eventually broke up and marry another person. You want a relationship that will last until your gf become your wife, right? then the widest thing to do is to wait until u settle down your carreer and is financially stable. Now, you may not see the wisdom of doing so but you will see it years later.</div>
