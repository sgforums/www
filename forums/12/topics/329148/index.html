              <p>hi everyone. please spend alittle time helping me to interpret this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>theres this one girl ive known for awhile, that i really like, although i dont know if the feelings are mutual. so perhaps you all can help me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. she asks me out all the time, to the movies, to hang out, just the two of us.</p>
              <p>2. when we're together we'll sit really close, sometimes she'll lean on me, walk really close to me.</p>
              <p>3. she talks to me every day for hours, on phone, online, she initiates 90% of it and we'll talk about all kinds of things.</p>
              <p>4. when we're free, or at the end of the day, she'll look for me, to walk her home, to hang out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thats about all i can say without telling too much, but thats the essential info.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is a catch though .. She doesnt seem to be shy or reserved around me, and she's quite the liberal type.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So i really dont know how to interpret this. help ?</p>

              <p>As usual, ask yourself what do you want out of her ? Maybe Parn's thread should be stickied. (even though I dun like her 30k ring marriage proposal ! =p)</p>
              <p>Things should not be very complicated. Things are made complicated because we men complicate them!</p>
              <p> Apparently, you maybe thinking she likes you. But the fact that you are analysing her every move shows you are more needy for her than she is for you. Neediness is the root of possessiveness which kills relationships.</p>
              <p>Stop analysing everything she do. All you need to do is tell her what you want from her. That's all. Let her decide. First, it saves you the headache from analysing. Second, knowing the result will help you move on, whether positive or not.</p>
              <p>Best of luck!</p>

              <p>hi everyone. please spend alittle time helping me to interpret this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>theres this one girl ive known for awhile, that i really like, although i dont know if the feelings are mutual. so perhaps you all can help me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1. she asks me out all the time, to the movies, to hang out, just the two of us.</p>
              <p>2. when we're together we'll sit really close, sometimes she'll lean on me, walk really close to me.</p>
              <p>3. she talks to me every day for hours, on phone, online, she initiates 90% of it and we'll talk about all kinds of things.</p>
              <p>4. when we're free, or at the end of the day, she'll look for me, to walk her home, to hang out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thats about all i can say without telling too much, but thats the essential info.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is a catch though .. She doesnt seem to be shy or reserved around me, and she's quite the liberal type.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So i really dont know how to interpret this. help ?</p>

              <p>Yes, as a gal myself of this age, i can say</p>

              <p>1. she probably is interested in you</p>
              <p>2. She likes you as her a good friends</p>
              <p>3. She likes you like a brother</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>why not your ask her yourself??, do you like me or love me, so as to clear the cloud. For us at this age, we tends to like older guys than same age, maybe 22 to 25 or even 28 yo, and for a guy like you, you should look for younger gals maybe 16 to 17yo. This is becos we gals grow mature faster than you guys.</p>
