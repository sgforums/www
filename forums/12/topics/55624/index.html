Unless you are talking about her having a boyfriend - probably it may wise to avoid making things complicated (not always the case though). But this doesn't applies to your case. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You are 100% sure that she overheard a conversation with your friends and your crush is likely to know about your feelings for her. This is as good as a poor attempt of <strong>expressed</strong> feelings - don't you wish to add the things you haven't said or correct the points which you didn't meant it to be?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Why forget and leave things when you are in the process of letting her know? Expressing doesn't mean anything - it simply relieve the stress in your heart. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> How to go about doing it? Everyone has their ways, but here's a mini guide:<br><br>I) Ambience: pick a good location/place where you will reveal your inner most feelings to her. The place where you express should contribute to the certain theme/ambience which you want to create. (Romantic, quiet, etc)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) Planning - the choice of words, the content, etc. Its good to have a rough gauge on what you wish and want to say. Sometimes, planning on what you want to say can prevent unneccessary unclimatic situations from happening.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>III) Preparation - Expressing your feeling doesn't guarantee you a relationship. You have to be emotionally and mentally prepared to respect whatever choice she made. Afterall, you can't force/pressurised someone to be with you yeah?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Do what you must and leave everything to fate.
