Yup, I agree not many.  Those who are unselfish are often unappreciated, unloved, and even hated by those they love.  It's really painful so those unselfish lovers are often single, hermits, or monks.  Not that there are none but many of them among us, just that we are unable to see that they are capable of unselfish love.  What we see most often is "me me me" or "I I I".  My girlfriend don't love ME!  They underappreciate ME.  "I" don't care, THEY should sacrifice for ME.  Need I say more.<br><br>Why not turn things around and see what one can do for another's discomfort, to make some one happy even if it hurts like salt on an open wound.  I'm kind of dejected over these things, so I'll stop here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i like dis.. =)<br><br>"Relationships--of all kinds--are like sand held in your hand. Held loosely, with an open hand, the sand remains where it is. The minute you close your hand and squeeze tightly to hold on, the sand trickles through your fingers. You may hold onto some of it, but most will be spilled. A relationship is like that. Held loosely, with respect and freedom for the other person, it is likely to remain intact. But hold too tightly, too possessively, and the relationship slips away and is lost."<br><br>-Kaleel Jamison-</div>
