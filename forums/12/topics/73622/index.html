I now spend most of my days off in Batam - which works out to once every 10 days or once in two weeks.<br><br>There are literally thousands of girls in Batam. Many of them are around 16 to 17 years old. Those who are 26 and above are considered old. No one wants them.<br><br>It all starts with a drink at the karaoke bar or disco. If we like each other, we can go on to spend the night together.<br><br>It costs just $50 to spend a night with a girl there, and maybe an additional $10 as a tip.<br><br>Regular customers like me pay only $40, compared to $30 per hour for the girls in Geylang, who can't compare with the Indonesian girls anyway.<br><br>My current girlfriend is a 17-year-old Indonesian girl.<br><br>She is really pretty. She has blue eyes, sharp nose and an oval face.<br><br>She is fair, with straight, waist-long hair which she recently coloured brown.<br><br>Singapore girls can't compare with her.<br><br>Like my past Indonesian girlfriends, she is understanding and makes no demands on me. She is simple-minded.<br><br>Of my $1,500 salary each month, I give her $300 - $60 to rent a small room and the rest for her food and expenses.<br><br>In return, she agreed to sleep exclusively with me and I promised not to sleep with other women. That's why I don't use a condom. I'm confident she does not have diseases. So far, so good.<br><br>I've told her that at any time, if she finds a younger man and wants to leave me, she is free to do so as long as she lets me know beforehand.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>My wife, 63, and daughter, 38, know about her as well as the previous girls I've had.<br><br>They don't mind at all.
