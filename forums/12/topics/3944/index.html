Btw, can dun call uncle bear or not?? u also say I not that old..... Prefer Korkor Agony or Didi Agony... sounds better... hee hee...<br><br>Ur motto isn't dumb. It has some psychological effect on pple, hence to tell pple to be happy. showing that u feel for them also. Telling them that they are not the only ones in this world with them. U will be there for them, to encourage them and cheer them on.

            <div class='col-md body'>Me also last time like Edmund Chen.. But sadly, I don't think I look like him. If not Xiang Yun would have exclaimed, "Zhi Cai!! Why are you here dressed like a student???" when she visited my sec sch 5 years ago. Haa haa....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>You are not being unreasonable also. Each has our own preferences like what you have mentioned. Just like guys can choose to learn ballet.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Actually till now, I have not received any bad remarks with regards to my 2 bears. those who have only seen one will say it's cute. Those who have seen the both of them will say it's very sweet...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Aunty Agony?? YeeccK!!!! Can't imgine people calling me that.. kind of scary.. haa haa.. think better stick with Uncle... can't believe myself to be holding hands with another guy. Think after holding hands, must use 1 gallon dethol to disinfect my hands. hmm.. that makes you Aunty Agony for helping people as well.. haa haa..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Come to think about it, I'm on the consoling side as well. Normally I will help others solve their problems, rather than asking them for help. Because I find that solving their problems will make me learn from their experiences and apply it onto myself when I'm face with similiar difficulties. Anyway, mi also not much of problems in my mind only.. Nowadays, it usually is with regard to my studies. It's giving my a hard time. But nevermind, at least it gives me something for me to thing about, while I'm stuck with nothing to do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I also think that local Uni do offer psych, but they don't have a course for Masters. only for Bachelor. If you want to comtinue your studies you will have to go abroad to study in some uni. Anyway, you so clever, score 8 points, should not have a problem for you to get a scholarship. But getting one that allows you to study overseas will be quite a problem, because there are only a handful, and a lot of people are snatching them up. It could pose a bit of problem to you. Well, no fear, 3 years later I will be waiting in Los Angeles International Airport for you... Can introduce the place to you.. Don't worry I would not sell you off to some slave labour agency.. hee hee..<br><br>Seeing the first digit jump from 1 to 2 is rather frightning lorz. 1/4 of my life is gone.. Still thinking wat have I done in this 1/4 of my life... Haiz, sadly nothing but give my parents more headaches only... Well growing up will mean that thinking will have to change, maturity level will have to increase. Cannot run around like a teenager already. Cannot play catching already... Missed the good old days when I was still in sch. All the fun and laughter... But there will always be one thing that I can do!!! go to the playground and play with the swing.. haa haa...<br><br>Just wondering if anyone can help me in this. is Social Psych same as Sociology???<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nvm lahz... Short one then short one lorz.. At least still got something to reply.. Can kill sometime... I very easily contented one... hee hee.... Expect the unexpected?? Does that mean u really getting the 8 or 9 'A1's?? Can lahz horz.. hee hee...<br><br>dun worry lahz.. I wun forget u guys.. In fact, I think u guys help me recall the days when I was in Sec sch, where I was helping pple... Very memorable. See pple walking out of their problems with a smile...  U guys regain my confidence in helping others, coz I was afraid that my thinking might haf not been keeping up wif times. And lastly u guys haf let me found where I wanna go in the Uni. I know wat I really want to do liaoz.<br><br>Comfort and wise words? Think not so much lahz. especially the comforting words. Coz I think I'm kind of direct and hurt some pple in the process... There may be other ways of solving, or telling the solution, but sometimes I think I may haf chosen a way which haf made pple felt bad at times. hope u pple dun mind.<br><br>Wise?? Still got a long long way to go to be wise... Me still at a young age in terms of seeing all the problems in life. If I'm given an adult problem, or a marriage problem I dun think I haf the ability to solve it. Still learning.... All of us are still learning new things from life I suppose.. No one can claim that he is wise. Even when one can read up and be wiser, but still it's still theory... U will learn ways on how to do things, but to apply which way u haf learnt will be another skill.<br><br>Haf this theory abt knowledge. U draw a circle, watever is inside the circle is the amt of knowledge that u haf, and just on the circumference is the things that u dunno. As u read and see more... the circle gets bigger... but similiarly, the perimetre also gets longer too.. that means u dunno more things as well.. When u r young it's just a small dot, but when u get older it becomes bigger. Dunno whether u pple share the same tot or not??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>hmm... so u r living on the east side of S'pore is it?? Becoz I haf been following u home everyday... Making sure that u r not in trouble... secret admirer.. haa haa... Next time better watch u go, I will just behind u.. haa haa...<br><br>Actually if it's so, horz then it's not that hard to guess. U kept on saying NJ is too far from ur place. NJ is slightly on the Central West of S'pore. If pple living on the West or North of S'pore I dun think they will consider it as far from their home. But if u r living towards the East, then I think it will be little problem for u to travel there. 2ndly, u kept on saying u want to VJ, and VJ is so far East, and furthermore, u said that u live nearer to VJ... Seldom pple from other parts of S'pore will want to go there. Go there dunnowill take how many million yrs of travelling. Simple analysis rite?? hee hee...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Think I really got so bo liaoz to follow u mehz?? Even if I'm ur secret admirer will still give u space to breathe lahz.. wun be ur stalker.. If not will not get into r good books. Anywya if I'm a stalker, I dun think I will be in the rite mind to be so-called Uncle Agony liaoz. wanna guess where I stay??<br><br>think it's cognitive psych.. sorry last time, me spell it wrongly. It's has to to do with how the brain works, that kind of thing. More into the brain itseld.. Me also like u prefer conselling psych... sounds like the kind of job that I'm been working wif, like now. Fees for a year will be abt $13,000 - $25,000 a yr, includes lodging, books, everything lahz... except fees for summer classes.. The more ex one is becoz of it's prestige and recognition, it's UCLA. good uni, but also very hard to get in.<br><br>Dun worry lahz.. me wun disappear.. Still wanna be Santa Bear in this forum... and try out experiments from things that I learn in the uni. hee hee.. I'll be leaving somewhere ard June to August.. dun really know the date yet.. Well, can always contact me thru' email or icq...<br><br>Me still can pick u up from the LA airport... In fact, maybe can go there together also, coz the fall courses there start in Sept.. Anyway, even u take the courses for other season one also can lahz. got term break.. But me not necessary stay in LA.. some smaller towns outside LA. there also rather dangerous also.. Got riots and fights, stuff like that... Heard from an US fren... But will still wait for u, at LA airport 3 yrs down the road.. just tell me when u coming...<br><br>Btw, just remember to do well for ur 'A's dun be like me.. they request for 'A's but I dun dare to show, becoz too poor results.. hee hee... Haf to use 'O's to get in. So paiseh.... Just remember to study hard.. Shld not be posing too much of a prob to u lahz.. How I wish I got half of ur brain-power can liaoz.. hee hee...<br><br>Waste too much of ur time liaoz.. better get back to ur studies once again... Take care....<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>
