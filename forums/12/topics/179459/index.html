And I think I have managed to show my ex that I could still live and enjoy life after breaking up with him, and I think it did make him stew  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>And it was said that love and hate are two extreme sides of emotions. You will not hate someone that much if you have not loved him just as much before. If you are just neutral towards someone, he will not have that much effect on you.<br><br>Sometimes we think that our wounds have healed, but it just takes one action, maybe even one word to pick on them, and start the bleeding again.</div>

I'm trying.. despite been thru so many things.. I nv give up trying.<br><br>It's never my intention to hate him, coz I nv wanted to hate someone I loved.  He's the first and the only one. The damage was done when we were ending and after we ended.  So it does no any good that we ended ya?  If only I nv met him, I would be much happier.<br><br>I have forgiven him before.. i think it doesn't matter to him how i feel, doesn't matter whether I hate him or not.  After i found out that he slept with her, I can never convince myself to forgive him again.  </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I suppose my personal reaction differs : )  There was 1 ex who made me really hate him to pieces.  Although I was sad for about 2 weeks, I told myself that he was Not worth my tears, &amp; why should I make my eyes swollen &amp; ugly because of him.<br><br>When he finally saw me very happy without him, he started getting all mad &amp; married a girl within 1 or 2 months of meeting her, &amp; when his sister (who's a great friend of mine) asked him why he was rushing things, he replied that it was I who caused him to do that.  Talk about pushing the blame <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But by then, I was having such a great time, I didn't care whatever he said.  It felt like a personal triumph.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by rainee:</div><div class="quote_body">this is very true. one of my close girlfrens gave me this advice when I was hurting from my break up with my ex, and I decided to follow it. And I think I have managed to show my ex that I could still live and enjoy life after breaking up with him, and I think it did make him stew  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>And it was said that love and hate are two extreme sides of emotions. You will not hate someone that much if you have not loved him just as much before. If you are just neutral towards someone, he will not have that much effect on you.<br><br>Sometimes we think that our wounds have healed, but it just takes one action, maybe even one word to pick on them, and start the bleeding again. </div></blockquote></div>
