Will i still be with him, will i still treat him the same...<br><br>So i asked him, y he want to tell me now... he said coz i still help him out in finance despite he told me he might not be signing on. He felt that i'm genuine... so he revealed that he had signed on.<br><br>i felt like a fool....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>Well, its not a reason to be really sad about, people have flaws, consider this an experience to know him better. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> We can't say his actions were foolish/childish/wadever, because we aren't perfect either. At least he is honest with you after the incident right? And it also proves, in his own way, he is serious about you.<br><br>There are worst people out there, don't always keep hoping for the better. If you are not happy with him on this aspect, you can confront him to change or improve.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sign on doesn'y mean rich... Their starting pay may be v attractive in the short run but if u look far, the salary increment is so little n slow. hence in the long run, signing on will not make u rich. It only provide u enuf money to survive n earn a simple living. No posh car, no luxury house etc.</div>

Pls tell him that there are big shot + old bird regulars who are out to make a sucker out of him also.........make him mad until he buay tahan &amp; forced to break bond. And when that time comes he will pay the graduity like xiao....for example he will pay the amount left for him + 20% interest.....&amp; see where he will beg for the money &amp; where to hide &amp; cry..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I hope that wif your love &amp; sincerity would move him to think back &amp; make the best out of him for the current situation he is in.
