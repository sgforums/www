But he told me he had only went for 2nd interview. And they postponed his enlistment date to the 23th june for him to reconsider.<br><br>On 10th June, he receive a letter from Air force stating that he has accepted the bond. I asked him... but he told me he dunno whats going on. I thought the Air Force has made a mistake. So i asked him to check with Air Force the next day.<br><br>The next day, he said he forgot to call... During these days, he said he's confused, dunno whether to sign a not, might not be signing... I still told him to think properly... Helped him do research, asking qns here (if u guys have noticed)<br><br>11th June, i gave him a little money when i know he ran out of it and i'm going on a flt on 12th June. Then later in the night, he told me actually he had already signed the bond on 5th june.<br><br>I was shocked. Then i asked him y he didn't want to tell me earlier. He said he didn't want me to be with him because i know that he had already signed on. In another words, be with him for money. I asked him Through this 1 and a half years, u didn't know if i'm with u for money? He said ppl will change.... what he meant was he wanted to see whats my reaction if he didn't sign on. Will i still be with him, will i still treat him the same...<br><br>So i asked him, y he want to tell me now... he said coz i still help him out in finance despite he told me he might not be signing on.

Everybody has their own little dirty secret that they don't want people to dig. So I'm sure that you also have your own secret that you also do not want your bf to know. In fact, he is willing to confess his lie to you proves that you meant a lot to him. If he is really as heartless as other people mentioned, he would not have own up to you about his lie.

Yes we have been living together since april last year. We are together almost everyday unless i have flights... which means only around half a month i'm in SIngapore<br><br>I've talked to him about i feel....He said that he signed on is because he dun want me to carry a burden for another 3 yrs, so he signed on wanting to make my life better, furthermore he could save up for something else.<br><br>He told me he is going to be bound for 7 yrs. It's a long time and a BIG decisison. Although he had decided to sign for me, he still needed assurance. So he lied.... he said although it might not be the best method, he got the assurance he needs........<br><br>I accepted his apologies and made him promise never pull such stunts to me again..... my heart's weak and could not take something like that anymore....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

But he told me he had only went for 2nd interview. And they postponed his enlistment date to the 23th june for him to reconsider.<br><br>On 10th June, he receive a letter from Air force stating that he has accepted the bond. I asked him... but he told me he dunno whats going on. I thought the Air Force has made a mistake. So i asked him to check with Air Force the next day.<br><br>The next day, he said he forgot to call... During these days, he said he's confused, dunno whether to sign a not, might not be signing... I still told him to think properly... Helped him do research, asking qns here (if u guys have noticed)<br><br>11th June, i gave him a little money when i know he ran out of it and i'm going on a flt on 12th June. Then later in the night, he told me actually he had already signed the bond on 5th june.<br><br>I was shocked. Then i asked him y he didn't want to tell me earlier. He said he didn't want me to be with him because i know that he had already signed on. In another words, be with him for money. I asked him Through this 1 and a half years, u didn't know if i'm with u for money? He said ppl will change.... what he meant was he wanted to see whats my reaction if he didn't sign on. Will i still be with him, will i still treat him the same...<br><br>So i asked him, y he want to tell me now... he said coz i still help him out in finance despite he told me he might not be signing on. He felt that i'm genuine... so he revealed that he had signed on.<br><br>i felt like a fool....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Like what your senses has told you; its unneccessary to suggest a break up due to this. However, you have truly gain new insights about your boyfriend that you didn't knew and I am going to explain it here:<br><br>His actions revealed unconsciously about his deep inferiority when he is placed with you. The man, the one who is suppose to provide, is unable to fulfilled this 'society' standard - the ego is affected badly.<br><br>Noticed he only pick the road to sign or not to sign, served as a short-term method to ease his financial difficulty. With such mentality, it will be terrible for him because he is NOT signing a job - its a career. Considering monetary benefit to sign on will only make his life misery if that is not the kind of life he wants.<br><br>I have so many friends who wanted to sign on because of the stable cash and the actual untold reason that I see through is because they are so used to having a fixed route in life <strong>they don't even fringing` know what they want in life</strong>. I would have encourage if their lifestyle, mindset and personality (or they loved and took engineering) really fits and suits the army. But seriously, by the look of it, I doubt it. (Some the whole life gaming kind... if you can picture).<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I am afraid this could also be affecting your boyfriend currently: the question about what they want to do with their life, which ultimately affected his behavior towards the relationship: dunno-what-he-is-doing-and-saying.<br><br>Let it be this time round, but please note that your bf currently has a bruised ego. He, now, measure love through finance and trust me: pessimism, reduced self esteem and poor preception of love will surface for the next year in your relationship. To ride through, learn to equip yourself with high dose of understanding and tolerence.<br><br>Cheers</div>

Thanks for mentioning. Brings up one of my main concerns. If the amount of money ain't much to his advantage, it could be much more of his concern as to how he should be saving it up for his own better use? (depending on what type of character he holds?)<br><br>Of course, we shouldn't be too quick on judgement? Let's go it your way... Loosen up your suspicions a little and have benefit of doubt on him.... Afterall, it could be a genuine misunderstanding...<br><br>If he sincerely holds your concern... He probably should....<br><br>1. Return you the money in time.<br>2. Mentions about the above and try to do something about it in time.<br>3. After a period of time, at least holds a certain amount of money for both your future.<br><br>All the above points can be revealed in time probably.. Actions or whatever interpretations are up to you to make....<br><br>Regards.</div>
