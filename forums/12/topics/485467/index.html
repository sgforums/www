              <p>I was thinking the same. Wouldn't the company supply you with a car if they want you to drive around? If they don't, it is clearly not a serious company and you shouldn't waste your time with them.</p>
              <p>Settling down wise, I think you are just scared to do it. I can understand that. So just take a time out by yourself and think about what keeps you from settling down, besides money, which isn't an excuse anyway.</p>

              <p>I understand your frustration.</p>
              <p>The gal wants to get fat,oops, I mean get married and make you liable for her financial and emotional needs. Don't be pressured by any gal or anyone for that matter to do things you are not. Even if you do sacrifice what you want to do and 'give in' she will continue to blame you after saying 'you really didn't want to,so you lied to her and this makes her life difficult knowing she cannot trust you anymore'. Thats b1tch logic,blaming the guy anyways while they stand to loose nothing and gain part of your finance if they stay with you or take part of it if they divorce.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">My 0.02$, be the man you want to be and your life belongs to you only. Be free and follow your passion, a better gal will find way to your life.</span></p>
