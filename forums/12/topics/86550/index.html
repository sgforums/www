Busy wif school n everythin... So i admit, i didn't mak much of an effort to really meet up lor...<br><br>We v long discuss break up liao. Jus tat both of us doesn't want to iniates it...<br><br>So slowly we not so close as b4 lor... then he iniates break suddenly...<br><br>At first, i was quite happy... Coz i feel tat i m the one who didn't really want it continue coz i know he isn't the right guy... But then now, slowly, the reality hits in onto me... N is real hard...<br><br>Sometimes i dunno myself... Do i still lik him or not... Or maby i bit touchy n emotional when comin to him coz he is my first in many many things... Hug, kisses... etc...<br><br>We now still friends lik tat... But of coz not v gd lah... Jus the normal hi n bye kinda...<br><br>Sometimes i think of him... i start to cry... Sometimes i think of his actions, i start to get mad...<br><br>Coz many a times... usually on Msn... We chat abit lor... He told me of tis gals tat he lik or gals tat lik him...<br><br>Mus admit he is quite attractive lor... Not too bad... Plus he v outgoin, humourous...<br><br>Tat time we break off less than 2mths only... Wow... He so fast he head over heels in love wif tis gal liao...

Not as much as b4...<br><br>I dunno... Mayb jus haven't get over it yet... LOL...</div></blockquote>well.. i think you are jus comparing yourself to this girl he likes now.. that's why you feel sad and uneasy about it.. You guys got together only after 1 year of friendship.. that's where the chemistry came in.. but for this present girl.. it may oni took him a few months and he fell madly in love with her.. You said he doesn't like hot-tempered girl.. that's where you always dun shout.. or even scolded him in any way.. but for this girl.. is vice versa...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You see how he praises the girl.. and you look back on how he critises you.. of cos you will feel bad and upset.. <strong>Stop comparing </strong>yourself to her.. you are jus as good.. jus that all these doesn;t come from his mouth.. afterall this 4 years.. i'm sure there are where you do have happy moments together.. something which he and the girl will never have! MEMORIES!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>You need not have to stop looking and seeing his mum.. if you really click well with his mum.. You are afraid that one day they might bump into at his mother's stall.. then let it be.. Why should you be afraid and frightened of.. Scared that the gf might get jealous over it.. scared they will quarrel be cos of you..?? well.. if the gf is sensible and considerate enough.. this issue will never ever happen.. To know that yuo both are still friends.. but of cos.. you were once his gf.. But that was in the past.. The guy must played his part well.. He and you must really draw a line across saying it <span style="font-style: italic;">"TOTALLY OVER BETWEEN US"</span> Is only the friendship that keeps it going.. nothing else... It must be Clear cUT!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Once you stop comparing and stop looking back at the past.. you will forget him.. and let the feelings jus fade away with the memories..
