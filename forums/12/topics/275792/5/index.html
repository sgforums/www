And he said those things (he insisted they are not lies) cos he was a victim of circumstances, cos he spoke too fast!

OH com'on, she works in entertainment line.  she, only 21 years ol, had a 48 years old japanese bf before.  does he think that she is so innocent?  has no knowledge of seduction? or is he so innocent? he is not borned yesterday. he is in his 30s! or is he quietly stroking his own ego? yes, he depends on her, me and other girls for his own emotional stability and ego.  And if that makes someone a loser, he then will be one.<br><br>Is he selffish?  this is a qn i keep asking myself.<br><br>you made several very valid points.

This was my story.<br><br>http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=236155&amp;page=0<br><br>For those who are lazy to read, to summarise, he was married and seperated, and asked me to wait for him for completion of his separation, which would be due by end march.<br><br>During this period of time, we barely met.  manytimes, he agreed to meet, but last min had to cancel.  and manytimes i asked to meet, he turned down saying he was busy<br><br>i waited for him, but when the deadline was approaching, he continued to be evasive.  still so reluctant to answer my qns on things, and when i asked when can we meet, he said maybe april.  i was so mad and i felt that he was stringing me along.  Confronted him , but he was still evasive.<br><br>so we broke up in end march.<br><br>Recently he called me, claimed that he has divorced, asked me to patch up.  So i asked for time to think.  we communicate via email, msn and phone.  he asked to meet.  i turned him down.  as i think it is not a gd idea to let emotion overtake gd judgement, and you really wont know how things will turn out after meeting up.  he agreed.  i think it is fair to only set a deadline, so i told him i will let him know the answer by october.  he agreed too.<br><br>all this while, i have been considering.  And all this while, he has asked to meet occasionally, i turned him down.<br><br>this morning, he insist that he wants to meet me this weekend, and want things to 'move', cos he is lonely and he is refraining himself from getting involved in other relationship while waiting for me.<br><br>i feel that this is absurd.  this is too much.  so if he wants, he can ignore me totally and dont meet me at all even though we were together (ie a couple). and now he is lonely, i must meet him despite i need the time to have a clear mind to think?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Is he disregarding my feelings?  Does he really think i am a inferior being to him?  Does he even respect me at all?</div></blockquote>He doesn't think any of that. He is lonely and he wants your company. Previously he was not l;onely and he did not need your company. Simple as that. Don't complicate life with imaginings and wild conclusions.<br><br>If you are serious about making "gd judgement" it is not only "let emotion overtake gd judgement" but getting rid of wild imaginings as well.</div>
