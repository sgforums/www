'how long i had to wait for him' to finalise with decree nisi (because despite we were a couple, during that period of time we barely met despite we were just together only for couple of months!), and now, how much time i need to consider proplerly, so as to be fair towards him that he does not have to wait indefinitely.<br><br>i do agree that he can be manipulative, which is what he is doing even now! insisting that we MUST meet up this weekend!<br><br>As for his insecurity, please enlighten me.

            <div class='col-md body'>Life's like that. Many people only learns to treasure what they have after they lose it. Similarly for your case, the guy is asking for a reconsideration<br>only after you have terminated him. Now he's wanting back because he realised that ultimately, you are still the best to him.<br><br>I can't really comment further because I don't know how close you are to him or how much the relationship means. My only advise is tread with caution.<br>Whether you decide to accept him again or not, you must make provisions that things may not turn out well as expected.

Go out of the cave, stop playing games, wasted so much time playing games and porn till gf also forget. You should have classmate, college, relatives, frens to chill out, learn to socialise, dun be a thrifty, spend a bit, be jovious, and dun be afraid of failure in losing a gf you want very much, just let go and find again, very soon, you will have one that love you so much. And of course, you have to look at yourself and dun expect the high end beauti and sexy like movie star type ok. Be simple, jovious, fun to be with and civilise, and dun use the middle finger.</div>
