As for him, just don't be soft and give in to tempations by meeting him.

I am not saying its the 3rd party or anyone's fault, but obviously, its best not to fall for married persons.</div>

And when cornered, he lied. i remember how i cornered him when we were in a relationship. when i begin to suspect some thing was wrong, i asked him again "are you married, he tried to evade, but no, i wont take that for an answer, he said, no, he is not married.<br><br>He perpetually treating me in such ways i deem unreasonable, forever evasive, and yes, i went through the paradigm shift. i began to think that i was wrong, maybe. i begin to question myself.  This morning, i woke up, and after reading your reply, i begin to understand, perhaps that is why so many gfs or wives help their bfs or husbands do ridiculous things, even like killing or raping.<br><br>Yes, he is forever depending on others for his own emotional stability and ego.  he told me that pretty girl is so innoncent that she innoncently stroke his face and thigh, doesnt know that such acts are not platonic. she is always trying to hold his hands, doesnt know that such acts are not platonic. OH com'on, she works in entertainment line.  she, only 21 years ol, had a 48 years old japanese bf before.  does he think that she is so innocent?  has no knowledge of seduction? or is he so innocent? he is not borned yesterday. he is in his 30s! or is he quietly stroking his own ego? yes, he depends on her, me and other girls for his own emotional stability and ego.  And if that makes someone a loser, he then will be one.<br><br>Is he selffish?  this is a qn i keep asking myself.<br><br>you made several very valid points. Thank you for your assurance, for telling me this is too much, for assuring me that he is disrespecting me and treating me as more inferior than him, for i am no longer able to tell black from white anymore.</div>
