            <div class='col-md body'>she need a reality check .. give her ur temper when u feel like it .. show her tat she shld nt take u for granted .. or her husband for tat matter .. if this continues .. its she whom will be spoilt .. being a woman of her age .. i cannot believe tat she behaves like a tat .. after going through marriage n at least 20yrs of life she still couldnt mature ?? well .. she might be a good fren .. but i guess u hav already done ur part as a good fren as well .. or u might wan to try the soft method .. talk to her 1 on 1 .. on a relatively easy mood ... knock some sense into her .. tell her to reflect on her behaviour.. n when she tries to interrupt .. u make it a pt to remind her tat she is interrupting u .. since she is ur gd fren .. i believe tat 2 of u shld b able to communicate more effectively .. so much tat u can pt to her her bad pts n persuade her to change for the better .. if she show u black face .. or typical spoilt brat attitude .. i reckon she isnt quite a gd fren u said to be .. peace</div>

Not only it gives others a bad impression of her, its throws her husband's face as well. Arguments like this should be kept behind closed doors and not infront of everybody (including the kids).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </span><br><br>another problem is, recently i find that she is impatient talking to me, like very 'gan chiong',<br><span style="color: brown;">Just wondering...is she a cantonese?</span><br><br>She is quite a nice friend just that she is quite quick temper and at time misunderstand my meaning cos i dont have the chance to finish my sentences ...and is most of the time.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><span style="color: brown;">Make your stand.

In turn she show apprecation of your making feel so comfortable and good. If u two keep agruing everytime u two talk, i pretty sure it will eat anway her self esstem and the bond between u.<br><br>2. show respect -- so obvious lol<br><br>3. Be supportive -  when she makes mistakes let her kloow everyone makes mistakes and she shoudln't be hard on herself.<br><br>4. Let her know u appreaciate her - its a amazing mind game... as a saying one nice word in the bank is worth a hundred after the fact.<br><br>5. allow her to give u - well this is something i note.... ppel tend to like us if we do nice things for them but if a person actually like u more after he/she does something for u. U see.... pple dun things for pple they dun like... the chances she does something for u means she like u. So once u take and appreaciate her effort there is a sense of respect for u<br><br>once u done it she will respect u more and i guess u change her a bit lol once she respect u<br><br>but again if u are lazy to change her.. maybe a direct approach will be best..<br><br>for husband thingy...just said u dun like it but in a nice way.. maybe like<br><br>" hi ABC, i respect u alot and u had being a role model for me and i am sure you and yr huasband are a loving couple, but i WANT to let u know you scolding or quarreling with your husband seems offensive to me and embrassing.<br><br>well she can said she is sorrie or defend herself<br><br>i put my bet on her defending lol<br><br>if she said sorry.. good stuff!!!<br><br>if not ... well she probably said things u are too sensitive or the fcat her husband is an asshole lol.. if she said none of yr business.. i probably leave it as this statement basicalyy disregard u as a friend.<br><br>One must remember in life there are good and bad friends.. bad friends are never worth keeping even how much benefit they will give u.. cos they eat u away like diseases<br><br>Just dun argue abck.. then said smile and said i undertsand yr reason is good but i must say its offensive to me." and end of story.<br><br>if she keep doing that keep using that method.<br><br>teh same goes for her not letting u finishing yr statement.. Just tell her u dun like it and see her reaction.<br><br>Never argue with her but just show her respect and continue on normal talking..after a while that might tone her down lol<br><br>Good luck!</div>
