You are already eligible for many courses in Polytechnic and it is a good time for you to reflect what else you can and may like to do, rather than being a stick in the mud and harp on something you cannot change.<br><br>After all, I had 25 points for my O's 10 years back and I'm still here replying to you. I'm happy doing so many other things even though I did not get into the course I THOUGHT I would want so much.<br><br>Don't waste your time any longer dwelling on the past, move forward and take another path to reach the ultimate goal in the end! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

While strolling, I meditated about my problems and focused my thoughts. I felt really hopeless. The waters were so tempting and I just felt like throwing myself in and drown myself in the deep waters...but then something struck me.<br><br>I realised that suicide was not the way out. That powerful voice in the back of my head spoke out loud. It was then I saw myself as someone great. I saw myself as somebody who would be useful to the community. I saw myself as somebody who had great potential. I thought about the advice you people at sgforums gave me. Yes. 19 points is not the end of the world. There are much better things to look forward to. A dead person would be useless to society, If Im Alive at least I can be someone who can contribute to society. Thank you all who had posted advice on my previous thread. Your words of encouragement has greatly lifted my spirits. I now look forward to being somebody in life . <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div></blockquote>That's good.<br><br>Remember.... you have more to excel and contribute.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>There's just a little set back and you are stronger now.</div>
