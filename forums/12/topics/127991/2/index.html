            <div class='col-md body'>lol i'm so surprised you actually posted this here. you won't know what kinda junk people fill in these forums. but this wasn't as bad as i thought.<br><br>to me, getting married is as good as inviting trouble. the more people you become close with, the more troubles you'll have. when you are good friends/lovers with someone else, their troubles become your troubles.<br><br>best is to be selfish and stay single in a world of your own.<br><br>but as they all say, no one can control love so i guess it's too complicated for the human brain to formulate. just take it as it comes.<br><br>btw the condom-in-car story above is cool.<br><br>TUT<br><br></div>
