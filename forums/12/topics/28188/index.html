            <div class='col-md body'>are u looking for a companion? lover? provider(of anything)???<br><br>if u are looking for a companion, usually, ur understanding of the other half is weak, because all u want is someone to be there for u, whether ur feelings are strong or not with ur companion, u won't understand what goes on in his/her life... and when there's some arguements, usually, it's a small matter blown big....<br><br>if u are looking for a provider, u juz want someone there to give u all u want, whatever it is, money, or sex, u juz demand material things, hence understanding of the person is next to nil, unlike companion.............<br><br>if u are looking for a lover, u'll find that u are the one sacrificing things, not DEMANDING things, and u know every single thing abt ur lover, and of course, if ur lover falls in the above 2 catagories, u find that it's very hard to communicate with him/her, and when u point out sumthing in his/her life, it often ends up as a dispute....<br><br>whatever i typed above, is based on my POV</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by AsTr0GiRL:</div><div class="quote_body">This thread was like a few mths back liao but since it was dug up, i shall juz add another 2cents worth of thots...<br><br>I realised that most pple r forgetting what love really is all about... They can say I love u to a person when he/she barely know each other... What they have could be juz a crush or a liking.. Thou it may proceed from there, but if you dun even understand a person, how can you love that person? When love is taken out of a r/s, one will realise that wat holds a couple together is companionship, gotten too used to each other or maybe even responsibility and no longer love... Where have all the love gone to?? Have most pple really forgotten how to love anymore??<br><br></div></blockquote>hmm.... hope that i am wrong....  but wat i feel nowadays....  ppl like us... tense to get into a r/ship so fast that u end it urself u also wont noe it.....  one of the most impt reason i believe its becos we nowadays had become lazier...  we tense to skip the "knowing period" and straight away get into the so called "loving stage" and that is y they can say : i love u....  i will marry u etc.....<br><br>but when the time gets longer.....  one of the party will start to realised that he/she is actually not the one for him/her..... and they initiate break up.... thats y ppl broke off so easily even if they ever said that they love their partner?<br><br>and this is wat i posted b4.... =)<br>personally, i feel that for mi to say : i love u... its quite diff....<br>unless me and her had already develop a kinda r/ship that have already mature.... thou i dun really noe wat is mature... but i think mature maybe got to do with whether hv already develop things like<br>1. telepathy<br>2. understanding<br>3. compromising and of cos not forgetting<br>4. being together.<br>maybe till that time i might be able to really understand and to let her noe that i had already develop love for her and not only likings. but thats the danger part also.... if u ever love a person.... means that u already in too deep.... if any failure in the future.... sure diff to get over... and definately will need some time to recover.... and the side effects is when u start another r/ship.... u will be hv some kinda phobia.... u will tense to be more protective and gif less to the other party.... that's how i feel....<br>any comments anyone?</div>
