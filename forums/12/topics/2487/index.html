            <div class='col-md body'>that's something like Incest isn't it ? just that you like a relative ... When you eventually spread the word that you love your cousin (why do you even say love ? couldn't it be lust or just like ? Think about it), You'll receive negative comments everywhere ... taking lew kuan yew for example.<br><br>I Like to say this, you often know the answer more than anyone. No one knows your situation more than you do, it's often yourself  who has the correct answer and authority to do it. Seek out your heart, and ask yourself if it's really him you love, or is it just a short term lust.<br><br>Hope i have been of help .<br>-Love, AaroN<br><br>------------------<br>The night is near and dawn is coming... I Lay awake on my bed thinking of you... I wonder ... when will we meet again ? When will we talk once more ? I Know my love to you is deep and true ... but i wonder how you feel for me ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I Think it's juz a temporary thingy.. Maybe juz becoz he did something that touches ur heart, or maybe he has been rather nice to u, becoz he is ur couz and u mistakenly taken it for affection?? maybe it could be, u sre still growing up, and this couz of ur is juz too good looking and u begin to haf a crush on him... Or maybe even he could juz haf returned from abroad after yrs of studies, that u missed it a lot??<br><br>I mean all these are contributing factors.. Time will tell u if u really like him truely or not. Though, I personally oppose the idea, becoz it's incest in any case. Maybe u can tok about it a little more, rather than juz giving a sentence about it. I can email me at beingfunny_1999@yahoo.com if u want. I will try to help.<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

Looks??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Sorry another thing that really puzzles me... If they cannot communicate, then how do they tok to each other in to liking each other?? In my mind, I think there muz be a common language that both of them share rite?? Chinese?? Malay?? some dialect?? I think a good way is to work on the the common language that they share. There are Chinese educated pple, and English educated pple pairing off, even in Singapore. On the other hand, she has to understand his disability, and haf to bear wif it. But she can always make herself to be his motivator to improve his english.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>One thing that u haf to tell ur fren. Both may face the problem of having 2 conflicting ideas, when in comes solving problem, becoz of their different styles of thinking.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The above is in the assumption that he is well educated in another way as well. If he is not so well-educated, ur fren will even haf to endure even more. Becoz being of a different level of education, both will not see eye to eye wif each other. It may not surface at the beginning, becoz of the passion. But soon, when some problems arise, they will feel the inability to understand each other's position. For instance, ur fren may want to study, or think about her family commitments, but to the guy, he may feel that she is neglecting him, being unable to understand her position.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Finally, juz a comment add-on. they juz met each other recently like wat u haf said. Chances is they are blinded only by infatuation.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm Bear you are right. Anyway both of them are attracted to each other's looks I guess. Perhaps it won't work out at all.

Miracles do happen. Even no miracles, think she will be able to gain a good lesson from it.<br><br>T|red: Actually ur second motto makes sense also.. In fact I haf been using it very often also.. I remember when got my PSLE I only got 217.. I was allowed to go to my mother's sch, thru' connections if I want, but I din, becoz I will be at the very bottom of the level. And being in the last few class, u juz get all the despise from teachers. I remained in my sec sch... In the end, I worked my way from the bottom half to the 2nd class... Really happy abt my achievement.. hee hee...<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>
