I m sure u will survive,girly. Rough it thru! Jia you!=)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Forumites, thanks for all your contributions for now.. As much as I understand most of you have your valid points to tell, pls try to understand that youngsters often have their own ways of thinking... I'm not about to comment whether they're 'right' or 'wrong', but rather.. I suppose you can say they can be quite different...<br><br>Majority of your maturity, thinkings and experience can be quite different from them.. And hence your ideas might sound alienated to them as much as theirs might sound the same to you... With that 'gap' in between the generations.. I certainly would not think it quite possible for them to quickly absorb your ideas, inputs, thinkings.. Not to mention that they might not even be accepting your advices in the 1st place... But if you wish the better for them, pls try to be patient with them... Even adults would need time to sort out their feelings, and as some of the forumites have already mentioned... Feelings can certainly be genuinely involved in an online relationship, otherwise there won't have been so many couples developing from knowing each other online...<br><br>As for Princess and her online bf... I would personally advise you to sort things out between each other as peacefully as you can... FORGET about what the others have said and just simply end things... 'Kai' already has a gf and Princess is not for that... Whatever it is, things would certainly come to an end whether it's ugly or not.... So why not both parties just end the whole thing as simply as possible and persue no more.. Just let it 'settle'...<br><br>As much as many forumites out there might be genuinely concerned about the whole thing, I personally feel that it just might not be so meaningful to go after the whole story... It'll certainly help and be easier for the 2 involved parties to let go willing if there're less people knowing the 'story' which might otherwise possibly 'evolve' into other versions of it to complicate matter....<br><br>As told.. What done cannot be undone. It's time to bury things and get on with each other's life....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think forumite has to keep in mind:<br><br>no doubt feeling can cultivate spending time tokin to each other online since in real world no one will tell friends their problems, but cyber world is totally different wif real world. the reason is in cyber world, everyone can be 7-inch conjone, double D cups, flirts, cassnova, etc. but tis does not implied that real life he/she is dat sort of person, he/she can be quiet, decent person who is faithful to his/her partner. i asked a female friend in msn before whether she flirted (cyber) online even though she love her bf, n she admitted she does dat all the time.<br><br>flirting online does not necessary mean one is unfaithful. hence i feel dat online r/s should nvr take as seriously.</div>
