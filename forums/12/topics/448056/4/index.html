              <p>Hi, I am 33 and just got married to my wife (same age). Lately
              we have been having tiffs about housework and finance. She just
              started working part-time and earns about $1K.I am holding 2 sales
              jobs, fetching about $3K per month.</p>
              <p>I have been feeling flustered as she is not keen to keep the
              home clean. I have to come home to clean the house even after a
              really tiring work day.</p>
              <p>Financially I also feel drained as I need to pay for our
              house-loans and many bills and expenses. I am not even sure if we
              could afford to have kids in future.</p>
              <p>My wife became very upset when I told her to chip in, in our
              home expenses. She is still not into housework and she can't
              cook.We cannot afford a maid at this moment.</p>
              <p>I love her yet I am feeling very frustrated about her messiness
              and unwillingness to help me lower down household expenses.</p>
              <p>What shall I do? Divorce is never an option to me.</p>
              <p>Please feel free to drop in your opinion.Thank you.</p>

              keep her mess and turn a blind eye to it. At least the mess will only be

              really peanuts in Singapore. Assuming she spends about $100 in transport every
              month, she only have $900 left. Are you paying for her phone bills? If not her
              own mobile phone charges, insurance if any, and stuff that most women need like

              <p><br>There are many cases in my country whereby elderly man try to buy brides from vietnam but most brides ran away back to vietnam.</p>
              <p>One case: A 35 year old man paid $20,000 for a vietnamese bride but she turn out to be an ex army officer in viet cong army who know martial art. She began to physical beat him up and abuse him. Then she ran away. The 35 year old man had to go to a famous mediator in my country name Michael Chong. The viet cong officer lady came back and met with press to declare that they "amicably" ask for break up.</p>
              <p>Second case: A 50 year old man married a 23 year old viet cong girl. She refuse to sleep with him and made him sleep in the living room. Got language problem. After 4 months - she ran away back to her village. The 50 year old man went to her village to persuade her come back - but was beaten up by her fellow villagers. Turn out that the 23 year old viet com girl already have a 23 year old lover cum husband in vietnam before she married him.</p>
              <p>So the 50 year old man ask marriage agency for refund. No refund they say.</p>
              <p>So you stil reckon viet cong bride strategy can work?</p>

              <p>Of course I am going to contribute to both the housework and household expenses. But that is not what you said. You said that it's ok for a woman to keep all her money, use the husband's money, and not do any housework. In other words, your 'advice', if one can even call it that, is for all men to be spineless, henpecked husbands. </p>
              <p>Marriage is supposed to be a partnership between two people, and not a parasitic relationship.</p>
              <p>Are you saying its ok for the person working part time to refuse to do housework while the person working full time does everything? </p>

              <p>with regards to money, yes, I find it perfectly acceptable that my money is her money, and her money is her money. Maybe it's my neanderthal brain stem speaking, but to me, the man is the one that brings home the bacon, he should be the main, if not only provider, my stated goal has always been to be a good enough provider that my wife has the option to be a full time housewife if she wants to, and she can spend and buy whatever she fancies, so yeah, I don't call it being spineless, though perhaps a bit chauvinistic, a man should not be on top only in bed alone, no ? </p>
              <p>As for housework, you have missed my point, it is as I've said in my later reply, if either or both parties keep track of who has been doing what for the family then sure as hell a quarrel is just down the road. An equal partnership in marriage doesn't mean both parties split the finances and housework down in half, if you keep a mental count of "damm, I had to do the laundry again today" or "damm ! she never do the dishes and messed up the place again" ... then of course, sooner or later cracks would appear ...</p>
              <p>As the chinese saying goes, it's easy to get along, but it's quite another to stay under the same roof, all the quirks starts tumbling out. Each one of us would have some annoying personal quirks and habits that the other party finds very annoying, for all you know, this chap's wife may well have been biting her teeth and bending over backwards about some annoying quirks of her husband, like in my case the after hours drinking with clients and friends, my ciggy habit, my noctournal fishing sorties, my snoring, etc. If you start being "historical" on your partner, the other partner certainly would get "historical" on you too, and all these little things from both parties would come tumbling out, and then chickens would fly, dogs would jump, and the neighbours would make a noise complaint to the cops, and the bad feelings would fester .... </p>

              <p>Depends.</p>
              <p>If wife earns same salary as you - would you still want to spend 100% on all household expenses? Maybe one should say that the husband should be the one who brings home the bread. But wouldn't it be fair if the wife isn't calculative all the time. Maybe if the husband parked him car at the underground park - forgot to bring some small change and ask the wife to pay - no big deal right? But yeah, I have heard stories from a friend who tells me his wife is so calculative that even if he had forgotten to bring small change to pay for parking - she wouldn't take any coins out from her purse to pay. That bad.</p>
              <p>Or I heard a story of a boyfriend/girlfriend. Boyfriend decided to go for full time study while the girlfriend is working. Last time when boyfriend was working - he used to foot the bill on all outings - movies/dating/dining. Now he is studying and got no income - so he ask the girlfriend if they can go dutch - meaning 50/50 on dinner. The girlfriend said to him - that he must foot the whole dinner because he is the provider. Boyfriend was shock because he is studying and he cannot affort while girlfriend is working. He also say last time he used to spend a lot of money to buy girl friend lots of clothes/presents/dating. He wonder why she treat her back like this?</p>
              <p>So ultimately Man wants to become provider but if Woman start to become calculative like the two story above - Man start to wonder if the Woman thinks of him as an ATM or sugardaddy rather than a husband that she loves and cherish as an equal partner.</p>
              <p>If wife earns the same as the husband - perhaps she can chip in 30%. That is fair enough.</p>
              <p>For sure every man of the family - wants to chip in some money in pay for his own hobbies. Unless he is very gifted with high salary or business income - he would have to allocate some cash for himself. Like a man - likes to enjoy buying  a nice golf set/ nice car/ nice clothes/ nice watches/ give some allowances back to his parents.</p>

              <p>I wouldn't know about my partner but she may prefer to keep her career going and may not be satisfied with being a full-time housewife. It's the way contemporary women are and I feel that the relationship should reflect the autonomy that they have. 
              Realistically, it'll also be more comfortable for the two of us, even if I earn more than I do now.</p>
              <p>I don't think anyone advocates being calculative but we certainly agree that one party shouldn't bear the yoke alone and be taken for granted. The other party has to take up the slack when one is ill or in a peak period at work. The arrangement in normal circumstances has to be agreed on first as others have already pointed out.</p>

              <p>Lets pin down your problems.</p>
              <p>1.  Not enough money</p>
              <p>2. Wife does not do Housework</p>
              <p>3. Of late, wife becomes bitchy (after you ask her to chip
              in)</p>
              <p>#1 is a percieved problem. If you adjust your lifestyle, this
              item will be well under control. Have you ever been in a situation
              where you have no income, borrow money until friends and relatives
              avoid you. 15 year old daughter decides not to study (even though
              she is good in studies) and wants to work to help you. $3k plus $1k
              is a luxury.</p>
              <p>#2 If wife can do housework, hooray. If not, do you love her
              less. I have 2 kids at home, does not lift a finger to do
              housework, all done by me. (after my late wife left us). I just
              need to organise myself and get the important things done. Laundry
              is the most important, followed by stuff in the kitchen, then the
              beddings, then the floor, etc. Live with it, be happy. Occasionally
              ask for help, if dont get the help, its Okay, be happy.</p>
              <p>#3 Wife becomes bitchy. Hopefully (touch wood) she is not having
              a relationship outside. And dont you go suspecting her because it
              will surely spell trouble. If her changed behaviour is because of
              asking to chip in, then let her keep her $1K. They need that kind
              of security. Believe me, they will share with you, just don't make
              any claims on it. If #1 and #2 is properly resolved, #3 will
              dissappear.</p>
