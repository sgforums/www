              <p>Hi, I am 33 and just got married to my wife (same age). Lately we have been having tiffs about housework and finance. She just started working part-time and earns about $1K.I am holding 2 sales jobs, fetching about $3K per month.</p>
              <p>I have been feeling flustered as she is not keen to keep the home clean. I have to come home to clean the house even after a really tiring work day.</p>
              <p>Financially I also feel drained as I need to pay for our house-loans and many bills and expenses. I am not even sure if we could afford to have kids in future.</p>
              <p>My wife became very upset when I told her to chip in, in our home expenses. She is still not into housework and she can't cook.We cannot afford a maid at this moment.</p>
              <p>I love her yet I am feeling very frustrated about her messiness and unwillingness to help me lower down household expenses.</p>
              <p>What shall I do? Divorce is never an option to me.</p>
              <p>Please feel free to drop in your opinion.Thank you.</p>

              you should have talked about such things before getting married.

              <p>I believe he is just flustered about coming back to a messy home after a long day of work (note: he's holding 2 jobs). She may be spending more than they can make.Home loans and bills...in Singapore, are really no joke. And they still have to save for future kids?</p>
              <p>I can only see that they will work out if he just learn to overlook the mess and both cut down/off on every want. Just spend on needs.</p>

              <p>I find it really amazing that people do not discuss financial arrangements and household maintainance before getting married. A few questions need to be asked:</p>
              <p>And since there are no children, why can't the wife work full time?</p>
              <p>And what kind of many bills and expenses are we talking about here?</p>
              <p>What is your monthly mortage payment and are you paying cash or cpf? And what kind of property is it?</p>

              <p>And I think people should be very clear what their personal values and beliefs are and never compromise them just to get married. </p>
              <p>e.g. if you belive in frugrality, don't marry a spendthrift. if you believe in the value of hard work, don't marry a sloth. and etc.</p>

              <p>Lets pin down your problems.</p>
              <p>1.  Not enough money</p>
              <p>2. Wife does not do Housework</p>
              <p>3. Of late, wife becomes bitchy (after you ask her to chip in)</p>
              <p>#1 is a percieved problem. If you adjust your lifestyle, this item will be well under control. Have you ever been in a situation where you have no income, borrow money until friends and relatives avoid you. 15 year old daughter decides not to study (even though she is good in studies) and wants to work to help you. $3k plus $1k is a luxury.</p>
              <p>#2 If wife can do housework, hooray. If not, do you love her less. I have 2 kids at home, does not lift a finger to do housework, all done by me. (after my late wife left us). I just need to organise myself and get the important things done. Laundry is the most important, followed by stuff in the kitchen, then the beddings, then the floor, etc. Live with it, be happy. Occasionally ask for help, if dont get the help, its Okay, be happy.</p>
              <p>#3 Wife becomes bitchy. Hopefully (touch wood) she is not having a relationship outside. And dont you go suspecting her because it will surely spell trouble. If her changed behaviour is because of asking to chip in, then let her keep her $1K. They need that kind of security. Believe me, they will share with you, just don't make any claims on it. If #1 and #2 is properly resolved, #3 will dissappear.</p>

              <p>And I think people should be very clear what their personal

                  married. </p>
              <p>e.g. if you belive in frugrality, don't marry a spendthrift. if
                  you believe in the value of hard work, don't marry a sloth. and

              <p><br>I did not set down any rules and conditions when I married my late wife, but things seems to automatically fall into place, some with a little bit assigning of responsibilities.</p>
              <p>Most times when family is together, I pay. House bills, I pay. Groceries, Kids stuff, and things she wants to get for the family she pays. Generally, I pay for all the basic stuff, and she pays for the "nice to have" stuff.</p>
              <p>Not all women are like that. But I realised one thing. When husband demands, normally there will be trouble. When the wife demands, 80% (not verified) of the time, husband will give way.</p>
