              <p>(1) sounds like a statement from a cynic that I've read before, and (2) is going to end in tears when one party does the housework all the time and is taken for granted. The peace won't last for long.</p>

              <p><br>My friend already in his 30s - very desperate - he tells me age is catching up. Bo Bian. So he marry anyway. He thought he could change her in the course of marriage. But he was wrong - she is still the same bitch.</p>
              <p>The girl - look a bit ok but short in size and very bitchy.</p>
              <p>How to find new one? My friend has been trying to find date for 10 years ! He go everwhere, date co-workers, go pub to find life partner and ask friend for recommendation. Everytime kena rejected and then my friend kena dump by women many time.</p>
              <p>In my country - chinese are getting extinct becuase chinese women are becoming so particular (want perfect husband).</p>
              <p>I know one chinese guy who converted to religion that I don't wanna say. He got 4 kids and two wives. Some more at office - nobody likes him because he acts like a 10 year old - throw tantrum and never cooperate. He is abusive and slap his children - i once heard him do it when i called him on the cellphone - i heard him slapping and verbally abuse his kids with bad words. Some more at office he show third finger and scream bad words at us.</p>
              <p>I am amazed that women of the religion he married to - can still choose this guy. Maybe one thing good about the religion is it teaches the women to respect the husbands. But I don't want to go thru circumsicion and  i don't want to fast one month in a year and i love eating pork.</p>
              <p>But chinese guys in my country - no chinese woman wants.  So we chinese are getting extinct. We only number 6 million in my country of 27 million. In 1960s we used to make up 40% of the population.</p>

              <p><br> My friend already in his 30s - very desperate - he tells me age is
              catching up. Bo Bian. So he marry anyway. He thought he could
              change her in the course of marriage. But he was wrong - she is
              still the same bitch.</p>
              <p>The girl - look a bit ok but short in size and very
              bitchy.</p>
              <p>How to find new one? My friend has been trying to find date
              for 10 years ! He go everwhere, date co-workers, go pub to find
              life partner and ask friend for recommendation. Everytime kena
              rejected and then my friend kena dump by women many time.</p>
              <p>In my country - chinese are getting extinct becuase chinese
              women are becoming so particular (want perfect husband).</p>
              <p>I know one chinese guy who converted to religion that I don't
              wanna say. He got 4 kids and two wives. Some more at office -
              nobody likes him because he acts like a 10 year old - throw tantrum
              and never cooperate. He is abusive and slap his children - i
              once heard him do it when i called him on the cellphone - i
              heard him slapping and verbally abuse his kids with bad words.
              Some more at office he show third finger and scream bad words at
              us.</p>
              <p>I am amazed that women of the religion he married to
              - can still choose this guy. Maybe one thing good about
              the religion is it teaches the women to respect the husbands. But I
              don't want to go thru circumsicion and  i don't want to fast
              one month in a year and i love eating pork.</p>
              <p>But chinese guys in my country - no chinese woman
              wants.  So we chinese are getting extinct. <span style="color: #ff0000;">We only number
              6 million in my country of 27 million. In 1960s we used to make up
              40% of the population.</span></p>

              <p>The most is do housework every once a week. No need do the whole house at once. One portion at a time. Is more than sufficient to keep a neat and clean home.</p>
              <p>We are Asians, we don't wear our outdoor shoes into the house like Ang mohs do.</p>
              <p>Nowadays got washing machine and dryer, dish washer and other electrical appliances to make your life easier.</p>
              <p>Not like last time.. our grandma have to wash clothes with her hands and clean the floor with a bucket and water.</p>
              <p>If TS is not a clean freak ( OCD ) .. then he must be a slave driver.. marry a maid better !</p>
              <p>This why mothers always tell daughters.. never marry a pauper.  Not only he cannot provide you a good life.. he expect you to become his FREE maid.</p>
              <p>TS never look at his own weakness.. he only complain about his wife's misgivings.</p>
              <p>He already very lucky his wife willing to marry a poor shit like him.. yet he come here complain she lazy... that girl also is si bei suay !</p>

              <p>I have been feeling flustered as she is not keen to keep the home clean. I have to come home to clean the house even after a really tiring work day.</p>
              <p>Financially I also feel drained as I need to pay for our house-loans and many bills and expenses. I am not even sure if we could afford to have kids in future.</p>

              <p>A lot of elderly chinese who were born before 1957 - without valid birth cert got their citizenship annuled. Therefore they cannot own land - cannot travel - cannot work.</p>
              <p>I got one friend who married a vietnamese - she only get a visitor pass and have to renew every year. Unless she is Indon muslim - she will never get citizenship.</p>
              <p>5 years back - I watch the news in shock - a group of Indon muslims got shot dead outside a bank apparently trying to rob it - it turns out they are PR holders. Then also another case an Indon muslim was caught molesting an underage girl - another PR holder.</p>
              <p>Whereas, I know a chinese couple who adopted a kid from Philipinnes. He attended International Bacalaurete in private school - top results. Gahmen refuse to give him citizenship.</p>

              <p><br>There are many cases in my country whereby elderly man try to buy brides from vietnam but most brides ran away back to vietnam.</p>
              <p>One case: A 35 year old man paid $20,000 for a vietnamese bride but she turn out to be an ex army officer in viet cong army who know martial art. She began to physical beat him up and abuse him. Then she ran away. The 35 year old man had to go to a famous mediator in my country name Michael Chong. The viet cong officer lady came back and met with press to declare that they "amicably" ask for break up.</p>
              <p>Second case: A 50 year old man married a 23 year old viet cong girl. She refuse to sleep with him and made him sleep in the living room. Got language problem. After 4 months - she ran away back to her village. The 50 year old man went to her village to persuade her come back - but was beaten up by her fellow villagers. Turn out that the 23 year old viet com girl already have a 23 year old lover cum husband in vietnam before she married him.</p>
              <p>So the 50 year old man ask marriage agency for refund. No refund they say.</p>
              <p>So you stil reckon viet cong bride strategy can work?</p>
