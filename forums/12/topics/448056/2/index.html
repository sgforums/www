              <p>Hi, I am 33 and just got married to my wife (same age). Lately we have been having tiffs about housework and finance. She just started working part-time and earns about $1K.I am holding 2 sales jobs, fetching about $3K per month.</p>
              <p>I have been feeling flustered as she is not keen to keep the home clean. I have to come home to clean the house even after a really tiring work day.</p>
              <p>Financially I also feel drained as I need to pay for our house-loans and many bills and expenses. I am not even sure if we could afford to have kids in future.</p>
              <p>My wife became very upset when I told her to chip in, in our home expenses. She is still not into housework and she can't cook.We cannot afford a maid at this moment.</p>
              <p>I love her yet I am feeling very frustrated about her messiness and unwillingness to help me lower down household expenses.</p>
              <p>What shall I do? Divorce is never an option to me.</p>
              <p>Please feel free to drop in your opinion.Thank you.</p>

              <p>1st is the engagement ring</p>
              <p>2nd is the marriage ring</p>
              <p>3rd is the Suffer ring.</p>
              <p>I hope you understand. Since you had married, you hv to take the suffering.</p>
              <p>Good luck</p>

              </p><p>Do the house once, and then don't mess it up. Make it a rule the one who mess up the house must clean it. Don't have too much furniture or clutter, have more bare spaces, its easier to clean and maintain.</p>
              <p>You are making in $3k, so you do the paying. Shut up on that.</p>
              <p>Only two person, eat out most of the time, its cheaper and more convenient. Try cooking just a little bit. You can't, you will alway cook a pot, and for the next two or three days you will be eating left overs. After every cooking and meal there is washing to do. So eat out.</p>
              <p>No maid, no car, and plan your budget. If you have no budget you will always feel frustrated. Because it is all in your head, everything is in your head, so definitely you will explode easily over inconsequential matters.</p>

              <p>You can hire a part time maid.</p>
              <p>As for the house, who messed it up who tidy it up ?</p>
              <p>If you already know that it is your wife pattern on not doing house work and not chipping in for the expenses, then you either accept it or you have to move on.</p>
              <p>No point quarrelling about it as she is not going to change because you are the hubby or you told her so.</p>
              <p>I assume your wife is made in singapore and having a comfortable life with her family.</p>
              <p>Or else re-design your house so that there are less things to tidy up. (Pack up all those useless deco or stuff)</p>

              <p>Yes not all women are like that. MOST women are like that. Your wife is in the minority.</p>
              <p>If husband don't give way it is recipe for divorce. You see - women can get away with it but men can't. Why for once men become the demanding one? Its no longer the same - women are no longer the weaker sex - they earn comparable to us - they are in macho vocations like fireman and army - they become the one who wear the pants in family. Its time we men ask for fairer treatment (more comparable).</p>

              <p>Hi, I am 33 and just got married to my wife (same age). Lately
              we have been having tiffs about housework and finance. She just
              started working part-time and earns about $1K.I am holding 2 sales
              jobs, fetching about $3K per month.</p>
              <p>I have been feeling flustered as she is not keen to keep the
              home clean. I have to come home to clean the house even after a
              really tiring work day.</p>
              <p>Financially I also feel drained as I need to pay for our
              house-loans and many bills and expenses. I am not even sure if we
              could afford to have kids in future.</p>
              <p>My wife became very upset when I told her to chip in, in our
              home expenses. She is still not into housework and she can't
              cook.We cannot afford a maid at this moment.</p>
              <p>I love her yet I am feeling very frustrated about her messiness
              and unwillingness to help me lower down household expenses.</p>
              <p>What shall I do? Divorce is never an option to me.</p>
              <p>Please feel free to drop in your opinion.Thank you.</p>

              <p>Answer is simple: my friend cannot live without woman but live with woman also complain a lot.</p>
              <p>Yes - dating period that time we all friends advice him not to marry the bitch. Yet he still marry the bitch. I don't know why but I think its because he is desperate because he could not find anyone else.</p>
              <p>He complain about her during dating period now marriage also want to complain.</p>

              <p>If he cannot live without woman than just remain as bf and gf. Don't get marry. If she insists to get marry just give excuses such as not so fast as I want to concentrate on my career etc and than slowly look for a better gf than dump her..</p>

              <p><br>My friend already in his 30s - very desperate - he tells me age is catching up. Bo Bian. So he marry anyway. He thought he could change her in the course of marriage. But he was wrong - she is still the same bitch.</p>
              <p>The girl - look a bit ok but short in size and very bitchy.</p>
              <p>How to find new one? My friend has been trying to find date for 10 years ! He go everwhere, date co-workers, go pub to find life partner and ask friend for recommendation. Everytime kena rejected and then my friend kena dump by women many time.</p>
              <p>In my country - chinese are getting extinct becuase chinese women are becoming so particular (want perfect husband).</p>
              <p>I know one chinese guy who converted to religion that I don't wanna say. He got 4 kids and two wives. Some more at office - nobody likes him because he acts like a 10 year old - throw tantrum and never cooperate. He is abusive and slap his children - i once heard him do it when i called him on the cellphone - i heard him slapping and verbally abuse his kids with bad words. Some more at office he show third finger and scream bad words at us.</p>
              <p>I am amazed that women of the religion he married to - can still choose this guy. Maybe one thing good about the religion is it teaches the women to respect the husbands. But I don't want to go thru circumsicion and  i don't want to fast one month in a year and i love eating pork.</p>
              <p>But chinese guys in my country - no chinese woman wants.  So we chinese are getting extinct. We only number 6 million in my country of 27 million. In 1960s we used to make up 40% of the population.</p>
