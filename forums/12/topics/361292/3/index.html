              <p>By now you probably get the idea... don't blame NS.</p>

              <p>Don't know why you didnt do much for 2 years after NS. It takes you 2 years to recover from the 2 years of NS? If so, maybe you'll forget about her in 6 years' time.</p>

              <p>Good that you are "recovering" and trying to catch up. But then, do it for yourself, don't do it to win her back. The fact that she started work, got to know more people (guys in specific)... so will you meet more gals when you make the effort to be engaged with society.</p>

              <p>Damn, people love to blame NS for everything, don't they.. It shows that they have not internalised anything learnt in those two years, and prefer to see it as having wasted it.</p>
              <p>TS, stop living in the past and treat it as a new start. Change is the only constant in life, and in relations with other people.. it's how you manage the change or make it work for you that counts.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>about 6 years ago, i used to hand out with a girl during my late
              teens. She was a decent, and homely girl. She only used to trust
              and hang out with me, the  only guy she knew.. i had many
              dreams about her being my gf, all until NS spoilt it. Flash forward
              ,  We are both approaching our mid 20s now.</p>
              <p>She went to SIM to do her degree while i rotted away in NS.
              During this time, i only used to call her on mobile and met a few
              times. Then i was posted to Australia SAF camp till i ORD. So as a
              result i could not meet her in singapore.  When i finally ORD
              from the rothole,  i went to look for her. She was already
              working and i noticed she has changed a lot. She is no more the
              same person i used to know. She now knows other guys as well (
              working colleagues). even our looks are mismatched now. She looks
              older and mature while i still look like a teenager like how i used
              to 6 years ago. Her talking has also changed quite a bit. I felt
              awakward and somehow i think she has been influenced by others.
              After the meeting she did not call me , i sensed something was
              wrong, but i feel too inferior compared to her status now. I dont
              know if she dont want to meet me. i tried callling her a few times
              on weekends but she always says "i am busy, call me back later.." .
              This goes on every single time i call her until i give up. But i
              still cannot live without seeing her. I enquired through a few
              friends and what i learnt was she is not attached to any guy but
              dates quite a few guys here and then.</p>
              <p>Now i feel afraid of meeting or calling her as i dont want to
              feel hurt. But in my heart , i still think she has a deepfound
              respect for me. For 2 years after ORD, i was not doing anything,
              but doing a part time job which paid me quite well. Its because of
              my brain drain due to the endless tekan and paranoia thoughts
              during NS&gt;</p>
              <p>My life has picked up now, as i joined the civil service and
              doing part time degree in SIM. I have not tried contacting her for
              quite some time now. But here and then, such thoughts depress me
              often when i think of her. Is it because of the stupid NS which
              made us apart, For one i know that i will never forgive SAF for
              ruining my life like that.</p>
              <p>What is the best approach i can take now?. Depressed.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">People and situation changed along with time. Some relationship died off and some relationship evolved to become better but eventually there will be a separation in death as such. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">You need to grow up too and widen ur circle of friends. I don't see why she can't get to know more guy friends. Though you might have 'like her' or being a very close friend, i don't think you should limit her getting to know more guy friends since both of you are not official an item.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Anyway review your attitude towards her and clearly understand what went wrong.</span></p>

              <p><strong>She was a decent, and homely girl. She only used to trust and hang out with me, the  only guy she knew..</strong></p>
              <p><strong>She was already working and i noticed she has changed a lot. She is no more the same person i used to know. She now knows other guys as well ( working colleagues). even our looks are mismatched now. She looks older and mature while i still look like a teenager like how i used to 6 years ago. Her talking has also changed quite a bit. I felt awakward and somehow i think she has been influenced by others.</strong></p>
              <p>What the phuck............ You think what?</p>
              <p>She only hangs around with just 1 guy and thats you? Of course she also gets to know other guys la. It's not like your the only guy in the world. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">  The way you phrase your words tells a lot about you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>"Looks mismatched" - whats that?</p>
              <p>She looks older while you still look like a teenager - that is your problem la....And you say she has changed and blame NS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is not that she has changed a lot or that she has been influeced by others, it is you who did not change. 6 years leh. More or less also got change what.</p>
              <p>And dont blame NS, for i dont see the problem with it.</p>
