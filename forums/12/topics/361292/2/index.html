              <p>i see you have taken the easy way out by blaming everything on NS. you make yourself sound like a tragic hero but in reality you're just plain pathetic.</p>
              <p>do you even understand why singapore needs an deterrence force? what do you think gave you the freedom and peace to wail your heart out here? it's unfortunate that singapore is small, it cannot afford a huge regular army so guys are conscripted to serve NS and defend what is important to them.</p>
              <p>NS should not come to you as a surprise. you know what was coming and what did you do before it came? many guys have served their fair share of NS to give you time to do what you needed to but too bad you did not treasure it.</p>
              <p>next is this vacuum you called NS. you claim you "rotted" during these two years but all i see is you chose to do so. NS does not prevent anyone from planning their own future. you knew what were the problems but instead of planning how to overcome them you start your blaming game. you seemed to take pride in saying how you have remained unchanged after six years while the girl of your dreams have "changed". you also tried to paint a picture of her as a "weak-minded" individual who "changes her personality due to the environment". seriously i smell sour grapes because you simply could not accept the fact that she had blossomed into a woman. people change because they adapt to survive! NS was supposed to make you a responsible man, not a self-righteous wimp. and what do you think her reaction would be if she sees you still stuck in the past? she'd probably be thinking "what kind of future can this guy possibly share with me if he's still the same teenage boy six long years ago? we can't talk like before because we live in different stages of life now." try to understand what the girl thinks instead of finding excuses for yourself.</p>
              <p>based on your posts of "my parents said this,my parents said that", it is evident that you are a still pampered like a small child in your family. i must apologise if you are offended by what i am going to say about your parents but they have given you false hopes to protect your fragile ego rather than giving you practical advice for self-improvement.</p>
              <p>it's good to know that you have finally planned for your self-improvement to make up for the "lost time". but you must remember that this is to "catch up" with the girl and progress together, not hold her back once you caught up with her. if you change for the better, her impression of you will imrpove as well. even if she treats you as no more than just a friend, fret not because you might be attracting other girls with your newfound self.</p>
              <p>best of luck for your future.</p>

              <p>heck even viruses mutate! Accept this change. Without change, new ones won't appear. Bcause of her, your dating life is stalled for like 6 friggin years? Even Buddha said "the only thing that is constant is change."</p>
              <p>Your emotions have caused you to be so clouded in your judgement so much so that it's so appalling. All you know is blaming. Of what use is that to you? Are you blaming NS for your circumstances. Look, Im not trying to be harsh here but the world owes you nothing. She owes you nothing. She can do whatever she wants. You can do what you want.</p>
              <p> The only person that you should love most is yourself. </p>
              <p>Peace</p>
