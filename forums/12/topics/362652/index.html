              <p>That is the trouble with people. They often brought upon others what they do not want others to bring upon themselves.</p>
              <p>TS, if you are really sincere, go buy a cake and go over to your friend's house and apologise to him face-to-face. Odds are you will not do that because you do not have the guts to do so, despite the fact that you are in the wrong.</p>
              <p>And to cool-gal, friends are not clothes. Many people have this misconception, and treat people like spouses, friends, and even in severe cases, family as clothes, ready to be disposed off anytime. If you think of a person as someone whom you want as a friend for only a set period of time, then I will say you do not truly treasure that person as a friend.</p>
              <p>And it is not about being worth it or not. If the TS is at fault, he should put down his pride and do what a true man will do. He can take my advice in through one ear and out the other, and I will be certain that he will lose some more of his "friends".</p>

              <p>U rich boy ah? Apology also need buy cake... If for every single apology need buy cakes, i'll go broke and you see cakeshops opening everyday...</p>
              <p>This issue isn't such a large problem to require such a big apology anyway which is totally ridiculous.</p>

              <p>Well the ball is in your friend's court, its up to your friend to decide. I had a similar experience 1 month ago, i was shopping with my sister (who work as an air stewardness). We chanced upon one of my friend and i just greet her, after that a few days later we chanced upon each other in food court as we work in same building.</p>
              <p>While i was having lunching with her, she ask if my sister was my gf and wats her occupation, i told her she work as air stewardness and before i can answer that she is my sister, my friend went on to say air stewardness are high class hooker and will do anything for money.</p>
              <p>I was so pissed off as she is like 156cm and 90kg (thats wat she told me), anyway i just told her i am offended and leave halfway. I am not being petty but in the past she has make bad remarks on my occupation saying that accountant is a low pay job which i just never comment as i guess she has the right to her comments.</p>
              <p>Howvever this  time i am piss off as she went tothe extent of insulting my loved ones, anyway i have delete her from my msn and occassionally i see her in the street and i just ignored her as i just feel a friend who insult you and your loved ones are really not a friend at all.   </p>

              <p>This issue isn't such a large problem to require such a big

              <p>Sincerity is more important than anything material and

              <p>Of course I am not that rich. Well, you can always go for those smaller cakes which cost $5~7, just good enough for 2 people to eat.</p>
              <p>As for sincerity wise, I will say that the 2 of us have different views on it.</p>
              <p>You are those who believe that sincerity should be more of a thing from the heart, and that it should be shown through words.</p>
              <p>I am one of those who believe that sincerity should be shown through actions, and that words can never outweight actions.</p>
              <p>Hence, even though you see this as a small issue, I see it on a different scale. Small things can become bigger ones. If TS take a wrong step again, it will be even harder to clear things up with his friend. That is why I want him to show it through his actions that he is really very sorry for his unkind words.</p>
              <p>Neither of us are wrong, it is just that sincerity, being a part of kindness, takes on different forms when it is viewed from different angles.</p>

              <p>That is true. But a really outstanding and good friend, will always think about you before he/she opens his/her mouth. No matter how close the two of you get, he/she will always think about your stand before making any negative comments.</p>
              <p>In thickskin's case, it is pretty obvious that his 'friend' has a REALLY foul mouth, and an uncaring attitude, so it is not surprising that he break their friendship.</p>

              <p>I did guage whether will i regret as i have few friends, but in that case she thought that my sis is my gf and she went on to insult her of being a hooker either way she is a prick.</p>
              <p>I can hear from her tone that she was not joking but rather in a bitter and sarcastism tone as she just broke off with her bf as he finds her obese (thats wat she told me). I can understand her feelings but no way should she insult my loved ones.</p>

              <p>Yes i agree there is no right or wrong, she might have some bad experience with air stewardness  causing her a permanent case of negative stereotyping against them, however but i doubt i will never insult my friend's loved ones especially this insult is quite humilating and if i never treat her like a friend ( an ex friend now), i will insult her back that day instead of leaving halfway.</p>
              <p>Anyway my stand is that as an elder brother, my priority is to protect my loved ones  </p>

              <p>How about pissing me off everyday and buying me food everyday for breakfast so i no need go see what junk food i have in the house to fill up my stomach :p</p>
              <p>Do note that TS is a NSF and NSF are not rich. $5-7 is still a large % of the pathetic NS allowance.</p>
              <p>Anyway i don't believe in using money to buy or remedy friendship and thats the last thing i will ever advice anyone when i counsel them. If you really want action, i will rather suggest making a card or something selfmade to show sincerity than going to buy a cake which is costly as well as not really showing much effort as well.</p>
