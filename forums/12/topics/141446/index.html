I believe all of you have a mixture of these throughout your life. At which phrase of your life do you hold these so called love definitions, before adopting new ones? Has it worked for you? If no, why?<br><br>P.S: Poll will <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ONLY </strong></span>be tabulated by chosing your CURRENT (or closest) belief and you have to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>STATE </strong></span>them for my easy reference. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br>A:<br>You believe that everyone in this world fits someone else somewhere in this world. You believe that you will eventually get married (or at least you would hold the promise of love). You believe that love is only for the willing and if it didn't work out, that person isn't meant to be.<br><br>B:<br>You believe in having many possible partners before getting married. You believe in experiencing all form of fun first (or at least many variety of partners), before getting tied by the roots of marriage. You believe that the person who will make you settle down and get married, is the one whom you would give up the entire forest for him/her. You believe in monogamy in marriage.<br><br>C:<br>You believe alot in fate. You believe that everything is fated and predestined, especially the people whom you will end up together. So much believe in fate... you tend to be passive in the chase, thinking that IF he/she is yours ultimately, no matter what happen, eventually, you two will come together.<br><br>D:<br>You believe that there is no such thing as true love. People get married because of their biological calls - when it's time, you get married. You believe in individualism - although you don't mind getting married ultimately, but even if you were to remain alone, it's ok for you. You make up through other aspects in your life (Career, Religion, etc).<br><br>E:<br>You believe that love is more like a companionship. You believe in friendship after a failed relationship and sees Love as an advanced form of friendship. You don't mind and prefer co-habitation first... before having the actual marriage, if everything works out in the end. Afterall, cohabitation is like a test before the examination (marriage).<br><br>F:<br>You believe that Love is all about giving and sacrificing. You believe strongly that with love, comes hurt. You will stay in a ruin relationship, thinking that as long as you remain in there, there is something you could do to make it better - UNLESS your partner doesn't want you anymore. You believe in waiting for someone and put love as your life's top priority.<br><br>G:<br>You believe in 'The One.' You believe that there can only be him/her and would do everything to keep the bond because there will never be anyone as good/better than him/her. When you are married to 'The One' - you see it as an ultimate stop. The issue of divorce is alienation and impossible.<br><br>H:<br>You believe in cosmic lessons. You believe that every relationship is like a step towards your eventual relationship. You believe in improving, evolving and learning. You believe that Love is all about learning something new about ourselves, our partners and most importantly, our love.<br><br>I:<br>You believe in non-committed relationship. You believe in 'living-and-love-for-the-moment.' Make good love, good dates, enjoy yourself, bathe in essence of romance, fun and all the goodness love could offer. You don't mind dating people whom are unavailable, saying that all is fair in love and war. Marriage to you is scary.<br><br>J:<br>You believe more in propagating and believe in marrying younger so that the age gap between your child and you isn't too wide. Fulfilling love is you is very much inclusive of your offspring. You desire to be married and hopes to find someone suitable and settle down as soon as possible. Love to you is about living with the suitable one as soon as possible.<br><br>K:<br>You believe that Love is nothing but dollars and cents. You see relationship as a form of investment. Every investment must see a return. You cannot see yourself getting married without having to establish a solid career and income. You are calculative in the sense that, if you see no future in the relationship. You rather cut the 'losses' before you incur more loss.<br><br>L:<br>You believe in spiritual love. You believe that your love and you must share the same faith (or request conversion), for love is nothing without religion (spirtual love). Love is always 2nd priority, God/Religion is the first. You foresee complication is having a relationship with people of different faith and avoids.<br><br>M:<br>You believe that love conquers all. You believe that all the massive difference between you and your love is nothing for love conquers everything. You do not believe in people's opinion about your relationship and would pursue difficult relationship if that is what your heart's desire.<br><br>N:<br>You believe that you are unlovable. You could never see yourself getting attached, let alone get married. You see yourself as inadequate and probably the feels that everyone you know would get married and you would still be left behind. Although you desire to be love and be loved - there are negative qualities in you that is sapping confidence and self esteem.<br><br>O:<br>You see love and lover as two separate entity. You believe that the man/woman you marry is the good husband/wife you wouldn't divorce. But you believe in extra-marital affairs. You believe in the existence of a lover, apart from your husband/wife, to satisfy emotionally or sexually.<br><br>***<br><br>A: 1 - (4%)<br>B: 4 - (16%)<br>C: 4 - (16%)<br>D:<br>E: 4 - (16%)<br>F: 2 - (8%)<br>G:<br>H: 2 - (8%)<br>I: 1 - (4%)<br>J:<br>K:<br>L:<br>M:<br>N: 7 (28%)<br>O:<br><br>Total polled (25): Ito_^, rammstein619, StarPuppy, DeathEdge, DeadPoet, DriftingGuy, Magnus, ETboy, Ah Gong, Wolfwoof^^, browniebaobao, zacken99, Saint`, kopiosatu, droopyeyes, Brightday, SoonKeong, shinta, I_am_PeTe_Parker, starblue, CoolMyth, Haze|, hyuuga neji, sgFish, FeowFeow<br><br>Cheers</div>

You believe that love is only for the willing and <strong>if it didn't work out, that person isn't meant to be. </strong><br><br>B:<br>You believe in having many possible partners before getting married. You believe in experiencing all form of fun first (or at least many variety of partners), before getting tied by the roots of marriage. <strong>You believe that the person who will make you settle down and get married, is the one whom you would give up the entire forest for him/her. You believe in monogamy in marriage. </strong><br><br>D:<br>You believe that there is no such thing as true love. People get married because of their biological calls - when it's time, you get married. You believe in individualism - although <strong>you don't mind getting married ultimately, but even if you were to remain alone, it's ok for you.</strong> You make up through other aspects in your life (Career, Religion, etc).<br><br><strong>E:<br>You believe that love is more like a companionship. You believe in friendship after a failed relationship and sees Love as an advanced form of friendship. You don't mind and prefer co-habitation first... before having the actual marriage, if everything works out in the end. Afterall, cohabitation is like a test before the examination (marriage).<br><br>F:<br>You believe that Love is all about giving and sacrificing. You believe strongly that with love, comes hurt. You will stay in a ruin relationship, thinking that as long as you remain in there, there is something you could do to make it better</strong> - UNLESS your partner doesn't want you anymore. You believe in waiting for someone and put love as your life's top priority.<br><br>G:<br>You believe in 'The One.' You believe that there can only be him/her and would do everything to keep the bond because there will never be anyone as good/better than him/her. When you are married to 'The One' - you see it as an ultimate stop. The issue of divorce is alienation and impossible.<br><br>H:<br>You believe in cosmic lessons. You believe that every relationship is like a step towards your eventual relationship. You believe in improving, evolving and learning. You believe that Love is all about learning something new about ourselves, our partners and most importantly, our love.<br><br>I:<br>You believe in non-committed relationship. You believe in 'living-and-love-for-the-moment.' Make good love, good dates, enjoy yourself, bathe in essence of romance, fun and all the goodness love could offer. You don't mind dating people whom are unavailable, saying that all is fair in love and war. Marriage to you is scary.<br><br>J:<br>You believe more in propagating and <strong>believe in marrying younger so that the age gap between your child and you isn't too wide. Fulfilling love is you is very much inclusive of your offspring.</strong> You desire to be married and hopes to find someone suitable and settle down as soon as possible. Love to you is about living with the suitable one as soon as possible.<br><br>K:<br>You believe that Love is nothing but dollars and cents. You see relationship as a form of investment. Every investment must see a return. You cannot see yourself getting married without having to establish a solid career and income. You are calculative in the sense that, if you see no future in the relationship. You rather cut the 'losses' before you incur more loss.<br><br>L:<br>You believe in spiritual love. You believe that your love and you must share the same faith (or request conversion), for love is nothing without religion (spirtual love). Love is always 2nd priority, God/Religion is the first. You foresee complication is having a relationship with people of different faith and avoids.<br><br>M:<br>You believe that love conquers all. You believe that all the massive difference between you and your love is nothing for love conquers everything. You do not believe in people's opinion about your relationship and would pursue difficult relationship if that is what your heart's desire.<br><br>N:<br>You believe that you are unlovable. You could never see yourself getting attached, let alone get married. You see yourself as inadequate and probably the feels that everyone you know would get married and you would still be left behind. Although you desire to be love and be loved - there are negative qualities in you that is sapping confidence and self esteem.<br><br>O:<br>You see love and lover as two separate entity. You believe that the man/woman you marry is the good husband/wife you wouldn't divorce. But you believe in extra-marital affairs. You believe in the existence of a lover, apart from your husband/wife, to satisfy emotionally or sexually.<br><br>***<br><br>A:<br>B: 1 - (11.1%)<br>C:<br>D:<br>E: 2 - (22.2%)<br>F: 2 - (22.2%)<br>G:<br>H: 2 - (22.2%)<br>I:<br>J:<br>K:<br>L:<br>M:<br>N: 2 (22.2%)<br>O:<br><br>Total polled (9): Ito_^, rammstein619, StarPuppy, DeathEdge, DeadPoet, DriftingGuy, Magnus, ETboy, Ah Gong<br><br>Cheers[/b]</blockquote>those that i highlighted...
