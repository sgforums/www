              <p>It started in November when my bf asked me to help him check his email when I saw he emailed a transvestite saying "Hi Pretty...etc.etc.etc" and basically asked if she was available to "have fun" with him before he enlisted. I asked but he said he knew nothing of it...</p>
              <p>Then recently, his brother showed me two chat logs with that same person...we were already together for 7 months...then I saw that he had started sexual talk and gave out his number and wanted an "experience" with her.</p>
              <p>Judging from how he treats me which is well, I'm extremely confused now. On msn, from wat I know, even with remote assistance..you cannot have a conversation with your friend and a hacker supposedly using your account to talk to someone in your contact list at the same time. I'm really hoping I'm wrong. His comp has no firewall (I think). He claims he didn't do it...but logically its quite impossible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Someone help me.</p>

              <p>I really need some sound advice. I know its up to me in the end. But its just scary to know the person you share your life with has such a secret. I hope its not him but logically it doesn't seem to be anyone else.</p>
              <p>Now I'm scared, but I can't cry or react because its sort of shocking, and also he might feel destroyed etc. and I know its impossible to be sincere and not hurtful. I can deal with this side fetish I suppose but its damn scary and I have no idea what to do right now. I'm trying to be positive and believe him that he won't do such a thing.</p>
              <p>In the past he really did look like a girl, some say prettier than other girls. I know a few guys do look like that, my cousin has a bandmate that looks just like a girl even I got fooled. He's my second bf. The first hurt me very very very very badly, and it did take me a long while to trust someone else.</p>
              <p>My bf has always showered me with love and respect, which explains why this could not be his doing, but I've called a few people in I.T, and they've confirmed that its impossible for the conversation to happen anywhere else but from his computer. He was at the same time also, when the conversation with her happened, talking to his best friend. Exactly the same time. His brother got worried and showed me those conversations. I'm not sure what to think though.</p>
              <p>The vital stats, even what sort of boxers he wears, was all revealed and if he was pranking around he would never give out his number. He received gay jokes forever and even though he's now in ns it hasn't stopped. But his friends really don't mean anything. Now I'm scared as to who he really is.</p>

              <p><br>I did. Actually he said he may have a mental problem. Which I know about. Its okay with me, because each person has their own psychological issues. I'm just feeling quite cornered because I don't want to say things too hurtful to him. I'm sorry I really can't explain what this feeling is.</p>

              <p>I only mention it because in his conversations he mentioned he was interested in being the girl generally. Doing what girls do in sex.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He treats me very well. I have no issues with transsexuals. Its probably the contradiction between the him that is always with me and the him in those conversations. Its remarkably explicit. Those happened behind my back.</p>
              <p>I don't think I'm a victim or anything. I'm just extremely confused because he doesn't even know if he wrote it according to him. There's two sides, one I'd rather believe but no solid proof, the other side I dread but proven. I admit I'm pretty devastated. My ex left me for some girl for aesthetic purposes. Its always physical beauty. Its okay with me, I'm willing to be open about this, but can there be ANY good intentions while someone has told you they love you only an hour before the conversation, and then become someone totally different the next hour.</p>

              <p>Thats some wierd behavior from a guy to want experience what girls feel during sex...</p>
              <p>Maybe you should have a good talk with him. You mention he has mental problems, what sort of mental problems if you don't mind sharing?</p>

              <p>I'm not sure the SAF sent him to a therapist...he's going today actually. He doesn't like society because of you know, the people because he had alot of shit from people since he was young.

              <p>He had an ex who was terrifying and did it with him out of guilt because she was cheating on him. He values sex as a sacred thing so in the end though there was intercourse he didn't do anything, and I suppose a few minutes after she realized he wasn't interested, she just got off and went home. For about 3-4 years he lived his life with her thinking he's useless. She used to make fun of him and her mother and her both called him useless etc.</p>
              <p>Then he had alot of accummulated anger or some enlightnened sense...and decided to hate. Him falling for me is a miracle. He thinks I'm perfect etc. Which I guess provides too much of a contradiction to the person who was talking dirty to the transvestite. Initially I assumed that...he needed someone to talk to about him getting gay jokes or if perhaps he has a guy-girl problem. I'm only taking comfort to that.</p>
              <p>I mean no disrespect to anyone. I just don't know how to put this in a better way. He really went through alot but he said the moment I came into his life everything is complete.</p>
              <p>I told him two nights ago, I said not to clip his own wings, just keep flying. One moment of folly should not determine how he lives the rest of his life. Deep down, I'm just pretty shit scared.</p>

              <p>Just do your best to help him since you are 1 of the best person to. Just stay by this side and help him tide over his problems to the best of your ability. Sometimes just the presence of someone who cares works alot more than any counsellor can advice.</p>
              <p>Problems during the childhood so sometimes lead to some problems later in life but your bf will need to be able to get over the feminist comments and think of himself as a guy doing things the guy way and not girl.</p>
              <p>If sex is really sacred to him, i don't think he would do anything unfaithful to you since theres no reason for him to do it and ruin things with you.</p>

              Perhaps, the question that you might want to answer - not here- do you love out of fear, love out of need, or love out of love - it presupposes that you are aware that all emanates from you.
              Love shares , love appreciates .
              When it is logic, when it is reasons - its not love but something else UNCONSCIOUSLY disguised as love. 
               To think that one knows another is very, erroneous. How can you know another? How can you know the man/woman? They are processes, they are not things. The woman/man that you knew yesterday is not there today. So much water has gone down the River; he/she is somebody else, totally different.
              And the man that you slept with or ... last night, look at his face again in the morning. He is no more the same person, so much has changed. So much, incalculably much has changed. That is the difference between a thing and a person. The furniture in the room is the same, but the man and the woman, they are no more the same. Can one relate to the furniture? One relates to a human being!
