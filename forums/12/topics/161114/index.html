            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Papercut,<br><br>Every girl feels like they need to measure up to their bf's exes at some point in time, &amp; this is especially so when the relationship is new, like yours.  Sometimes it's Not even the appearance, but how sad your bf was when they broke up, because the ex(es) obviously meant alot to him if he felt so depressed when they'd split.<br><br>The good news is, this feeling won't last  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">   I've been in your position, &amp; I worked up the courage to talk calmly with my partner about it.  I broke the news of my insecurity to him very gently, all the while reassuring him that it wasn't the result of any deficiencies on his part, but rather, that it's normal for girls to feel that way.<br><br>He gave me the exact reassurance I needed.  And I told him that everytime I felt insecure, I would always speak to him about it.  Happily, it got less &amp; less frequent, &amp; eventually, I don't speak to him about it anymore because I don't feel insecure about his exes anymore.<br><br>There must be a reason for his beautiful smiles when he sees me, &amp; the way he feels fulfilled &amp; contented (which he told me himself).  If you're feeling this way, I would recommend you bring it up gently with your bf, &amp; let him reassure you.  If you weren't special to him, he wouldn't have chosen you : )<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by papercut87:</div><div class="quote_body"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> hey guys. just recently i got attached to this particular guy whom ive been gud friends with fer abt six months or so. he confessed that he was interested in me and asked me to b his gf. i was pretty reluctant at first but he kept askin me give him a chance to prove himself... n so i did. its been about a week since i went into a r/s with him, hes super caring, attentive and encouraging towards me.. but somehow i feel so inferior whenever i compare myself to his ex gfs. some of them are like so pretty n glam.. whereas im just a simple student who doesnt even bother puttin on makeup whenever i go out? i seriously dunno why he chose me in the first place.. cauz i just feel like im nth compared to his previous gfs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> haiz dont think im good enuff fer him.. feel like brking up. gaah. but its only a week..<br><br>how?</div></blockquote></div>

I recently was fortunate enuff to win the heart of my current gf. She revealed to me that prior to accepting me, she was thinking a long while about saying yes to me. Why? The reason was becuz both she and my ex are in my company &amp; she knows who my ex is. And she was deliberating so much 'cuz she felt that my ex is too pretty as compared to her. But i reassured her that the fact that i chased her meant that I have already taken into consideration all factors and am serious about her, &amp; not juz her looks, etc. And she shouldn't bother about other people comparing her &amp; my ex.<br><br>My bottomline is, if your bf has been persistent &amp; sincere, then u shouldn't worry too much; like wat the other forumites has said, u must have something unique that attracts him, be it ex-factor, affinity &amp; whatnots. So be confident &amp; love him unconditionally. However, if u are still wary that he could be a player, then avoid intimacy for now till u are very sure.<br><br>Hope this helps <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
