I recently was fortunate enuff to win the heart of my current gf. She revealed to me that prior to accepting me, she was thinking a long while about saying yes to me. Why? The reason was becuz both she and my ex are in my company &amp; she knows who my ex is. And she was deliberating so much 'cuz she felt that my ex is too pretty as compared to her. But i reassured her that the fact that i chased her meant that I have already taken into consideration all factors and am serious about her, &amp; not juz her looks, etc. And she shouldn't bother about other people comparing her &amp; my ex.<br><br>My bottomline is, if your bf has been persistent &amp; sincere, then u shouldn't worry too much; like wat the other forumites has said, u must have something unique that attracts him, be it ex-factor, affinity &amp; whatnots. So be confident &amp; love him unconditionally. However, if u are still wary that he could be a player, then avoid intimacy for now till u are very sure.<br><br>Hope this helps <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>gals put on makeup may look nice outside, but when they remove makeup at home, who  knows wad they look like, some gals use very heavy makeup to cover flaws they have on their face...<br><br>i prefer gals with minimal makeup..as i get to see their real face..</div>
