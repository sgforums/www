Wanna help u with job load. In my current job, my colleagues dun tekan me / shout at me for something for small, I already happy.</blockquote>on the surface, you may hear me talk about my job and it sounds great lah(moon is always brighter on the other side of the river), but it's not as perfect as you think.<br>i do have occasional brushes with my colleagues and sometimes, the blur-blur ones always give me wrong information for me to input and in the end, i got screwed by higher-ups. but the main reason why my colleagues so nice towards me most of the time is because i help them like loyal servant like that, very sincere that kind of warm feeling. that's why they reciprocate in kinder ways. but for the first time in my life, this doesn't have any effect on my boss and haiz......<br><br>i think if one is a kind and honest soul, wherever u go, chances are that you'll get along well with others.....except the rare, occasional b@st@rd here and there.<br><br>haiz.....</div>
