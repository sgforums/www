            <div class='col-md body'>hi all,<br><br>i'm currently working as an office clerk in a precision engineering firm. all has been coming along fine for about 1 year already, but with the coming of the new year 2007, lots of things seems to be re-vamped in my department.<br><br>during the past few months, i've been doing my work and writing/managing the department's documents a certain way, and my colleagues have absolutely no problem with that. life is sweet.....<br><br>but now, my department boss wants me to change the way i handle those documents and my work. basically, he's added a lot of very very tedious steps into my usual working routine, so incredibly insane that in the past, a 40 page document gets done and ready for issuing in 10 mins, whereas recently, to do a 30 page document takes about 7 hours(9 am to 5.30 pm++), and by 7 hours, i mean 7 straight hours at the desk typing and working away, no time at all to see/talk to other colleagues at all(not even a single word, except during lunch).<br><br>you see, on my typical work day, i would photo-copy lots and lots of documents(900++ pages per day), write bunches and bunches of data-letters to clients/suppliers/other companies(approx. 50++ per day) and other miscellaneous mainteance errands that clerks/postman/sai-kang warriors do.<br>i can handle all these, no problem, since i can say i work very efficiently and have a systemized organization way of working.<br><br>so, as you guys can see, in the past, if i spend 10 mins to finish 40 page document, i can really clear a lot of the office work, photo-copy finish whatever mountain is given to me, settle all outstanding issues, maintain the office well and have time to breathe. but now, to do a very simple 30-page document can take 1 full working day, and that means 98% of the rest of the expected jobs are not touched at all!!!!!!! based on my calculations, even if i work non-stop from 8 AM to 2 AM(19 hours) everyday, also cannot clear the work.<br><br>in other words, my working pace has slowed down by at least 30++ times ever since the silly introduction/concepts he introduced outta the blue.<br>the worst thing is.....get this clear : these new tasks he introduced are not even in my job scope......it's supposed to be done by our outsourced-companies(something like consultant/service provider companies)!!!!!!! SIAO!!!!!!!!<br><br>dunno if i offended him or what, but other higher-ranking colleagues can give him trashy document(spelling errors, liquid paper everywhere, cancellations, crumped paper, wrong subject, missing content etc.) and he can still sign so happily and never read. from what i know, i never step on his toe and never even bad-mouth him to a single ant. i tried all my best to satisfy his sick whims everytime, but....sigh.<br><br>i'm trying to hang in there, but i'll try not to tell him my problems, because he's a Da4 Nan2 Ren2 Zhu3 Yi4(Big man) kind of boss : very hardcore, loves to scold english bad words, don't accept feedback from subordinates and brutal.<br><br>so, what i do now? if i tell him i got problem, he'll be sure to blast me in front of everyone. i'm currently doing my resume to prepare to find another job already, he's getting more and more insane in his requirements towards me every month.<br><br>but.....i'm very stuck : this job is quite high-paying(don't think can easily find a better one elsewhere) and the dress code is very lax(which i love). the colleagues are all very very nice and warm and i've absolutely no problems with them. in fact, a lot of my higher colleagues(executives) often see me so trapped by work and they try to help me whenever they're free. even the company's GM also very nice......the only problem is my own department boss.<br><br>to quit just because of 1 person.......is very very silly......but....i really have no choice....it's useless to tell my problems to the higher-ups(GMs, HR managers) as my boss is quite high-ranking himself(manager) and he can still back-stab me afterwards.......sigh......<br><br>thanks for any help, all! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>nikar.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Nikar,<br><br>Perhaps you should consider talking to your boss. The other options are to:<br>(1) continue to suffer in silence, or (2) quit.<br><br>Best if you can learn the art of ANGKAT (PLP).<br><br>Buy tea... compliment him... offer to da pao lunch etc...<br><br>These are all office politics survival techniques.<br><br>The most important thing in the office is RELATIONSHIPS.<br><br>It's WHO you know, not WHAT you know.<br><br>Doesn't matter if you're the most efficient worker because someone else who's well recognized by all the big bosses, will get promoted first.<br><br>So focus on relationship building with your superior...<br><br>who knows... this may be his ploy to get you closer to him... by overloading you with work until you have to beg for help.<br><br>So try to see through to his intentions. Then you can decide whether to (a) ANGKAT or (b) LEAVE or (c) SUFFER IN SILENCE.<br><br>Cheers.<br><br></div>

They can create nuisance, make up stories, and act without conscience to get rid of people, especially in the govt service!  It is sometimes not our good performance that will cause these sickening bosses to treat us well.  Many of them act on their impulses and are ruthless to kill whoever they don't like even though we can be contributing effectively to help them get promotions!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>(Darkness hacker)<br><blockquote>40pg in 10min to 30pg in 7h.<br>Got so drastic meh?</blockquote>yesh, got so drastic. that's why i decided it's getting to unbearable limits already, or else given my high tolerance, i won't think of quitting so easily.<br>the reason why 40 pages in 10 mins becomes 30 pages in 7 hours is because in the past, it's straightforward : skim through the documents and prepare the necessary documents. now, it's read and understand the entire document(not documents, more like technical books), do some kind of detailed report and so on.<br>the problem is : these kind of job is supposed to be done by the outsource company, not me. this is because the outsource company has the tools and people knowledge(they specialize in this area) and thus can do it a lot faster and better than me. my job is a general admin type, not those specialized-niche in technical stuff. i keep telling myself : since i'm now given the job of doing the work of the outsource company, i might as well go and work for the outsource company instead. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>actually, i think fireandhell got a point also. since the 1st day i joined the company, i've been very "on" and enthusiastic about the job. they give me tasks, i will immediately do it and hand it to them complete within 2 hours time or a lot faster. then, they start giving more and more tasks and i become more and more "siao-on". in some ways, i began to take on some little tasks here and there not related to my job scope, but i can still handle those.....but now, this huge mountain suddendly descend on me and i don't have the spirit to be so "on" anymore....like you battle more and more armies until u cannot take it anymore, and it's still increasing everyday.<br><br>anyway, today, the final straw came. i gave him a stack of documents and technical books to check and read and then sign. i spent the whole of yesterday(the 30 page in 7 hour thing, plus other documents) to prepare these documents, but the moment he saw it, he got so angry and used his ****ing pen to scribble and draw all over my documents which i prepared so painfully. of course, asked me to re-do everything, with that "bua-song" look on his face.<br><br>worse still, got other documents i let him check. i got the information needed to prepare these other documents from a newly hired executive(a bit blur blur one, but means no harm). and because the information this exec gave me was wrong, all the documents got wrong.<br>so, of course, the boss blew his top again. i tell you, i really want to break down and cry at that time, although i'm a grown man already.<br><br>then, later on, i saw the boss explain very nicely in a gentle tone to that newly-hired exec that he(the exec) got the information wrong.<br>the boss even jot down notes for that exec and pampered him like a little prince loh. this is the umpteen time that exec made these mistakes after so many reminders, and the scum still so warm towards him.<br><br>and me, who's just the clerk taking orders from execs, got blasted like anything. got very disheartened and sick because of that and made the decision to quit. i seriously feel that a hardworking, loyal and "on" clerk like me deserve a boss who treats me like a real human loh, and then i'll serve him and make sure he gets all the credits and promoted(i'm quite a strange person lah.....if i like the boss/superior, i will go to all means to help him no matter what it takes).<br><br>i'll be searching for a job tomorrow, and when everything is settled, i'll tell him straight in his face that i'm quitting. i don't want to wake up every morning and see a very unreasonable boss i dreaded.<br><br>a few questions, though.<br><br>1) if one is currently holding a job and plans to find another job on the sly, how does he go about doing it? i mean, if the hiring company wants to interview me, do i apply for leave in my current job? but if the interviews are on different times/different days apart, how?<br><br>this is the 1st time i'm doing this(wanna secure a job before quitting), so i need some advice and tips.<br><br>thanks all!<br>nikar.</div>
