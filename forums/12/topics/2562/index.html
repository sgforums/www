            <div class='col-md body'>What the hell, boy. Go for it!! You have to learn about the opposite sex sometime.  But, and I say BUT, find out first if she is married or has a boy-friend already.  If she has, forget it.  She's only stringing you along for her own private ego-trip.<br><br>Remember, at 33 a woman is either supporting herself, she is already married, or she has a sugar-daddy.  If it's either of the last two cases, it would be very dangerous to proceed.  But if she is supporting herself, then either she is lonely or she is flattered that her womanhood can still attract the attentions of a young male.  If that is the case, then give it a try little fella.  Or if you don't want to try sex first, well try getting more emotionally involved with her.  Anyway, see what she likes: sex or companionship.  If you are lucky she wants both.  In that case never mind the age difference.  If you are really in LOVE with her it won't make much difference that you are 33 and she is already 50...!</div>

Thanx for yer advice man... well currently i am having my exams. and im kinda finding it rather tough to go on. well we chated on the phone a couple of times and i guess that the chances of us being together are rather slim. she clams she is not married but im kinda having my doubts about it. When i was talking on the fone with her yesterday i heard some kids pyaing in the background. i asked her who are they and she took quite some time in answering me claiming it was her nieces. this is my biggest problem. i difinately would not want to get involve with a married woman. its not healthy man....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shauny,<br><br>Dun rush into it. Sometimes, it is just a infatuation or crush. 2 years ago, I had fallen in love with a guy who is 8 yrs older than I am. I like his maturity, his stability, his wisdom and of course his intelligence. He did not captivate me with all these when we met the very first time. We knew each other for some time before I found out where his charm is. However, he rejected me, telling me that he rather we be friends as he dun wish to lose a good friend like me. I believe he dun like little girls like me because he did mention to me that people at my age (teens/twenties) are still maturing and unstable, as in emotionally.<br><br>Shauny, it is not that I would want to break this to you. She is 33 yrs old. She is mature and she knows what she wants and the way to get it. She may be just having fun and enjoy the attention you gave her. Like what others mentioned, she may be married or attached so what is the point? At her age, even she is not attached or married, she would want to seek stability in a relationship with a guy who can provide her that. Can you provide her that? She is not young, like a teenager who can afford the time and youth.<br><br>Shauny, just move on.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> She may be just a passing stop in your life.</div>
