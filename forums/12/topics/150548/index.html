            <div class='col-md body'>well, i guess you can roughly estimate by checking how many weeks old your baby is and start counting backwards? heh that's the only solution i can think of now... instead of goin 4 all the expensive DNA tests..<br><br>its up to u whether u want to abort the baby or nt.. but in my opinion, its just so wrong and sad to take away a new life in such a cruel manner.. hwever if we look at things at a realistic angle, as a 17 yr old individual, ur education, and family relationships might risk being ruined after the birth of ur child..<br><br>well... maybe u can try sending him/her for adoption? and plz dont ever make this serious mistake again.. ya?<br><br>anyway, why sleep with so many men until you lost count and dunno who is the child's husband? not afraid you tio aids meh? hiak.<br><br>lastly, i encourage you to be more responsible in the future. practice safe sex lor.</div>
