              <p>The story goes like this:</p>
              <p>my good friend has just broken up with her boyfriend</p>
              <p>she was very sad and became vengeful</p>
              <p>she will shoot any girls who came close to her ex-bf</p>
              <p>all this while i did not know cos i was really too busy to take notice (hair long long never cut some more)</p>
              <p>then when i knew about it, i got mad, really angry</p>
              <p>i sent an email to scold them harshly why their matter kanna innocent party, more so when one of the victim is a good friend of theirs</p>
              <p>now, our friendship is strained</p>
              <p>after cooling down, i realized she just wants to share her problem with me and i scolded her for it (I AM SO STUPID!)</p>
              <p>of course, she did not come to me after that</p>
              <p>and i know an additional reason why i so mad: I fear whatever advise i give her will poison her, adding to her emotional distress</p>
              <p>and i had displayed it in her face</p>
              <p>she must feel real sad and disappointed her so called good friend like this</p>
              <p>but i really dun have the right medicine to her problem, what i have will only reinforce her emotional distress</p>
              <p>and i chose to run away like a coward let her die like that</p>
              <p>i feel so cowardly and pathetic</p>

              <p>Hi Mr Milo,</p>
              <p>It is kind of you to show care and concern for those who your friend has hurt, but just as you should apologise to your friend sincerely for losing your temper, she should be the one to apologise to these people whom she had hurt. </p>
              <p>Although you may blame yourself for not noticing that she is in need of someone to talk to earlier on, and thus it resulted in her unleashing her anger on others, the truth is that it is her own choice to do so.</p>
              <p>You can try asking her nicely to consider apologising to them, though you shouldn't force her to do it. However, if she chooses not to do anything at all, it will not be your fault at all, so you should not blame yourself for everything.</p>
              <p>Cheers. </p>
