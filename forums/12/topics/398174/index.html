              <p>Hi all, first some history.</p>
              <p>I was diagnosed with clinical depression and had several major bouts over the years. I also have social anxiety and suicidal thoughts in the past.</p>
              <p>Recently, I was given a chance to further my studies overseas. However, I am worried that the change in environment will aggravate my condition. Furthermore, I will be away from my friends and family who have provided me with support.</p>
              <p>In your opinion, should I take up the chance?</p>

              <p><br>agree... People who are close to you, especially you yourself, knows what you truly want/need. Don't just think but write down all the realistic pros and cons of going overseas and ask yourself if you can take up the challenge. We can only give you moral support in whatever you are doing. Good luck~</p>

              <p>Are you kidding? In most cases i think SG is the disease, the cause of your depression and social anxiety.

              <p>Sorry mancha I'll have to disagree with you on that =) Depression is a recognised illness. Sometimes we fall ill without any outside factors being involved.  Autoimmune diseases are what they are, your own immune system attacking your body, any outside factors involved? Debatable.  Just because something is self generated, doesnt mean nothing should be done to help them.</p>
              <p>People suffering from clinically depression often KNOW they are depressed. But just cannot feel happy, no matter how hard they try. So unless a kind soul pulls them out of the hole/crack they have fallen into.  Its very very hard to climb out on their own.</p>

              <p>You can't generalize like tt...there are many types of depression...some are caused by hormone (or smth) inbalance and some are caused by outside factors (such as bullying, loss of loved ones, etc)</p>

              <p>I have not come across a person who is depressed and happy. Or happy and depressed.</p>
              <p>Depressed and pretending to be happy, - yes.</p>
              <p>Why is a person depressed or happy?</p>
              <p>Chemicals in the brain?</p>
              <p>This chemical = depressed ; that chemical = happy.</p>
              <p>Brain activity is an electrical process, that produces a by-product. Over activity mucks up the brain, and causes fatigue, dullness, headaches, or other discomfort,  in most people. In some people it causes depression, or other psychiatric problems.</p>
              <p>It is the working of the brain, the thinking.</p>
              <p>Thoughts that goes round and round will over work the brain. Happy thoughts  are usually brief, but produces chemicals that causes elation.</p>
              <p>Usually the external factors that cause the mind to ruminate are often work related issues, (for the common man), and hypocrisy, (for the rich and successful).</p>
              <p>Drugs can clear the weary mind. But not cure the depression. Which can reoccur as easily as thinking again.</p>
              <p>My two cents worth.</p>

              <p>Ravagers,</p>
              <p>Overseas education is not for the poor nor weak minded.</p>
              <p>You will be away from your support system. Your family, friends, your psychiatrist/psychologist.</p>
              <p>If you are not the kind that can adapt easily and roll with the flow.. you will be like one of many whom had tried and failed.</p>
              <p>You will experience culture shock and many issues that requires a calm and patient mind; else you'd be losing yours.</p>
              <p>If you are unable to function outside your comfort zone, my advise is to stay where you are and work your way up from there.</p>

              <p>I have not come across a person who is depressed and happy. Or happy and depressed.</p>
              <p>Depressed and pretending to be happy, - yes.</p>
              <p>Why is a person depressed or happy?</p>
              <p>Chemicals in the brain?</p>
              <p>This chemical = depressed ; that chemical = happy.</p>
              <p>Brain activity is an electrical process, that produces a by-product. Over activity mucks up the brain, and causes fatigue, dullness, headaches, or other discomfort,  in most people. In some people it causes depression, or other psychiatric problems.</p>
              <p>It is the working of the brain, the thinking.</p>
              <p>Thoughts that goes round and round will over work the brain. Happy thoughts  are usually brief, but produces chemicals that causes elation.</p>
              <p>Usually the external factors that cause the mind to ruminate are often work related issues, (for the common man), and hypocrisy, (for the rich and successful).</p>
              <p>Drugs can clear the weary mind. But not cure the depression. Which can reoccur as easily as thinking again.</p>
              <p>My two cents worth.</p>

              <p>Hi all, first some history.</p>
              <p>I was diagnosed with clinical depression and had several major
              bouts over the years. I also have social anxiety and suicidal
              thoughts in the past.</p>
              <p>Recently, I was given a chance to further my studies overseas.
              However, I am worried that the change in environment will aggravate
              my condition. Furthermore, I will be away from my friends and
              family who have provided me with support.</p>
              <p>In your opinion, should I take up the chance?</p>

              <p>It is not a joke. Normal people will get very depress and upset when leaving the family behind when they go overseas. And people usually get very stress up when they are studying for exam.</p>
              <p>With student killing professor in NTU, student hanging themselves in the room for not finding a good job. Anything can happen.</p>
              <p>I am not sure about your conditions, if you can get over with your psycho prob you will do well eventually. People grow over time. Do not let history be a  burden for you. And nobody knows unless u this try out urself. Just be prepared to come back if you cannot take it. Dont kill any1 in the process. LOL. </p>

              <p>An alternative thinking to TS Question......</p>
              <p>i copies 2 views from the top..... I think both extreme views hold truth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>Are you kidding? In most cases i think SG is the disease, the cause of your depression and social anxiety. Going out and getting thrown into the deep end of the pool, learning independence, breaking away, though its a steep learning curve, will bring you more happiness and satisfaction than you ever thought possible</em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><em>Ravagers,</em></p>
              <p><em>Overseas education is not for the poor nor weak minded.</em></p>
              <p><em>You will be away from your support system. Your family, friends, your psychiatrist/psychologist.</em></p>
              <p><em>If you are not the kind that can adapt easily and roll with the flow.. you will be like one of many whom had tried and failed.</em></p>
              <p><em>You will experience culture shock and many issues that requires a calm and patient mind; else you'd be losing yours.</em></p>
              <p><em>If you are unable to function outside your comfort zone, my advise is to stay where you are and work your way up from there</em></p>
              <p><em>...................</em></p>
              <p>typically we tell people to stay with family support system. Talk to your doctors etc.</p>
              <p>BUT many times Singaporean family may see "TS" as a problems rather than a solution because of mental situation.....Singaporeans are still emotionally imature in handling mental shortcoming in the publics. There are no community Health Care system in Singapore. It is difficult to find motivation out of a perpectual cycle of  sterotype support system.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day...TS is still Young and still have alot to growth to be a more confident individual and Can still make worthy contribution to the Society and will be able to decide what is "good for him/herself" it is a hard decision but a decision worthy of consideration of changing lives and be a confident individual.</p>
              <p>A cross road in life indeed....... </p>
