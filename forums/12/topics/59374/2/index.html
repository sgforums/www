It's more of age diff. Age diff coupled with schedule diff.. hence the rift in relationship.<br><br>Give the girl another 5 more years, you'll find her more settled. Girls just wanna have fun in their early 20s. Trust me on this!<br><br>Solution: Guy should decide if he would wait for about 5 yrs.<br><br>If yes, let the girl go but keep in constant contact. But guy would risk her loving and marrying someone else. So while waiting for her, keep his eyes open for other girls.

Even if he waits for another 5 years, there'll still be no guarantee... There're girls who still PARTY at the age of 30 plus or so.... Girls who turned 'tame' and went WILD again.... Besides... After 5 years ALOT of things can HAPPEN... Doesn't necessarily mean that she'll have to go back to her...<br><br>This is sort of a one-sided love for now...
