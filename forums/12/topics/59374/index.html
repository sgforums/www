I ended up lending my ears for 2.5 hoursÂ… IÂ’m so sleepy today. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Anyway, hereÂ’s his story:<br>HeÂ’s 30 and SheÂ’s 22 this year.<br>Reason she gave for the break up, life style different.<br><br>They met at a karaoke joint few years back. He has not have any gf for 7 years until he met her.<br>She is wild in nature, cheonging most of the time while he is a homely person who has already planned for their future. When to buy house, when to ROM, when to hold wedding dinner etc all have been planned. Joint account has reached an amazing figure of 10+k. It all looks like they will be heading for the red carpet till last Saturday.<br><br>Anyway, things happened on last Wednesday, he Â‘caughtÂ’ her with another guy. She claims that the guy was not the 3rd party as they are long time friends and they have not started anythingÂ…. Yet. But she is happy when go cheonging with this particular guy. That night when he Â‘caughtÂ’ her, he saw the guy putting his arms around her when in a cab on her way home. She insisted that she has not done any Â‘dui bu qiÂ’ him things.<br><br>The reason she gave was that he was not able to company her to her weeknights cheong sessions. She felt so left out when she told her friends that she has got a lao gong yet most of them have not seen him BUT the nature of his job does not allow him to have late nights on weekdays.<br><br>He is willing to change but she refused to let him change because she have tried to change to a homely person for him and she find it painful, maybe due to her age and unsettle nature.<br><br>He is not willing to let this relationship go because he has made up his mind that SHE will be the one. He accepted her everything (including the abortions she had, her outings with other guys) and willing to spend the rest of his life with her. He wanted her to give him another chance to work out their difference but she is not willing to do so.<br><br>Actually I also donÂ’t know how to advise him. He wanted to chase her back no matter what as he canÂ’t let her go, as mentioned, she is the FINAL one. To me, once a gal change their heart its VERY difficult to make them change back.<br><br>Told him that be it the issue of 3rd part or not, their age difference is still a major concern unless they can come to a compromise to suit each otherÂ’s life styles. If a relationship is strong without any cracks, no 3rd party will be able to get in. I believe she is planning to let go of this relationship way before this guy appears. Its just that he happened to appeared at the Â‘rightÂ’ time.<br><br>Lastly I told him to go for his oversea assignment trip on Wednesday and (he told me that he have arranged to meet her on the eve of his birthday (the day heÂ’s coming back)) talk to her to see if she has started off with that guy when they meet up.<br><br>If yes, then let her go, stay in contact.

            <div class='col-md body'>the personality rift is way too extreme.<br><br>secondly, from the girl's character, she doesn't seem mature to be frank. and her history of past abortionS? outings/flings (?) with other guys? they only serve to lower my/our collective impressions of her. and furthermore with marriage looming, i myself won't be caught dead in some dingy bar or another person of the opposite sex.<br><br>and finally, since she finds becoming more responsible for oneself, and trying to be less wild/immature is painful... i doubt she's ready for marriage since its a life-long commitment before God. and its really not a easy thing.<br><br>well, tell your friend to consider it very carefully. and ask him reasons why does he loves the person so much. love is not solely based on chemsitry. some may just feel the need for a partner... and she fit the bil. some may feel that she changed their lives... some may feel etc etc<br><br>if ur friend insists, perhaps u should call for a heart to heart talk and find out what are her true goals/mission in life. respect each others decisions... even if they end up not being in sync. wel from there, im sure he knows what to do?<br><br>God bless.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I believe the girl has made an effort to accomodate him too.  And 3 yrs is a long time for some to try.  Putting ourselves in her shoe, I think it pains her too.<br><br>I think it shouldn't be the first time he confronted her regarding her cheonging and going out with guys.  She must be tired of all these already.<br><br>If someone chooses to leave, no point forcing her to.  When two persons come together, it's all about timing.<br><br>Let him do whatever he chooses.  At this point of time, he cannot rationalise his actions logically.  Once he is satisfied with his effort.  He'll come to his senses.

            <div class='col-md body'>Is the girl a mature person? Perhaps many would think not in many ways. But at least there's one thing about this girl.... She's still quite 'CLEAR' on her mind?<br><br>Like many had mentioned, character difference cannot be forced. Is this girl a selfish girl? I think she likes herself... And she probably love her too... Despite character differences, she tried to change and work things out for him... But she known it's unbearable and probably won't work out. She probably won't expect him to change too since she know how hard it would be to just force a preson to 'CHANGE TOTALLY'? She probably just love him the way he is now... That's why no point accepting someone who's not gonna be himself (the promised to changed him). She probably can get other 'bad guys' out there...<br><br>I think your friend shouldn't just blindly change for hre, but instead just be himself... May she accept who he is, and if not? Accept the FACT that she's not going for him...<br><br>No matter how much he wants her, he can't simply change someone just to suit himself ESPECIALLY when it comes to LOVE....</div>

(Not saying consciously he is doing it, rather subconsciously bah)<br><br>Met at Karaoke joint - I am not discriminating, however if he wish to settle down with a girlfriend as if marrying a wife - that would be one of the last few places you would ever want to seek for a wife. His wife is wild and I probably that she has her own ways with guys -your good friend - being susceptible finds himself falling for her (Art of Seduction - Siren) Risk factor - no gf for 7 years.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Noticed that your good friend is willing to change for her sake, but she doesn't want him to. Yet her reason for this break up is because she finds that he do not spend time with her together in her night life. Contradicting? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>The real reason</strong> involved is because if HE were to go, she would not be able to enjoy herself thoroughly and the guy (whom he perceive as a third party) will be awkward as well.<br><br>Chase back? The THING about chasing back someone is that IF your good friend is the cause of this problem - then maybe he would be to prove himself once again. However, in this case, she doesn't want the relationship anymore. How on earth are you going to chase someone who DOESN'T WANT THE RELATIONSHIP? Even if he succeed, is he delaying the inevitable? Cause in the future, similiar incident going to take place and 'poof', this relationship is gone again? So the hurting process repeats.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>People always say age is not a problem - yes, age is not a problem <strong>by itself</strong>. However, the vast difference in age <strong>is an issue</strong>. By itself, no problem, but by the issues it brings up, probably its rational to consider the factor. I doubt he did.<br><br>22 and he is 30 - his mentally is to settle down with a girl of his dream. At 22, she is just embarking on the journey of fun and adventure. Clashing and conflicting. And have you noticed, why did she start talking about life style clashing after 3 odd years?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If lifestyle were to clash, it will be felt within the first six months of the relationship and problems will have to be solved by then. Compromising take place right? Then why after three years then compromising ends?<br><br>P.S: Loving and suitability is two different issue. He may love her very much, but in fact, her heart may not be with him. Even if he were to attempt to chase her back, I doubt she will accept. She already made the choice - of the man she loved, but not suitable, and chose to leave. Is your good friend in denial of the facts lay out to him at the very start of the relationship? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Unfortunately, he's never been very good with girls and the previous girlfriend long time ago is also not as good looking as the current one. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>errr... if so, i can understand why she's attractive to him. well, give me a reply and i'll add my two cents worth? *take care*</div>

She claims that the guy was not the 3rd party as they are long time friends and they have not started anythingÂ…. Yet. But she is happy when go cheonging with this particular guy. That night when he Â‘caughtÂ’ her, he saw the guy putting his arms around her when in a cab on her way home. She insisted that she has not done any Â‘dui bu qiÂ’ him things.<br><br>The reason she gave was that he was not able to company her to her weeknights cheong sessions. She felt so left out when she told her friends that she has got a lao gong yet most of them have not seen him BUT the nature of his job does not allow him to have late nights on weekdays.<br><br>He is willing to change but she refused to let him change because she have tried to change to a homely person for him and she find it painful, maybe due to her age and unsettle nature.<br><br>He is not willing to let this relationship go because he has made up his mind that SHE will be the one. He accepted her everything (including the abortions she had, her outings with other guys) and willing to spend the rest of his life with her. He wanted her to give him another chance to work out their difference but she is not willing to do so.<br><br>Actually I also donÂ’t know how to advise him. He wanted to chase her back no matter what as he canÂ’t let her go, as mentioned, she is the FINAL one. To me, once a gal change their heart its VERY difficult to make them change back.<br><br>Told him that be it the issue of 3rd part or not, their age difference is still a major concern unless they can come to a compromise to suit each otherÂ’s life styles. If a relationship is strong without any cracks, no 3rd party will be able to get in. I believe she is planning to let go of this relationship way before this guy appears. Its just that he happened to appeared at the Â‘rightÂ’ time.<br><br>Lastly I told him to go for his oversea assignment trip on Wednesday and (he told me that he have arranged to meet her on the eve of his birthday (the day heÂ’s coming back)) talk to her to see if she has started off with that guy when they meet up.<br><br>If yes, then let her go, stay in contact. Who know, maybe when she wants to settle down, she will think of him.<br><br>If no, then if he wanted to win her back, by all means try.<br><br>I wish him luck.<br><br>What do you guys think? Does he stand a chance? Personally I donÂ’t think so.<br><br>This is a based on a TRUE storyÂ….<br>[/b]</blockquote>ok...she's not really dat ready for a steady and serious r/s...<br>and yes...u r rite...if their r/s is very steady, ntng can come in between dem lor..<br>i mean their diff is oready dere, leopards never change its spots...<br>well, the guy can still try his luck...provided the so called "3rd party" din win her heart...<br><br>/me search for yunhaier...<br><br>yun's a better person at this... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
