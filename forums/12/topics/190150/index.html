            <div class='col-md body'>Yes. Like Gwangetto says....keep the communication going. If you are a sincere and faithful person by nature, then it wont be any problem in your side. But do you trust men really?<br><br>Anyway, for my case, Im still young but I was away for a few months when i was attach with my ex. She told me online she will be staying home and not go clubbing or wad la. But in fact, my friends told me she went. And so i break up with her. Now the point here is that she lied. Of course I broke up with her over much more tedious issues. But my point here... being far doesnt mean both parties will remain sincere to each other.<br><br>So you got to accept the fact that... your guy would secretly have his own fun. Its better not to know. Trust me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Didnt have a very good experience in my past long distance r/s. You have to accept the fact that both parties are going to have temptations from time to time, and unless both of you are really faithful, it is really hard to withstand those temptations...<br><br>And the physical part of a r/s is very important as well...it is just not the same when you are not being in front of that person, when you are not able to hug, kiss and touch that person...Maybe both of you can stand it for a while, but if it is for a long period of time, it is going to be hard on both of you, esp when nearer temptations present itself to both you and him...<br><br>Not that I am trying to be a wet blanket, cos I am currently in a long distance r/s myself (though I am coming home soon) and I had been through one before...but it didnt end the way I wanted it to be. But I guess communication is very important, as well as trust and faith...not just on your side, but his side as well. This will be an important test to your r/s and if you can cross this hurdle, I think you will have a pretty strong r/s in your hand <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Gd luck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

It is high risk and represents an unstable model, unless you two are mentally and emotionally tuned to accept those challenges. And I mean real tuning.<br><br>Here's a sad truth: MOST LDR fails.<br><br>Not to overly douse you with cold water; the reason why LDR fail is largely because people are using conventional relationship methods to handle LDR (and yours begin from a conventional relationship). They perceive similar standards, needs, methods, wants, desire, etc of a conventional relationship and applied them into LDR.<br><br>Obviously when you are not feeling too good emotionally, your bf can't be there for you. Obviously when someone is chasing you, your bf cannot be there to deny his competitor with his presence and the list goes on. People engaging in LDR gradually give in to such vulnerability and in turn, reconsider their relationship, which is why most LDR fails. If you want to accept LDR, you got to truly give and expect nothing in return.<br><br>Somewhat like God? You pray to him, but God don't appear to you directly (maybe in your dreams perhaps). You lived on blind faith and believe in him until circumstances make you lose track of that vision.<br><br>If you want to accept LDR (especially those more than 1.5 years), you got to have a drastic change of mindset and also a change of lifestyle. All the lovely thingy that is granted to you this 5 1/2 years, will likely, NOT happen meanwhile. When I talk about those lovely thingy, it's all those insignificant thingy, which <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>you never knew it mattered, but when he's gone, you will gradually come to an understanding that it actually matters and make a difference in your relationship.</strong></span><br><br>All those insignificant thingy: e.g. like your bf used to wake you up for work through a telephone call, so as to ensure that you go to work on time. After he's gone, you find yourself being late for work because the phone never rings.<br><br>Your bf used to peel those oranges, so that you could eat them. After he's gone, you never touch those oranges because nobody peels them for you.<br><br>Know what I mean? People become vulnerable because they long for the 'previous' sort of lifestyle they are so familiar with and this creates instability. They are using the old ways of expectation and methods of doing things to a 'new' sort of relationship.<br><br>You will probably need:<br><br>I) Lots of blind faith.<br><br>II) Lots of drastic changes.<br><br>III) Lots of giving and zero receiving.<br><br>And lastly, probably no sex (if you have been leading a sexually active life).<br><br>P.S: Better to understand how challenging this route is and not delude ourselves, thinking that we-have-been-through-many-thingy-and-we-will-also-surmount-this-difficulty sort of mindset, so that you can better prepare yourself emotionally and psychologically and not succumb to circumstances while leading a LDR. It is difficult and even when you succeeded in maintaining LDR for four years, it is not exactly fulfilling as well. You will probably feel relieve, more than fulfilment in fact.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

As with any relationship(not necessarily a romantic one), trust and faith are integral components to sustain relationships and ultimately, strong and successful relationships often emerge with faith and trust forming the cornerstone upon which such relationships are built.<br><br>Look at it this way : if this relationship fails as a result of you guys staying apart, I suppose you - albeit a scant one - could take some consolation from the fact that perhaps, you two are just incompatible as a couple and he maybe isn't the one for you(to be frank, it might actually be better for you to discover certain undesirable/incompatible traits in your partner during courtship than to do so after marriage). It may sound harsh, but that's a realistic assessment of things IMO.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  However, if your relationship can survive 4 years of LDR, then I'd very much concur with rainee's assessment that what you will have at the end of it is a firm, secure and stable relationship that is well-equipped to stand the test of time and just about any challenge(well, maybe bar the world coming to an end  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) that you may be confronted with later on in life.<br><br>Good luck with your relationshp!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
