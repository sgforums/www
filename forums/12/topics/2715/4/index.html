It proves that you love him. My Ex also last time wanted me to patch back with her as I was angry wif her over some issues and did not wish to talk to her for a long period of time (nw I find it very childish for not talking to her)... Well, the point is guys should try to understand their the other half's feelings and pain she went through trying to patch back. Nw, I got a taste of my own medicine when I wanted to patch back wif her. My advise is take life easy and at the least you know when a guy wans to patch back wif you, imagine the times he went through is similar to urs. Good Luck to ur no 2, &amp; pls understand him.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello friends, I was studying in UK for the past 5 years. I met my jap galfriend there.<br>After being together for 8 months she left me<br>and return Japan to further her study. We<br>maintained contact by phone and email while I was still in England for the last 3 years of my study. Now I am back in Singapore.<br>Several times, she wanted to give up...thinking that it would be impossible for us to carry on. I kept encouraging her.<br>Her parents object our relationship. We both miss each other very much. She thought perhaps by breaking up we would not have to endure so much pain. But I never give up, so it is near the fifth year now since we met....she is going to start working in Japan and me working in Singapore.<br>Still I will not say the words "break-up" so easily because even there is a 1% chance we have to try it out !<br><br>------------------<br>Feel free to visit my homepg at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/ngwailek/" rel="nofollow">www.geocities.com/ngwailek/</a></div>

Boys and Girls EQUAL.... But we can't expect people to run our lives for us...? Everyone have got their OWN problem... I think the best idea about this place is for someone with somehow similar past experience can provide some 'insight' to the situation and a troubled life.... We can talk about it, we can complain about it, we can even cry over things... But in the end, the person would still have to be the VERY ONE to move forward and out of the SHIT..?<br>"Life is a momentum. Trouble is a constant giving. When pain is conceived you feel like a human. A victim. Life is a momentum. Energy is a constant giving. When provoked you give a reaction. Life is a momentum. A world with a constant giving.

U try ur best for the last time. But if she still refuse or show little signs of recovery.. I would forget the matter. Becoz it would be lying to urself that there is still a chance. It's just like telling urself that she is considering, when she's already wif another guy.. Maybe I'm a little cold on this but that's the best way out.. It will hurt but having to face the harsh reality, u get over it and get on wif life faster...<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

When u say it out or jot it down, u will realise that there are some tots that were hidden. To spell it out, somehow lay the facts and directions right before u.
