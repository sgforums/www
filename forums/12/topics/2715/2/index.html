            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by CyberNut:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi. I just broke up with my girlfriend of 7 months. I'm 17. This is my third relationship. This time I really put in everything I got. I can't get over it. I admit it too was my fault, but there's a lot of bad timing involved, that caused all these to happen. Long Story. Ain't gonna say. I really need someone, someone human to talk to. I nearly jumped down the MRT train track yesterday. Without thinking. I had to look away. I feel like a zombie. Nothing in life seems to matter anymore. No goals, no aim. She was what encouraged me to do things, she became my sole encouragement. Now I have lost her. Even as I dream, I dreamt about not having her. Could someone tell me what to do... I'm not exactly askign for answers. I'm just lost. Lost forever. Drowned. In Love.</div></blockquote>I hear you my friend. You are not the only one that has been through the bitter experience of having a relationship that one has thoroughly invested in to fall apart. I was driven nearly to suicide too, except that mine involved the Live Grenade throw in BMT. That particular relationship of mine was extremely intense and to be torn from it was a mortal pain. I sincerely believe that no one's general advice would be beneficial to you at this point. Your primary focus is upon the great loss that you have suffered and plain, empty instructions like "Go play soccer or something" would be irrelevant.<br><br>I can, however, offer you what I myself DID after my own run-in with ill fortune. I went out with all my best friends, organised a few parties and clubbed more than I usually did. I think I may have a few gigs up for January... perhaps you might be interested to come?<br><br>Oh... and some more practical advice. Try not to pester your ex for patches at this point as it would lessen your chances of actually getting back with her (learnt it the hard way) and you are most likely in the 'rebound' phase at the moment. Avoid all impressionable young women like plague- you just might get another (very) short term relationship that would be more than you bargained for. Some men in rebound become more attractive somehow... afterall, there's no aphrodisiac like lonliness. Take your mind off scoring and love, kickback and escape. I hope that has been helpful.<br><br>Happy New Year.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all the encouragement. She told me she wanted a reunion, but not now. She felt that she is not ready, and wants some time off, to lead a single life again. I'm sure many of us have heart this kind of talk before. It gives us a sense of hope, yet a fear, that it was not to be. A stae of confusion. I know this time is hard for her as well. She too, was really serious, before all these mayhem broke out. But her way was to avoid thinking about it altogether, to prevent the painful memories from comign back. But if she learns to forget, how are we to get back together again? She's hot and cold at intervals, and it hurts like hell. Time will heal all wounds, but scars shall always remain. I guess I could only pray for peace for now. I never would have chosen death if I could, I would let down alot of people. But sometimes, emotions just get the better of you. I'm still well and alive, and I thank all for your concern.

Still, she gave you spark of light, and I hope that it will ignite a fire again.<br><br>On the other hand, still it's n harm to know more pple now. Widen it, coz maybe next time u wun have the chance when u r paired up again.<br><br>But remember suicide is never an option. It shld never be one. coz whether is it successful or not it will bring more hurt than to yourself.
