Touching the cool seeds again gives u a feeling expressing you are special becoz someone has took the effort to pick so many for you... listening when you move ur hands across them, feels like 'wow there's so many'.<br><br>Well, it's always a feeling or awkwardness and embarrassment there, u can't escape from it. And it will spread to ur friends who are ard you too. Sometimes becoz of this, classmates might not ask the 2 of u to go out at the same time. It's a dilemma for them too. unless u plan the first one and ask him to come along, then things will be easier to sort out by ur friends.<br><br>Sometimes being a not so practical person will live better, coz u dare to dream. U will work towards ur dream and not be restricted by ur abilities. Dreams sometimes are extra encouragement that will do wonders to a person... Even when u it comes to love matters... At least when u dream, u can be happier... just like a baby or an innocent child... But dun live in it for too long...<br><br>Jazmyn... u will be leaving for UK tmr rite?? all the best for ur studies...

PES A?? Where about are you working at? Why? How come? Geeze.<br>Anyway... I'm really surprised to see so many people going through this kinda problem too. I'm kinda facing this love problem, and i can say the biggest one i've faced before. Its so so complicating that it cannot be expressed with just words alone, and its plain stupid of me to make such a mistake and letting her go. Just like to say a big thank you to all those here who gave advice and consolation to those who lost love. It makes one feel slightly better... Hmm, my life seems inverted after parting with my loved one.<br>Sorry to disagree with some, but i think being single for my case, without her, really sucks, and there is nothing i can do about it...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>think it's out of pure luck that I got into this position. Hee hee.... SOrryz can't help u.. hee hee..<br><br>Well, I suppose many of us let our hearts rule over our heads once in a while and in the end we are faced wif this kind of situation. But I dun think falling out of love is a trouble, becoz we have let our hearts free once in a while. If we have not loved seriously, we will not have the feeling of loved or being loved. I think without love many of us will have regretted in our lives instead. It's becoz of it, we have a period of happiness, we feel that liufe is special, we feel that living is a blessing. that's the way it should be.<br><br>No doubt we do have our troubled times, but hey... dun take it as a upset period. Take it as a lesson learnt to treat the opposite gender better. Take it as a appreciate the person and the time that u had and to reflect on urself. it will be a better and more positive outlook on the matter.

Forget everything he/she says with the word "forever"(or anything to that effect) stuck to it for he/she obviously lied but that doesn't mean that the next person in your next relationship would lie too. My gf broke up with me b'cos too many people lied to her and she couldn't believe that i am actually serious about the relationship.All i want to say to all of you is to remember the relationship not as a failure but as a learning tool so that you can do a LOT better in your next one, and show him/her on how much he/she is missing out on.

We are all human beings, be it watever race or religion we are all humans. We may not be as great as Late Princess Diana, or Mother Theresa, but suppose all of us here have been helped in someway or another. It's just fair that we learn from our lessons and share it others, to spread our experience if not to empathise with the person. It's a small world out there, moreover I believe many who visit this site are S'poreans, we shld on the more help each other out. To make ur life and my life a happier and peaceful one.<br><br>Okie.. sorry about the brag... but It's just how I feel that life shld be. But ironically real life situation in any office or working environment will be able to tell u, many times this is just a dream.<br><br>anyway regard ur qns. I'm sorry to say that chances is that the 'I LOVE U FOREVER's are just part of life usually, esp when it's said during the teenage yrs or adolescence stage. That's becoz u r still experiencing wat is love, and at that stage u dun know wat u want in life. but as u mature I suppose u r more focus on wat kind of partner that u r looking for. Hence those words will have more weightage. Furthermore u will be more responsible for ur words and actions.<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

I guess it still hurt as much as he said the other words the other time... but on the other hand can feel that u are beginning to have a more positive attitude towards it. though it may have been forced out becoz it's a way of forced acceptance and comfort. But hey... the thing is, it's a positive outlook... Keep it up...<br><br>I suppose there are some guys out there who dun really equate to the number of yr to the amount of love. I have to agree partially u on this. As adolescence, u have the tendency to fall into that category... becoz in r/s the longer it is, the more boring it will be. In this kind of situation, it like the feeling starts to deminish. the passion starts to depreciate. As youngsters, they tend to have the urge to look for interesting things, and they usually wun understand that fact that a r/s cannot sustain the flame that long. they are unable to see that it will be some sort like a marriage kind of thing, like most family with both parents. Fortunately, the thinking will be known to them as they grow up.<br><br>Take care Jazmyn....
