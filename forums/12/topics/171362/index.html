The first few times I heard his songs, I thought they were really crappy. All the solos sounded long-winded and draggy and donÂ’t really make sense to me.<br><br>I thought I had him figured out. His music is crap and not for me.<br><br>But the more I listen to them, the more I feel his intensity.<br><br>What was Coltrane thinking when he wrote the song?<br>What are his life experiences that inspired him and made him different?<br>Why is it that every time I thought I had him figured out he surprised me again?<br><br><strong>He makes me wonder. That is why I played the song again and again although I have so many other options.</strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Humor is a good attribute to have. But it works even better if you can throw her off guard sometimes.</span></strong><br><br>Your situation is the same. <strong>She thought she had you figured out. So you ceased to be a challenge to her.</strong><br><br>In her opinion, you are the laidback guy who jokes too much and doesnÂ’t seem serious about anything.<br><br>But when I read your posts sometimes, you appeared to be someone with many Â“facesÂ”. You can be a clown at times. You can be caring, you can be mature (but thatÂ’s once in a blue moon <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> )in what you say.<br><br>Next time when you go out with her in a group outing, talk more to the others when she is around.
