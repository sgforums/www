            <div class='col-md body'>hi lushpies, you must be in lots of misery and feeling very lonely.. i can't say that i can empathise with you.. it must be very hurting to be mistreated so many times..<br><br>it's a great thing that you were able to forgive him for the things he had done.. no many ppl can forgive.. and you can never forgive someone too many times.. what i'm trying to say is that u can still choose to forgive him for the things he had done to you and let go..<br><br>however, forgiving him and giving him a chance are two seperate issues <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> if you indeed choose to give the relationship another chance, don't go into it thinking that he will change.. like you mentioned, a leopard never changes its spots.. in the same way, a person's character doesn't change so easily.. accept for what he is, if you cannot.. then it's better to move on..<br><br>that said, i wish you well in finding happiness.. contentment is the path to it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

In all others, they loved love.<br><br>From the above quote and your own quote:  <strong>i can say that he is the only guy who treat me so well before.. as in really give way to me &amp; pamper me...</strong> He is taking advantage of your weakness and your inability to leave him. Firstly: He is your first love - HOW are you so sure nobody would ever treat you better than him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You fear to be single.

The issue is about a 3rd party? Girl - if three times is not enough to realise the real him, let me kindly explain in words to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The reason why he would come back to you after patching is because your bf cannot get her (or last with her due to external factors (character, some traits, no chemistry, etc). Think about this: if he would fall for a girl and created a problem because of that - that's how shallow you are in his heart.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>IF THIS GIRL IS DARN GOOD AND HE COULD <strong>GET</strong> HER AND <strong>LAST</strong> WITH HER - do you think you will still be with him?<br>Its all the matter of time - either you will be ditched eventually or he changed totally.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Give chances? Many forum mates asked for chances. My point is - <strong>how many chances </strong>does he needs to learn, to respect his own relationship and his gf - THREE NOT ENOUGH? - I feel its over the limit. Its not about giving chances - its about what he do with those chances. Blown it or thrown it?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Always give a first chance - anymore similiar situation, hack it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

(Avoiding the whole issue ain't you? You realise this point about him long ago - you don't wish to pursue, don't wish to trash things, continue this way even after 5 years, I bet you still couldn't believe it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) Oh well, I don't blame you because its your first love. I am very sure after this relationship (if it ever vanish for good) - the next relationship you going to have, I pray that you would be more experienced to undercover guys who ain't going to give you much bliss and happiness in the long run (if long term is what you seek).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Missy: its not about playing - its about love maturity. The differences in preception and love definition will eventually spark conflict in your relationship. Again - love maturity has little to do with your chronological age. (you can have adults acting like kids in love). He is not going to settle down with a gf and be contented with it - but you are. <strong>That's is the difference</strong>. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>What have you probably learn or realise?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You confusion stems from the fact that this is your first relationship -nobody is born knowing how to love. You now realise how fragil a relationship is when the other party isn't very forthcoming with his effort in making the love blossom.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You also discovered that breaking and patching will eventually cause stress and tension in your life. The relationship will probably dies off from it as well. The real way you should handle a problem is to solve the roots together - IF a mutual decision is made to break off the relationship - vow never to patch again. If patching lingers at the back of your head - THEN DON'T BREAK IN THE FIRST PLACE.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: No one can make us stay in a bad relationship, but overselves - 2nd Law of Love.<br><br>Cheers</div>

Your search for answers and suggestions in this forum is VERY SUBJECTIVE. Only little is known and revealed of your situation. You should NOT take the words as advised here too wholeheartedly but see things in concept to your situation by YOURSELF as you're the REAL person in your own shoes now. Regards. With that, I shall CONTINUE....<br><br>It's always EASIER to FAULTS in others than yourself. BUT you're not totally blind. And I believe that you're pretty much AWARE of what I'm talking about. I wonder who initiated the break offs? Was that you? And WHY the patch back again...? PROBABLY because you KNOW your 'Maths' pretty well...? Patch backs don't happen for no reasons..? 2 of the most common reasons would be... <strong>1. One is BLINDED by LOVE. 2. The WORTH is there.</strong> Sometimes it can also be a mixture of the two. But won't go into much details here as there're really TOO MANY possibilities to be looked into.<br><br>Do you THINK you're BLIND or he is? I think you probably know your facts pretty well...? The WAR of the HEART only begins as a TORMENT because of the UNKNOWN future. For every future is ALMOST ALWAYS an UNKNOWN and a GAMBLE. LOVE is no exception. In every relationship there're probably some reasons to FEAR... You're NOT the ONLY one.<br><br>To carry on with this relationship or not I'm in NO POSITION to judge. It all depends on what you WANT from this relationship? Are you willing to take the CHANCE (with the pain)? All I wanna tell you for now is DON'T be afraid to be hurt my dear... For in Life there're ALWAYS PAIN and CHANCES of EXPERIENCING it... That DOESN'T mean you should stop living altogether? Don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting you should just go ahead for whatever too... YOUR LIFE... You DECIDE okay?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  I can offer to give you AN ANALYSIS if you want to. It'll provide you with some INSIGHTS but NOT the ABSOLUTES... The ABSOLUTES are partly rested in your hands and partly with 'fate'?<br><br>And another WEIRD suggestion by me? Have you ever thought of printing out or writing down what you're typed out in what I've quoted and showing it to your bf....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">~good luck girl....</span></div>
