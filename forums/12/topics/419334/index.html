              <p><span style="line-height: 16px; font-size: 13px; color: #333333;">I been rejected time and time again. Its really hard when my feelings for a gal developed. Once I liked someone, I would give her most of my attention at my own expense. The rejection from my close girl friend has hit me very hard. I hope that will be the final blow. I think the only way to prevent myself from getting hurt again is to never love a girl again. Im still straight. Its just that I dont want wanna like somebody else again or I will have to go through the same pain and recovery process again. How can I be friends with girls but at same time never have any special feelings for them?</span></p>
              <p>I feel more relaxed and stress free when I dont have any special girl in my heart.</p>

              <p>Ts,</p>
              <p>If u feel hurt understand this lah - it is needs expectations masquerading as love that hurts. Till one acknowledges the folly of misunderstanding/misinterpreting the above as love, one is sooner or later going to come away feeling hurt and rejected.</p>
              <p>U ask how not to fall in love? If one can be self-fulfilled (on the INSIDE and yet being a porous ego) the chances of one falling in love is very remote. Also, people do not fall in love with another but rather fall in<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> love with an image that one carries in one's head</strong></span> and when that projection is found on another - one falls! So the reality is that one does not love the other but the reflections of what is within oneself.</p>
              <p>If one is friendly what is there for a friend? Friendliness is a fragrance of one being .... (what is one being when one is in a situation, or with a friend, family or ..., eg hostile, sociable, judgemental, loving  ....add on). Friendship is a thing, friendliness is a quality of what one is!</p>
              <p>All said and done the quality of being able to relate to oneself is essential. If one is able to understand, acknowledge and fufill that aspect within onself, relating to others would not be difficult. Even when it gets challenging one would still be able to handle situations/people or what-have-you. The quality of life is not in the living but the ability <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to relate to all</span> and sundry. Think of situations/cirumstances from shopping, work, business, friends, family - it is how one relates that matters.</p>
              <p>PS - Let me reiterate love never hurts, people who cannot love pretend and delude themselves and the hurt is always cos of expectations, needs , hoping for another to fulfil one's beggary.</p>

              <p>Be cynical. Remind yourself that the feeling is not mutual, that she doesn't feel the same way about you. Tell yourself that you're lusting after your friend and that is evil. Remember how much you prefer the individualism that comes with singlehood.</p>

              <p>in a nutshell, the trial and tribulations are like a property or insurance agent perhaps....selling and persuading....</p>

              <p><br>What to do, you are making your own love out of a gal, blame yourself hor.</p>
              <p>To gal, friend is friend, not lover ya. To a guy, is seem like they think of bed, sex, marriage and family liao, so desparate. Haiz, give you a tip, we gal love steady and easy going guy, not those kan chiong one ya. For gal, relationship needs time to built, not just thru one movie or one outing to sentosa ya. Dun be naive</p>
