That said, that 'rule' might not be too applicable in a pre-dominantly Asian context where guys are expected to take the initiative(more often than not) for everything(from initiating a date to paying for meals/movies) and by extension, would mean they should pay <strong>all the time</strong>.<br><br>That said, I can't see myself with a girl so passive that she <strong>expects</strong> to be paid for on every single date - for me, that says a lot about her character and quite honestly, it's not something I find appealing. Even if the guy could afford it and genuinely wants to pay for the lady, I find it only right that the lady <strong>at least offers</strong> to pay at times. As someone has already mentioned, when I say she should offer to pay, I do not mean it should go to the extent of splitting the exact cost depending on the order of each party - it'd be a nice enough gesture for the lady to offer to pay for movie tickets and snacks in reciprocation of the guy paying for their meal, for instance.<br><br>Of course, if finance is an issue(ie.a teenage couple whose income is still dependent on their parents), then I'd imagine it only sound that a couple went Dutch.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys doesn't need to pay for the girls at all. Some guys insisted on paying for the girl and some girls insisted that the guy pays for them. But the fact is, nobody need to pay for anyone's meals and expenses all the time unless they got an ultra-huge ego + wallet or still holding onto the social values in the 80s?<br><br>Nowadays girls earn more than guys in reality and alot of sg girls are financially independent and doesn't really need the guys to pay their way in a meal or movie or whatever activities. What they really need is actually the acceleration_in_the_maturity_of_sg_guys....not joking, but sg guys seriously need to be more confident (not act confident and also not acting smart pls), think positive, and be able to shrug off girl's nonsense (they need to be able to tell the difference between our usual nonsense and our serious nonsense).<br><br>It's true that some girls out there is willing to accept any guys with alot of money or a good future, that's their choice and they don't represent all sg girls even though their graph is higher. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Guys/Girls pays for each other cos they felt bad about not paying up. And it's their own personal choice to decide who they wanna be with in the future, so I sincerely that hope all the guys/gals whining will stop for at least 1 day please.<br></div>
