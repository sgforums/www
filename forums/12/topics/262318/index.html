She is unmoved and doesn't like u.<br><br>Trust me the logical thing to do is to "not keep someone who doesn't love u back" or "u can't force someone to love u"<br>but humans are driven by emotions.<br><br>Everything u do is based on an emotion of some kind.<br><br>U will be tempted to try out the more ' optimistic' approaches, like waiting for her, hanging ard her hoping to change her mind.<br><br>Read up on past AA posts, u will realise your situation aint as bad as u think.<br>Read what the forumers posted, but treat them as guidelines and make a decision based on your own accord.<br><br>Popular opinion does not equate best solution.<br>Because everybody's situation differs and what's best for others might not be best for u.<br><br>Now u are going to have to decide for yourself, cos sometime in the near future, u WILL encounter a similiar situation - what will u do then?<br>R u going to ask someone to decide for u again? Y not start learning to decide things by yourself?<br><br>Judging from your post, i surmise that u r still young.<br><br>don't be afraid of making mistakes but remember to LEARN from them -that is how u shape your character and beliefs.<br>If things are not turning out well, try changing your approach.<br><br>Insanity has being defined as ' doing the same things in the same way and expecting to get different results.'<br><br>Don't fall into the trap<br></div>

Sorry for everyone attention. I has like this particular girl for 6 months already. At the start, she and I were smsing each other sweet smses. One fine day, i confess to her, i told her i like her, i didnt expect she will say she like me too. We thought is too fast and we want to know each other more 1st. Ever since that day, things have become very awkward. I just want to know her better, but she just like me n not love me. She has no feeling for me yet.<br><br>Every now n then , i m feeling very emo because i duno whether stand a chance. She will always say she is not good enough for me..and ask me to find others. She is someone i really like for the 1st time. I tried to do things for her..but her nature is stubborn and cant be bothered. I can understand why sometimes she ignored me. She just dont want me to feel sad and wait for her. We are both very stubborn, and i know she dun wan to be committed as she prefer to be single. She is independent all the while and hope i can just carry on my life as normal. I cant. i just wan to tell her that i will be there for her. Even she turn ugly one day, i will still like her.<br><br>Now, i just hope she will like me once again or be back to the past.</div></blockquote>An unrequited one-sided love will only lead you into destruction. She clearly doesn't see you as enough attraction for her to break from her routine.<br><br>A passive love would <strong>not</strong> be enough motivation for her. Stop that "know each other more" thing. Either be more active, or stop it all together.<br><br>Sure, things like <span style="font-style: italic;">"Even she turn ugly one day, i will still like her"</span> sound great on paper.<br><br>They just don't work in practical. Take a more active role. Make your presence more known, but don't force it upon her.<br><br>Good luck.</div>

I didnt let her know that i am feeling that bad because she is feeling guilty. She has no reason to reject me since i m so good<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> haha..I will wait coz she is worth it. She is quite pretty btw and she thinks i like her because she is pretty. Guys feel attractive when they have pretty girlfriends. I am not that type of person. Sometimes i get jealous especially when her frdster is flooded by desperate guys. She is kind of anti social but she is quite a nice person and treat her friends quite well.</div>
