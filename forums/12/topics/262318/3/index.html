Sorry for everyone attention. I has like this particular girl for 6 months already. At the start, she and I were smsing each other sweet smses. One fine day, i confess to her, i told her i like her, i didnt expect she will say she like me too. We thought is too fast and we want to know each other more 1st. Ever since that day, things have become very awkward. I just want to know her better, but she just like me n not love me. She has no feeling for me yet.<br><br>Every now n then , i m feeling very emo because i duno whether stand a chance. She will always say she is not good enough for me..and ask me to find others. She is someone i really like for the 1st time. I tried to do things for her..but her nature is stubborn and cant be bothered. I can understand why sometimes she ignored me. She just dont want me to feel sad and wait for her. We are both very stubborn, and i know she dun wan to be committed as she prefer to be single. She is independent all the while and hope i can just carry on my life as normal. I cant. i just wan to tell her that i will be there for her. Even she turn ugly one day, i will still like her.<br><br>Now, i just hope she will like me once again or be back to the past.</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> To me, you are just like the other guys desperately trying to know her through friendster. The only difference is that you got passed the stranger barrier and is currently holding the title of a friendship with her.<br><br>But surely, the sequence is the same. Should anyone of those desperate souls got into the same position as you did, they will react the same way, doing the same thing. Same quality, though different person will also inevitable produce the same backwash.<br><br>Thus she is she's not particularly impressed.<br><br>The art of chasing is not about how much love you have for someone. Surely, I believe that other competitors will be claming the same love for her. Such claims are extremely passe - much more if she's gorgeous as she has probably heard it a milliion times. Cut that flowery language and your tendency to revel in an idealism - think about how you are going to differentiate yourself in order to maximize and marketing your USP (unique selling point).<br><br>Eventually, it's all about strategies.<br><br>P.S: I suggest you read Orange's post, as he has highlighted some rationale and proposed plans.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
