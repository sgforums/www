I think its more than just " I don't want to commit" maybe she herself have family issues she has to deal with too. After you have find out her reasons or even if she doesn't want to tell you, if you REALLY is sincere in this friendship, always assure her you'll be there for her no matter what. Also, I can understand that you feel very frustrated cause you like her so much but yet can't get her heart, I think you should stay neutral. Tell yourself she's just a friend and you will do your BEST as a friend -- be with her whenever she needs you. =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know how it feels man. You cannot force it. Even if you super like a person doesn't mean she must feel the same degree. She may only like you but not love you. Given some distractions of life, your feelings will take the back seat in her world. There is really no way 2 person will like each other every single moment. Just treasure the memory you had, continue to be normal friends, cool off, and let nature set its course. You will be agonized with unrequitted feelings but it is part of coming to terms with reality.</div>
