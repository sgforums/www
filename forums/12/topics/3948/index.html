            <div class='col-md body'>Relationships that is heavily depended on looks is not one that will last. It's personality, that a girl will feel good when she's wif u. Looks will gif a good first impression to a girl. But normally it will just stop there. The most is only exchange of fone no. and stuff. After knowing that u haf no character inside, the girl will still leave u. However if u haf a good character, and pple may not get notice u in the first instance, but time will tell them that u are the dependable sort of guy. Girls will look for security in a relationship, instead of the looks. Girls are not that dumb to go into looks. They will also think if u r the kind which they can fall back on when they are ur frens.<br><br>To get to know gers, maybe like wat Crysania mention, that is to be more sporting and join activites. Becoz u and I are similiar that is we aren't good looking. We can only show our hearts to pple.

Till now, I haf never approach a ger by just saying, 'Hi, I would like to know u.' so things like that. Not for myself, but only did once for a fren. There was this ger whowas seeling flags, and she smiles rather sweetly, and my fren was rather attracted by the smile. He pleaded me to approach her on his behalf, asking her to go to a place where there's not so much pple, and my fren was suppose to be waiting (just a few steps away only lahz - think wat?? I going to bring her to secluded places arhz??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ).<br><br>I agreed to it, walked up, pretend to donate, then ask her, 'My fren over there would like to know u. Would u like to know him? He's just over there....' My fren was not there!!! he played me out and went to hide!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>After that, I told him I'm not going to do anything like such for him already.. He still complain that he felt so malu.. Then I told him, 'U felt paiseh, then how I feel?? U went up, while u hide. I shld be more malu.' Well, it was pretty embarrassing, but it's an experience... hee hee..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yuppiez: I do agree with ur saying, that young gers prefer good looking guyz. but as they grwo older, it's something else that they see in their bf. Everyone matures. Think gers are smart coz they know that looks dun last. But for guys, many still prefer a good looking gf...hee hee.. think we are not that mature yet.. haa haa. no wonder they say that the mind of a guy is 3 yrs younger than that of a ger... hee hee...<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>
