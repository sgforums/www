            <div class='col-md body'>For braces, it depends on how old you are....<br><br>If you're &gt;20, then you might need to pull 2 upper and 2 lower teeth, IF your mouth is not big enough for your wisdom teeth. If your mouth is big enough to keep your wisdom teeth when they grow out then, you just need braces on both upper and lower for 2 years. Total cost= $5000 depends on where you go... $3000 for public.<br><br>If you're &lt;20, and your wisdom teeth are out and your teeth look fine and are striaght, then you would'nt need to pull any teeth out. If so, then you would need braces to first striaghten them.<br><br>Also, to pull your lower jar back behind, you will need to place rubber bands on the braces for 6mths to 1 year.</div>

Heex..<br><br>Regards,<br>Mark</div></blockquote>I've got the same problem as u, Rite now i'm seeing a orthodonthist to solve the problem. There are actually 2 ways to solve the problem:<br><br>1st) Put a brace to straighten the teeth and at the same time, the brace will push the lower teeth that are protruding back inwards so that it appears normal.<br><br>Pros: No surgery will be needed to fix the problem, just brace.<br><br>Cons: The jaw will still be protruding but it will not appear so becos the teeth is pushed back to its normal position.<br><br>2nd) Put on a brace to straighten the teeth first. But this bracing will not push the teeth back to its normal position. This is just to straighten the teeth. After 1.5 -2 years of bracing, the teeth will be straight, now the 2nd part of the procedure comes in, A surgery will be performed, during the surgery, the orthodontist will remove the jaw from ur mouth temporarily. The Orthodontist will then cut the jaw to a specific length. After this, the jaw will be sewn back into the mouth.(Might require some bolts to faster it) Then Viola!, A perfectly looking jaw and teeth!.<br><br>Pros: The jaw will look fantastic, u will have a great smile for the rest of ur life.<br><br>Cons: The Brace alone cost around $4500 for private hospitals. The jaw surgery will cost an additional $3500. There will also be a 7 weeks down time for ur mouth after the surgery, u cannot eat food except the liquid food given to u by the hospital, u might lose some weight.<br><br>I Hope this answer ur question, But i would reccomend that u visit ur dentist to get to know better, I'm not a dentist, just a patient, so it might not be too accurate. It's really up to u which solution u want to take, how long do u want to wait? Becos the 2nd way is a very long road, quite painful also after the surgery.<br><br>Anyway My 2nd appointment is next month, hope it goes smoothly, and also if u are in the army, the army will pay for the jaw surgery, which means dun have to pay a single cent! But for the brace, u have to pay for urself, army dun subsidise for u...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Suggesting jaw surgery? I've been through it about 6 years ago.<br>Private hospital and surgeon, costs about $30,000. It was done in Gleneagles and insurance doesn't cover it unless you can prove that it was necessary. All of the expenses must be out of pocket and immediate. It's also a painful procedure dude, takes like 6 mths to heal. For like 2 months i was walking around with swollen face and worse, rubberbands to hold my lower and upper jaw together so i couldn't eat at all.<br><br>Enough melodrama.... lingos is gonna exit now.</div>
