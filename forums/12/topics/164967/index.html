A possessive man will gradually find himself suffocating his own relationship. No matter how many different woman enters into his life, the conclusion remained - critical constant not evolved. Result will stay.<br><br>An average looking girl, who feels inferior about her appearance, will ALWAYS feel negative about herself. Even if a man, comment how good she appeals to him, psychologically she is unable to accept this complement gracefully. It triggers her unloving automatic thoughts and dismiss it as a sarcasm. If steps are not taken to correct that mindset, this poison will sap all aspects of her life and create hinder progression.<br><br>Your karma is a gallery of cosmic debt collected in your unconscious. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It kinda shaped your circumstance that you are put into</strong></span> - like the scenario above. Somehow, it seemed to me that you labelled that as your 'destiny' and how 'going against it' creates misery and suffering, but technically speaking, it isn't so. In fact, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>how you handle your own karma makes your destiny.</strong></span> Destiny cannot appear without you making a decision and handle them, just like the next chapter of a story will only appear if you read on.<br><br>It seemed to me that you are keen to decipher part of this so called 'destiny' and work towards a better ending, regardless of the outcome. You might find your answers in Astrology.<br><br>P.S: Don't see Destiny as complication. Solve your complication through Freewill and understand Destiny lies in your hands.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

I'm still alive.<br>How many people right now can tell you their "destiny"?<br>None.

I did have a few r/s after that but it never really seemed to work and soon I've come to a conclusion that it's my retribution for hurting the girl I love 9yrs ago and it's my destiny now that I have to suffer.<br><br>Then the miracle came. I met my current gf 3yrs back and we become soul mates. I even told her about my this "problem" that stuck with me for the past 9yrs. She had been very supportive of me and she's always around to hear me rant about the past and am very patient with all my craps.<br><br>5mths back, she came to Singapore to look for me. the following month I went to her hometown in Malaysia to visit her and stayed there for three weeks. And during my stay there, it seemed that the wound that I carry with me all these 9yrs are slowly healing which in fact it's been healed long ago but I never really notice it and kept it in my mind that I'm still wounded. During my last week there when me and her are on the way to Genting, I just suddenly told her that I felt very relieved. She asked me why but I don't know the reason why.<br><br>On the night I'm in the coach on my way back to Singapore, during the 9hrs journey alone in the coach, I came to realised the reason and I SMS her and told her that the 9yrs nightmare is gone. And when I reach Singapore, I knew I miss her alot. and for no reason why, the courage is suddenly just there to confess to her that I love her.<br><br>Me and my gf are together for almost 4mths now and I knew deep in my heart that I truely love her from the bottom of my heart despite the 9hrs distant between us.<br><br>So now tell me again...is this "Fate" or "Destiny" or what is it?<br>I've learn a lot over these period of time. You won't know what is going to happen tomorrow, so why put a full stop to your life by saying it's your "destiny" to experience all the stuffs?<br><br>Learn from experience and face tomorrow with pride. The real "destiny" awaits you and there's no saying what will be it in the end. It's not just about r/s but generally. You can change "Destiny" if you bother to make a step forward instead of just standing down there and do nothing and start complaining that it's your "Destiny" to experience what you experience at the moment.</div>

During the 9yrs, death has always been in my mind just the lack of courage and too many other reasons for me to stick around still but I think you'll understand the torture of being stuck in the middle whereby "you live and you suffer" or "you die and regret". It may be part of your destiny to experience what you have to experience but you always have a choice to choose between two fate. Many times when one experience bad situations, their brain natually bring them to the negative side of the two choices which later on lead them to another path in life. "Destiny" is like a maze game. You come to a split end and that moment if you make a wrong choice, you face the consquences of your own mistake. But if you go on without learning, you'll make the wrong choice again and again and you'll be going around in circle.<br><br>Making a right choice is damn important to a person's life but how often can we make the right choice? It's something to learn and to practice and remember as we go on.<br><br>I wouldn't say that I'm enlighted now. Peaching is always easier than done. I know which direction I'm supposed to head on to but I'm still a human being living on temptation island. I still need constant reminders not to make mistakes or at least grave mistakes (I'm human..not god..and I still make mistakes now).<br><br>The path towards "Destiny" is call "Fate".<br><br>Remember this "You can't change Destiny but you can change your Fate".<br><br>Easy path or hard one...you decide.</div>

Both of us has been trying too hard that we forgot how to let go. I don't know how true this is but now I do believe that God is still fair. You fail in an exam, you pay the price for it by having to go through it again for a year and another exam come. If during that repeat year, you learn well, you pass yoru exam this time round and you'll be well rewarded. (Laymans term. Hope you understand what I'm trying to say. I'm not very good in English.) At least for me, I saw it happen.<br><br><strong><blockquote>Jus review in brief - 'I had near death situation a few times in the past, i learnt that if u are prepare to live, u must prepare to die... 'it' had given me tonnes of good reasons to live, at the same time good reasons to die."...begining to sound like pyscho   </blockquote></strong><br><br>Haha...so does that make me a pyscho too? In my previous post, I mention that I don't have the courage to die. Actually not quite true. It's not about courage. There's more reasons for me to live on than to die although death will put a stop to the pain I felt. It's a battle between my brain and my heart. Honestly, the war is still on and I can't be sure that one day I'll succumb to Death.<br><br>I like the way you phase it "If you are prepared to live, you must be prepared to die" but what not say it this way "If you are prepared to die, then you must be prepared to live"?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><strong><blockquote>Like most of the posts, in the past, i dun really take 'destiny' seriously &amp; it doesn't bother me at all.

'retribution'.</blockquote></strong><br><br>You know...Buddah got this saying that if one can still see his own wrong doings, he still can be saved. It's never too late to turn back if you are willing to. But remember, like I say in the previous post, "Destiny" is the destination all humans are heading and the path is our "Fate". Should we make a wrong choice and took the wrong path, it's never too late to turn back but on the way back is where we'll suffer the consequences of our own mistakes. Short to say, if you have already walk 12km of the wrong path, you have to walk back 12km to where you are in the beginning of the split road and take the other path. Worth it or not, you'll decide. But the earlier you turn back, the lesser sufferings you'll go through.<br><br>(P.S. Sorry to bring in religion. I'm a free thinker but I learn the good teachings of all religions to help myself to be a better person. No offence intended.)</div>
