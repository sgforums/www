              <p>not trying to pour cold water....but piggy....go slow.  maybe i am jumping the gun a bit but here we have 2 lonely people, new to the country, city, school, blah blah....  so, u both kinda can relate and connect easily, i guess.</p>
              <p>it's alright to ask her out again but move slow lah hor.  don't really need an excuse mah.  just ask "hey, u wanna go out?"  that's it.  but it's kinda bold to invite you over to her house.  maybe i am old school but i'm just writing wearing a mother's hat so just taking in some caution.</p>
              <p>anyways, have a circle of friends.  oooohhhhh.....stop it.  erm, that earlier statement for myself.  kekekeke......just my vibes speaking.</p>
              <p>anyways, enjoy your student life in indiana.  good luck and all the best! :)</p>

              <p><br>Why do I feel she's more interested in being friends with you than any other things?</p>
              <p>Anyway hor....we're more vulnerable emotionally when we're overseas, especially alone and overseas. So please don't be super confident when you know us, cos we might not be able to resist not to rest our emotions on you if you do something super sweet and kind to us.</p>
              <p>Best to be normal and be yourself so that she won't be attracted to you, just in case you think you're not good enough to give her happiness. So better not to attack her emotions with your romantic stunts if you are not confident of protecting the happiness both of you are experiencing right now. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>no prob.  u r always welcome.  trust me, i know how you feel.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and as i have written earlier, in the SO forum, my friend's son was there for a year and he definitely didn't like it.  like what u wrote, he felt that the sg club ain't friendly and he was really lonely.  he even needed some counselling.  it changed all his perception of being in the US altogether.  i tink it was a small-town syndrome.  i don't know.  anyways, he left immediately after his first year and is now happier down under.  big city, a sense of familiarity and also close to home.</p>
              <p>take your time.  right now, the friendship is pretty new and your passion is building, maybe.  it adds up that you are lonely and alone too.  human needs to feel belong eh.  just enjoy the friendship and then take it one step at a time.  God bless! :)</p>

              <p>Yes, I have to say parn brought up a good point this time.</p>
              <p>Do you consider staying with her for long term?</p>
              <p>I broke up with my first ex due to this: he knew he is going to stay in US while I know I am coming back here. When he told me he didn't have in mind a long-term relationship when he was pursuing me, but just for a moment's thing, I was really hurt. Until now, we have not talked for even once after we broke up.</p>
              <p>I wouldn't want you to do that to the poor, unassuming girl.</p>

              <p>Singaporeans don't invite people to their houses readily, they only invite established friends.</p>
              <p>People of other lands, quite often, routinely invite people they have struck up an acquaintence with, to their homes.</p>
              <p>Don't read too much into it.</p>

              <p>I am studying in indiana, america. There is a gal from china live next door and she is dam dam pretty. Pure beauty i mean. The best part is that she is also a freshman and she got almost no friends here and she cant speak english fluently. i always saw her walking alone...</p>
              <p>i said hi to her at the bus stop one day and we had a nice chat. i called her out last saturday for a concert and after that we went to wal-mart. we were talking to one another for the whole night and we really have the common topics... We were chatting like we were old friends. she even said that i can come to her house next time, she said this twice at different instance.</p>
              <p>and here comes the question...should i call her out again? for wat reason or events? i am afarid that i will disturb her or she will get annoyed....or she dun really like me after all?   LOLX...never had a gf before...no experience...</p>

              <p>Well, you can call her out if there is another event. Just as friends. As time passes, it will be a little clearer as to what you should do.</p>

              <p>does the TS sound like he may fall in love with the gal?</p>
              <p>maybe she just needs a friend to talk to. reasons for asking her out need not be always for events like movies or concerts, too cliche.</p>
              <p>Show some concern like asking her if she needs any grocery if you happen to do your own shopping, or likewise ask her to go grocery-shopping with you? </p>
