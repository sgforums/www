And no, i do not think so.  He is tall and muscular, not Andy Lau, but not ugly like what you have pictured him to be (hey, dunno if you are fat, short and ugly, but not every guy is like that).<br><br>If you will not read selectively, you will <strong>see</strong> that my question is directing at his joke, not him.  I like him, but not this joke of his, get it?  Condemn the sin, not the sinner, get it? (not sure if you have even heard this saying before).<br><br>Yes, my 'problem' is not a big deal as compared to other problems in this forum.  So?  Does that mean i cannot post here?  Is there a term or condition on this forum to say only wat kind of problem can be posted here?  Or how serious a problem should be before it can be posted here?  How to measure seriousness?  KG? G?  Miles or watever?  Wake up the idea kiddo.  Who are you to say that one problem is petty and another problem is big deal?  Are you the judge or are you GOD?  And if you think it is a petty problem, why do you even spend so much time posting here?  Don't post here!  Get out then if you please then.  I will not ask you to post here.  In fact, i will be more than happy not to have your lame, destructive and valueless posts here.  What should i say?  Get lost?<br><br>The idea of the thread is whether if i should tell him i dun like this kind of joke (if the joke is really lame and morbid) or should i juz accept such jokes (if im the sensitive one).  Get it?  If you still dun get it, like what a lot of others have, there is no way i can reach out to you.  Hence, this shall be my last reply to you.<br><br>All the best and improve your english or/and your listening skills.<br><br>And yes, i still think you think too much.<br><br>p/s:  and we are not having sex BECAUSE i think the maturity of our relationship has not reached that stage.  Yes, he has wanted it but he has come to a compromise that he should respect my wish.<br><br>Not every male species only think with their dickhead like you do.</div>

She believes that women are angelic creatures who would make the world a utopia if only the male "patriarchy" would allow them toÂ¡Â­Â¡Â­.<br><br>I have met women like this, trust me, it is only talk with air in it. As far as I know, the few of them (who coincidentally married to rich people) ended up divorced, with kids and struglling to make a living. You forgot to mentionÂ¡Â­they always say : "MEN cannot be trusted."<br><br>2- Miss Take<br><br>She's out for your money -- pure and simple. Miss Take is the ultimate in high maintenance. She expects a man to finance her entire life Â¡Â­..<br><br>This sounds like the typical China whores most Singapore carrots are finincingÂ¡Â­.watch your CPF, men!!!!<br><br>3- Miss Romance<br><br>This type of woman lives in a fantasy world of Lifetime Channel movies and romance novels. Every night she goes home alone Â¡Â­..<br><br>Mostly refer to immature Singapore womenÂ¡Â­that is why Korean "romantic" serials are so popular here. They failed to see that the Koreans are famous of being MCP and beats up their wives as hobbiesÂ¡Â­.<br><br>4- Miss Elusive<br><br>This woman is closely allied to Miss Romance, but with a dark side. She is usually one of the "walking wounded" -- someone who has been hurt in past relationships and so subconsciously avoids or sabotages new relationships in the presentÂ¡Â­.<br><br>This type always moan "I have been hurt beforeÂ¡Â­.." , hey you deserve to be hurt again until you mature upÂ¡Â­..<br><br>5- Miss Angry<br><br>Like Miss Feminists, Miss Angrys really don't like men. They scorn the male gender and can rattle off all the wrongs and misdeeds of every man they've ever encountered.<br><br>Are we talking about BUTCH here?<br><br>6- Miss Insecure<br><br>This woman seems great at the start because she's very nice, accommodating and treats men well. But her inner insecurities don't take long to surfaceÂ¡Â­.<br><br>This is the type which most likely will end up having depression or throwing their/someoneÂ¡Â¯s baby down the blockÂ¡Â­.<br><br>7- Miss Bitch<br><br>Miss Bitches are the sulkers, pouters and ball-busters of the female world. They are very unpleasant people who treat their fellow humans poorly, care only about themselves, and aren't concerned at all if they hurt you or anybody else.<br><br>We have lots of these in Singapore, they only turn to angels when they see Ang Mo, that is why 1/3 of Singapore men married foreign brides last year<br><br>8- Miss Me<br><br>A close relative of Miss Bitch, Miss Me is entirely focused on herself. Miss Me needs to be the constant center of attention no matter what she does or where she goes. She is a selfish, self-indulgentÂ¡Â­..<br><br>If they climb up to be your boss or even worst, your wife, you are fucked for life, man!!!<br><br></div>
