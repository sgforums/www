Have been wondering what makes gaming so addictive. Till i read an article somewhere that people turn to gaming to experience the kind of events that they know they could not possible go thru in real life. The success in the games kind of fill up the emptiness of that person and make that person fill better. Sounds good huh.<br>But addiction to gaming surely have crossed the line. Wonder if there is a panacea for this. More gaming perhaps.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>Hmm............interesting!!!  Thanks for the insight eh.

Let's say u spend 5hours a day gaming. Every day, u cut off ur gaming activity 10mins earlier. So, if let's say I game 5-10pm everyday, starting today, i game from 5-9.50, then tomorrow, 5-9.40pm and so on.<br><br>Also, u can try going out more often during ur gaming time. Go out with friends, catch a movie or something. Then when u reach home, don't immediately go straight to ur PC and turn it on. Go read the newspaper, take a bath, and go to bed after tat. Slowly, u will find urself going to ur PC less.</div>

Every day, u cut off ur gaming activity 10mins earlier. So, if let's say I game 5-10pm everyday, starting today, i game from 5-9.50, then tomorrow, 5-9.40pm and so on.<br><br>Also, u can try going out more often during ur gaming time. Go out with friends, catch a movie or something. Then when u reach home, don't immediately go straight to ur PC and turn it on. Go read the newspaper, take a bath, and go to bed after tat. Slowly, u will find urself going to ur PC less.</div></blockquote>that sounds like a plan....slowly weening off instead of an abrupt stop eh?<br><br>thanks, nanren4ever <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
