            <div class='col-md body'>Now dat u've revealed its actually over a mistake dat u've made.. seems like he's confused becoz he wants to forgive (mayb he already did) but as human beings.. we will never forget. He's not sure if he can really achieve dat as much as he would want to. Waiting for him to talk abt it when he's ready will take too long.. u muz show him dat u want to salvage the relationship. Make him face it. He wans to 'escape' from having to face the issue for as long as possible &amp; dat will hang both of u neither here nor there. Get over the gloomy days.. u've apologised so try to make amends in watever way u feel like &amp; return to ur usual self.. the 1 dat made him fell for. If he can't get let go... its best dat u remain frens.. move on back to life rather den having 2 person feeling miserable everyday. Wish u luck! =)<br><br>*paiseh.. abit lorsor.. =X<br><img></div>
