For whatever reason it is, she knows it best. Would advise her to get over and move on with her past sad/confusing/frustrating feelings first before she commits in another relationship to be fair to her future bf.<br><br>Yes it is normal for her to feel this way. She should let go of her feelings and learn to forgive and forget. If she is unable to forgive, forget might be the easiest way out but not the permanent solution. If she is unable to forget, then she should learn to forgive as this is the permanent solution. Depends on which is easier/faster for her to assist her in moving on with her life and feelings.<br><br>Good luck to her anyway. She is going to need it cos she is still quite young. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Experience has shown that girls prefer to have a guarded heart against man which in turn would sabotage their relationship. Then again a guarded heart would mean semi-truth feelings which will make the guy feel hurt if he ever found out, not unless he don't care of cos. But if she wants to go out and have a relationship this frequent this fast, it's best she does it with a guarded heart. Sure the guy might be true to her, but in her own interest I believe once she finds out she can revert to loving wholeheartedly again. Well that's just how I feel, because of experience <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Take care</div>

Sounds like u r describing my lovelife... Such past memories can never be forgotten. She has to learn to accept her past, not forget. Learn from her past, and never to repeat mistakes. One day, she will meet a guy who will help her forget about the pain she went thru. Someone who is able to make her love, trust and be happy again. She needs to let go of the fear of getting hurt. All the best to her in life... Relationships ain't everything.

To forget the past, easier said than done..<br><br>It's like i am almost subconsciously self-sabotaging my present relationship due to the hurt &amp; negative feelings from the previous. In fact my last relationship ended largely cause of that.<br><br>And that's why i am stayin single for now... Or as long as i still haven't overcome my personnal struggle.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The past hurts, but eventually, u are the one who chooses to hold on to it, or to drop it. I learnt to drop it after a week or so, as I don't want to let my life come to a standstill. I'm happy to know that she managed to attain what she was aiming for. Too bad I can't be with her to share that happiness.<br><br>Keeping emotions under control is something we all need to learn, and the path might not be easy. But hey, life's never easy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>is it normal for her to be like this? </strong><br>it's normal. If she behave otherwise, then it's abnormal.<br><br><strong>would it be over soon? </strong><br>It depends. Girl gotta SLOWLY overcome the fear and give herself and the guy she loves a chance to try and let go of the past. Mustn't hide anything. Guy has to be there and always be very patient, caring and *understanding(*this is the most important). At times guy can play the role of a friend as well. That's where real test comes.<br>Love can kill but heal wonderfully and give something what we call - hope.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
