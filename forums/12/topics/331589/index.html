              <p>I had my Chemistry paper today. It was god damn weighty and even though I studied real hard for it, gearing myself up the week before, the paper was a "disaster". It wasn't really bad but it has to be my worst performance for this year. I'm afraid it wil fall between a B and C range. There was a time shortage during the paper. I couldn't finish up the paper and screw up Section C(which consists of a lot of marks). My friends said that it is because of my persistence to come up with solutions for the earlier sections that a time constraint has occurred. Although many did not finish the paper, I though I had it worse: I ended up skipping a lot of questions towards the end of the whole paper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sometimes I really wonder if it was worth the effort to study this hard and fare this badly. And what's more, this is only my first paper and this is a hit to the morale indeed. There is this thing in me that makes me want to complete all the questions before going forward to the next one during exams. One of my friends commented that if I do not eradicate this bad habit of mine, this persistence and stubborness, I would not score well for the paper because of the need to fight against time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don;t know why, but every time I skip a question which I'm doubtul of, I would have this feeling of guilt inside me and that makes me determine to solve that question. It really bugs me a lot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can someone advise? Thanks all!!!</p>

              <p>just accept your shortcomings and move on.</p>
              <p>always try to attempt those qsn which offers the most marks, if your problem is with time management.</p>
              <p>do those qsn which you excel in first. that will boost your morale.</p>
              <p>there's nothing wrong with skipping a couple of "undoable" qsn, but it will be wrong for you to not do easy qsns because you allocated a tad too much time on the former type of qsn.</p>

              <p>If you cannot handle A level Chemistry then forget about University. In JC, you are spoon-fed, in uni u are expected to learn fast and by yourself.</p>
              <p>When encounter a problem, develop strategy to counter it and not saying things like it is too weighty too difficult. You can only say you are not good enough for the paper and so u need to work harder.</p>
