Dont be too conscious abt saying things that u feel u might be offending her unless its too obvious that it will. Observe what her reactions are to what u have said and judge from there what can be said and what not.  Try to know her as a friend. Put in ur best without the intention of her to definitely becoming ur gal.</div>

However, we started chatting intensively recently this year. Mostly through MSN and SMS. Sometimes in MSN, we chatted late at night (maybe like 2-3). Seriously I dunno if she is interested in me, I've read in other thread that chatting in MSn or SMS cant really see through a person's feeling. From the way she reply, it might even mean that she is just being polite. Yea i agree. So i know you guys want me to ask her out and see how the way she acted rite?<br><br>Now that's another problem... I can chat very well in either MSN and SMS because there's time for me to think what to reply but if i meet her, i would stammer and dunno wat to say. I've meet her outside before (but just for a short period of time.) as she need to borrow something from me. So when i pass her the things, i didnt really do anything and didnt really look at her.. needless to say chatting, I just pass her the things and she didnt really speak too, just smile. It's really pai seh when both of us standing there not talking at the bus stop. So, she break the slience by saying she got to go... and i bid her goodbye too - -" Damn~ I know i should not let her go just like tt and try to talk to her... but i cant~!! When i saw her, i was totally speechless and there's nothing i can do.. (you know.. 'nervous!')<br><br>Honestly, Im not a good speaker that are able to talk well and entertaining. Although i was able to talk and joke ard wif my fren only. When it come to the person i like, i will get nervous. But in Msn and sms is different thing... (although im  braver in msn and sms, im still not brave enough to tell her that i like her.) lastly, we dont really contact through phone as we are used to msn and sms already.<br><br>Since both of us had not been a relatioship before, we dun really have experience for it.<br><br>I know im such a failure but still... tell me what should i do? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You are so much like some friends I have; People who communicated very well in virtual world, but sux when it comes to reality meet-up.

Crap. You must learn NOT to give yourself excuse to learn and survive out of virtual world. Everyone began their first relationship on a FIRST basis, what makes everyone else different? What matters is whether you are willing to make your first step and learn.<br><br>II) Contrary to popular belief, you DON'T exactly have to be VERY good with your words to be able to communicate. (its a good asset, but it's not absolute) Humor, good conversation skills, etc will only come after you are at ease with yourself and your audience, plus your comfortability. Communication about having to SPEAK and LISTEN. Since your problem lies in speaking, you have to keep practicing. And the only way is to keep talking.

Do you know what she likes to eat?<br><br>2) You are just friends for starters thats all.  Please start slow there is not such thing as fast method to win a girl over. The fast methods will only kill your chance.<br><br>3)   Why are you so afarid of talking to her when you meet her ? I can tell you why is because you want her to be your gf asap and you forgot the basic  needs for a girl is to let her understand you first.<br><br>Methods to help you.<br><br>1) Please change your mindset first. She is not your gf. She is only a girl you have meet. You are interested in her but that does not mean she must be interested in you. Stop thinking if she will like you or not.<br><br>2) Please see her as a friend first, Go out in groups to slowly breakup the ice between you two.<br><br>3) Take some time to know her first before thinking of relationship. You are moving too fast and just hoping she will love you. Are you sure you will like her once you know more about her?<br><br>Final thought<br><br>Just cool it. She is just your friend not your gf. I understand that you like her but I must ask you to take a step back to start thinking carefully first.

Everyone is different due to the beliefs and experience we hold, and thus will interpret things differently. Will showing your anxiety kill you? You may think that looking elsewhere instead of into her eyes will relieve you from your anxeity, but what if she really dislike pple talking to her and not looking at her? Do you think she will jus voice it out so that you will look at her when talking?<br><br>She may think that you are not interested in conversation as you didnt maintain eye contact when talking and there isnt much conversation going on also.</div>

Just like when u go for rock climbing, u hav to make sure that the rope are securely attached right? And for doctor, you hav to comfirm that ur medicine mixing is rite in order to cure somebody rite? Needless to say operation and stuff, 1 mistake might kill somebody.<br><br>Im sorry actually that im not trying to say that my pts are right, I know u are trying to help and i really appreciate it. But i just cant ignore the fact that wat will going to happen when there's no 100% comfirm which will eventually lead to failure after tt. If everyone can see the pts of not taking any risk, there will not be a result of ppl wanting to commit sucide after a heavy loss in gamble and stuff.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>Yes i agree with u that analysis is needed. However, different situation requires different amount of analysis. Those that already have theories behind it, definitely you will have to analyse thoroughly using them. For those that you know nothing abt, if u never try out, how will u ever know? Without failure, u will not know how to get to success, and never know how to get out of what u are facing now. Commiting suicide and willingness to take risk are different matters. Commiting suicide is the result of being unable to accept the reality when failure strikes. This doesnt mean that failure will point towards suicide. Maybe there are people who are successful in their first try, but not all and in these pple, there are some that analyse while acting out. They slowly refine their approach and it led them to success. Therefore analysis does not limit itself to before all actions. Especially for this case, time is crucial, u dont have the luxury of time to slowly analyse... Does the thot of "She is alr attached to someone else aft I had enuff evidence that I will nv fail, then to find out that she has always been waiting for me to act" come across ur mind?<br><br>I am not asking u to kiss her or what, but to find out hands on, how to communicate with her effectively. Build up your courage and go for it! U maybe shy, but relax and talk naturally with her. She maybe able to guide u along when the silence is broken. Remember that its you that wants her that is a confirmed fact, not the other way round, so you will need to do something to get it. Dont ever wait for things you want to fall from the sky.</div>

Seriously... Chances that conversations would be going through in a movie especially for 2 parties who barely started knowing each other would be VERY SLIM...<br><br>Go for OTHER ACTIVITIES!! It's not like you've got much to start off for conversation even in the 1st place...?? MAKE USE of your MSN conversation... Talk, talk, talk... Find out WHAT SHE'S INTERESTED IN... Then date her out for those activities... Do things and then can talk at the same time... Easier to break the ice!! Otherwise you might just end up sitting down there staring at each other again like you've previously described!!</div>
