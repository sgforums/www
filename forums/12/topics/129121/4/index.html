            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Hazeline_snow:</div><div class="quote_body">There's this girl I like and we know each other in school few years ago. However, we started chatting intensively recently this year. Mostly through MSN and SMS. Sometimes in MSN, we chatted late at night (maybe like 2-3). Seriously I dunno if she is interested in me, I've read in other thread that chatting in MSn or SMS cant really see through a person's feeling. From the way she reply, it might even mean that she is just being polite. Yea i agree. So i know you guys want me to ask her out and see how the way she acted rite?<br><br>Now that's another problem... I can chat very well in either MSN and SMS because there's time for me to think what to reply but if i meet her, i would stammer and dunno wat to say. I've meet her outside before (but just for a short period of time.) as she need to borrow something from me. So when i pass her the things, i didnt really do anything and didnt really look at her.. needless to say chatting, I just pass her the things and she didnt really speak too, just smile. It's really pai seh when both of us standing there not talking at the bus stop. So, she break the slience by saying she got to go... and i bid her goodbye too - -" Damn~ I know i should not let her go just like tt and try to talk to her... but i cant~!! When i saw her, i was totally speechless and there's nothing i can do.. (you know.. 'nervous!')<br><br>Honestly, Im not a good speaker that are able to talk well and entertaining. Although i was able to talk and joke ard wif my fren only. When it come to the person i like, i will get nervous. But in Msn and sms is different thing... (although im  braver in msn and sms, im still not brave enough to tell her that i like her.) lastly, we dont really contact through phone as we are used to msn and sms already.<br><br>Since both of us had not been a relatioship before, we dun really have experience for it.<br><br>I know im such a failure but still... tell me what should i do? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  </div></blockquote>1st theory, no venture no gain.<br><br>2nd theory, treat her as another of ur normal frenz n u will not have unnecessary pressure.<br><br></div>
