              <p>If u feel this way, theres a chance u might regret it later in life when u suddenly realise u need friends but have little or none around u.</p>
              <p>At ur age u would not see their importance but alot of times friends are the best sources of contacts and with more friends, u widen ur reach for information as well as help into alot more areas than someone with less friends.</p>
              <p>Until see have a need for them, u won't appreciate their prescence. Like the chinese saying èº«åœ¨ç¦�ä¸­ä¸�çŸ¥ç¦�</p>

              <p>Hi dracas,</p>
              <p>I understand what you mean. You are only interested in keeping people with the same ideology as you around yourself. </p>
              <p>I will not say that you are wrong to do so, for many people only keep like-minded people as their friends. But please do remember that though a lot of people do otherwise, one should not treat his/her friends as clothings which can be discarded when they have outlive their usefulness.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I appreciate all of the postings but take a look, in facebook, I
              have like 100++ friends. But so far I can count on my fingers how
              many I interact actively with. Many of them were very gd friends,
              played together, studied together but now, eevrybody are leading
              their own lives, nobody really gives a shit. Oh even if you have
              build strong bonds with them in the past, all these disappear with
              time. Only your own accomplishments doesnt disappear, in fact, it
              will make you a stronger person.</p>
              <p>I duno..perhaps its a matter of being goal-orientated. In the
              past, I think too much of having fun and after stepping out into
              society to work for a yr with low qualification, I begin to realise
              all these things doesnt matter. What matters is to strive hard for
              oneself, work damn hard and attempt to scale up the social ladder
              step by step. And of cos, in order to do that, one must pay a
              price. Not to the pt of alienation of ppl around you but rather
              filtering these ppl to retain the ones who could help you grow and
              learn from each other. Those who dun, just chuck them away. Oh I
              feel so superficial but I still believe in the theory that "You
              become most like the ppl you spend most of your time with". I just
              refuse to stay a loser anymore. Haiz.</p>

              <p>If thats ur stand and view of things, i won't try to change it since every person is different and have their own needs, thoughts, experiences.</p>
              <p>To me friends are not people who are there for u to take advantage of or people who have uses to u only. There will always be a closer group of friends that i can confide in etc but there will be a larger group of friends i can carry out casual chat with, share different experiences etc.</p>
              <p>Its the people that are different from u that can share with you something you have never tried or experience to increase ur knowledge etc. Only knowing people who have the same interest etc as u will sort of limit ur exposure to everything else that might be going around the world.</p>

              <p>Took you so long? I've been keeping up that mindset ever since I was 15 years old and it has served me extremely well all along. To hell with "work-life balance"; if something is significantly more important than another thing, I might as well focus my efforts just on the former and let the latter take its own course. One's resources are limited anyway.</p>
              <p>The fact is that there aren't probably a lot of people out there who are worth your time, effort and commitment. These so-called friends are just socially dependent people who need you to satisfy their short-term, recurring socio-emotional needs. <strong>They are not out there to make lasting friendships with you, nor do most of them have the maturity and understanding of relationships to build sustainable connections with other human beings, even if they wanted to.</strong></p>
              <p>A truckload of other priorities call for your attention, especially if you -- like me -- have an inherent insecurity of being inferior to others, of feeling that you aren't maximising your self-potential. Don't waste your time doing shit things and then find yourself waking up one day in your thirties and forties, wondering where all your years had gone to and realising that you haven't accomplished shit in life while many of your peers have moved way ahead of you. Conversely, you probably won't find yourself waking up one day and regretting that you didn't have more fun.</p>
              <p>Make the right choice and stick to it. If you have ambitions, e.g. you want to excel in your academics, you want to be a great guitar player, you want to start a company, you want to be an investment whiz, you want to lead a healthy, bodybuilder lifestyle, you want to raise useful kids, you want to write a book, etc., start now.</p>
