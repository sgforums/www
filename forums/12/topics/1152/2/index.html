She might really thought and appreciate(d) you for being able to change for the better for her (in fact, I must admit I dunno?)... She could be (a)appreciative OR she could be just (b)taking things for granted? Let's make the situation more hopeful and pressume it's (a)? I PRESONALLY feel that way too? Cause if it's (b), there's pretty much LITTLE or NOTHING to talk about...<br><br>IMAGINE she appreciative of what you're doing for her. YET, the moment she thought HIGHER of you, you QUESTIONED her whereabout? She dropped the VITAL POINT - 'RESPECT MY PRIVACY'.... You IGNORED and CROSSED the point...? And you were telling us SO MUCH... About HOW you care and concern for her safety... And YET how she could be with another GUY...? WE know what you're thinking... Because you've just POSTED it... She DOESN'T...? Not saying that you're totally wrong in your shoes, your motive might be out of CARE and CONCERN but your driving direction seems SIDETRACKED?<br><br>About the things that she'd said after that, if you know women you won't be surprising at all...? Even MEN does that at time? Not to mention EMOTIONAL creatures like WOMEN? If you REALLY CARE at all, try FOCUSING on HOW she FEELS for a change..? And NOT ONLY just what you THINK is good for her...?<br><br>~Good luck..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> You might expect 'tougher challenges' ahead if you overcome this one...?
