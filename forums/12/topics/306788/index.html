              <p>Few years back.</p>
              <p>Two guys entered my life at the same time. We were all from the same secondary school and they knew each other. Lets call them X &amp; Y.</p>
              <p>X attended to me via sms/msn. We chatted almost everyday, talking about absolutely anything. He was the very caring type, When I fall sick, he was there, telling me to drink more water, rest well etcetc. Although we were very close, we never really talked in school. Y was somehow like X. We chatted via sms/msn everyday. He was there to cheer me up whenever I was sad and was happy whenever I was happy. The only thing that differs was that we went out a few times together. He paid for my expenses. Thus, we were often mistaken as being a couple. Rumours started to go around the school about me and Y being together when we were actually not. Slowly, X and I drifted. Occasionally, I would initiate a conversation with him on msn but we became, so stranger-like.</p>
              <p>Frankly, I never thought of either one of them being my boyfriend one day. I thought friends would come and go. But one day, it eventually happened. One day, Y asked if I wanted to be his girlfriend. And I agreed.</p>
              <p>The next two years was probably the best phase of my life. We were very loving in the beginning. Although there were up and downs, we were back to being lovey-dovey again. During this period of time, X found himself a gf and he practically disappeared from my life. Sadly, things took a turn between my boy and I and we eventually broke up three months ago. Its was over something that was difficult to be solved, not because I didnt love him anymore or vice versa. I still think of him everyday, and I really wish he will be back by my side one day.</p>
              <p>Then recently, X came back into my life again. He, apparently has broken up with his gf. As we chatted on msn, I am reminded of the good old times we had.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, I feel like god has sent this guy to help me get over my ex but sometimes, I feel otherwise. I dont know what to do. I am afraid I will fall in love with him because he 'helped' me out of this tough period. I feel like not contacting him anymore, but till today, he and my ex are still the only people I trust. I wish my ex can just return to me so everything will be settled.</p>
              <p>I really need a breather from all these confusing matters.</p>
              <p>Constructive comments please?</p>

              <p>take things slow, do not make decisions when you are so confused now though/ if u really need a breather, i would suggest going out in groups rather than be with either one of them. just make friends first. choose wisely.</p>

                                      this tough period. u urself know deep down its not becoz u love him for hu he is, but rather he's just a substitute..</p>

                      I agreed with jojo that love can blossom in the most unexpected places, with the unexpected people. Perhaps you do have feeling for X. However, don't misplace X for replacement for Y. It will leads to more mistakes. Think about it with your heart and head first.
                      
                  The two men are not necessarily the only men you can rely on for life. You will definitely meet more people in the later part of your life. Just remember to open up your heart.

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Few years back.</p>
              <p>Two guys entered my life at the same time. We were all from the
                  same secondary school and they knew each other. Lets call them X
                  &amp; Y.</p>
              <p>X attended to me via sms/msn. We chatted almost everyday,
                  talking about absolutely anything. He was the very caring type,
                  When I fall sick, he was there, telling me to drink more water,
                  rest well etcetc. Although we were very close, we never really
                  talked in school. Y was somehow like X. We chatted via sms/msn
                  everyday. He was there to cheer me up whenever I was sad and was
                  happy whenever I was happy. The only thing that differs was that we
                  went out a few times together. He paid for my expenses. Thus, we
                  were often mistaken as being a couple. Rumours started to go around
                  the school about me and Y being together when we were actually not.
                  Slowly, X and I drifted. Occasionally, I would initiate a
                  conversation with him on msn but we became, so stranger-like.</p>
              <p>Frankly, I never thought of either one of them being my
                  boyfriend one day. I thought friends would come and go. But one
                  day, it eventually happened. One day, Y asked if I wanted to be his
                  girlfriend. And I agreed.</p>
              <p>The next two years was probably the best phase of my life. We
                  were very loving in the beginning. Although there were up and
                  downs, we were back to being lovey-dovey again. During this period
                  of time, X found himself a gf and he practically disappeared from
                  my life. Sadly, things took a turn between my boy and I and we
                  eventually broke up three months ago. Its was over something that
                  was difficult to be solved, not because I didnt love him anymore or
                  vice versa. I still think of him everyday, and I really wish he
                  will be back by my side one day.</p>
              <p>Then recently, <span style="color: #3366ff;">X came back into my life again. He, apparently
                  has broken up with his gf.</span> As we chatted on msn, I am reminded of
                  the good old times we had.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, I feel like god has sent this guy to help me get over
                  my ex but sometimes, I feel otherwise. I dont know what to do. <span style="color: #3366ff;">I am
                  afraid I will fall in love with him because he 'helped' me out of
                  this tough period.</span> I feel like not contacting him anymore, but till
                  today, he and my ex are still the only people I trust. I wish my ex
                  can just return to me so everything will be settled.</p>
              <p>I really need a breather from all these confusing matters.</p>
              <p>Constructive comments please?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The reason why X didn't make it to be your bf is probably he's shy or just quiet when it comes to such matters..</p>
              <p>X could be your buddy (soul mate/confidant - somebody that you meet to share and talk about problems, secrets etc)</p>
              <p>You shld however make it clear with X abt the relationship and clarify with him on that issue.</p>
              <p>Ask him if you could go to him when you need someone to lean on.</p>
              <p>Do take note that while he helped you out of tough times, don't convert the gratitude and simply pass it off as feelings which you might still have with Y. Since you still miss Y</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can't mix up X and Y.</p>
              <p>If you must, then talk to X openly. Avoiding only make matters worse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My elder brother has a bossom buddy (of the opposite gender) and they worked out quite well, as long as you let your other half knows,at the very begining of the relationship (in future).</p>
              <p>While I might not have such a confidant yet; still searching, at least i have a fren whom i meet out late at night..when we're both bored and to meet up just to chat and kill boredom.. (again of the opposite gender).</p>
              <p>If you find someone whom you trust, than talk to that person.</p>
              <p>It's hard to come across somebody who cares for you with no ill intentions. (specifically since you're a girl and is at disadvantage if you know what i mean..)</p>
