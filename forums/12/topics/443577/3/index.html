              <p>about 1-2 years ago, i was at a haagen daz shop in taipei.. and there at the shop counter was one of the cutest girl i ever saw in taipei...</p>
              <p>so i took my time to choose my ice cream and ask lots of questions and asked for her suggestions...and i also made a few really lame jokes which got her laughing.. not sure she laughed out of courtesy as i was a customer or not but anyway i didnt know for sure...</p>
              <p>then finally i asked which flavour she liked, and i ordered two of that and gave one to her.. she was really surprise by that.. she said she wasnt suppose to eat it then as she was on her shift but she did say that she will keep it...</p>
              <p>the following day, i went back to the shop but unfortunately she was not working then... but two weeks after that i went back to the same shop and she was working! and best of all she remembered me!</p>
              <p>anyway, cut long story for TS, make a good first contact and impression and she will remember and look upon you favourably...</p>

              <p>That is what i did to my customer too, alway they will buy a glass for me, joke with them, talk with them awhile, then go to the back and throw pour the drink away, then come out again, then at the end of the day, we gals will joke and laugh over all these silly guys</p>

              Hi Seth,
              
              After reading your posts...I find that you really, really remind me of my little cousin. He's a few years my junior, and he ever told me once that he really liked this girl and what he did to talk to her..
              
              I can't really advise you on this, but I think one good thing to note is what kind of girl she is, ie intro/extrovert? And also would like to share my own experience with you, see if it gives you any ideas/hints what to do.
              
              A few years ago when I was in Poly, there was this guy (a friend of a friend) who had a huge crush on me..and he would be waiting/calling/texting me that he was 'around that area' as he was 'passing by'. I knew that was a lie, although it was sweet of him to be hanging around waiting for me. But then, all I thought of/worried about was WHY WAS HE THERE. I'd been dropping hints that I did not like him that way, which he did not get. I eventually had to block/delete him (which I agonized over cos I did not want to hurt him more - but he was driving me crazy). He was sweet, but he was TOO MUCH. And I didnt' feel anything for him beyond friendship.
              
              Just be mindful if she doesn't seem to like you that way. Take things slow..again, that depends on the type of person she is.
              
              Good luck =)

              Hey everyone! Sorry for my lack of replies. I've been working on long schedules for the past few days. Finally getting an off-day tomorrow, :). I must admit, she's constantly on my mind! Especially now that Christmas is approaching and that the gift lays there in my cupboard. Not that I'm going to give it to her anytime soon but it does remind me of her. Hope you are all having a good week so far, :D!
              
              Coffeebreak : Wow. That was very nice of you. I would love to try but I doubt I'll ever be able to pull off something like that. Haha!
              
              Tmarcus : Haha! I'm pretty sure I'd probably look for the furthest table away from her! I don't know why but I seem to be subconsciously hiding my feelings for her.
              
              Fcukpap : I'd rather use that $300 to treat her to a sumptious meal / buy her something she likes. Hahaha!
              
              elindra : Oops! Looks like most ladies find it uncomfortable. Actually, she and I have to walk to the same bus stop. However, she continues walking from there while I've got to take a bus. No worries, I've given up the idea, xD.
              
              AngelOfDarkness : Hi!
              
              To be honest, I can't really be sure as to whether she's an extrovert/introvert. From what I observe, I don't think she's an introvert as I've heard her laughing loudly and openly on a few occassions. Plus, once when she was exiting the cafe, when the cashier thanked her from across the room, her reply was clear and loud enough for him to hear (short 8-10m?). I'm not sure, but for me, I'd just smile and walk away quietly, :S.
              
              I understand. Thank you for sharing, :). I must admit, I've purposely dropped by (outside) the cafe she's always hanging out at just to see if she's there. Well, of course I did it in a way that it seems like I was passing by, haha. Hope she doesn't notice it that way and that she doesn't feel what you felt!
              
              Thank you, ;)!
              
              winsomeea : I actually saw her carrying boxing gloves around before. Saw it tied to her bag on 3 seperate occassions. Maybe it was prepared for me, :O ?!

              <p><br> Just joking!! :D Most girls don't show fist when they're pissed ma.
              You must be one hell of a girl :D</p>
              <p>Ewwwww. Luckily that guy didn't do that. But he was quite close
              to that. And it was disgusting as hell :S I just pushed him off to
              another topic.</p>
              <p>If it were me in the lift with him and he moaned, I'd probably
              scream at him LOL. And not jus that EEK CAN YOU STOP THAT?! That's
              just EWWW.</p>
              <p>what did you do imm. aft he moaned in the lift?!</p>
              <p>oh gosh. I feel for you.</p>

              <p>hey, u judgemental!  BTW, he is as good as a stranger to me.     I have been trying ways and means to avoid him but he keeps irritating me, scolded him when he stood next to me and grinned like a shit.     No use.   I am up to my neck that was how I plucked up my courage to show him my fist.   He knows the unit I stay, if I dun want to show him I am fierce what happen one day he come my house and do someting funny.    Normally, I won't show fist.    He was the first idiot I showed fist to.     </p>
              <p>After the moan in the lift.     I happened to be in the lift with him for about 2 to 3 times.    I saw him coming in I immediately walked out.    I hate to talk to him, feel he is too unworthy to talk to.   The last time I walked out of the lift when he walked in he cannot take it, he questioned me why I walked out.    I could not even be bothered to answer him, I ignored him.      </p>
