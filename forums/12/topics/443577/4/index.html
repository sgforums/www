              Hello people, :)!
              How have all of you been? The Chinese New Year is approaching and I hope it has been a good new year so far for all of you, :).
              
              My birthday was just yesterday and I thought I wanted to give her the present I got for her previously. I was playing basketball in school and I saw her walking by. I quickly tried to chase her from another route ( as it was not a linked path ) but I couldn't find her. I went up the staircases and went through the whole of 6 storeys but to no avail.
              
              I was walking past a foodcourt today and I saw her sitting there in the cafe! There was a little battle inside me as to whether I should give her the present or not ( Yes, I bring the gift everyday ). We're still total strangers, other than the fact that we bump into each other quite frequently. I was so scared and hesitant, but one thought overuled all other feelings - "If not now, when?". 
              
              I was never quite this brave in approaching a girl. I just pressed on and fought away all thoughts of turning back. My mind was a total blank and I was tongue-tied. Nearly nothing I had planned to say came out. I blurted, "Hi, I hope I'm not scaring you. I got something for you awhile back and I thought I wanted you to have it." and placed the gift on the table. Her response was like, "For me? Thank you!". She looked so cute and pretty I just felt like melting on the spot, :S. Then I left, LOL! She gestured and asked something, but I was too shy to listen. I just walked out of the cafe and told her to keep the present.
              
              I could feel my face swell in deep embarrassment and I was jelly all over. While walking down a stairs after the incident I was shaking so much that I lost my footing. I didn't fall though. 
              
              Just sharing!
              At the same time, would like to know what are the chances that I scared her, :x?

              <p>Since you post on the 17 of January, I presume you just gave the present. I have no idea where this is going to go but one thing for sure, you be the talk of town. What is their next reaction, I have no idea. Maybe news will spread and other girls in your class will want to become the apple of your eye.</p>
              <p>There is high chance you won't get this cute girl. If you think about it, if she is hot to you, she is sure hot to other guys. After your bold encounter, how soon other pursuers will be hot on her heels? Especially after hearing news of your apparent bravery?</p>
              <p>Moreover, you didn't do a background check on her. How you know she is single? Maybe she's going out with another guy who is from another school?</p>
              <p>Anyway kudos to you for your bravery.</p>
              <p>However perhaps next time before you make your move, you should ask yourself why you like her?</p>
              <p>1) You don't know her</p>
              <p>2) you like her because she is pretty</p>
              <p>3) you don't know her character, her temperament</p>
              <p>Perhaps you can ponder and reflect on reasons on why you like the girl? Next time please don;t judge a girl on her looks but more important so, on her character and her similarities with you.</p>
              <p>You say you are an introvert. Therefore unless you are a player, this infatuation won't go far. Only a player who has the necessary skills can step up his game.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, I salute your bravery. Maybe you've earn some respect. Maybe not. Do keep us update on the latest news.</p>
              <p>1) Did you get her attention?</p>
              <p>2) Is she coming to talk to you more often? If not, are you approaching her? How is her reaction?</p>
              <p>3) What isyour next move?</p>
              <p>4) Is there any other girl suddenly like you out of the blue? after hearing your brave move on this cute girl?</p>

                      *I'M TERRIBLY SORRY BUT I CAN'T SEEM TO PUT THEM INTO PARAGRAPHS NO MATTER WHAT I DO, :( !*
                      It was pretty discrete (imo and I hope it was!) because the cafe is sort of enclosed in glass panels in front of the foodcourt. Plus, I wrapped the present up and put it in a paper bag so no one could really tell what it was. According to my friend who was watching from outside though, only two guys in the cafe seemed to notice and it looked like a normal friend-to-friend approach. 
                  
                  
                      
                      Yes, I get your point. I noticed because I just added her on Facebook yesterday and someone who previously enquired her for her number wrote on her wall, still asking for her number, which she didn't give. I really hope you aren't right and that no one noticed anything, :x. She is a really beautiful and attractive girl and easily stands out from the crowd. 
                  
                  
                      
                      I checked a little, but I can't be sure about things. Here's what I found out from her ex-schoolmate. She used to be "super boyish" (there were photos to testify that) and she wasn't straight. I was told she turned straight but from her photos, I think she's dating another girl. :(. I couldn't sleep a wink trying to accept that but yeah, I've accepted it and I feel that I shouldn't give up. After all, I'm just making wild guesses..
                  
                  
                      
                      Thank you, :). I never expected myself not to turn back, haha! I did revise that in my mind countless times. I kept telling myself that it was her looks that I'm really attracted to and I think it is. I feel though that she's really friendly and that fate has let us cross paths too many times. I see her in bus rides, train rides, school, Orchard, Somerset and near our homes. All without planning and the coincidences probably played a big part in making me believe we can be something. Other than that, I believe I was just infatuated, sad and guilty to say...
                  
                  
                      
                      Point taken, :). I do judge a girl from how she behaves and her character. She's really bubbly and loud but feminine at the same time too. Yes, I'm young and inexperienced but I don't fall in love and go into a relationships with anyone just because he/she is goodlooking. I've got devastated by previous relationships and I no longer judge things on a superficial level. Plus, I've secretly admired this girl since March 2011 and only till now did I make a move.
                  
                  
                      
                      It was the biggest load taken off my mind after I handed her the present. I just wanted her to have it. It didn't occur to me if she liked me or not. After she accepted my request, I took the courage to say hi on Facebook chat. I took 5mins to do that, LOL ._. It started off really badly. She was a little rude and sarcastic with her words and wanted to return the gift, which she did so today. I believe it wasn't her talking to me at first though. I suspect she was directing my words to someone else and that someone else was telling her what to reply as she takes really long to reply. Only later into the night did it feel like we're talking as 'friends'. She was way friendlier and warmer and we chatted about random things till 1am ( from 10pm?). I met her before she went to class this morning to pick up the present. Bought she and her best friend each a cup of Starbucks coffee under the excuse of making her sleep late the previous night and as a form of apology for shocking her friend. 
                      
                  
                  
                      We're still chatting on Facebook and things are going well at the moment and I really hope it'll stay that way for as long as possible. I'm not placing any hopes on anything but yeah, I'll take whatever comes, &gt;.&lt;.
                  
                  
                      
                      Anyway, thank you for your sincere reply MagnicientDiagrams, :)! Really appreciate it. Sorry that my reply is SUPER LONG! I just had to get it all out, &gt;.&lt; You don't have to reply if its too long / you're too tired. It was nice rattling on, :P.

              <p>i managed to read your super long chant LOL...</p>

              Hi! Thank you for reading and I really appreciate that you share your opinions, :).
              Do you mean that there's a high chance that she'll like a guy because "she is ultimately still a girl"?
              
              True. To be honest, these thoughts have crossed my mind and that's why I'm not pinning up any hopes on anything. I'm pretty sure most girls in her position would guess that I have "something" for her. I couldn't tell her why when she probed though, :(. It sucks to have to hold back the feelings but yeah, it was the best thing to do.
              
              You may be right. We're still talking though ( I know its only the second day but it matters! ). Whatever it is, I shall cease to expect anything from her. 
              
              I stumbled upon her blog yesterday and I must say, it felt like I was reading my own blog. The things we blog about, our ideals and thoughts. She's very much like me - We appear cold and strong but inside we're vulnerable and insecure. Here's one big example : Since a kid, I've always dreamt to make it big so I could fly to Africa and help ease the sufferings in the remote areas. She too, wishes to fly to Africa to help out. It feels so much like there's an identical twin thinking the same things and sharing the same dreams elsewhere and neither of us knows. She cannot bring herself to trust guys because apparently, she has seen her father mistreat ladies countless times. I feel attached, and it feels so much like a telepathic feel ( I hope I haven't watched too many movies). I trust God and Fate, for the countless encounters with her.
              
              Here's a little inside story.. A few months ago during a school holiday, a really adorable girl walked into my life. I'll call her R. No details, but it was the worst period of my life and I was totally confused and stressed. R gave me a lot of support and helped me to see the light in many things. She taught me how to make the right decisions and guided me in many things.She was alwasy there. Naturally, we grew really, really close and it was nearly like we were a couple. Yet, at this point in time, I related to my friend that R has been extremely nice and stuff and I like her a lot (only as a friend) and that no matter how close and attached and indebted I feel towards R, V (the girl I admire then till now) is the girl I truly want to be with.
              
              Sorry to have to come up with another chant, &gt;.

              I'm sorry about that but I can't put it into paragraphs no matter how I try.
              
              You are right. Its agonising but I can't seem to pull away from it.
              I guess we're considered friends as we're still chatting on Facebook. No worries, I won't read too much into that..
              
              I find it so hard to approach her, :(. I'm just too shy, zzz..
