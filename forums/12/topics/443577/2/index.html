There are guy who can do the cheap way out and still able to please gals, for example, recently this guy I went out for a causal dinner and then strolled by the park, I saw some flowers blossom very nicely and told him I like road side wild flowers, then the second day after our meet up, my maid came and told me that my gate outside got lots of different type of wild flowers, he must had make and effort to pick and pluck for me. So warming and yet so unforgetable. So, be creative in courting, doing the same old stuffs is not going to get a gal heart.</p></div>

              We should never criticise something we don't understand ; Every individual is different in his own way of thinking that we don't understand. Thus, we shouldn't be judging. Can't be helped though, sometimes we just have to let off some steam, xD.

              Thankfully, a great sense of humour is something I definitely do not lack. I'm always the one making people laugh in my clique, hehe. Understand though, not everyone will laugh at the same things. As for me, I ain't rich but I'm the type to take note of whatever 'she' adores &amp; start saving if its too expensive.
              Wow, that guy you mentioned sure is sweet. Seems like he is someone thoughtful and sensitive!

              Well, the only thing I'm worried about is giving her a bad scare. It'd make it awfully awkward if we meet in future, :(. No worries, I'm not a pretentious guy. Hypocrites never stay as friends once I have a glimpse of their true colours.

              I hate it that I'm unbelievably shy. Now that I'm closer to my colleagues, they told me they couldn't believe how shy I was as a guy when I first came in. Does it mean that my shyness is a result of my lack of confidence? I guess that'll definitely come in handy but it isn't something that can be done overnight, :\.

              Wah, that sounded so serious. Never crossed my mind but yes, the chances are slim, but there. From my observation of her though, I personally don't think she's that type. Then again, of course, I don't know her, xD. If that really happens then I can only blame it on my luck.

              Oh. I do that sometimes! I always feel so strong right after doing so and then later on, I'd slump back into the same patterns, :x. Looking back to half a year ago though, I guess I've improved my self-esteem by quite a bit. Evident by my "want" to know Her. Guess that's it? Just gotta work harder on boosting my confidence?

              <p><strong>Theodore Robert</strong> "<strong>Ted</strong>" <strong>Bundy</strong> (born <strong>Theodore Robert Cowell</strong>; November 24, 1946 – January 24, 1989) was an American <a title="Serial killer" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Serial_killer"><span style="color: #0645ad;">serial killer</span></a>, rapist, kidnapper, and <a title="Necrophilia" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Necrophilia"><span style="color: #0645ad;">necrophile</span></a> who assaulted and murdered numerous young women during the 1970s, and possibly earlier. After more than a decade of denials, he confessed shortly before his execution to 30 homicides committed in seven states between 1974 and 1978; the true total remains unknown, and could be much higher.</p>
              <p>Bundy was handsome and charismatic, traits he exploited in winning the confidence of his young, attractive female victims. He typically approached them in public places and feigned injury or disability, or impersonated an authority figure, before overpowering and assaulting them at a more secluded location. He sometimes revisited his secondary crime scenes for hours at a time, grooming and performing sexual acts with the decomposing corpses until putrefaction and destruction by wild animals made further interaction impossible. He decapitated at least twelve victims and kept some of the severed heads in his apartment for a period of time as mementos. On a few occasions he simply broke into dwellings in the dead of night and bludgeoned victims as they slept.</p>
              <p>Initially charged in Utah in 1975 and convicted of aggravated kidnapping and attempted criminal assault, Bundy became linked to a progressively longer list of unsolved homicides in multiple states. Facing murder charges in Colorado, he engineered two dramatic escapes and committed multiple additional assaults, resulting in at least three murders, before his ultimate recapture in Florida in 1978. He received three death sentences in two separate trials for the three known Florida homicides.</p>
              <p>Ted Bundy died in the <a title="Electric chair" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Electric_chair"><span style="color: #0645ad;">electric chair</span></a> at <a title="Florida State Prison" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Florida_State_Prison"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Raiford Prison</span></a> in <a title="Starke, Florida" href="http://sgforums.com/wiki/Starke,_Florida"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Starke, Florida</span></a>, in January 1989.

              <p>about 1-2 years ago, i was at a haagen daz shop in taipei.. and there at the shop counter was one of the cutest girl i ever saw in taipei...</p>
              <p>so i took my time to choose my ice cream and ask lots of questions and asked for her suggestions...and i also made a few really lame jokes which got her laughing.. not sure she laughed out of courtesy as i was a customer or not but anyway i didnt know for sure...</p>
              <p>then finally i asked which flavour she liked, and i ordered two of that and gave one to her.. she was really surprise by that.. she said she wasnt suppose to eat it then as she was on her shift but she did say that she will keep it...</p>
              <p>the following day, i went back to the shop but unfortunately she was not working then... but two weeks after that i went back to the same shop and she was working! and best of all she remembered me!</p>
              <p>anyway, cut long story for TS, make a good first contact and impression and she will remember and look upon you favourably...</p>
