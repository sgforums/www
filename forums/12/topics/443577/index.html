              My apologies to Little_Red_Book for the look-alike-post, but your thread sparked off something in my mind. Of course, my heart as well.
              
              There's this girl I've been admiring for roughly half a year. She's studying in the same polytechnic as I am. I presume she's taking the same course too as she's always around the blocks I used to have lectures last semester. Frankly, she's a really pretty girl (shall not disgress to avoid a million-page write-up). If it helps, she's definitely seen me before. We always meet incidentally at either of these places:
              1. MRT Station ( same destination)
              2. School ( self-explanatory)
              3. Foodcourt / Cafe in school ( I go there just to see her! Creepy, but yeah, no ill-intentions)
              
              We're currently on a 3-week holiday and I really hope to see her again soon. Recently, I've got a very strong urge to take my chances and get to know her. I've even purchased a Swarovski necklace for her as a Christmas gift. Christmas is fast approaching and I've been scheduled to work the entire Christmas period.
              
              So, how can I actually approach her without embarrassing her / scaring her off? I'm very much an introvert and I know this is going to be tough for me but I don't want to wait till she finds someone better ( I can't be 100% sure but I'm pretty confident she isn't attached at the moment ).
              
              Sorry for the painfully long post. Hope to get a few good advices and pointers that I can rely on. Feel free to flame me as well. I'll swallow it like a pill. Thanks in advance!

              Thanks FireIce for that! Very simple, but somehow it feels so sincere! 
              
              Will it be extremely awkward for her if I wait at the bus stop near her house? I mean, I am already "fully-booked" for this Christmas period and that means, I can't do that on the festive day itself, :(.

              Guess that's what its called, :x. She has to walk past that bus stop to go home. Its on her route home. I've got to take a bus from that station to go home. I won't know.. Call me stupid, but I wouldn't mind waiting, xD.

              Hehe, I'm quiet and shy in the "real" world (meaning off browsers..) but I guess I can safely say that I'm a friendly guy. I can be quite a joker too, but I only do it with people I know really well. Fully understand the fact that if it doesn't come my way it isn't that bad a thing after all. Hope its the first case scenario though, :). Thanks!

              You're right.. Perhaps then, I should keep it until I get to know her better? Somehow, I feel lost now (oops!). It had seem like such a good idea until reality hits, :S.

              Ts,
              So wise of you, you must be young, be friendly,  and most of when matters of the heart are concerned being unserious and accepting that there is no rite/wrong n knowing that it just the way it is - makes for an adventure (mishaps not exluded) and being open to ... that is freeing!

              Seems like it's a really scary thing to do. To think I even thought that up, LOL!
              Shall let nature take its course in that case. Would be pretty meaningless though, if Christmas ended and the gift still sits there in my cardboard..

              So wise of you, you must be young, be friendly, and most of when
              matters of the heart are concerned being unserious and accepting
              that there is no rite/wrong n knowing that it just the way it is â€“
              makes for an adventure (mishaps not exluded) and being open to â€¦
              that is freeing!</p>

              Haha! Thank you, but you're the wise one here! Well, matters of the heart should add a spring in our steps and not weigh more on our foot. As naive as it sounds, that's the way it should be!

              Sadly, we don't have any mutual friends. You see, the only people I'm mostly in contact with are my classmates. They're about the only group of people I know in SP. My classmates know I'm fond of her, but no one knows her, :X. Thanks for the advice too! I clean forgotten about the whole 'BGR' thing. Still far from it, I guess.

              Will keep that in mind! Somehow, I'm not a bad student, but I don't study ; I don't listen in class but I don't disrupt anyone. This girl that I like makes me want to study hard. Perhaps its my way of being 'good enough' for her. I won't do anything foolish, :). I'm stronger than most people my age. Not to mention, more matured as well. Understand that maturity is not for oneself to judge but I know myself well enough to say so. Been working since I was 15. Not a total newbie to the society but I'm well-aware I've got many more ropes to learn!

              Life is expressed in all forms from the rich to the poor to the arrogant to the wise, to the disconnected to the ..... but whatever it is behind all these the longing is to be included. Look around and behind the social facade are hearts beating to the silent screams and hoping that someone would ignore the latter and recognise the former.
              
              Rich cannot exist without poor, arrogance cannot exist without humblessness - sad is the folly of modern living
