            <div class='col-md body'>I was a big fat round ball back in primary school and always the target for bullies. Got beaten up like don't know how many times already. When i grew up, i trained myself up and practised karate. Though not very big size now but still no one really dare to mess around with me now.  Soemtimes i saw those who beat me up last time i really want to revenge but then no point. When you're a kid you don't really get into trouble for beating people. But when you're an adult it's real trouble.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I got bullied even in the Army. The main reason had to do with the fact that I was more highly educated than most of them. I swear to God, I never treated them any differently regardless of their backgrounds. I know for a fact that some of them were drug abusers and secret society members in the past, and I never judged them based on all that. Besides, for every bully there were many others who accepted me for who I was.<br><br>I talked to one of those who didn't bully me, and he said that the bullies simply felt 'inferior' by my presence and picked on me just to make themselves feel better and to teach me 'a lesson in life' as was born in 'a privileged position'. Please.... without going into details, I came from the school of hard knocks, and I don't ask for any more lessons.<br><br>When I finally got my three stripes, they suddenly lost all the will to bully me.<br><br>Goes to show that all bullies are cowards after all.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
