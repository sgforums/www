            <div class='col-md body'>Verbal bullies are easy to deal with. Either ignore them and they get tired of humiliating someone who don't bother. Or you just punch them once and they will leave you alone forever. If you show that you get pissed off by their insults, you're just falling into their trap. And it makes it more fun for them.</div>

For young kids, this could be more overt. Among adults, it may happen as well. Politics and all that. But should not let it tarnish your character, and make you bitter and vengeful. Feelings may be hurt for awhile, but once you let it destroy your good character, then the damage may be permanent.</div>
