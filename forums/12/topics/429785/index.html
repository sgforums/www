              <div class="content">My
               elder sister is really treating me like a child. I been engaging in 
              casual sex for the past 3 years and of course condoms is a must for me. I
               hardly had any intercourse but more to oral ones. She saw a condom in 
              my room which I had left it there by mistake. She asked me why did I buy
               it and what do I do with it? I was stunned that I cant find a good 
              excuse but to tell her that Im just buying for fun.<br> <br> And she threatens to tell my mum. I was so pissed that she would treat 
              her 30 year old younger brother like a small child. And she preached 
              about how sinful it is to engage in such activities. Im a grown up adult
               and I can do whatever I want as long as its not at the expense of 
              others. And I should be free to choose what kind of life I want. And I 
              wont blame anybody if I ever got any serious STDs or HIV.<br> <br> She will never be able to see the bigger picture that I did cuz it I had
               no choice as Im single, never had a gf, no girls wants me and I have my
               needs. I mean who wants to die a virgin anyway. And all the sex I had 
              was consensual where no one gets hurt after that. Isnt that better than I
               go around raping a woman? And speaking of religion, if God is really 
              that great, Im sure he would understand me doing such things. I did it 
              not because I want to but I have no other alternatives.</div>
              <div class="additional-details"><br></div>
              <div class="additional-details">I 
              have no disrespect to anyone who still wants to wait till marriage to 
              have sex or wait due to religion obligations. its all individual 
              choices. i dont encourage people to do what im doing now either.  i used
               to have such mindset that I wanna wait and do it with my wife. But 
              after several life experiences showing me that my chances of getting 
              married are slim, I have decided not to wait anymore. I lost my 
              virginity during my late 20s. that is considered late in today's 
              culture. sex is something everyone of should enjoy. its not wrong 
              engaging in pre marital sex so long we do it safely and no one gets hurt
               in the process. and yes, there are risks. anything we do in our lives 
              has its risks, even getting married is a risk too.</div>

              <p>You say you have no gal fren, so how did u manage to get consensual sex? Sex wif galfren is safe because u know her better and where she has been, therefore reducing probability of catching STDs. You can catch Hepatitis D and E via saliva which could lead to prolong liver disease and damage. Hepatitis is very commonly transmitted thru oral sex. My cousin contracted Hepatitis while sharing food with a co worker who has contracted the disease. Yes risk is everywhere but by having consensual sex thru one night stands, you are raising the risk. Find a galfren, have a mono partner relationship then you can start to enjoy consensual sex.</p>
              <p>Consensual sex with prostitutes (I am not saying you are having) may produce moral dilemnas. It may not affect you right now but in future your view of women and family could be affected because of the moral consequences that you may choose to do. It can produce effects on your subconscious actions.</p>
              <p>However, if u met somebody from the night club and go for one night stand, tat is a different case because u don't know where that somebody has been. Even condoms don't fully protect you 100%. There could be microscopic holes or defects in the condom.</p>
              <p>Having said this, leaving your condoms around to be spot on by your sister, isn't exactly a very good thing. Its like leaving your diary wide open. If you see your sister leaving her dildo or birth control pill around, won't you complain as well?</p>

I hardly had any intercourse but more to oral ones. She saw a condom in my room which I had left it there by mistake. She asked me why did I buy it and what do I do with it? I was stunned that I cant find a good excuse but to tell her that Im just buying for fun.<br><br>And she threatens to tell my mum. I was so pissed that she would treat her 30 year old younger brother like a small child. And she preached about how sinful it is to engage in such activities. Im a grown up adult and I can do whatever I want as long as its not at the expense of others. And I should be free to choose what kind of life I want. And I wont blame anybody if I ever got any serious STDs or HIV.<br><br>She will never be able to see the bigger picture that I did cuz it I had no choice as Im single, never had a gf, no girls wants me and I have my needs. I mean who wants to die a virgin anyway. And all the sex I had was consensual where no one gets hurt after that. Isnt that better than I go around raping a woman? And speaking of religion, if God is really that great, Im sure he would understand me doing such things. I did it not because I want to but I have no other alternatives.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I have no disrespect to anyone who still wants to wait till marriage to have sex or wait due to religion obligations. its all individual choices. i dont encourage people to do what im doing now either. i used to have such mindset that I wanna wait and do it with my wife. But after several life experiences showing me that my chances of getting married are slim, I have decided not to wait anymore. I lost my virginity during my late 20s. that is considered late in today's culture. sex is something everyone of should enjoy. its not wrong engaging in pre marital sex so long we do it safely and no one gets hurt in the process. and yes, there are risks. anything we do in our lives has its risks, even getting married is a risk too.</div>

              <p>U oledi say u have no galfren. Now, confirm u do not belief in sex buddy. So where r u getting yer one night stands? If you are visiting prostitutes, it is not a healthy sign. First, physically you r subjecting yerself to STD and Hepatitus disease which can be transmitted thru oral sex. Second, by going to prostitutes, your opinion of women will be degraded.</p>
              <p>Without rejection u cannot learn. Try and try again until u succeed. Instead of going after gals, try making more frens n going out to more social gathering to meet the opposite sex. Make frens wif gals first. 30 is still young. I know people in their 40s still not married. Must be more thick skin le.</p>

              <p>Hi...</p>
              <p>It is true you are not a child anymore....</p>
              <p>But..</p>
              <p>You also have to understand.....your elder sister...is your elder sister......</p>
              <p>She is not your friend or someone like that.....</p>
              <p>So......because she is a family member....her position and her relations to you....is within the inner ring of family relations.....</p>
              <p>She is just thinking about your well-being....</p>
              <p>Due to that, she may be shocked and uncomfortable when she found out the condom...</p>
              <p>Well.....to understand her feelings, maybe you can imagine a similar scenario in reverse....</p>
              <p>What if you find a dildo and birthcontrol pill or abortion pill in your sister's room.</p>
              <p>How would you feel ?</p>
              <p>Would you feel completely normal, "she is an adult already not a child, I shouldnt interfere, never mind"</p>
              <p>Maybe to understand it further, imagine if she is your "younger" sister.</p>
              <p>I say that because older siblings have stronger inclination to protect the younger siblings.</p>
              <p>Well.......</p>
              <p>It is an uncomfortable situation for you also.....what I suggest you do is......to keep quiet and to be passive about it.....no need to justify anything and no need to talk about it......</p>
              <p>I think you need to protect the siblings relations / family relations and keep it intact......</p>
              <p>Sexual matters is taboo and uncomfortable and personal......and its hard to cross over or bring it into the family relations matrix......</p>
              <p>So my recommendation :</p>
              <p>Keep quiet and let it slide.</p>
              <p>Next time be careful and be more discreet.</p>
