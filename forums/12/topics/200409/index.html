            <div class='col-md body'>in my opinion, she could be using you as just a spare tire. as a friend, maybe you could show her concern not because you wan to get into her good books but to console her, maybe she just need a person to console her. if you really still love her, maybe to prevent you from getting hurt again, sms her or talk on phone frequently to see if whether there is still love between you and her. however whether you want to take the chance or not is still your own choice.</div>
