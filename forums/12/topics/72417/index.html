            <div class='col-md body'>i will still meet her one last time, and then pour out my feelings to her. but i won't expect anything in return since she is attached. just wanna make my feelings known. at least when it comes the time when i'm having my last breath, i won't regret it.<br><br>if you fear that you might break down in front of her, use the old fashioned way. write out your feelings in a letter. have a normal meeting with her and just as both of you are parting, hand her the letter. then walk away and don't look back again.<br><br>cheers...</div>

Either you see or you don't.<br><br>So what happen when you see? Your soul is happy, but your emotional spirt screams the pain - of someone so near, yet so far.<br><br>Then what if you don't? Your soul longs and your emotional spirit still screams the pain - of someone far and still so far.<br><br>Sounds like paragraph two has a better choice - at least your soul is happy.<br><br>Understand this part, do you think boyfriend matters? Do you think what you kept in your heart matters? Nothing matters because you both are causal friends. You could say anything you want - do you lose anything? No. It's like playing Who Wants To Be a Millionaire and you are at the one thousand dollar level - even if you answered it wrongly, you don't lose anything. You only lose something if you expect something (<strong>No disappointment because there is no desire</strong>).<br><br>You can meet her, a last date where you can throw whatsoever sh|t you have inside as a concluding speech to her on that day. After that, start walking on your own. It's like an ending chapter - do it well, you can begin your next chapter faster.<br><br>P.S: Then again, what makes you think she will agree on a private date then? Fate... difficult to comprehand. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

We were just talking moments ago and she was telling me all the lovey dovey things that her bf did for her.<br><br>I really don't know why am I such a fool to be still here...I have long not expected anything to happen between us nor would I want anything to happen to the both of them if she's really happy with him...Can you actually stop yourself from loving someone? Can you actually suppress the feelings you have for someone that you really do love? Please do teach me how...<br><br>I am missing her so much...to an extent that it hurts slightly...</div></blockquote>At a point of my life I've come to learn that... Loving someone is not to possess that someone... It's not even neccessarily about making that someone happy... (depending on your scope of duty.. You can still do so as a friend if you want to or need to?)<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"It's about just letting someone be happy in whatever way it should be...."</span><br><br>If she's happy, shouldn't you be happy for her? It's a natural impulse if you wanna do something to protect your love (one?) and even <span style="font-style: italic;">doing something for her....</span> But sometimes doing nothing can be just as good enough... Not to ruin the happiness she's in....</div>
