Hm got one ex colleague, her grades not very good leh. She took up a scholarship to study in one of the university offered by a company which she search online. But it requires her to work for the company during her holidays and after she graduated she needs to work in that Company for about 2 to 3 years. If she failed her exams need to pay that company.</div>

Guess what? You can! I did it before, although it's going to be really tough and tiring, not sure if you are the "can take it" kinda guy! Study part time can start with a bank loan, your own biz depends on what kinda biz you want, for a start you may try one with minimum capital... But first you need a job bah from what i presume, so that you can get the bank loan and some cash flow to start your own biz as well.<br><br>If you have a goal, then you need a plan to achieve your desired goal. If you cannot reach the goal, then change your plans in order to be able to achieve the goal, dun change the goal... However, most people tend to reduce their goals to fit their plan, which usually means compromising by having a lesser goal in life. I don't know about you, but I'm a freaking stubborn guy that persists until I reach my goals. Even though I came from a poor and broken family, it doesn't stop me from doing what I want, and having what I have. People and life generally tend to put you down sometimes, but they will shut up after you came back with the results, and then they will start to say funny things. It's human nature.</div>

If study then i need money, but no body can give me money.<br>though i looks rich as i live in landed property. But my parents are not that rich.<br>My 2 elder brothers and sister have all been to aust to study. Spend about 400k.<br>Now my dad want to retire, but judging from the bad business in the past years.<br>i doubt they got much savings. i am not so bastard to use my parents savings. Even though i know they will still support me if i want to study.<br><br>feel like getting a degree even though i know i won't work for anione in the long run. degree is like an achievement in life...............................</div></blockquote>for me i would tell you<br><br>dun study to secure your pay in future.<br>study only for knowledge<br><br>do a business be a boss earn more money<br><br>now average is undergraduate degree to get at least 1.8k only<br>now starting pay more than 2k are those from double degrees<br><br>more and more ppl are studying higher education.<br>demand is only so little, supply so high thus your pay-cheque will only get lower and lower<br><br>in just 5-8 yrs.<br><br>i forsee that if no one is double degree, basic starting pay only 1.5k and below.<br><br>bear in mind that foreign talents are rushing into singapore, they can accept lower pay coz they still can send back to their countries, but not us..<br><br>so to study for a higher pay is usless, study to increase knowledge is a better reason.</div>
