That's very shallow to be judging someone by their qualifications. U probably do need alot of time to get over her. I'm sure you would find a girl someday who wouldn't care even if you had O levels or PSLE, someone who would make you happy and love and care for you.

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Again... the qualification issue. The war between lower qualification man and higher qualification woman. Question is... is that all-mighty important?<br><br>Why? Why you may think women prefers man with higher qualification than them? The reason is very simple: the investment theory. Back to basis, every  women sees relationship as a form of investment; this investment we are talking about goes beyond the paid expense of the man's version in a relationship. We are talking about biological aging, emotional investment, sex-related thingy (even pregnancy), etc.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Qualification is a measurement of <span style="font-style: italic;">potential </span>success the man can achieve.</strong></span> Obviously, it doesn't mean the man could definitely do well in life, it simply suggest the potential success of a man. Because of that, this man exuded alot of security on his part AND women, being highly affected by the investment theory, usually consider alot of security on her part to make the commitment affair (Especially Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn).<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Also, why woman prefer guys who are average joe-looking (or even worse)?<br><br>Security; of all levels. (Inferior woman never feel good about themselves; they feel that they are too fat, single eye-lid, small cup size, etc. This 'security' effect is triggered and they fear that having good-looking bf is emotionally taxing through jealousy, fear of losing them to a third party, etc).<br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Obviously there are things more important than the above examples. In very simple terms, it is your personal attributes that score points for the relationship, or at least the love/respect for you. However, this is <strong>heavily moderated</strong> by her own preception of what's important to her. E.g. If you have a woman that needs the constant loves-showering, to satisfy this emotional needs is more important than say qualification. (Especially Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces). Another example would be, if your woman rank material needs as first priority, being able to bring good income serve more sense than say being a SNAG boyfriend.<br><br>In CloUdiSm, this is phenomenon is called Suitability - something I often stress on, about looking at the same direction and not at each other in love. In Marketing, we talk about satisfying your customers needs; in relationship we talk about the same needs to be satisfied mutually.<br><br>You can actually turn this negative situation into a powerful positive force that could drive you into trying to excel in your life. Love can be the motivator, however, if it causes you to fail your relationship for any reasons, FAILURE retains that memory painfully stronger and deeper.<br><br>P.S: Banish your sense of despair. If you have the drive to strive and work towards your career, that's the best cert you could have. We call those thingy 'Shang Jing Xing.'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
