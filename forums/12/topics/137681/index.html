            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br>Really feel sorry for you. What Ican say now is that you have to move on not beause of her but for yourself. I am a working adult, qualification is very important in Opening doors to opportunities. The rest lies with how much knowledge do you want to acquire from the company. Your wealth will build up with the experiences as well as future job opportunities and undertakings.<br><br>btw, i was dumped too cos I cant bring fun to my ex. I was dumped while I was progressing with my course in a local poly, I suffered terribly too.  If she is good, she should have assist and support you all the way towards your goal, be it diploma or even degree and not simply give such r/s up. sorry, just my opinion,<br>I strongly feel that anyone on earth can look down on you but our girlfriend should not do so unless in the first place, you dont even want to further on your studies.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm 25 this year. and she feel that at my age. I didn't achieve anything at all. yeah.. i did wasted some of my time and money. My dad gave me some money to further my studies about a year ago.. however, my best buddy got some financial problem and need money for his mum's operation. yes, out of desperation, he come and borrow from me and it's a large sum of money. i didn't think so much and just lend him the money because i don't wanna have any guilt if there's anything happen to his mum. i even kept the truth from my parents because the money is meant for my studies. I always feel that success isn't measured by qualification.. it's about hard work, good planning and a little bit of luck. And i decided to set up a small business with a friend, however it don't really goes well because of wrong choices for the locations. we didn't cover back our capital and even had some debts.. yes, in other words, I'm broke.. And it took me some time to clear my debts and finally have the money for my further studies now.. and all her friends are the same.. just kinda look down on ppl. sometimes in their conversation, they would just talk about" oh, aiyo... why she still with that guy, the guy also no qualification at all, and still be with him for 2 years. she don't know how to think ah". well, few days ago, i went mad and i just told my ex that all of them really look down on me.. Haha.. she only said" no.. they never know down on me at all" yeah.. maybe who knows. ad she said her friends don't  really look down on ppl.. just that they are just being realistic.. what crap is that. being realistic doesn't give you the rights to said about other ppl.. yeah.. so what if her friend's bf doesn't have any qualification.. but can't they see they are happy together if not they wouldn't be together for 2 years and still going strong.<br>I guess most of you are right.. it really sucks living in Singapore, i mean no offence to gals, but i just feel that the younger generation are really materialistic, they just want to have good life and always want someone who's rich and have a car. yeah.. I know not all of them are materialistic, maybe i just happened to know a bunch of them..</div>
