            <div class='col-md body'>In the first place, since she's already attached, you shouldn't even be tacitly wooing her, much less doing it aggressively.<br><br>I guess she got the idea that you like her. However, since she's already attached and has feelings for someone else, she doesn't want to give you the wrong ideas and is giving you the cold shoulder.<br><br>My advice to you: stop pursuing her, whether it is aggresively or in a subtle manner.<br><br>I can tell you one thing is for sure: you'll end up hurting a lot of people if you do manage to steal her from her boyfriend.<br><br>Yes, that's what you're doing: you're stealing her away from someone else. You're gonna hurt the guy, you're gonna hurt the girl when she realises that she hurt someone else, and if you have a conscience, you're gonna feel hurt knowing that you had hurt other people.<br><br>So be the nice guy and back off from her.<br><br>Just appreciate her as a friend; that is something special in itself.</div>

It could be just that your friend likes her as a friend while the girl wants to get something more out of it.<br><br>If that's the case, your friend cannot be considered as an active third party. Then he's just an unwilling third party - someone who doesn't want to get in the way of the relationships of others but somehow did so unintentionally.<br><br>I think it's more of the intentions which determine whether or not a third party is guilty. If your friend isn't aggressively pursuing the girl (unlike the case of this entire thread), then he hasn't done anything wrong and has nothing to feel ashamed about.<br><br>I have no advice for your friend except to just continue treating her as a friend. There is nothing wrong in a friendship with a girl, and it is indeed something to be cherished.<br><br>But if your friend is indeed pursuing the girl actively, then just tell him two words: BACK OFF.</div>
