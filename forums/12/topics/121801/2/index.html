You could try asking her close friends or something. If she does, then back off. If she doesn't then well, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> you're free to chase her, but if she starts avoiding you it might be a sign that you should tone it down a little.</div>

Let me quote from it:<br><br><blockquote>this girl i like <strong>already got a bf.</strong> </blockquote>So we gave suitable advice accordingly.<br><br>Now you tell us that you're not sure whether she has a bf. To be brutally frank with you, you can't really expect others to help you when you keep flip-flopping on your facts. Be perfectly straight with us, and we'll do our best to help.<br><br>That said, just go and ask her once and for all whether or not she's attached.<br><br>If she's not attached, then there's no issue. You can happily chase her all you want, and we can close this thread for good.<br><br>If she is indeed attached, just follow the advice everyone has been telling you: back off.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if she is available, then u can try to woo her. but if u can try sound her out first weather u got chance or not first. she may treasure the friendship more then a relationship (like wat some guys do). so if she just wanna stay as friends, just stay as friends and wait till she wants to get attached then u can try ur luck again or at the same time look for other babe.</div>

I tink u knw wat 2 do, but always remember tis, Gals dun like guys 2 try 2 hard. It will onli irritate them more. CHEERZ</div></blockquote>sorry i had to quote on this, this is easier SAID than DONE. and it takes a lot out of the head. ur better off not thinking too much about u and her. my advice is dun give out ur heart on a silver platter. and ya... trying too hard? better not try at all if u dun want to get urself hurt. to quote from yoda: do or do not there is no try. in this case u shudn push it or ull ruin it.</div>
