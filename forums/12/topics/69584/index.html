I don't know. but what i do know is that generally, the new generation is pretty okay with it. the two tourists did raise a few eyebrows but its not as if they were stoned to death by an anti nude mob.<br><br>all i'm asking is. are we ready to accept nudity?<br>what are the social implications if the govt does allocate a certain area for it?<br></div>

Janet Jackson's stunt was deplored and condemned NOT BECAUSE SHE BARED HER BOOB. but rather the low level to which she stooped to attract attention to her already failing career.<br><br>it is NOT common sense that one should possess blahblahblah whatever u said as a result of Janet's stunt.<br><br>i don't think u understand at all what we are all talking about. even sgboy does.. u should be ashamed of yourself. IF the government dedicates a secluded beach for nude sunbathers, people who feel offended by nudity would not go there in the first place. If such people actually visit this nude beach, then they have nothing to complain about as they were told before hand it is a nude beach and should expect nudity therefore havin no reason to feel offended.<br><br>but sadly i have to agree with you there is no point trying to convince you as you don't really read into things. TSK ppl gettin offended by Janet's stunt just because they saw her boob. its people like you that would try to sue her if possible.</div>
