            <div class='col-md body'>Okie, juz my 2 cents' worth.<br><br>Opening up of a nudist beach MAY present problems like increased procreation/copulation, but altho it might lead to increased #s of single mums, our system actually has in a place a gd way to counter tt problem -- lack of financial help or welfare pkgs for single mums.<br><br>In the United States &amp; Australia, there is the dole/welfare sys, so single mums dun need to work, &amp; can simply collect a cheque for their daily expenses.  In SG, single mums rely on family aid.<br><br>Wat I wld like to see, tho, is increased education abt sex &amp; the repercussions of casual sex or sex between 2 pple who're Not mature enuff to think of the consequences.  Sex, is still v. much taboo in SG, as is nudity.<br><br>Perhaps wif better sex edu programmes, the opening of a nudist beach wldn't generate so much hoohaa.

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree wif wat u sez'd, but juz wanna discuss 1 pt...<br><br>If those naked babes wanna strip down naked, then they shd've No problem being byo'd, rite? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Personally, I dun think it's abt whether SGreans r ready to accept nudity.  It's whether they wanna accept it or Not, there's No right &amp; No wrong.<br><br>Caucasians r more exhibitionist, perhaps, &amp; they haf No problem wif sexuality, &amp; the flaunting of sexuality.  Asians, r more reserved, they're more modest, altho nowadays we see SGrean girls strutting down the street in more revealing clothing than sez, 10 yrs back.  I remember when I was 16, we were in tees, @ most tanks &amp; spaghetti straps.  Now, teens r sauntering down O'Shard in tube tops &amp; halternecks.<br><br>But No matter wat, I think the SGrean babes may still choose NOT to strip down naked in front of pple.  Bikinis r 1 thg, nudity is another.  I haf No problem wif looking @ naked pple, but I wldn't strip down to Nothg, simply cosh I dowan to.<br><br>Mebbi the qn doesn't boil down to whether SGreans r ready, but r we exhibitionists, do we mind flaunting our sexuality?  There brings in www's post abt culture.  It is linked to the mindset of Asians &amp; Caucasians.  I noe the pple in Hawaii wldn't think of walking down without a bra on the streets, even tho this is still the United States.<br><br>Juz as Caucasians r open abt the flaunting of naked bodies &amp; sexuality, so r Asians reserved on this subj.  It's perhaps, more an issue of preferance? : )<br><br>Wat I noe is, after living in Melb &amp; Hawaii, I've come to respect &amp; love the Asian mentality.  A naked body is beautiful, but I'd rather let someone special appreciate mine : )<br><br>RP<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Devil1976:</div><div class="quote_body">But things ain't usually that straightforward. 1st expectation we get is that we'll probably be seeing Ah Peks there...

Then the foreign workers who walk around just to bio the naked babes... The locals would start to complain about them... To think who started off such an avenue in the 1st place? But of course, people's intention for starting off such a place  or beach would probably not be solely for the hungry eyes of others... But talk about 'intentions', what's to stop them? Would that promote the increase of crime rates? Molest? Rapes? Social problems...<br><br>Some things might or might not push for more effects... It might be so directly doing so...

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Farmer Brown:<br><strong><br><br>i did think of that before..here's my solution. in fact. i already mentioned the solution before, its double edged u see:<br><br>OPEN A NUDIST BEACH<br><br>see.. <span style="color: blue;">if people are willing to bare all, then they wouldn't mind if people are staring be it the young cute caucasian or the old cheekopek over there.</span> besides if it was a nudist beach, either u go there to really be nude or to bio. the difference is very obvious as those who go to bio are really there to bio and not really ready to go out in the buff.</strong><br><br>I've come to realise that this is the general belief, but somehow I have to add that this might not always be the true case. Commonly, there're some people who show off their body just to get the attention of certain group(s) of people... (eg. pretty girls, hunks, rich &amp; wealthy...) Just like if a guy is there to show off his muscular body on the beach doesn't certainly mean he would welcome the hungry eyes of gays too?<br><br><strong><br>anyway, here's my take on it. i dun forsee the govt ever opening a nude beach as it has no economical benefits.</strong><br><br>This I would very much agree....<br><br><strong><br>How would a nude beach actually benefit the state, well firstly as a tourist attraction. Promoting a liberal and open image of singapore to the world, showing the world that our government is liberal and willing to accept ideas.</strong><br><br>This ain't much of a problem. I think Singapore being a more 'kiasu' country and also ASIAN country definitely would have to be reminded of its 'position' from time to time as highlighted by www. As much as you like a 'break through', sometimes it's just difficult for you to dismiss everything and pretend that they're not there.<br><br>I believe though the thought of 'liberating' Singapore and attracting tourist might be attractive to the government... Our government is still much on the 'conservative' side on certain things... (which though some might disagree, I personally finds that it might not be such a bad thing?) Our government is more on the 'assurative' side... Usually when they do things, they want it to WORK... Or if not, at least they have nothing much to loose.. Singapore is a SMALL country... Any (small?) 'mistake' made might just as easily SNOWBALLED into a BIG one.... Hence the need for 'conservative moves'....<br><br>And talking about being an Asian country... Whatever we do would have effects on how we'll be judged, ie... Plus and minus I should say... Much factors to be throughly discussed here...<br><br><strong><br>but the downside of this argument outweighs the plusses of this argument. as devil has mentioned, socially we would present more problems to the people in singapore. opening the minds of the youth is like opening pandora's box, encouraging them to explore their sexuality, though it is already happening, this mindset would definitely become more widespread and we would have many more young couples or single teenaged moms or higher abortion rates blah blah blah. <span style="color: blue;">(hey maybe that's the solution to encourage singaporeans to make babies hahahaha)</span></strong><br><br>Look at the case of Africa? Singapore government wants 'quality' too... Not just unwanted babies on the streets...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></blockquote></div>
