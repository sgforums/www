You should discover by now that by itself and only itself, sense of responsibility is kinda bullsh|t - you can't retain a person's feeling through morals and ethics. Love is spiritual, it bypass through whatever mental barrier you impose on yourself.<br><br>You have three choice<br><br>(I) to continue your relationship and suffer through being with someone you have little love with.<br><br>(II) To give up present gf and pursue potential relationship<br><br>(III) Opt for two timing.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Among all these choices, (III) is totally out of question IF you want to get out of your mess, because it will implicate your situation.  You can decide about (I) or (II). Lets go through it slowly then.<br><br>What if you stay in the relationship? It is possible as a decision - however, its not about just remaining and that's it. Attempts has to be made to rectify the issues in your relationship (possessiveness, lack of trust, etc) and tons of communication with your gf. Conclusion, acceptance and lines must be drawn. It is the 'harder' option as expanding effort to REBUILD relationship is NEVER easy. But it can be very rewarding at the end of the day, if things work out. Afterall, what makes you think S defintely likes you the way you do (even though its likely) or things will be better? And even if it doesn't work out - bottomline is that <strong>you did what you can</strong>, instead of running away. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>(II) Option? My version of this decision is not to ship-hop at first sight of opportunity. Probably you already did what you can in the relationship already; maybe the aftermath of choosing decision (I) - then if the relationship were to vanish - do not jump into another boat of love straight away. You may want to clear up some emotional turmoils and mental issues away first. This will probably take up to 1 - 3 months. Take this time to get to know S better as well - <strong>don't</strong> talk about feelings with her. Just know as a causal friend. Because if you do, chances are, you both will be together soon enough, together all these undissolve matters in yourself and it will bring about greater problems. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Life is about decision making - everyone is doing it everyday. What matters is that the decision you make, will not bring about greater issues to settle in the future. You should be rational to think long term and the possible complication that could occur. Use all this time now.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not because of differences that you leave a relationship for another, because in any r/s there will be differences... there' no such thing as a perfect match without ironing out the rough edges. I'm also pretty sure, from time to time, our parents argue too.. it's inevitable.<br><br>Furthermore, it's usually when things turn sour in a r/s one will look for interests in other place, and may mistake the curiosity in finding out more about a person to be a liking for that person, which unfortuantely, is usually the case in many situations.<br><br>However, I'm not a person who agrees with possessiveness... as it doesn't mean knowing your every movement is trust. In fact, there's nothing for a guy to go out with a girl alone or vice versa, as long as you for sure know that you're going out as a friend and nothing more. Like you don't going out with a girl, thinking you can woo her. In addition, I do support that people should have a life of their own, during a r/s or marriage.</div>

For your current relationship with your gf, how long have it been? If you feel that things don't work out between you and your gf, you should let her know about in one way or another? (unless you intend to just keep things that way and you're contented with it...?) Responsibility is a factor in a relationship. But 'Responsibility' usually shouldn't be the MAIN reason for a relationship. Especially for a BGR, it can be a rather WEAK result. BGR is usually with chosen partner and not inborn ones as in family relationship or business relationship (though not inborn) where you sometimes have little choices. BEFORE anything with 'S', I'll advise you to figure out what's going on with your current relationship 1st... The reason(s) for both of you to be together in the 1st place should be reviewed...<br><br>Then come 'S'. Should only be that close after you resolves the ongoings of your current relationship (unless you don't mind of being accused as double-timing)... Should be a new start if your current relationship is to end? Don't make too much spectaculations... Just go with the flow...</div>
