            <div class='col-md body'>I think it boils down to 2 issues.<br><br><strong>Morality </strong>and <strong>Temptation</strong>.<br><br>IF you hold on to your morals strongly enough, there will not be a problem. Never.<br><br>Except when temptation comes knocking, some people falter, and eventually end up cheating. (Like someone said, who can resist two chio bu's who knock on your door?)<br><br>Yet even with high morals, we are put into the test when we're sorely tempted.<br><br>What we need is for those husband-grubbers to keep their hands to themselves, and cheating will take a dramatically low downturn.<br><br>Hmm, perhaps there's a 3rd issue of being too promisculus(how do i spell this?). Especially true when you're working in a foreign country, and you cannot meet your wife often. For people who are weak in morals, and are easily tempted... *bang* Cheating begins.<br><br>~~</div>
