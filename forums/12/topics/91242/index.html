Unless that is what you want?<br><br>At least know what you want before you start on anything... A movement without direction is just a motion...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You should go out with both, ofcourse not together. But date them each. Because one of them is BOUND to piss you off by being a rotten egg, so then when you know them better you can choose. Same thing for guys, keep your options open.</div>

I repeat - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">there are NO win-win solution here</span>, so you can forget about trying to maintain the best of both world and keep everyone happy. Your situation only promises an eventual hurt to either one, two or three parties and it is up to you to make that choice ultimately.<br><br>You stall because you are unable to make the decision regarding the birth of a relationship and waits for them to pop out the question. But seriously, do not be led by the nose and be fooled in thinking that since you loved the both of them - either one of them doesn't matter. <strong>In fact, it does matter</strong>. We are given freewill in relationship and that allows us to make a decent choice. Do not sit back and let circumstances lead the way. You will NOT prepared for what is going to throw into your path and would be slaughtered by how quick pace and vicious this possible triangle is.<br><br>Since the feelings about mutual and about the same - check suitability and compatiability. Everyone is DIFFERENT in this aspect and from there, you know which one is better for you together in a relationship. Of course, only if you are on for a serious relationship (this is not applicable if you are NOT looking for a serious relationship) - for the two of them will likely to fall out (Or at least reduce one level of friendship with to one another) because of this.<br><br>Drop both if you feel neither of them suits you. Remember, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you don't neccessary have to make a choice between the two of them. </span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
