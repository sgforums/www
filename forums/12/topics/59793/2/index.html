            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>First of all, I can understand your feelings. The feelings of loving someone so deeply and realise that the two of you cannot be together. But deep in your heart, you are still not willing to give up.<br>You are hopping that there might still be a chance, even if it's once in a million chance and you are willing to wait for it. To me, I feel that you are waiting for a miracle although you are trying to tell yourself that you are not.<br><br>I have been through it myself. A girl whom I have love deeply for the past 9 years. Same as you, whenever she quarreled with her bf, she will tell me about it and I always stand by her. She will also tell me how she shares the happiness moments with her bf. It's her first bf and they are already together eversince they are in their teens. All this ended after one incident which is 3 years ago. She quarreled again with her bf and as per usual, she confide in me. But this time, it's different. She became very close to me and we can chat daily for at least 4 hours. But in my heart, I know that I am just a good friend since she haven't left her bf officially. But yet, we are so close.<br><br>Only until one day while we are chatting over the phone, I realise that she still loves her bf and I also realise that it is unfair for her if I take advantage of this situation since she is not totally clear in her mind. It's really hard for me to come out with a decision since I have been waiting for 7 years for this moment. But eventually, I voiced out that we should stop all this. And I am really cruel to her that night. She just wants to find a good friend to confide in her problem and yet, I crushed it. Only after the incident, she told me that she is actually considering to give up her bf and be with me. But what I did has made her hold back all her consideration.<br><br>I really suffer and bleed in my heart even until now. But I know that situations might not be any different even if I hold on to her and without crushing her hopes that night. She might still go back to her bf after she clear her thoughts and I still, will just remain as a good friend. I really hate myself that night for not able to hold on to her even as a good friend. Do I love her deep enough? The answer is Yes. But why did I crush her hopes that night if I truely loves her? The answer is because by loving her so deeply, I really don't want to be unfair to her. I do not want to take advantage of her emotions and be unfair to her bf as well since I can sense that they loves each other deeply. And I choose to suffer myself.<br><br>Although after the incident, which happens three years ago, I try to win back her heart after her emotions are much clearer. But I failed again and again. Until this year, I realise that they are no longer together but our relationship are also different now. She doesn't confide in me anymore. I know I cannot blame anyone since it's me who failed to hold on to her.<br><br>To me, I find that at least she can still confide in you, you should be happy. At least she is still willing to chat with you and share her happy moments with you. I know the feeling is painful having to listen to her happy moments with her bf. But please stand by her and just be her friend. At least try to be just her friend. If there are times when you cannot control your emotions, just let go for a while and give yourself a break without contacting her. She will appreciate you. Love cannot be force. If she loves you, she will love you. If she doesn't, no matter how hard you try, she will just be grateful to you.<br><br>Grateful is definitely not love.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To darrendon,<br><br>I have to admit that the feelings that I have may be similiar to those that you have for the girl you have mentioned..but the situation between us may slightly differ in ways where I might have been more fortunate than you in that I was at least her bf (or so I thought) for a short period of time. However, I find that it is more unbearable because everything seem to happen so suddenly when nothing seems to be wrong..and I lost her just like that..I have tried to be the best bf she could've ever asked for...but I guess we were just not meant to be..<br><br>When we were together..she told me that her bf does not really treat her really well...and I told her that I promised with all my heart that I would shower her with all the affection that my heart could muster..and I did just that (I hope...) She was really happy then..I was too in seventh heaven..but somehow...somethings just happen when they are meant to...<br><br>The past few days have been really busy for me..work..studies..I was really immersed in all the workload but there are always times in between when my thoughts turn to her..I told myself that I should really try to forget the feelings for her...but I know deep in my heart that I still could not let go of her...I know that when you love someone..you should learn to let them go when the times come..I tried...I did tried my very best..but it just didn't work..it was as if I was just lying to myself that I do not care about her anymore..but I do care for her...<br>The nights that I spend hugging her close and telling her that everything's going to be alright when she's not feeling happy..the way I felt when she held on to my arm..during those moments..I wished with all my heart that Time would stopped forever there and then..all this images of her keep coming back to me again and again..I could swear to the heavens above that no one could have loved her the way I love her right now...and I really do love her..<br><br>Sometimes when I felt that I have finally got rid of her from my mind..thoughts of her then come back as strongly as before..and in the end I really do not know what I should do..I know that there's no way for us to be together..since Love can never be forced on to someone..Maybe that's what making it so unberable..like you said I am sure you understand how it feels to love some so much...that nothing else matters in the world except for her...<br><br>She used to tell me that I am much more luckier than others in terms of studying abroad and other stuffs...and that people would have wished for all the things that I possess...but I wanted to let her know that I would have given up everything in this world...everything that other people wished for..if I could just be with her again...none of the things would matter to me...You might think it's very immatured of me to think that way...but that's how I feel right now...*sighs* I have been in relationships before..but I have only felt this way twice...the first was my first love...and now her...I can't help it but my heart just cries out for her day and night...<br><br>I do not want to lie to myself anymore...I am so tired of telling myself that I do not care for her anymore when I do indeed...I just love her so much it hurts...*sighs*<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Some people say the worst way to miss someone is when they are right next to you and you know you can't have them, but it's worse when you thought you didn't want them anymore and then all of a sudden you realize you can't live without them...</div>
