In the begining, you story is just the early plot for the real action and effect to take root later.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You are there for her during the second phrase you both met; for you are a temporary source of shelter towards her problematic relationship. This is definitely not love. Her claims is not accurately rational and stability emotions basis - rather its during her confusions stage.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>When you are there for someone you love and care (be it whether gf/bf or a good friend) - is there a need to expect anything in return? When you have been there for her and because you care - you should do it in good faith, because volunteering is self-sacrificial and not commercialized for returns. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Yes, I understand you her words truely led you on; she mentioned that she loved you. Well, all I can say is she made her ultimate decision and its her bf, in the first place, what status and position do you have to compete with him? Even if there is no consideration made, chances are, she will go back to him. Understand that you will be going aboard to study, your stay here is merely a holiday - LDR is a nono as well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Well, at least you had your beautiful moments with the lady you loved alot, but do not have the fortune to be with her - there are lots of people out there who <strong>don't even have </strong>half of your luck. If you had a choice - would you rather to undergo a beautiful dream and learn about the bitter truth, or never to experience anything and continue life as normal, like a calm wave? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey bro , honestly speaking from my own experience similar to yours it took me 3 years to really forget about it and till now the hurt has not gone away, but i managed to put it aside somewhere in my heart n moved on. Trust me as long as you do not see her often, you will eventually forget. dun remind urself of her by seeing photos n stuff , eventually your thoughts of her wll go away too. People are like buildings, once the building is demolished , people tend to forget it ever existed. Hope you get what i mean.</div>

I am doing a medical related course and it is a busy course in itself..but let me tell you something...have you ever had one moment when you are so caught up in your work...so busy doing your projects and stuff...when that little quiet moment suddenly presents itself..you're sitting on your desk..reading your notes..worrying about the work load ...and then your mind goes blank and you think of nothing but that one special person in your heart...how much it hurts..I really can't explain in words...maybe some of you out there know how it feels...<br><br>Time, you say? Does time really make one forget the one special person in their hearts? I tried..I really did tried...but when you love someone as much as I do (I'm not saying you did not)...trust me...it's easier said than done...<br><br>I really am very happy to see how happy she is whenever she tells me about her happy moments she had with her bf...but at the same time..I can't help but feel the pain inside...how can you even feel both happiness and sadness at the same time...? *Sighs* =(<br><br>"Sorry, I don't take love so lightly,<br>sorry, I can't say let's just be friends;<br>I apologize to you politely, but true love just never ends."</div></blockquote>Why must you focus your good memories into complete forgetting when in actual fact if your nature was generous enough, you could retain it as sweet memories? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>I have never ever in my 4 years expected us to get so close like we did....</blockquote>You said this yourself - so do you think the experience is worth forgetting? If you wanna forget this person successfully, you have to forget every single incident that took place relating to her. Can you? Nope, you can't - then forget about trying. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: There is no such thing as 'love too much cannot be friends' - its between keeping on open mind with generous nature, or narrow mind with superficial love. You will be fine alright? I wish you well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To <strong>GOiN^CrAzY^SooN</strong>,<br><br>I would say I have to agree with Yun on a large part for this one... In fact, I think his interpretation is quite well-written... Except for some smaller parts which I couldn't yet be so sure to agree upon...<br><br>Anyway, I feel that you're still very much 'trapped' within yourself? Hereby, I would just like to add a few words... Very much of it would be just a 'guess' from my own point of view... They don't necessarily have to reflect the truth and reality....<br><br>It occurs to me that your love for her is SO DEEP that it's almost UNBEARABLE to put yourself only as a friend to her... On the other hand, it seems that she's suggesting just that... As a person if her love for you is as deep... She probably won't be able to bring upon such a decision too... Then again, she MIGHT? Depending on her character...? Though I must say chances are quite unlikely... And your simply refusing to give up on this love... SHE - what you've always wanted... Makes me think... What she THINKS of you? And the fact that she've got a relationship... You don't... Her continuation of a 'more than friends' relatoinship would risk her own relationship with her current bf... You've got nothing to put to risk if you just go after her... (Well... At least not in a direct concrete sense...?)<br><br>Quarrels among couples... Not unusual now... Are they? Because the problem(s) she was facing with her bf... Because of the things you've told her... About how you feel for her.... You've either or indirectly offered yourself as a 'choice'. A 'choice' in which she probably thought in fulfilling it, would satisfy BOTH of you... At least for that moment...?<br><br><strong>Question.</strong> If given a CHOICE, would you rather she gave you a chance and have a taste of how it's like to be with her (like what she did) OR you rather remain a DISTANT 'alien' to her for the rest of your life?<br><br>Admittedly, at this point I do not know nothing about the character of this girl of yours. Whatever's the actual reason she 'let you in' during that period of time can be VAST... POSSIBILITY of Reason vs Character puts it on HIGH CHANCE under appropriate conditions...<br><br>Whatever happened had happened... Whatever she did... Whatever she wish you could understand and forget.... It's time to move on... From my point of view, you've probably be considered quite a 'lucky' man...? Well... But of course, you can make it a miserable turn out if you want to...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To all of you (and I thank you for your replies for although we are strangers you took time to pen down a few words),<br><br>I have been thinking a lot for the past few days on what I should or should not do...Yes..Unfortunately I have to agree on what most of you have written down..as Devil1976 has said..I too agree with what Yun has said...I might have been too caught up in myself to actually think of the right and wrong of my feelings...and that those times I had with her could have been sweeter memories box-ed up somewhere within my heart...<br><br>I know what most of you are thinking of telling me...things like moving on...well I've done that once...and I did think that I would be able to do it again...To tell you the truth, I was almost as hurt as I am now when I lost my first love...during a six month period after my break-up with my first...I cried almost every week (Think of me as weak, if you like) but then I came to meet this girl that I am talking about...I never did thought anybody could have made me forget about my first...but she did...somehow...she made me realised that out there....there's someone as wonderful...maybe even more...she was the one that brought me out of the dark when I thought everything seems to be going wrong for me...<br><br>To me, I thought that forgetting her would be easy since we are so far apart and her bf will be coming back to her from overseas too...I thought of giving up and getting on with my life...I thought of remembering her as being a wonderful part of my life...I have thought of all that you have said...but somehow...there's that little part of me that doesn't want to give it all up...there's that little part of me that still wants to wait...I don't know for how long...but I did tell her that even if it takes a month, a year or maybe more...I wouldn't give it up so easily...<br><br>Yes, I know she might have somehow rushed into the relationship with me...and that she was having problems with her bf and somehow sought me out as a "substitute"...but I did too tell her that I do not want to hear her say she loves me unless she really means it...and she did...What I do not understand is how she is able to throw away everything that we have and not even give me a chance to make it up...but you see...I do not think I have done anything wrong...all I have ever wanted...all I have ever wished for is to just spend some time with her before I left...<br><br>Before I wrote this, I have again thought about really trying to get back on track with my life...and then she called...again, everything doesn't seem to matter anymore...all the hurt that I felt...all those night when I lay awake thinking about her...all that seems to feel so right...we started talking again...she told how excited she was that her bf is coming back...I am hurting...yes indeed...but I was happy she called...<br><br>I think I might have fallen...fallen too deep when I shouldn't have in the first place...I do feel pain and sorrow...but whenever "clips" of moments that we spent together sprung into my mind...I can't help but remember how sweet she looks in the white dress I bought for her...or how cute she eats her ice-cream...How can I ever bring myself to forget such wonderful moments of my life?<br><br>"You taught me how to love;<br>you taught me how to live;<br>you taught me how to laugh;<br>you taught me how to cry,<br>but when you left,<br>you forgot to teach me how to forget you."</div>
