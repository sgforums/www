I am also a whiner what! I dare to admit cos AA is the place that makes me recover from my wound. Without AA, i think i wouldn't have learned so much about r/s and how ladies think.<br><br>It is HUMAN NATURE TO overstate ur problem and understate others' problem. Everywhere is like that to be frank, in politics, in r/s, in friendship, in jobs etc....<br><br>Love, by itself, has no right or wrong answer. U can never justify who is more at fault than others, simply because this is the price u need to pay for going into a r/s. Love is sweet and bitter and there are many factors that govern the success of a r/s... don't be so simple-minded to call people whinner because u never how much effort one has placed in to a r/s and ended up failing.</div>
