            <div class='col-md body'>Well,me n my ex had been going out for 6 months. I noe teenage relationships dun last but anyway, 4 the last 5 months we were happy together but it was at the 6th month that problem arose. My ex had juz completed his N'Levels so he was working. Now here's the problem. In my heart, it was as if all feelings had died inside me. I suddenly felt very sad,very tired and u can also sense the strain in my ex's voice i dunno due to work or wat ( he's working in the banquet section of Hotel Intercontinental, so the hours r like kinda irregular due to the shifts they r assigned to ).But at last one night, an e-mail came from my ex stating that he wanted to break up wif me due to his work and that he cant stand the pressure of having to worry bout me and stuff.<br><br>But now after the break-up,we do go out occasionally wif other frens but he does things that does not tell me we r juz normal frens. And my trusted frens told me that my ex still likes me after being asked by frens. Well, i dunno how true that is, but i juz want to get over my ex n get on wif life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello yolanda_tan,<br><br>Like you, I am also in the same situation now. I just broke off with my ex recently, about 2 weeks ago. Sometimes, when flashes of memories start coming back, it is very painful to fight back the fact that I still really can't get over him and I still miss him alot. I have this feeling esp at night or when I am alone, my mind starts to wonder and thoughts of the past keep coming back. Memories of the things we did together, the places we went to and the words he said to me. Whenever I thought of this, I cry. During the first few nights after our breakup, I practically cried myself to sleep. Luckily I have this group of friends who are very supporting. They console and comfort me. They are there for me when I need them. I also try keeping myself busy with my work in order not to think of him.<br><br>yolanda_tan, do the things that you like and feel happy about. Go out with your friends and enjoy their company. Spend some time with your family. Just keep yourself occupied and move on with your life. If you and him are meant to be together, it will be. I believe whatever will be will be. No point in forcing things to happen. They will come when the time arrives. I have learnt to take things easy and accept it as it is. I try to move on with my life. Only when you move on, then you can get over.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>All the best to you. Hope one day you and me can get over our exs and move on with our lives as happily as before.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>Where is LOVE? Help me find it.  :p<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yolanda: i've got a question to ask u, if not a few......<br>what do u mean by getting over ur ex? as in forgetting him (physically) totally, or as in erasing the memories of u being with him? or do u mean just basically getting rid of feelings u have for him?<br><br>one thing for sure, memories will always be there. u can't erase it away, u can only store it someplace deep within the mind. u can try pushing it deep down within that pit, but somehow, (i realised) it will always come back someday. tt's y it's called memory........recalling and remembering those memories (bittersweet) will no doubt bring some amount of hurt (reminded tt u lost him) to u, but it's inevident. looking back, i assure u tt u will smile at those memories u had........=)<br><br>forgetting/getting over those feelings are the hard part...but i guess, like they say, time can heal everything. mebbe not totally everything, but it can make u sort of feel numb bout the whole thing......<br><br>anywayz, to forget ur ex (physically), (it worked for me, albeit being seemingly mean n heartless) stop all forms of contact with him.....until the day tt u're sure tt u've gotten over ur feelings for him....<br><br>hope the crap i've said helps, thou' i think it won't. =)) hee~</div>

It can be teachers or een seniors. BE i girl orguy, there will definitely be someone. Coz we are all emotional creatures. For instance, aguy open a door for a girl, chances is that the guy will have a 2nd look from the girl. To a teenager it might be her first time experiencing this kind of treatment, and might be infatuating over that guy about it.<br><br>It's feelings and I have said it cannot be controled. When u feel sad I'm sure u cannot luff at anyone's joke also rite?? U might be annoyed by a group of frens who are luffing over the joke ard u rite?? and might even turn to shout at them...<br><br>I'm sorry that I'm a little harsh here, and I think u have the 'trying-to-have-fun' attitude here for this post.. But becoz yolanda might get a little upset upon hearing ur post. I'm really sorry about the harsh words.<br><br>Yolanda: how r things for u now?? Sorry I was away during the time when u posted this topic, so I did not chip in till now. But do tell us ow are things getting on for u. even if it hurts, we are here to share the pain... At least there will always be me...<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>
