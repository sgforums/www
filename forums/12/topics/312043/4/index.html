              <p>I thought all parents would want their children to be happy. So why would they oppose to someone their child like, even if that person is of a different skin color? (Not as if their partner is a criminal or something)</p>

              <p>If your child was dating a boy/girl of a different skin

              <p>let’s say if the boy is Indian skinned, but more Chinese than
              Indian as he’s mixed blooded, would you judge him by his skin
              color?</p>
              <p>Or would you bother to find out more before discriminating?</p>
              <p>True, SG is multi racial, but that doesn’t mean traditional
              parents would still react strongly against differently colored
              people.</p>

              <p>heh my mom was not happy when I was seeing an iranian because she thinks that he will take me to iran and she will never see me again. She freaked out when she found out that I was dating a saudi arab. She boiled my clothing when I was dating an american guy because she thinks americans are not very clean. She was ok with my ex boyfriend who is a australian jew (by ethnicity - mom is israeli)  except she grumbles alot now because I stopped eating pork. Only problem , his mom doesn't like me because I am not a jew. My mom  thank the stars that I am seeing one romanian guy except now MY DAD is of the opinion that romanians are slick conmen. She hates it when I go out with a mexican but is ok if he is brazilian.</p>
              <p>So I think I can forget about getting married with the rate of parental disapproval. It is way too complicated.</p>
