I suppose to meet buddy, sometimes 1 hour later call him still at home...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  The worst record he set was 3 hours later after appointment time just woke up...<br><br>You can try setting an earlier meeting time for her or maybe just be there later than the appointed time (according to the time you estimate she'll be there... Well.. Maybe just a little earlier..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> )... If you're ON TARGET, solve the problem.. If you're late, she'll understand it certainly isn't very entertaining to be the party waiting...<br><br>The latest 'strategy' I've developed for my appointment meet ups is.... To keep myself OCCUPIED.... Meet at a place where you can shop around a bit... Read book(s)... Or do the things ya like to do... My time with gf is 'my time with gf'... If she rather let it slips away like, I'll just take it back as 'my own'...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

But however, if this is persist and you are rather disturb about it - plain simple talking is useless - you need some form of strategy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You could meet at 3 but tell her to meet at 2.30, OR give some form of punishment when she comes later than 10 minutes kind of thing. Simple things like a treat to sexual playfulness - exercise your creativity. Could use to build this relationship and perhaps 'reward' your waiting?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Of course, if things really pisses you badly - a heart to heart talk is essential. Its not just talking - its communicating with your emotions to one another. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
