Work on your communicaiton skills and anger management. You sound like a young punk/bull who thinks that to be a man is to be decisive and rash. WRONG WRONG WRONG.<br><br>In contrast to the other postings, I would not ditch the girl. Despite her tight schedule, she still makes time for you at the expense of family time. What's the point of asking her why she is still acting cold? What you need to do is on your part, figure out why you are so rash and work out a way to change your temperament. I can never understand mixing girlfriend with friends. Can't have quality time together if you have a third party around. Do something to cheer her up!</div>
