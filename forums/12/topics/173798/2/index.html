You kept apologizing and it makes your sorry very insignificiant (even when you may not be wrong).<br><br>The root of this conundrum may not be about forgiveness - she is reviewing your overall attitude and personality. She is acrimoniously cold towards you is because she is trying not to be emotionally connected to you as a trigger mechanism to protect her emotional realm.<br><br>She is thinking.<br><br>Very hard in fact.<br><br>About this guy, whom she loved, on his character and that his apology has no meaning to them because at the end of the day, history reiterates.<br><br>So... what are you going to do with yourself, first?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
