              <p>my "brother" is actually someone using a fake identity and i only found out recently..this is the story</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i lived with my mom since young and my dad went to a foreign country for business together with my younger brother and ended up living there for many years. the last time i saw my brother was when he was 6 before he left the country. my dad was an influential businessman who went abroad to manage his company as president, my brother went there to study and my dad hoped that one day he will take over the company..</p>
              <p>last year, my brother came back to server military service but i noticed something was very strange. i didn't see the brother i used to know so after much thought i engaged pi and background check. i then found out that he was actually a vietnamese chinese who pretended to be my brother for at least 5 years..maybe more. what is shocking is that he managed to come back to serve army!</p>
              <p>after paying a huge sum for detailed research, i then found out that he was actually the son of the vice president of my dad's company who tookover his position 5 years ago. 2 months before my "brother" came back, we received news that my dad passed away due to "suicide" and we travelled to attend his funeral. the vice president greeted us warmly and told us that he will support our family. we were so depressed and only wanted to reunite with my brother..</p>

              <p>because it all happened outside singapore, it was difficult to investigate and i spent a lot to engage special help. it turns out that my dad was killed and he did not suicide. my brother was also listed as a missing person in that country. i could not accept this and thought that the evil man could have killed both my dad and brother to take over the company. </p>
              <p>over the last 5 years, my mom and i never got a chance to meet them in person because my "dad" always told us he was busy. we only got to talk to "brother" over the phone ,who really tricked us inside out. it seemed that the duo had already planned for this very well, researching on our information so they knew everything about us.</p>
              <p>the murder actually happened 5 years ago and they somehow managed to cover it up. we lived our lives being cheated that dad was actually out there making money because he sent us money every month together with letters..but other than that we had no contact! this time, they faked the funeral because my brother was due for national service and they had no choice.</p>
              <p>it seemed so real and they even invited my dad's friends and i think they had bribed all of them to put out an act. upon further investigation, that man assumed my dad's position 5 years ago with the reason stated "death of existing president". we have no solid evidence that they killed dad but piecing up all the information, i am very sure that he did.</p>
              <p>my real brother might still be out there, or he might be killed together with dad 5 years ago. but i still do not understand he killed my dad and did not fake a story about my brother during that time. after checking with his high school, they said that he had attended school all the while..so the person who attended might be the fake vietnamese son instead of my brother. it all makes sense now because 5 years ago, that was when he enrolled with high school and the location is very far away from his previous school. they must have planned this all along..</p>

              <p>my family still owns many properties in singapore and other countries and that must be what they are doing all these for. that evil man, now the president of my dad's company had recently scheduled many "business" trips to singapore ever his my "brother" returned. i have a feeling that he might do something to me and my mom to take over my family's assets entirely. we are not sure how to handle this because he is a foreigner and i have only seen his picture before. </p>
              <p>i am extremely afraid because that man might have already planned a fake "sister" to replace me and his wife to replace my mom. that means he might have plans to kill us where we live. having said all that, we still have no conclusive evidence of his doings. our only hope is to find my real brother who must come back to bring him to justice. we prayed that my brother escaped at that time instead of being killed. 5 years ago, he was only 13 so the chances is very slim. </p>
              <p>do you think we can find him?</p>
