            <div class='col-md body'>All of us are flattered by attention. All of us are suspicious of people who declare their love for us before getting to know us. We assume that you have fallen in love with who you think we are and not who we really are. That delusion makes for a bad foundation to a relationship.<br><br>I agree with the above poster. You don't have to stop loving them but get to know the person. You don't want there to be a bad foundation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know as we become older, we become less trusting and more suspicious of people in our later stage of lives. In most cases, at least what i witness is that more ladies choose to fall back and get attached with guy friends in their primary, secondary, JC, poly/university friends because of the long years of bonding and trust in their guy friends.<br><br>For you, being a totally new stranger, she is freaking afraid of you because she does not know you. You could be a jerk or maybe you are.(just that you do not realize it yourself).<br><br>Please take things slow. I advocate NO MORE asking her out one-on-one. Organize a group date instead. Go ask a few other colleagues before you ask her out. Go out in a group date because in a group date, you will be yourself. There will also be less pressure, and more avenues for the girl to observe you.<br><br>Going on One-on-One date, is really a superficial date because both parties will be on pretence and be at their VERY BEST.</div>
