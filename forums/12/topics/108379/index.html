            <div class='col-md body'>Didn't know you posted here as well, i replied to you in Active response, but guess i'll reply here too.<br>_____<br><br>First of all, calm down and relax a bit. Being tensed up and nervous will not help in any way. Remember to paragraph too~<br><br>What a coincidence.. i'm 20 too.<br><br>Okay, to the real stuff.<br><br>So he said that he wouldn't regret it in the morning? Regret what? Not sleeping with you?<br><br>You're worried that you got drunk and kissed him? Don't worry, as someone who's 20 year older than you, and who has a family. Unless he's a total jerk, he'll know better than to pursue the incident, and will most likely forget about it.<br><br>Try pretending the thing never existed, and if it makes you feel better, stop flirting with him. Nothing happened after all. Don't worry too much, see what happens when you go back to work, and then tell us about it.<br><br>You'll be fine. Just remember to calm down. Take care!<br></div>
