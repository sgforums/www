Objecting their child from riding bike has nothing to do with single parent. In fact, almost every parent do not wish their child to ride a bike, esp in sg cos of the accident rate. All of my friends so far who rides bike have accident b4. Some after the accident, choose to drive car instead, some simply just take public transport instead, some cannot even make it after the accident.<br><br>Not to discourage u from riding a bike, but now then i realise why my parents are worried when i told them I am going to learn riding bike. Hope u can understand ur mother more. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

He told me no bike because sure die or get maimed in accident , get a car. Can't afford a car? Take public transport.<br><br>Cheaper to be on public transportation. Bike means petrol , petrol means money and maintenance also money .<br><br>The scholarship money is meant to go into your studies and usually they pay into your account , not hers since you are actually old enough to have your own bike. If your family needs some financial help, just give her what you can spare,and cut your luxuries down.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When you turn 18 next april then decide. You still have a long way to go in terms of your TP tests, be it 2B or 3. Do you really need a car or a bike that badly? Correct me if i'm wrong, you stated that your salary is approx 600 per month. Will taking public transport be more economically viable for that salary?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is not easy for a women to run the household... really.... and to bring you up, support ur siblings and you through education. Most parents could naturally want the best for their children and could also feel frustrated when they are unable to give what their children desire. Think in her shoes. I believe she isn't having a easy time to handle it.<br><br>You probably need time to adjust to a new lifestyle due to the emerging situation.<br><br>Without a bike, u can still be happy, don't forget to appreciate the things that you have had now.
