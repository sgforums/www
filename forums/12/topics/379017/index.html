              <p>Life is never perfect - it is just the way it is. Of course, all of us make mistakes, take tumbles here and there along the way.</p>
              <p>The sickness is one thing - how u perceive it is another thing altogether. What is gone is gone. Feeling lousy, guilty is utter waste of time.</p>
              <p>However, <strong>unlearn</strong> your previous 'ways' of thinking and habits - slowly and be patient about it. The sickness is one thing - how u perceive it is another thing altogether.</p>
              <p>U can waste energy worrying , wondering or simply feel like a victim or u can use the same energy and understand and be a bit more focussed with what u are and do.</p>
              <p>The wise one observes and learns from <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">others'</span></strong> mistakes. The not-so-wise type learns from one's own mistakes.</p>
              <p>The lift to 'success' is out of order and one has to take the staircase - <strong>one step at a time</strong>. There are no short-cuts - u reap what u sow!</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>  Fighting the odds is always going to leave you frustrated and tired.</p>
              <p>  Embracing the odds by opening the doors of your heart to them will help you to take things in your stride. The past is really gone, finished. The future is always uncertain. Now is the time you have and the present moment is the time where the future is made.</p>
              <p>  Do check with your school whether you could highlight to MOE and/or SEAB about your case. Consult all your teachers and see what they could do to help you catch up with all the revision. If you take H2 maths, you may wish to read two checklists I have prepared at:</p>
              <p>  http://weews.yolasite.com</p>
              <p>  and mug on some questions I have made guesses on, at:</p>
              <p>  http://www.sgforums.com/forums/2297/topics/374636</p>
              <p>  If you like, I could give you a complimentary copy of my H2 Maths Worked Solutions book :)</p>
              <p>  Thanks and good luck!</p>

              u can go to queit places to study. Home isnt the only choice.

              <p>Hi lilac,</p>
              <p>The 2 options which will be most plausible in your situation will be to either purchase some earplugs, or to move temporarily to a relative's place where there is someone to look after you. </p>
              <p>As for your eyes, you can purchase some eye drops to use. It could be getting dry because your body is still recovering, thus the rate of water loss is very high.</p>

              <p>Hi lilacs,</p>
              <p>Indeed, your father should spare a thought for your studies. But if he is unwilling to think for you, then you will have no choice but to find somewhere conducive for learning, such as a library. As much as you will like to not accommodate his actions, he is still your father, thus there is nothing much you could do about that.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
