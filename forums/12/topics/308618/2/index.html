              This is <span style="color: #ff0000;">his 3rd year as a Sec 3 NA student leh</span>, what should he

              <p>Although it's a fact that SAF is mostly paying us to do things like my slack vocation~ would you guys think of how the govt spend it's bills?</p>
              <p>Since it's negative, i might just don't say it..</p>
              <p>that's part of the oops..<br>to prevent myself from being caught for blackname the govt..etc..</p>
              <p>you know, how sensitive this issues are..</p>
              <p>as for studying O levels during NS..forget it..it's super stress lor..</p>
              <p>Dip at least isn't that stress, since it's spread over 3 years so the examination period will be after ORD thus it will not add on to the stress whereby u need to report back to camp/ur unit after the examination since there's a lots of unnecessary rules which we need to follow inside..</p>

              <p>Think he should finish up his NS liability first. In the meantime, he can earn some money, and save up a part of it.</p>
              <p>After ORD, if he still desire, with the money he saved, he can sign up as a private candidate.</p>

              <p><br>He retained in *Sec 3 twice because he simply does not have any interest in studying. Now he is showing improvement but there comes the option of just joining the army instead of continuing to study.</p>
