Wing Tai group holds some warehouse sales occasionally at their factory at tampines rd near the superbowl at hougang south.<br><br>2)  Wrinkle free polyester cotton shirts, but I tell you from experience, it ain't 100% wrinkle free, please iron before you wear it, otherwise you look really sloppy, like someone who couldn't be bothered to dress up for the occasion.  Very bad.<br><br>3)  No, it is not fine, your ankles are left exposed when you sit down.  Just go and try it and look at yourself, you'll find yourself looking awfully silly.  Please wear dark coloured socks with dark coloured leather shoes, same goes if the shoe is white.  Its comfortable yes, now imagine someone who wears shorts and socks with leather shoes.  Same as the above, don't make yourself look sloppy if you want to dress up welll.  Especially when it comes to corporate attire.</div>
