            <div class='col-md body'>Ok. i jus wan to post smth, cuz im not really feeling that gd&amp; as an advice to ppl.<br><br>Half a yr ago, i started to jio a sec4 gal &amp; all that. Im 16 but retained at sec3. I added her on msn, &amp; started chatting. I took some time to dare to sae hi to her in skl, as she dunno who am i. Finally she knew, but i humji towards her, for eg, out of 10 occasions we meet, i think i onli sae hi 4 times. Heaven gave me many chances la, met her outside be4 &amp; all that. But i did not took them well, at most chattin for 5 mins. During the first half of the yr, she had choir syf, talentime,&amp; mid yr exams, so she was vbusy &amp; her piority was her cca&amp; studies. I got her no, but we onli sms sometimes. Because she doesnt have much face to face chat with me, &amp; I was too rush &amp; frightened her. During the june hols, we did not hav much chat nor sms cuz i thought she givin me cold treatment. At the same time, a sec4 guy was jioin her too. His attitude towards guys not very gd, but he got glib tongue&amp; treat gals well. I buay gum with him since sec1, cuz he very haolian, &amp; backstabs ppl. Thn now skl reopen le, her best fren tell me i lost, thn my buddies told me they saw him &amp; her walking in to skl together, &amp; out of skl together. One guy even tell me he saw him&amp;her during june hols at national library studying together. Jus when now i wanted to be daring to talk to her more &amp; stuff, its too late. i Guess most probably he stead wif her le.. Now onli left 10wks to prelims, thn they no nid come skl le(stay at home study), so it is unlikely for me to go in to break them up in 10wks,&amp; im alr have no stamina to continue, so i'll have to let her go, no matter how awful i feel now. Cant believe she chose such a bad character guy. Bascially, i put all my heart&amp;sincerity into it, because i thought she was the right one for a serious relationship. But i olways tensed up when near her, so i cannot joke &amp; be my normal self.. Finally an advice to all, wan jio gal, mus brave, heck care wad ppl say, jus go &amp; talk to her, ego must drop, dun be like me shy shy, thn gal gone with some other lousy attitude but dare to jio her.

Be it triple science or what shit, i am Double Math Double Science students and score A for all of them...  but do i get a gf till now? the ans is NO. A Big NO. Nv in my 21 years of life, did i ever get a gf. In other word, i want to convince u that even i score well... i am suffering the same fate as u. There is nothing wrong with being a retainee but what is wrong is the inferior mentality that u have now...<br><br>Kick away this mentality away, find a meaning in life than just wasting it away in sec school... i know u hate being detained so buck up go and study... work hard for ur future.. may ur destined girl find u in ur course of study...<br><br>Gd education = better employment.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ah koh:</div><div class="quote_body">Ok. i jus wan to post smth, cuz im not really feeling that gd&amp; as an advice to ppl.<br><br>Half a yr ago, i started to jio a sec4 gal &amp; all that. Im 16 but retained at sec3. I added her on msn, &amp; started chatting. I took some time to dare to sae hi to her in skl, as she dunno who am i. Finally she knew, but i humji towards her, for eg, out of 10 occasions we meet, i think i onli sae hi 4 times. Heaven gave me many chances la, met her outside be4 &amp; all that. But i did not took them well, at most chattin for 5 mins. During the first half of the yr, she had choir syf, talentime,&amp; mid yr exams, so she was vbusy &amp; her piority was her cca&amp; studies. I got her no, but we onli sms sometimes. Because she doesnt have much face to face chat with me, &amp; I was too rush &amp; frightened her. During the june hols, we did not hav much chat nor sms cuz i thought she givin me cold treatment. At the same time, a sec4 guy was jioin her too. His attitude towards guys not very gd, but he got glib tongue&amp; treat gals well. I buay gum with him since sec1, cuz he very haolian, &amp; backstabs ppl. Thn now skl reopen le, her best fren tell me i lost, thn my buddies told me they saw him &amp; her walking in to skl together, &amp; out of skl together. One guy even tell me he saw him&amp;her during june hols at national library studying together. Jus when now i wanted to be daring to talk to her more &amp; stuff, its too late. i Guess most probably he stead wif her le.. Now onli left 10wks to prelims, thn they no nid come skl le(stay at home study), so it is unlikely for me to go in to break them up in 10wks,&amp; im alr have no stamina to continue, so i'll have to let her go, no matter how awful i feel now. Cant believe she chose such a bad character guy. Bascially, i put all my heart&amp;sincerity into it, because i thought she was the right one for a serious relationship. But i olways tensed up when near her, so i cannot joke &amp; be my normal self.. Finally an advice to all, wan jio gal, mus brave, heck care wad ppl say, jus go &amp; talk to her, ego must drop, dun be like me shy shy, thn gal gone with some other lousy attitude but dare to jio her.  Pai seh, abit wordy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> </div></blockquote>I was in similar situation two-three years ago. I too, like a girl who don't even know that I existed. I did not have the guys to even approach her. Eventually, as we left sec sch (i went to jc and she went to poly), she got herself a boyfriend. Ironically, I finally approached her (through msn) only when we left the school. We don't talk to each other now though (even though I still have her as my contact, but I'm not sure about her)<br><br>Two years down the road, I look back and realise how foolish it was of me to get so crazy over a girl who probably don't even know me that well anyway. Don't worry, you'll get over her sooner or later. And when you do, you'll look back and laugh at yourself...<br><br>...and cry at the same time for not having the guts to approach her.</div>
