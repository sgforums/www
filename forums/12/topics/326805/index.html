              <p>Yest, was my last day of poly life.. next sem attachment all the way.</p>
              <p>My class decided to like eat tgthr at amk hub.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There's this gal that i'm very close with. If some of you might rmbred, yea that les. She supposed to meet her butch at 2 plus.. cause lesson end at 12 but we drag drag drag.</p>
              <p>theortically, if we end lesson at 12, we will be able to make it to lunch by 1230 and eat then she will have enough time to meet her.Knowing us going out in a big group plus mostly gals, need go toilet all that. so we end up leaving campus only at 1 plus.</p>
              <p>so she told her butch to join the gathering.</p>
              <p>before her butch came, there's an empty seat beside me. However, I refused to approve her letting her butch seating there when she arrive. giving all kind of stupid excuse like "reserve it for my another friend who's riding." when keep insisting, I actually blurted out, "go ask her sit another table la.." I think after that she knows I sort of dont like the presence of her butch.</p>
              <p>After which, my fren arrive (the one who's riding) then followed him go draw cash. by the time I arrive, she's gone. They said that she not joining us for lunch. Went out with her butch instead.</p>
              <p>Pretty upset about it cause she left without a word. Come to think of it, I rather have her around with her butch rather then she's not there.. I didnt know when I chased her butch away, I'll be chasing her away too..</p>
              <p>On the last day of school, I've played the devil in chasing away someone dear to me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What should I do now? Apologize?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, that butch got bad history in my class.. she used to belong to another in my class. then something happen then my friend sort of "snatch" the butch away. Long story la..</p>
              <p>I was waiting for someone to voice out that her belong is not there. apperantly, nobody seems to want to say anything. seems like it's only me who voiced out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sigh..</p>

              <p>Are you looking things on the surface?</p>
              <p>It does not matter whether you are or not actually since that your spontanenous outburst was kind of abrupt and rude. (No offense, just want to speak what comes to mind.) </p>
              <p>Perhaps an apology would suffice for now, but not without telling her that you dislike her friend. Be honest without beating the bush, yeah?</p>
              <p>I think your friend would be forewarned if any 'shyzeer' (a Russian slang) plays up.</p>

              <p>If you cared about your own guilt and think you're at fault, then apologise to her.</p>
              <p>If you cared about how she will think of you regardless who's fault it is, then apologise to her. But do let her know that she meant alot to you.</p>

              <p>yea..</p>
              <p>i admit im childish for not giving up that seat for personal reasons.. i admit im childish cause i just thinking of my own benefits..</p>
              <p>but like I said. That butch got problem with my classmates. Especially to one of mine. I doubt their issue is settled and a fight could occur then. She's not part of the class.. Why must she come? Create trouble?</p>
              <p>I could have keep quiet and sit down and let her have that sit. But I choose not to. I practically "chased" her away. Many were unhappy she arriving. Many choose to keep quiet about it. I'm one of them who's unhappy but I did not keep quiet about it. Even though my reason for unhappiness might be different frm theirs, I voice them out instead of keeping them inside..</p>
              <p>Back to present day..</p>
              <p>I'm told her I'm unhappy she left. She apologize for leaving.. We decided to meet up tmr.. See how it goes.</p>
