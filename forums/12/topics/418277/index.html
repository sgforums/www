              <p>Total Crap!! Bad character is intrinsic and will affect everyone she comes in contact with. Shes just using the tried and tested way of rejection called "Its not U! its me!"</p>
              <p>Although it may just mean that you are not currently in contention. If you want, just keep being sweet. Most girls will come to like the sweetness they used to hate(or is indifferent). Of cos in the mean time you can be on the lookout of alternatives. &lt;3</p>

But if you really like her, I think it's worth a try.<br><br>But um, just keep a lookout yeah, 'sall I'm saying. And all the best man.</p>
