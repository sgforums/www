              <p>Hi guys, please hear me out and help me with my problem. I really appreciate it.</p>
              <p>My bf is a nice guy and we used to have amazing time together. Like any other couples, we had our ups and downs and we worked though it. But now he keeps pushing me further away by taking me for granted. It's like he doesn't care any more, he doesn't want to listen to what I have to say anymore. He makes me feel like I am a pest! He took our rs for granted. I started feeling so lonely in our rs. I am almost always the one who would try to fix things and now I am tired of doing it on my own. He may be insecure too. The other night, we went out for a drink with some friends and there was this guy friend who has a big crush on me for quite some time also joined. When my bf took me home, he looked upset and said things like perhaps I am better off with that guy, that he is better than my bf (that friend and I have a proper friendship and my bf knows that). I know that guy friend is the type of guy many girls would dream of marrying but I love my bf for who he is and I never look at other guys. When he said that to me, it really hurt because it was not the first time he would say such a thing. I was upset to the point I wanted to tell him if he keeps saying such a stupid thing, it will eventually drive me to that other guy! But of course I didn't because it's not what I meant and I didn't want to make him feel even worse.</p>
              <p>I don't know why. My bf doesn't want to put in effort to make our rs work but he is afraid that I may leave him for other guys. It hurts and it's drowning.</p>
              <p>I feel like my passion for him has faded due to how he has treated me, treated the rs. I am really tired of trying to fix things on my own. I don't want to keep asking myself what I do wrong all the time anymore. I don't want to feel like I am on my own in our rs anymore. I don't want to make myself a whining needy gf by talking to him about it anymore. I want to give him another chance, maybe last chance to realize what is happening before I can't take it anymore and walk away. But I don't know what to do anymore.</p>
              <p>Anyone ever experienced the same thing? Any advice please?</p>

              <p>but I don't want to give up on him so easily because I know he still cares alot about me. It's just like he is insecure and thinking that he can't be the bf that I want him to. He had this idea very early on in our rs that I deserve someone better so yes like you said probably he has 'given up' symptoms. But I don't want to give up on him if it is really the case. I love him for who he is and I will not consider any other guys as long as I am still with him and in love with him.</p>
              <p>Anything I can do?</p>

              <p>I'm not perfect either and he is a good guy. But one thing i would expect is we share the same idea of a healthy loving rs that both need to work for it which we didn't.</p>

              <p>I don't think ignoring my bf is something I want. I don't want to get that kind of attention. I mean if he cares, he will show it without being 'reminded'. If he needs me to remind him then he actually doesn't truly care.</p>
