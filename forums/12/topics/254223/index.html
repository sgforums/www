Look at it this way, you are successful in all aspects of your life actually, but yet, u feel that job-wise, you are not doing as well as you like. This could be due to several factors, but i suspect the most likely one will be because you are feeling job fatique, and that you have reached the point in ur life where u are seriously thinking if its worth continuing on in ur job. Could it be that u feel u have been bypassed for a raise, promotion etc?<br><br>Its seriously not worth doing stupid things because of your job. I would suggest u take a short holiday break, and evaluate where u think u are now, against the goals u have set urself when u first joined the company. Are u reaching ur goals? Do u think u can reach it? Do u need to change ur goals? Do u think that u can reach ur goals only if u go somewhere else? Ask urself these questions, and u probably will be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel. There's no need to go to extremes and think of doing stupid things because you are only gonna make ur loved ones miserable.<br><br>Hope my advice helps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you are subjecting yourself to too much pressure by having lofty expectations of yourself..... Take things one small step at a time - the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step......... Each time you focus on making each step your best, it becomes easier. Looking at the whole distance all at once is scary and tends to make people stumble.<br><br>We are all not infallible..... Long as you learn from your mistakes and resolve to do better all the time, you'll be on your way..........<br><br>With each small step well taken, you should learn to give yourself a pat on the back. As this process goes on, you should be able to restore your self esteem which is all about learning how to value yourself!
