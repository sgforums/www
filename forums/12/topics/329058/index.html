              <p>That's because you were too used to having him around in your life for the period both of you were together.</p>
              <p>Cry if you are upset and whenever you have reached your emotional threshold, your tears will eventually kill the love detachment off in your heart. And time will wash away all the lost, numb, meanigless and uncomfortable feelings from you faster than you think it should take.</p>
              <p>Moving on doesn't means forgetting about it, it means you are slowly rejecting him from your mind and you won't think about him as often as now.</p>
              <p>You can think less frequently of him to the point of getting use to your current life routine without the need to think about him.</p>
              <p>It's only temporarily, you can think lesser of him but you can never forget about him.</p>
              <p>You will eventually erase him from your heart when you have found someone better than him and your time spent with your new guy and the love you have for the new guy will overtake and replaced whatever remaining feelings you have left for your ex-bf.</p>

              <p>Thanks Parn <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png">. I'm actually not worried of having no guys coming after me. But I feel as though I am so attached to this guy that I don't have any more room in my heart for another guy.</p>
              <p>What's worse is he now lives beside my blk. How am I going to move on when I know he is physically so close to me and I may just bump into him anytime. This makes moving on so much harder. Agree?</p>

              <p>You just need to meet someone new. Go out more...meet up with new people. You don't need to worry about bumping into him until you do.</p>
