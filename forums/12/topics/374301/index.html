              <p>virginity still a highly valued trait for the guy to be seeking in their future wife</p>
              <p>Once
                  u know ur girl not virgin, she say do it 1 time/accident only. Confirm
                  the guy will think how many other guys got in already.  i doubt any guy
                  would believe unless its blind love.</p>
              <p>Once the infatuation wear off, he
                  will think like since u already do with others anyway.  Would be unfair and crappy if he didnt get his share of sex partners in his entire life. Why commit ur love &amp; virginity to this non virgin?</p>
              <p>I last time got NS friend, he is
                  "playboy",  say nowdays non-virgin girls often claim only do 1 time
                  b4, so its hard to believe their non-virgin story. I know he lies about alot of thing. and really a selfish jerk anyway. He can fake sincerity very well and know alot of love songs to hook zhabor for sex. He very good at buildin short term attraction by offering so and so, his ambitition nonsense. By the time they find out his character already too late.</p>
              <p>Girl should notice when a guy knows too many love songs, too much unrealistic promises. Theres probably a catch.  Sadly to say i think many girls do often would go for the showy type rather than those down-to-earth type. </p>
              <p>Nice guys finish last( which guy want to be like the 10th+?).When their innocent hope of finding a pure love are dashed.</p>
              <p>edit:</p>
              <p>this is a little off topic but i would like to ask if given a
              choice, would you want to be the 1st guy for a short relationship or
              10th for a longer lasting one? i think its pretty obvious</p>

              <p>Yes, i do really meant too many love songs + <strong>unrealistic</strong> promises</p>
              <p>but i just realised love songs can sometime contain unrealistic promises lol.</p>
              <p> 
              A realistic love song is probably not as romantic.  Such irony</p>

              <p>Virginity is indeed over-rated, to the core.</p>
              <p>When you truly love, nothing really matters anymore, for you would have love a person as a packaged whole, flaws and all, as none is perfect.</p>
              <p>To seek for perfection is to live in denial, obstination and procastination.</p>
              <p>Those who rate virginity as high value are nothing more than selfish and self centred persons, for they view love as an object to possess - virgin would only mean an untouched item to them, they way they would view and purchase only new items. They know not nor comprehend the concept of true love.</p>
              <p>True love is to find out the character of a person, to be fully aware of that person, flaws and all, to accept and to give love, in returned to be loved, or in the lest, to serve a higher noble calling of helping someone else in life, should the love not be returned, for true love frees a person, never enslaves one.</p>
              <p>There is so much we need to know still of love, even after 6000 years of recorded history. It is an alien concept, and bewildering, for we are animals and beast at heart. Civilisation is an imposition upon our ancient forefathers, so that humanity may grow and survive. So too, was love....</p>

              <p>Btw, i dun think knowing too much love songs or unrealistic promises = playboy... Too much of a sweeping statement... It's like dyed hair = ah beng, smoking = gangster... Gotta bring up facts and not myth to back ur sentence...</p>

              <p>Anyway i would say virginity is highly valued to males in general unlike those in fantasy ideal worlds.  Its gonna be hard to find a guy not using you for another cheap thrill</p>
              <p>Faithful guy or playboy. They all want it but only one type would wait for it. If lost, most will intepret u as a cheap slut regardless whether u 1 time, accident or 1000 times</p>
              <p>Would be wise to hold your virginity to the death or marriage</p>

              <p>Virginity has nothing to do with one's body (biology) it has more to do with the profundity/divinity of love - if u will, a 'non-sexual' state . One labels another as virgin cos one (the other) has not made 'love' yet lar.</p>
              <p>When one has transcended love - one has plunged the very depth(s) of one's Being and in turn the depth is in itself transcendental.</p>
              <p> My meaning or implication is that of virgin as purity, uncontaminated, spontaneity, simply innocence (of the heart/soul or whatever one is inclined to call it).</p>
              <p> All these dichotomy/polarized view(s) has come about cos sex is not the prolem but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sexuality</span>. Sexuality is repression having found an abode in the mind. ie, one is sexual in the mind, thoughts are all about sex!</p>
