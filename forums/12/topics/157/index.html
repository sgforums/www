            <div class='col-md body'>today at the bowling alley, I was spurred by another one of my personal life thoughts again. Playing in the alley, there was this spastic girl... Looking at her, it just dawn on me that I find it really fascinating.. I'm not being bad here.. but have you guys ever realized that these people are actually the ones we were hoping to be at different times. You always hear people say, "how I wish that I would never grow up?" Or "how I wish I will always remain as a child?" Little did we realise that these spastic people are the very ones who we are hoping to be. Their minds never develop fully, and hence they're always in the child mood. The most ironic thing of all is that many of us will keep ourselves away from them, avoid them totally, and would even tell our children or some other normal kids to stay away from them, just because they are a little different. I really makes me wonder why?? In my mind, they are the ones we should envy. They can always remain as a child regardless of their age, and no one will say they are immature. Why is it people avoid them?? If you're going to have the idea of not growing up, you will just be like them. They are just so care-free, nothing to worry about, but to have fun.<br><br>-Quote- "XXX has bunny ears... HAhahha" these are the very words that I overheard one of them saying, while 2 others are making fun of each other. These words made me recall the kind of language we had used some time ago. Those days it sounded so sweet, but if it's said by one of them, it's just feel different. They are living what we wish to be.. but why do we have a different view of it when we see them??<br><br>Can only say humans, they just want the best of both worlds...<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)

            <div class='col-md body'>you got a point there about thinking too much, devil.. It's not a problem to think too much, neither is it all that bad. The thing is to think of the correct things, and it will surmount to some value, if not you're really considered a weirdo.<br><br>Speaking of cleaning ladies, I used to meet one too at the old Police HQ where I worked before. Well, my friends say she's kind of weird too coz she's always taking to herself. She even openly and audiably talk to herself. I dunno really nkow unless I really go examine her lahz.. but I feel that talking to oneself is something that can relief boredom. BEsides sometimes it's hard to find companions who are weirdos like me, so the best friend that one can have. You will never get tired, nor can you get rid of this friend.. hahaha~<br><br>Anyway from what I know about the other animals are that they fight, but they dun kill their own species. Maybe I have not seem before besides for some hammies that eat their own offsprings and dolphins which behaves very much like man, coz they rape their female counterparts, they abuse their 'women' to submission, and they fight other males to get their mates. if not can't seem to see other animals doing it liaoz...<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)
