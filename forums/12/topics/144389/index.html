Use the resources to make yourself more valuable.  Do not quit unless you are being offered a position.  Honestly, people who find jobs easily have the experiences, a good profolio, fantastic soft skills or are extremely good looking.  Not everybody is blessed like that.<br><br>Ultimately, the word here is Passion.  If you are not passionate about your job, you will not last long.  1 year is considered very long.

Secondly if you are employed you will have better bargaining power in terms of pay and benefits when interviewing for the next job. This is important in my view as there is also no guarantee that the next job, would provide you with greater satisfaction in terms of colleagues, boss, corp culture, so if you get a better pay, at least the upside is still there. Every corp has its plus and negative points, there is no heavenly work place!!!! Good luck in your search</div>
