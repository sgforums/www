            <div class='col-md body'>To me it's a little delima...<br><br>let's say the ones in the relationship is Gal-A and Guy-B, and Guy-C likes Gal-A.<br><br>cos,<br><br>1) if the Guy-C really cant get Gal-A out of his mind, I would advice him to just confess to Gal-A and get her to make a decision. that way at least Guy-C knows that he had tried. and it is Gal-A's decision.<br><br>2) If Gal-A decided to stay with her Guy-B, that will show Guy-B that Gal-A is serious with him and really loves him, and Guy-C should give up, cos the lady have made her choice.<br><br>3) If Gal-A decided to give it a try with Guy-C, that will mean that there was a problem in Gal-A and Guy-B's relationship, and somehow the relationship is not strong or precious enough for Gal-A and Guy-B to put in the hard work to work it through.<br><br>but then again, If Gal-A can leave Guy-B for Guy-C, what makes Guy-C think that she will stay with him when the going gets tough?<br><br>Bottom line. if u are in a relationship and are unhappy, work that out first before considering anyone else. if it is really not meant to be, end it. but do not start a new one so soon. if the "guy-c" really loves you, he'll be willing to wait for you to pull yourself together.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>like i said its easy to tell the rights and wrongs but when it comes to choosing between the 2 ....... thats a totally different thing.<br><br>I believe in a relationship, we are constantly tested on our faith and trust in each other. Temptations will always be there, its jus how we deal with it, give in ? or try harder to keep the relationship alive.<br><br>And further more everyone's idea of whats right and wrong are totally different, this guy/gal who is going after someones elses gf/bf might not think that he is doing the wrong thing when everyone else thinks that he is. he might be simply following his heart .....<br><br></div>
