Knowing that the one he / she love is being tormented and maybe even abused by the 'official' one.... The person actually set off and help the one he / she love set free from the lock... The person actually might not even be getting anything much if any at all from stepping in.... Yet helped nonetheless... At high costs... Being called names... I've even personally seen people who devoted themselves so much that in the end they're only being used by the ones 'suffering'.... (of course, I'm not saying there're not genuine ones who are really suffering..) 'Idiots' who couldn't even wake up to face themselves or the reality after they've been used....<br><br>So though I can agree that SOME people just tends to be seduced more easily or break from a relationship more readily... And it MIGHT just be a 'karma' that one who get himself / herself involved with such a type of person might just have to face the consequences one day.... It's rather unfair to say a straight down statement that such people start off with only intention to TAKE and not GIVE.... And this is just a type of EXAMPLE I'm giving... I certainly don't wish to be going on and write a book out of it....<br><br>On another note... If one is 'sway' enough... Even if one court a single person also no guarantee that the person would be a good and faithful one... Least to say even if you wait till they officially break then enter a relationship... If a person has a tendency to stray from relationships... Would just simply because you've entered a relationship with that person AFTER the official break up make that person any better by chance....? I would certainly doubt so...<br><br>I personally also think it's too early to jump to conclusion that if a person jumps into a relationship while he / she is attached then it would mean that he / she would have a natural tendency to do so.... And should be labelled as 'bad' or whatever...? It might be that the person genuinely IS in a VERY LOUSY relationship and needs a pillar of suppotr before he / she breaks down....?</div>
