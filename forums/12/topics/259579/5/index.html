            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FocusPoint:</div><div class="quote_body">It seems your little story might soon garner a lot of support or sympathy for the girl here. As we understand humans are very emotional creatures and love to support the underdog. But did you realize the girl is just to be blame? You would think after 3 abortions in 8 years and she would have wised up? But no, she still stick with the guy and now pregnant again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Any average intelligent woman would have come to realize what kind of man he was and would have dumped him long before he dumped her.<br><br>My advice : When one go into a relationship go in with two eyes open. If you know the relationship is not going to work out as what you want bail out fast and don't hope and pray for the best the other party would change for the better. Always learn from mistakes and move on in life.</div></blockquote>Yea true, and I am aware this is just an one-sided story from her. Her fault is keep giving in to the guy and keep hoping that one day he will change for her. But obviously he is not going to. I think it is a good thing she has decided to move on, and from the last post she posted, it seems that she aborted the baby <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>But the third party, the guy already tells her about the situation he is in, and still continues to seduce him, I really do not know what to think of such a girl.<br><br>I agree that we should go into a rs with two eyes open, but at the same time we shouldn't give up so easily either. It all depends on what happened of course. If just conflicts, should sit down together and talk it out. Not the moment there is a conflict and the grass suddenly looks greener on the other side, then start looking for excuses to terminate the rs so that you can go over.</div>
