As we understand humans are very emotional creatures and love to support the underdog. But did you realize the girl is just to be blame? You would think after 3 abortions in 8 years and she would have wised up? But no, she still stick with the guy and now pregnant again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Any average intelligent woman would have come to realize what kind of man he was and would have dumped him long before he dumped her.<br><br>My advice : When one go into a relationship go in with two eyes open.
