Loving the person based on that, more than likely, will NOT yield a good outcome in the relationship. To love is to give. If both sides give, then wouldn't it feel good to receive when you least expect it?<br><br>However quite a number of people cannot resist the temptations of self-centered loving. What they want compared to what they can give. What they desire compared to what they can do for others. Such selfishness will destroy not only yourself, but the people around you as well.</div>
