            <div class='col-md body'>I VERY "SWAY" AH!!!!! Why always I so unlucky one?<br><br>Yesterday, we got this stupid presentation, the entire module is about coding a program and yesterday was the presentation and luckily I got the program working in time and mine was a rather unique idea that our tutor really took close notice of... BUT WHY DID HE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE SO CONTRIDICTING AND STAB US AT THE BACK.<br><br>You see, for our class, it was rather "sway," we got a quick-witted invigilator and a I also dunno how to say him tutor. The invigilator shoot us while our tutor poured cold water... WTF!?<br><br>U see we were presenting then we had an extra features in our program, it was a mini clock that shows time and date. Then the invigilator asked, why did we implent the clock, how is it useful to the user in this program... and we had to cooked up many many stupid excuse to cover that stupid question... I MEAN ADD EXTRA FEATURES CANNOT AR? MIGHT AS WELL ASK WHY WINDOWS AND HANDPHONES GOT CLOCK AND DATE... But I didn't tok of that earlier no I sure shoot back one! Wah Lau! Then our tutor said... but user got watch wat!!!!! THIS IS THE LAMEST EXCUSE I EVER HEARD FROM A PROFESSIONAL! WTF?! User confirm got watch meh?!<br><br>Then they invigilator proceeded to ask about the display screen where it gets the value from the database. The display screen was my friend's part (But is I do one lah, I "bao la liao" de). So my tutor shot me! He said then since the display screen extracts the data from the database and u r doing the database, what is your part!!!! Then I explain to him lor... I tok him, the database is for extracting the data and the display screen just calls and gets the data... Then he keep saying and saying and saying, so the display screen extracts the data lah, its link to the database lah... Then my friend also stunned...dunno wat to say...Then I said NO! The database EXTRACTS the data while the display screen CALLS the database to get the data... Then the teaacher said OH! call... with an unsatisfied face... WTF?!<br><br>Then everytime, my group member explain till stunned, I will "chap" in and help them....the invigilator is okay...BUT MY OWN TUTOR! MY OWN TUTOR!<br>He gives me that "U R RUDE, I am not listening face" and bo chap me..." MY OWN TUTOR!<br><br>After that, the invigilator asked...so who made the clock, then I raised my finger then she said she wanted to look at the codes...Then I opened the file and told her...."Tell you the truth, I dun really understand the codes." THEN THEN MY OWN TUTOR! I EMPHASIZE ON MY VERY OWN TUTOR, OUR TUTOR, his eyes opened wide wide stared at me and said "SO  U COPY ONE LAH, NOT U DO ONE LAH, U IMPLEMENT ONLY LAH!" I was like WTF, the entire module was unfair to us from the start, ask us to create program, GUI layout and additional features.... and all we learned up to now is still dos dos DOSSS! WAT IS THE SCHOOL DOING? AND THE TEACHER LOOKED SO SURPRISED LIKE TAT! LIKE I AM SUPPOSE TO KNOW HOW TO CREATE THAT KIND OF THING, I THINK HE ALSO DUNNO AR!<br><br>Then we had a loading bar, we implemented last minute and the invigilator asked, so how is the loading bar useful to the user? Then I was like WTF? Loading bar leh...where got use de... just for fun nia...additional features mah...add they also kpkb, dun add they also kpkb... Then we think think think think...finally thought of a reply, we told her so as to let the user know if the computer load halfway hang... THEN THEN!!!! MY OWN TUTOR!!!! HE GAVE AN EXTREMELY STUPID COMMENT! HE TALK NEVER GO THROUGH HIS BRAIN ONE ISSIT!? CALL HIMSELF A PROFESSIONAL?! HE said "but you suppose to give the user a fully functional program wat" HUH? LIKE NO LINK LEHZ, the user computer hang, our fault ar?<br><br>Then the invigilator commented, actully you shoot add maps for the user to see where they are going... Then OUR TUTOR TRIED TO SHOOT US AGAIN, he said this was wat they planned originally and they omitted  quite a lot of things....BUT BUT THE THING IS LAST TIME, HE SAID CANNOT HARDCODE AND MUST STORE EVERYTHING IN MICROSOFT ACCESS AND TOLD US THAT SINCE IMAGES CAN'T BE STORED IN MICROSOFT ACCESS, WE CAN IMPLEMENT AND EXTRACT THE DATA HE VERY, HE SAID ONE, HE VERY HAPPY LIAO!<br><br>Then the invigilator commented that our database design was not appropriate and asked us whether we learned database b4... Then I said NO! and said it rather assertively... Then our tutor...this was the nicest thing he said throughout the presentation, he said no, they not supposed to learn it this semester, I think next. Then the invigilator said so I can cover one eye one this...COVER WAT EYE?! We did something we haven't learned, must give us CREDIT...IN FACT MOST OF THE PROGRAM WE CREATED WE HAVEN'T LEARNED DE... Our tutor then said another nice thing, its good that they learned somthing from this project...<br><br>WHY SO SWAY DE? WHY OUR TUTOR TRIED TO "HAI" US! WHOSE SIDE IS HE ON? Then today, I saw my friend, other class de present, their teacher so calm and quiet one...like true gentlemen..unlike our presentation, more like debate!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>erm.. when you copied the code and applied the interface directly to your application, you should at least add comments next to the code that you have copied to show you have attempted to understand the code. It is like that what. Anyone can just go online or search books, go find the code and apply the interface. Value is added only when you actually understand the code and shows you have a deeper understanding than your peers...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Therefore, actually when you add the clock without understanding the code, it is actually really like something "extra" and you might as well not add it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I were the lecturer, sure I will screw your a.s.s more than he does.<br><br>Any features added to the program must have direct benefits to the system.<br>Adding a clock? plus you don't know the codes? then add for what?<br>Our workstation no clock ar?<br><br>A progress bar, as it's name implied, is to inform the user the "Progress".<br>What the heck is the "program hang the user will know"? What a funny answer? Should you develop a program that will hang in the first place? I laugh until I almost fall off my chair for this lame answer.<br><br>This is the lamest s.h.i.t i ever read. Imagine, you work for a local bank in the country, and you have added something to let the user know you that program will "hang", what does that mean? You are creating a joke for your company as well as your country. Imagine, the headline in the paper, "APPLICATION FROM XYZ BANK IN SINGAPORE HANGS AND INDICATE WITH A PROGRESSBAR RUN UNTIL HALF WAY"?? So, the user should know your super program hangs lah, if they saw the half process progressbar? Is that the biggest joke?<br><br>Some kids are just not competitive, they can only learn from the lecturer.<br>You know how those oversea kids learn? The lecturer won't teach them single s.h.i.t,  they do their own research, and do their project on their own. Do you mean you need your lecturer teach you how to eat and s.h.i.t is it?<br><br>It's quite sad that out local kids are like that. No wonder there are some many<br>born losser.<br><br>Oh yeah, any staff under me who did something, like you did, add something, but don't know what, just copy here and there, and add without a purpose, and thought he should be rewarded that way... give me one reason, why should I keep him?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Big Bot,<br><br>consider this, what is the presentation/examination for?<br>if it was just about your project, they could have just asked you to submit it and they fiddle with the program themselves.  This is obviously not the point.<br><br>thus, I believe the point of the presentation was for them to ask questions about your project and listen to what you have to say about it and trying to assess your competence, both in programming and presenting your ideas in an orderly and coherent manner.<br><br>The advantages of the features you have added may be glaringly obvious to you but to someone 'outside' the project, it may not be so.<br><br>besides, if you add useless features, it would waste processing time. the questions on the reasoning behind adding the features are therefore relevant.<br><br>the examiners being examiners were doing their jobs, trying to understand the thought processes you have gone through to put together the program.<br><br>going through school is like playing a game, know the rules and you'll do well.<br><br>cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
