              <p>Changes occur for reasons. They dont come out of the blue or at the whim and fancy of anyone, let alone our heirachy ordered organisation called the SAF.</p>
              <p>Were there elements of slackness that compromised the readiness and operational status of your company or battalion recently? Was there a greatly reduced manpower strength or natural attrition rate to rationalise the efficiency of the organisation? Were the changes only temporary to cope with the current national security requirements?</p>
              <p>Each will have to do their share in their allocated time, and none must shirk their obligations, for what we do, we do it for loved ones and those we care about. Some become clerks and need not sweat like horses or touch a weapon after BMT. Some become the infantry and stink so bad after weeks under the sun and rain that their camps are mistaken as rubbish dump or a waste treatment plant.</p>
              <p>What was ordered, was for a purpose, which you must reconcile with, for higher ideals that you will respect within your heart. Serve All Families - your job is to defend and protect, regardless if you are a clerk or elite soldier - and it starts with simple mundane starts such as orderly duties.</p>

              <p>Actually it could be nothing wrong, maybe because the whole unit/batallion do not have enough manpower (due to some going to ORD, taking block leave, etc) for shift rotation of duties.</p>
              <p>This happens very often for Units that have 1/2 lao chiaos, 1/2 newbies. The transition is the worst, but cannot avoid.</p>
              <p>Or if new men, havent come in yet, i.e. the unit has mostly commanders, so its purely commander's BMT, ACT, SISPEC, etc. The RSM &amp; CSM bo bian has to regulate their commanders for duties, maybe some commanders even went for infantry weapons course, intel course, pioneer course, 84/MG course. Then when they come back, they will boost up manpower, so there will be more people to go before next round of duties.</p>
              <p>Also, you can discuss with your friends or CSM to rotate people on weekend duties. Cuz alot of CSM thick skull ones, they sometimes unilaterally think that some one or some guy prefers to do duties on weekend, and then will schedule him on weekends. You can also discuss with your friends to swap duties. We do it often when we were in 1SIR, they flexibility is good, as long as both parties agree then remember to inform CSM can already.</p>
              <p>Also, ensure you dont kena extras, else will have more duties.</p>

              <p>Ah...if you suddenly get orders for duties as what you said in TS 1st thread, then your CSM has poor organizational skills. All duties MUST be planned out at least 2 weeks before actual duties and be put on the BIG BOOK.</p>
              <p>As specs, or PS, you can ask PC or PS to go to CSM office, then check his BIG BOOK to get ready for duties, cuz sometimes CSM just can forget about reminding you all on duties.</p>
              <p>And cannot be last minute ask your friends for duties, why? Cuz all duty personnels, COS, Guard Comds with Guards, etc will be put on the day's BRO already mah. If listed, then although comanders didnt remind men, they themselves are supposed to check the BRO everyday and also check with their comdrs on any duties.</p>
              <p>As a good reference, last time, my standard Guard Comdr/G2/G3 duties are on average 1.5 times a month. Normally, if I heng heng, then I will get 1 weekend duty every 2.5 months. And at your 2nd year, COS duties will be done all by Lance Corporals &amp; Corporals, Private First Class also will do, if they have excused themselves on exercises.</p>

              <p><br>nowadays got people who got involved in alternate perm 24hrs duty. exempted from shift but then ended up getting work spilled over from shift. i had that for 2 months while awaiting to be thrown overseas once again. and i do always lose a day every weekend.</p>
              <p>and i am just bearing a few more cycles before i ORD. so TS shouldnt complain especially when others are burning every weekend. also bear in mind that some people are being posted overseas unwillingly for a year at least.</p>
