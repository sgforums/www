            <div class='col-md body'>I have a question about this girl,A i like. Problem is there's this other guy,B around who i think she might like. A seems happy to talk to be, cause she smiles a lot when talkking to him. Well she also smiles a lot when talking to most other people, but i could be too sensitive. One other thing, she sometimes plays with her hair when she talks to him. Some people have told me that this means the girl likes the guy, but i could be imagining things. Anyway when one of her friends asked her what she felt towards the guy, she said "friends only, nothing special." So what do you guys think? She sees this guy more often than me btw, coz they are in the same "academic group".

She seems happy talking to other people too, but for some reason i just *sense* that she's somehow happier talking to him. Like she seems to talk to him a little longer etc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From the way you have described, it does seem that A is attracted to B. Playing with the hair is known to be a subtle sign language that indicates interest (but that only applies to girls or guys who behave like girls).<br><br>You sound like a nice guy, and sad to say this has happened to so many nice guys before that the outcome is now more or less predictable: You could either suffer in silence and keep the friendship, or reveal your feelings and risk the friendship. Whatever you decide, the friendship between you and her is never going to be the same as before.<br><br>Maybe you could dedicate to her David Tao's "Pu Tong Peng You" on the radio.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah... he's rite. U have to do something.... anything.... can start from group outing first then u can slowly proceed. Try to act normal and friendly towards her loh. Dun be afraid to show a little more care, like offer her tissue paper after a meal and other small small "hints".<br><br>Try to go into the "good friends" catagory of her life, can stand a much better chance. Since she and ur good friend can evolve into good friends, then there's a chance tat they'll continue to evolve deeper.
