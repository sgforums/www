No doubt when 2 people feels that it's really different a feeling to be together, moving from the previous relationship into a BGR can spend quite a different thing... Different way of holding it...

So if it cannot last, does that mean you won't even wanna know her in the 1st place? Won't even wanna love her?<br><br>I'm quite sure there would be many out there telling you that "I wish I've never been in this relationship..." when they fail one.... But if you tell them that the relationship won't last, or it's gonna really hurt them.. There're also 'the many others' who INSIST to CARRY ON THEIR WAYS... Just take a look across the topics in AA and you can very well understand....</div>
