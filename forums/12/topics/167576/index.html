During these 4yrs that we know each other, despite the distance between us, she never failed to be around for me and same for me to her. Since I've put aside my feelings for her right from the beginning, the "relationship" between us seemed purely just friendship.<br><br>It's only until she came over mid June this year that the feelings seemed to be being dug up but I can't confirm the feelings yet. mid July I went over to her hometown and stayed for three weeks and during that period I'm more or less starting to suspect that the feelings that I've once put aside is slowly coming back and it's duely confirmed the day I'm back in Singapore and I decide to confess to her my feelings much to my delight that she actually had feelings for me too. That was end July.<br><br>Since then till now is already 4 mths and I went over to her hometown again during her b'day in September and it's during that trip that her dad got into an accident on the day I'm supposed to come back to Singapore. I stayed on another week not wanting to leave her to face the incident alone. I wanted to be by her side to support her and give as much help as I could to her and the family. But due to work, I only stayed on for another week and I have to come back to Singapore and since then the problem started to be more obvious.<br><br>I could understand that facing her dad's condition right now she'll be under a lot of pressures and no matter how cranky I am or how upset I am over her lack of communication with me, I never dare and will not voice it out to her afraid that it'll just add on more pressure on her.<br><br>But honestly, no matter how hard I try to be strong, I know there are times when I really need so burst out and yell. My temper now becomes errantic but even then I never throw my temper on her. Sometimes I really miss her too much and it doesn't help to sooth my temper when for days I tried to call her but she never once pick up the call and never reply my msg either. But according to my cousin who is also her cousin and she's very close to him, it seemed that I'm not the only person who tried to call her and she never picked up the call. That calls for some comfort but then there are still times when I'll really get upset. But whenever she picked up my call (finally), she never fails to brighten up my mood.<br><br>I'm still trying to cope despite the fact that it's being ongoing like this for two months.<br><br>Since then till now is already 4mths</div>
