Long distance relationship is never easy.  You are not by her side when she's going thru a rough patch now.  The least u can do is to show her ur concern, let her know that u care..but not pressurising her.  </span></div></blockquote>Ok..let me describe her dad's current situation. Maybe it'll give you all a clearer picture.<br><br>Her dad is still in hospital bed ridden and needs to be tube feed. Don't ask about the nurses, the service at the hospital sucks. My gf and her mum stays at the hospital 24/7 to look after her dad and they have been staying there for 2mths already. My gf only goes home on certain days in a week to help out the family business which after that she'll drive back to the hospital again to look after her dad.<br><br>It's been going on like this for the past two months. The last time I remember her sleeping in her own room in her own house was the day before the accident happens.<br><br>There's no way I can write to her. I'm the one who help her check her email and clear her inbox of junks. If I were to email her, most likely I'll be the one reading it. If you are talking about snail mail, that's even worse. There's been cases before that I snail mail her and it either get lost somewhere and never reach her or she got it like a month later.<br><br>My dear cousin is coming to town soon. He usually will spend CNY with my gf's family and I'm thinking of writing a letter to her and ask my cousin to pass it to her personally. I can't imagine anyone of the family being itchy hand and no respect for privacy and opens the letter to read. I can't risk that.</div>
