Is that holy..? I won't know for sure probably because I'm not a Christian....<br><br>But to some, sex before marriage is a form of delibrate sin. Just like murder, stealing, robbing. Just different degree of severity.<br><br>Interesting enough, sex has often been restrictive in most religions because it has been a taboo for society during the time back. Even till today, even as the topic is opening up in discussions and actions. Laws and religions still often take the more 'backwards' approach in an attempt to hold back the infrastructure of the society.<br><br>Today. As people go more for liberations and break free from myths and taboos, most people are willing to ignore certain parts of religions which fall in conflicts with their daily lives to compromise for a more 'balanced' life IF it seems justifiable.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello,<br><br>After reading this topic, I feel rather sad that there is so much "misunderstanding" from some forum posters here.<br><br>Many Christians/ Catholics or other people of other faiths, Muslims, Jewish, Hindus, Budhists, etc, when they are planning to get married, they would like to get a partner who has the same faith as them. Why? Because their faith is very important and very dear to them. Their faith is something very fundamental, it is the very essence of their world view, their beliefs, their convictions, their way of life. It is the basics and the fundamental building block. It is their guidance in life.<br><br>Marriage, it is very important, where 2 people live together, build families, share joys and sorrows, face challenges, go through many things together, as husband and wife, as parents, and as best friends.<br><br>If u understand the importance of faith, and the importance of marriage, u would understand why these devout people of these faiths (not just Christianity) wanted to have a partner in marriage who has the same faith as them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am a non christian.But not against people seeking their religion whatever it is.<br><br>1) When you are so vehement that you will never be a christian, is it because you have tried to find out more about this religion and understand it and makes this decision that you will never be converted because of this? Or issit because you cannot stand your girlfriend holding this religion as a 'requisite clause' over your head?<br><br>2) If it is because of your gf's attitude towards relationship and religion, do remember it is HER attitude towards it and may not be representative of the religion in itself. Would it help if you keep an open mind about the religion first?<br><br>3) If it is your gf's attitude and how she looks at things, then possibly the problem in the relationship have nothing to do with religion but everything to do with character.<br><br>While many christians do feel that it is imperative for their partner to be christians, others just hope that one day perhaps someone they love can share their faith. If her character is judgemental then even if you become christian, things may not necessarily work out for you.<br><br>The religion itself is hardly ever a problem.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by edemonda:</div><div class="quote_body">I'm not with her ONLY for sex... I'm just saying that by having sex with me she has sinned and since she knows that.. it shows that she really loves me...</div></blockquote>She will love you in the will of the Lord if she is not having sex with you before marriage and not the other way round.  That is the Lord's way.  If she knows the will of God, she will not do it because pre marital sex is drawing you (not just her) to sin.  Having sex with you is perhaps an easier way because our flesh is weak and highly susceptible to temptations.  If having sex with you means she loves you, then why the guilt ?<br><br>Pre-marital abstinence from sexual activity is one of the fundamentals of a Holy Matrimony. Why "Holy" ? Because that lays the foundation among many things in life you do as a couple and being right with God.  To just list one aspect: your respect for your partner - if you love a person, is it then a must to have sex before marriage ? Even when u run into the risk of pre-marital pregnancy ? May i then ask how many men and women actually fall into the trap of an unwanted prenancy with the men escaping and the women aborting ? Even with many arguing that it is OK to have pre-marital sex, about as many men and women decided to abort the baby - so that is considered "OK" ? 1. Murder 2. Dishonouring the Body that God gave.<br><br>By speaking such, i am not saying i am someone who is free from sin. NO oh NO....on the contrary, i am just sharing some experiences i had which was very much regretted and still causing haunting memories.<br><br>What should you do ? I think both of you should communicate more about the teachings of the bible and pray. Praying is a powerful gift from God to let you discover solutions to your problems.<br><br>Being "Holy" is not a term to divide who is a Christian and who is not. Rather, it is descriptive of doing what is right. Even after accepting Christ into your life, your walk only begins.  The walk wasnt promised to be easy, but i will not leave it because it is good.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Christianity is not a religion, religion teaches one to be good... and any christian out there will tell you that Christianity is a PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD... full stop and no buts. Also this is a time of Grace and not law, Jesus died for us to remove us from the curse, so we are no longer under the curse... but under grace.. but this does not give us licence to sin... but then the bible did say... all things are premissible but not all things are beneficial... you have to figure out why GOD did not want sex before marriage? It's not because He is a prude... it is because He is wanting to protect you from all the things that can go wrong with sex before marriage... God has a very good reason for doing things... if you think it through... what if you get your gf pregnant? What about sexually transmitted diseases? Etc... and the list goes on... if you really did love her.... I suggest you and her goto New Creation Church at Suntec city tower 4 I think... just follow the long queues on sunday...</div>

Maybe not to you, but to me and i am sure to many others, sexual activities between a male and female is a form of relationship. He is asking for opinions, and we think the relationship is giving alerts due to pre marital sex and adviced accordingly. And with this the overall picture of Christianity.  The matter at hand is pre marital sex and the author's suggestion that his girlfriend is "sinning for him".  If these issues are not the key..what is ?<br><br>I wonder what is wrong here ?  Why as a forum moderator, are u asking people how to word their opinions ? Is that the practice in sgforums ?<br><br>If that is , then why you yourself - asking "What is Holy ?".<br><br>Have a heart to help is way better than folding your arms at one corner, keep real quiet, and then start smacking everyone at the end of it all.<br><br>This i do not appreciate.<br><br></div>
