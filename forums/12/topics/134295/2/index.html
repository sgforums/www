And seriously I have something to say not only to you but also to your girlfriend.<br><br>Firstly, to you. If you had been keeping an open mind to know more about christianity but find no reasons within yourself to believe in Jesus, then please do not rush into it. Christianity is not a religion but a relationship with God. So if you are not ready to start that relationship, please do not, especially if the reason is just to please your girlfriend.<br><br>Secondly, to your girlfriend. I seriously think she needs to reconsider her position.  It is of no point threatening you to leave for a christian. Yes, christians marry christians may be what the church or many christians preached. Frankly, I personally believe that too. But it is more than just putting "Christian" in the religion column that makes you christians. It is the life you lead as a christian, not the title you carry, that makes you a christian.  What the point of forcing you to be a christian? To ease her own guilt? To make herself feel better? To make things easier? Relationships do not work that way.<br><br>As for the sex thing, i am against pre-marital sex. But its again your choice and hers. Sex is a beautiful thing. It is meant to be enjoyed between a married couple. But in your case,  It should never be used as a consideration or tool to force another party to stay in a relationship.<br><br>All the best to you. I always hope people come to believe in Christ but I rather you come to God knowing that you want to but not forced to.<br><br>God bless you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>I was an ex-christian. Ok..sound weird I know. Pardon me. I just don't want myself to be tied down to any religions. Personally, God in my heart is a wonderful teacher in life and I strongly believe that there's no happiness in whatever that is gained through forced means.<br><br>One can forced someone to be a Christian but what's the use when faith is not there? It's almost like becoming a monk who still eat meat in the temple. Our holy father Jesus uses his blood, life, faith and miracles to gain the beliefs of his followers. He who choose death and live again does not force His children to believe in him. He who roams the earth can accept everyone. Why can't she?<br><br>Even the high prist of all religions can pay visit to the other temples and churches.</div>

If you really love someone, you should respect his choices.. if you don't even believe in God, then it'll be totally meaningless being a Christian...<br><br>It happened to me b4.. in my previous r/s, my ex somehow became a Christian, a very devout one...and he tried dragging me to the church and stuffz.. and when I refused, He said " You either choose my religion, or lose me". I was so freakin pissed man... I left him for good.</div>
