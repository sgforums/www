The problem is that she's a devout Christian and I'm not. It's not as if I haven't tried. I followed her to church for a year and still couldn't be convinced about god's existence. She said she wants to get married in her church in future. But it is impossible unless I am also a Christian myself. She also told me before that I should not complain if she dumps me for a Christian in future.<br><br>I was angry when she said that. I was so tempted to dump her straightaway. But we had lots of sex. I know how much it means when a devout Christian sins like that. She sinned for me. That must really mean she loves me so deeply. And I love her too. But I can never see myself becoming a Christian ever. I want to marry her and be with her forever. But I know that this issue will haunt us forever if it is not resolved.<br><br>What should I do??</div></blockquote>Hi everyone,<br><br>jus to share my little story....<br><br>my first gf of over 3 yrs was initially not a christian, but somewhat like free-thinker. But tat didn't last and she started going to city harvest under the introduction of her friends. I am not a christian, not anti-christian and never thought of becoming a christian. So i became very disturbed when i heard of the so-called-law that christians had to marry christians.<br>Now, she didn't say those harsh words like "She also told me before that I should not complain if she dumps me for a Christian in future" but i knew that eventually things will not work out well as she will be torn between following the "laws" and being with me...so i ended the relationship.<br>I don't want to sound like discouraging, but since she decided to make her religion such an important part of her life, maybe it is time you find someone else to be the important part of your life.<br><br>cheers<br></div>

So if you are not ready to start that relationship, please do not, especially if the reason is just to please your girlfriend.<br><br>Secondly, to your girlfriend.

You are not the typical Christian I know. Many seems to be so hypocritical but you seem to be a very nice Christian. Most just want to convert you whether you believe in your heart or not. That's not right, I think. Religion must be something that comes from the heart, a true believer and not someone who just say he/she believes. And to threaten him? Is that called love? Better if she can show by example how to be a truly good Christian so that he will really follow in her footsteps and really believe in his heart. Bravo!

Thank you for the reply.<br><br>1. My message is not meant as a challenge. It is a query. There is a difference.<br>You answered a query as above. That's it. All i suggest is that a Moderator like you should perhaps reflect on the limits of restrain. "Suggestion", may i repeat in case it is to be misinterpreted again.<br><br>2. And to the nice fellow who says "relax la..." thank you. I am pretty relaxed when i typed the message.   There is really nothing here for me to so called "argue".<br><br>3. Since as a Moderator, you have the right to ask of people to so called "debate" in another domain, then i will not thus speak of whatever you have posted here. In all due respect, i did not say that i know the bible very well or  even fully understand the mystery of faith. But i learn through my humble life as a fellowship of Christ, and i have also digested your post in full details and am happy that you know the Bible.<br><br>4. To me, i dont want to cheapen God's work through a "debate" of Christianity".  All i care about here in this thread is providing what is right taught by God.  The Bible is a living Bible. To me, it is not just a Book. Please be clear that it is not "me" who opposes pre marital sex. But God does.  And i obey and i say - similarly to a lot of people who believe in His words. Simple as that. Dont have to complicate matters.<br><br>So thats about it.<br><br>Klydeer<br><br></div>
