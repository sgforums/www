            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kennyrogers:</div><div class="quote_body">The story:<br><br>both of us are working adults and about 27yo this year, we have been together for almost 2 years. she is working in a 9-5job while i am working in a shiftjob. On top of that, i have recently started my parttime studies in my masters. hence sucking up whatever time i have left, on top of my shiftwork which is already demanding like hell.<br><br>typically im busy with classes, assignments, projects,shift work and i try to juggle time with family, my friends and not forgetting, my gf.<br><br>especially during busy periods, where we cant meetup for almost a week or two on ends.<br><br>recently, she has told me that she "hardly ever sees me", and that she is very envious of friends whom are either married or are able to meetup with their beaus many times per week. its like, theres nothing i can do about this situation! i know she is needy but still, i have responsibilities to carry out.<br><br>i wont be done till at least 3more years, in which i still intend to stick with my current job which pays well but is shiftbased but im not sure if she can take this..<br><br>Was this RS ever a good idea to begin with?</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You can't say that it wasn't a good idea to begin with; relationship begins on a probability-thingy. Even the most calculated chase is but still a trial. Therefore it's either sunshine after the rain on your end or death from drowning way before you could catch a glimpse of the sun's ray.<br><br>Your woman is insecure and she has constant craving for attention and concern. Most women would suffer various degrees of such issues because in the alien world of emotions, nothing logical stay rational for long. You could say she's being needy, but different woman indeed have different needs (Esp if she's a Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces). Even if she's being needy, it's still an emotional need.<br><br>A need cannot remain unsatisfied for long - it turns into frustration.<br><br>You understood her background and perhaps that would shed some light on her definition and perception of love. Her previous act of infidelity suggested not just her emotional restlessness, but more important, her inner conditions and how it developed over the years.<br><br>Chances are, those unfortunate scenarios in the past might just be due to the similar sort of neglect-influence, subtly creating a push factor in seeking to fill her void from other sources. Of course, it doesn't help very much if she isn't evolved because her experience will spoilt her greatly, inflicting a very deluded taste of what's love outside her relationship.<br><br>A pretty girl who has no lack of attention from others, ironically, suffering the lack of attention from her boyfriend?<br><br>Paradox. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I cannot say that you are wrong because your higher education is an honourable goal to work for. And you are also politically correct to say that your love should support whatever healthy dreams you pursue because it might part of your self actualization.<br><br>But self actualization and all that abstract, logical theory is mutually exclusive.<br><br>Love do not perceive any of that unless your partner is evolved.<br><br>To keep it simple and short, I won't go length on my thesis on Individualism and Mutual Commitment, but I can tell you that time and the right circumstance plays a critical role in making certain relationship work. Certain relationships.<br><br>Have you ever consider that if you had not pursue your Master degree, your relationship might not heed to the rock as you had felt? Yes, it might be an urban truth that if she cannot handle this right now, there's no way she's going to handle the responsibility of marriage. But allow me to share another point of view for your consideration. Just something different.<br><br>I will reframe the context a little: supposedly you end your relationship with her and eventually after your Masters, you found another woman and end up marrying her. The reason for marriage might not be because you have found 'The One', but chances are, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>it is because she popped out at the right moment when you are in better position for love to blossom further.</strong></span><br><br>Putting her into the shoes of your current girlfriend, there's no guarantee that she could also survive that as well because you can't never gauge in that sense.<br><br>I can quote you a similar scenario: couple/s having dilemma of one having to study overseas and transforming their relationship into LDR. The exact same essence of problem existed merely in different packaging.<br><br>Everything is a sacrifice. If you have to sacrifice part of your mutual commitment for your individual pursuit in life, then naturally it will cannibalise into your relationship. And that's no right or wrong in both perceptions - it's a matter of choice - the choice to pick her as your partner and your choice to steer your relationship into.<br><br>Sometimes, the direction we steer bring us to the rock, even if we never wish to heed toward one.<br><br>P.S: The theory of distance is often not physical by nature - more often than not, it refers to the absence of emotional presence.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't be too disheartened.  Women will always want "more time" with their man.  She might actually be saying that you don't spend enough "quality time" together due to your commitments.  The key word here is "quality", maybe it's not about the frequency but the quality.  She could be implying that u've been very preoccupied lately and wants you to focus on her when you're with her.. sometimes we don't realise it,  but when we have too many things on our mind, we act differently around people.  We women are particularly sensitive to those changes in behaviour, and often worry that it's "our fault".<br><br>Unless something has changed, like in her attitude towards you, or either of your priorities for example, don't see a reason why you can't carry on as long as you're positive about it, and don't let your commitments eat into the quality of your "together" time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>About the infidelity part someone mentioned.. some women do resort to that to obtain what they cannot get from their current relationship.  eg, if she keeps a "cuddle buddy", it means she's not getting enough physical affection in her current relationship.  But she came back to you, so there's hope yet.<br><br>Find out what is missing.  Have an honest, anger-free talk with her.. I somehow get the feeling she's aching to tell you things but can't find the right moment.</div>

During this period, she can do whatever things she like and you, concentrate on your exam.<br>If after the exam, both of you feel that this r/s cannot move on, part off mutually.<br><br>I have a friend who because of a girl gave up his Master degree.
