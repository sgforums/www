Remember, woman has a shelf life, past the 30s and she would fear being left on the shelf.<br><br>Once she is part of your family, she will feel [b]obliged </strong>to provide full support to her husband.<br><br>Women are insecure creatures during times of change. That is why we seek stable environments. You can provide her something, offer it.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>I somehow agree with what you said. But there is a nagging doubt that somehow she will stray like she did before in all her previous RSes.<br><br>Stray as in, that at times when she finds the current RS boring, she has went out and looked for flings and even two-timed her previous male-partners.<br><br>Although we have been together for such a period, there were moments previously where i accidentally chanced upon 'evidences'.<br><br>In one instance, when she was at the bathroom, her phone recieved a message. As we were out to meet a couple of mutual friends that day, I thought it was from them hence clicked open to view this message..<br><br>Little did i expect to see a message from her ex-bf that he desperately wants to meet her and he <strong>also </strong>misses her.<br><br>This alarmed me. "Also" ?. hence i went to check her sent message inbox and found a few incriminating evidence...<br><br>That she also missed him but wont want to get back with him for the hurt he has caused him. That although she misses him alot, she is afraid that she wouldnt want to let him(the ex) go.<br><br>This set a few alarm bells ringing in my head, especially with a girl whom have had a list of previous unfaithful acts on her part.<br><br>Once she was done, i casually and randomly asked if her ex was still in contact with her. taking note to make it seem like a random remark. without batting an eye-lid, "No, we havent been in contact for ages."<br><br>This sparked off an arguement that blew off into mega proportions a while back. Her friends sided with her and claimed that i did the bigger wrong. While my friends assured me that she was in the bigger wrong. But i wasnt interested in who was wrong. I was interested in "Why" she did this to me?<br><br>that issue somehow died down into a peaceful silence and along the way we got back together again....<br><br>along the 2 years, there were a few instances that i caught her lying to me... even though classified as a "white lie" by her, i didnt feel that way.<br><br>For instance, when i expressed my displeasure of her going to a wedding dinner of a mutual friend between her ex-ex-bf (her ex-ex-bf was somesort like a family friend and that she wasnt ready to let him fade off into her past,instead making due care to keep in contact somehow) and her alone, she assured me that she wont be going because she agrees that since he is not her bf, why doesnt he ask another friend along.<br><br>BUT. a friend of mine caught them at the wedding. Together, sitting beside each other and taking intimate photos such as "her leaning on his shoulder" , "him holding her at the waist". I proceeded to disagree with my friend claiming they saw wrongly, BUT, a mms proved everything wrong.<br><br>how can i grow to trust her when in the beginning she has already broken my trust many times?<br><br>Can i trust that she will want to stick with me through thick or thin?<br><br>Can i trust her from what she has already done, and what she has mentioned to me about in her history of RSes?<br><br>Can i simply Trust her?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i dunno why but lemme put it this way...<br><br>1.) she is always complaining and whining that im always so busy with no time for her when im trying my very best to juggle my time for everyone around me, even to the extent of forsaking my friends most of the time<br><br>2.) when my best obviously isnt enuff for her, what else can i do?<br><br>3.) she always ends conversations with a sigh and say things like "owells... i shall try to be understanding..."<br><br>This seems to me like she is 'suffering' and for the greater good, i shouldnt make her suffer anymore. Ironic? maybe because i lack sleep from yesterday.<br><br>Maybe she will find another one whom is able to give her happiness immidiately instead of having to stick with me, which clearly is her source of suffering...<br><br>Jojo,<br><br>I am not able to 'reassure' her at this point in time by getting engaged or ROM-ed, one thing is that although i would like to, i feel a certain sense of nagging doubt in my above post, and also that both parents arent approving of it until at least i finish my studies. And honestly speaking, I dont want to invest in a ring that easily costs $5k into a RS that i am doubtful about.</div>
