            <div class='col-md body'>I guess as parents, they are worried about your future and your mom does not actually mean it that way. I found that some of the older generation do not know how to show their love and concern or rather they do not know how to express it. So they express it the way that they received it when they were young. But I truly believe that most parents do not mean it that way and they are just concern about our future. What is most important to them is to see us able to 'stand' up on our own so that one day they leave this world, they do not have to worry about us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know what? I think you should use this situation to drive yourself to succeed even more, read more books, enrich yourself with more knowledge, get a job endure and go further studies, you will have to go through some years of tough life, but once you get through, you earn lots of money, and your mum, well you don't have to take care of her, but trust me, when you are rich she will be nicer to you already, and by then, that's the time for your revenge. It will take years to get your vengence, but it's worth it, all for your own good. If you need to hang out with someone to release your steam, just pm me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I also agree. Move out is good. Sometimes when parents and child are too close to each other, the dependence grows. Your mum still probably wants to baby you that's why ask you quit your last job (mayb u complained about it to her) but she also want you to be independent (that why keep making you find job). At this point, she cannot respect you properly because you have been her child for so godamn long so she wants to interfere in your life.<br><br>I planned to move out since I was 16, and at the grand old age of 24, finally did. It really helps, cause finally, your family see you can take care of yourself, and they are relieved. Respect right? They say it must be earned... and its true.<br><br>If u can afford it, think about moving out. Dont kill your soul. The best advice I had from a consellor when i was going thru problems like this was that i should move out when I start earning money. The fact that she saw something positive in tt, encouraged me to work towards this dream to moving out. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> but of course, moving out got cons also lah...</div>
