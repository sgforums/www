            <div class='col-md body'>I totally understand. I was unemployed for 3-4 months before I got a job and that job was contract. It was a very stressful period sending out resumes and waiting and waiting. It really drained me mentally and emotionally that no one seems to think my qualifications and skills match any jobs for the time.<br><br>Then in your situation, your mother adds on to the burden. I'm sure you feel very sianed rite. Well my mother doesnt really add that much oil to the fire but there are moments where she will start questioning my luck etc etc<br><br>She will say I have very bad luck cuz its been months and no one wanna employ me. Then if I were invited to an interview and it didn't go so well she will blame my character and personality. Even though I'm sure she doesn't mean bad and its just PLAIN MOTHERLY NAGGING but the words really hurt.<br><br>I also have thought I was going mad cuz of the waiting and unnecessary nagging but I suggest you just wait it out and tune out your mother's crap.<br>Don't give up. I have been working contract for 1 yr(a few jobs) and finally i've gotten a perm post. I'm happy now and I am sure you will be too. Heck care about your mother's incessant nagging and bad mouthing. Its YOUR life, even tho I suspect you live under the same roof. lol. Don't let her negativities bring you down. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Altho it is very easy to say " just don't care about her la" but you have to take this attitude and really work it to your advantage. When you DO get a job, NEVER complain anything to her and just work it out yourself. Tell your friends or smth. Cuz if u complain the same thing will happen again and you will fall into the pit again. Learn from mistakes ok.<br><br>I wish you all the best and hope you do get a job soon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with many of the other forumers here, moving out is a good solution.<br><br>I, for one, am currently "unemployed", but working as a freelancer. I gave up a stable job to pursue my dream.<br><br>However, it turns out i am not making enough money. I am still surviving, but definitely dont earn as much as a regular job.<br><br>My parents, however, feel that i should rejoin the workshop and forget about my dream.<br><br>Every day, they nag about how incompetent i am, even when i am sleeping, thinking i don't hear them.<br><br>Truth is, i have been planning to move out for a year. Am i feel that it's better because..... sometimes, it's easier to love your family from a distance.<br><br>However, due to my current situation, i don't have the means to finance my own place. It's like a Catch 22 situation.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes i have thought of moving out too and stay with my sister.<br>However my father is not very pleased with that and i am not sure if my brother-in-law would be happy too as i can only afford to pay a nominal rental fee.<br>Luckily for me, my mum works so i only need to avoid her when she comes home. Of course that is bad too since at her age, she is still working while i am "shaking legs" at home.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Hardymonster.<br>U said it correctly. This period has really totally drained me mentally and emotionally. I can't think straight most of the times. When i go out, i don't even know where i am walking sometimes and seeing office workers during lunch time just makes me miserable.<br>I want to congratulate you on finding a perm job!! It's really an achievement at least for me as i have not found a perm job since i started working.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>I could only find temp and contract jobs. It seems i am the only pathetic soul around with such poor working experience. Recruitment agencies asked why i only take up contract jobs. I said i can't find perm not that i don't want to find a perm job!!!!<br>I shall try to hang on there and pray for the day to come.<br>It will definitely be a milestone in my life!!!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by hardymonster:</div><div class="quote_body">I totally understand.

Sometimes when parents and child are too close to each other, the dependence grows. Your mum still probably wants to baby you that's why ask you quit your last job (mayb u complained about it to her) but she also want you to be independent (that why keep making you find job). At this point, she cannot respect you properly because you have been her child for so godamn long so she wants to interfere in your life.<br><br>I planned to move out since I was 16, and at the grand old age of 24, finally did. It really helps, cause finally, your family see you can take care of yourself, and they are relieved. Respect right? They say it must be earned... and its true.<br><br>If u can afford it, think about moving out. Dont kill your soul. The best advice I had from a consellor when i was going thru problems like this was that i should move out when I start earning money. The fact that she saw something positive in tt, encouraged me to work towards this dream to moving out. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> but of course, moving out got cons also lah...</div></blockquote>I also want to move out, but my parents threatened to injure me if i did  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
