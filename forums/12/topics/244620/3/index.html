            <div class='col-md body'>Dont think like you are useless- then you really become useless. Its called acting out a script that other people write for you. Try to like yourself, that's important.<br><br>I think you just have to project confidence in yourself, in interviews. Action first, then your luck will come. Cause sometimes interviewers just want to see someone they can trust, someone they can like. You project yourself as capable, outgoing, interesting, they are going to like you. Of course, you must prep well for any questions they will ask, even hard questions. Interviwers dont want to hear negative responses, so, even if its the truth, turn it into a positive event that changed your life.<br><br>Maybe I simplify things, but i hope luck comes when you embrace life- so good luck!</div>

Up till now I have had 4 interviews and 1 already offered. I am going for my final interview for my 3rd interview tomorrow. The amount of resumes I sent; I cannot remember.<br><br>Have you been eagerly looking through news papers? apply to jobstreet. Amongst my 4 interviews, 2 of them were through agency. 1 was from newspaper and 1 was from company web page.<br><br>What I can advise is that:<br>(1) Know the industry well that you're going to enter. Unless you're thinking of entering an industry you've never done before. Still you still need to know something from that industry.<br>(2) If you can do what you're best at then do that.<br>(3) Enter firms with famous names. It'll facilitate a better chance when you leave for your next job. Also it'll be very great if you can expand your job scope with your new job. Or become specialise on it.<br>(4) If you're in the technical stream, stay with technical. Don't stray to operation unless you decided to change line.<br>(5) Stay at least 1 year on the job.<br>(6) Stress is every where. It's part and parcel of working life. If you cannot handle stress in the last job then you'll be hopping from job to job.<br>(7) I conducted interviews before and I look at the attitude of the interviewee first before anything else. Many of the interviewers also do that.<br>(8 ) Never bad-mouth your previous company that you left.<br><br>There're many more others can add to the list. But the bottom line is<br><strong>Have a Positive Attitude!</strong><br><br>Good luck to your job hunting!</div>

Give them confidence that you are not merely bumming around. Tell them that you want them to be proud of you too.<br><br>Maybe ask your father for help, get him involve with your job hunt, show him the resume you sent out and seek his opinions. Your father may ask around for you if there is any job openings you can try.<br>Referals is always good.<br><br>Asian culture is very much about face value. Your mom also wants to have children she can be proud of. Maybe she also feel pressure and lost of face when relatives and friends ask how her daughter is doing. It is embarrassing for her to tell them she is jobless/unemployed. Please also understand her predicament.<br><br>Find out from your parents what their expectations are and how they can help you to achieve it together.<br><br>Ignoring them and running away from them will only make it worst.<br><br>I wish you the best and good luck to resolving the issues at hand.<br><br></div></blockquote>yah .. it will be good to make them understand that u r trying yr best to get a job. the key thing is they must understand how u feel, that u feel sad that u r currently going through a bad patch in yr job search n u need moral support from the closest people around u. not them to rub salt into wound.<br><br>haha ... actually it's hard to understand what's going through the mind of the people from the older generation. i fully understand what the thread starter is going through.<br>for myself, my whole life whenever my mother open her mouth to talk about me in front of relatives n friends whoever it is, i have never heard of anything good that came out of her mouth. so u know, my self esteem is extremely low, confidence low n at times i really felt disgusted about myself, that if i can strike a few millions toto, i will just shut myself from the world since people out there felt disgusted to be associated with me and have this lousy opinion of me.<br>that was in the past, now it's better that i hardly communicate with them.<br>the whole life they keep reminding us that we r losers, can never make it in life, don't pin any hope on me bla bla bla...<br>so u have this mindset that the whole world already condemn u to be a failure then what for even initiate to do something when u will never even succeed.<br>now that u have decent education they r telling us how come we r not as successful as the others when they whole life they been telling us we r losers.<br>really confusing n contradicting...<br><br>i don't really hate them or anything, i only wonder why they never put themselves in our shoes n understand how emotionally hurt we r to hear those things.<br><br>i don't know whether dreamssie r having the same kind of mindset as me in the past?<br>r u having confidence related problems? or u feel u will have difficulties communicating with people or u feel u tend to shun people?<br>becoz once u have sever inferior complex, u actually have a lot of worries going through yr mind, for e.g whether this job u can handle or not, or u need to be very vocal n communicate with a lot of people etc etc<br><br></div>

But sometimes if you look at their faces carefully, the smugness shows through. Although you wonder why they couldn't just acknowlege your hard work ? It hurts.<br><br>I feel that the older generations does not say what they really meant.<br>It is as if showing love and concern will make their offsprings weak.<br><br>We the younger generations are very different as we believe in telling our inner thoughts and hope others will understand.<br><br>Older generations are not as expressive as the younger generations. They don't show their true feelings. But younger generations want to speak out, be heard and validated.<br><br></div>
