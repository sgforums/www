            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Corals,<br><br>Perhaps you're simply burnt out?  It looks to me that you're working &amp; studying, in the hopes of achieving your goals.  Perhaps the pressure at work is exacerbated by the stress of your class work?  I love my job, but sometimes I also feel like quitting.<br><br>After quitting your job, the stress of Not having any income stresses you out, which affects your studies.  It seems like a vicious cycle <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Perhaps you may want to look into part-time work, so that you still have time for your studies, AND you have at least some spending money?  Even tuition will help.  You may register with the tuition agencies online...<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by corals88:</div><div class="quote_body">I hate myself.

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all.. you said u were the guy everyone kinda envied and that u have good sense of direction in your life n now u become like this. I dun think its the inferior complex.. if it really is.. you would have the inferior complex issue long time ago. Look into urself and ask yourself n think what has made u feel this way.  Maybe its the boring routine... maybe its the people u socialise with do not have the same intelluectual properties as u..<br><br>You may be at a stage where u suddenly lose ur sense of direction. Ur goals. U question urself and ur very being. U wonder why? and u wonder how .. just focus, stick to ur original plan. Look for the problem that is plaguing ur thoughts.. talk to ur good close buddies..  if all else fails man.. go to the nearest club, buy a bottle JW or Chivas n down it n u will be all good.. temporarily .  A few b52 shots is not bad too.. quite kick..fast n sweet. good luck ma man.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

You have just lost all intrest in everything.
