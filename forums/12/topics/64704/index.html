As a GUARANTEE, he'll still have to go to the court and explain things to the court tomorrow. How old is he now? He probably won't have the $ now, so there're limited things the court can do to him too...<br><br>If his parents are such PRACTICAL people, DO BUSINESS with them....  Promise them something in the future if they help your friend now... If they declined, tell them how he'll 'WILL' the fortune to charity or something like that... (though I'm really not sure if he's able to do that at this point where he hasn't taken over the amount?)</div>
