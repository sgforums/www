If you're in a combat unit, it's much much worse...<br><br>1) You book out everyday. Combat soldiers book out once a week. You have much more personal time lor...<br><br>2) You get to call your gf once in a while when you have nothing to do. Combat soldiers are either busy training or out in the jungle most of the time...<br><br>3) A lot more others lah... Just wanna tell you that your case is not the worst... seriously...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>alot people dont understand his situation . give u all a scenario  . Paying u 500 dollars sit down there do nothing , comparing paying u 500 dollars ask you to do some some physical work . For me its best to have 50% of each.<br><br>intially when i was a recruit in civil defence ,its hell lot of physical torture . after post out , its fugging too relax until u would like people to push u and give u some physical training . because once a person stays inactive he/she will start to think negatively . there the reason why you will see people AWOL even though its a too bloody relax vocation .if ur outfield chiong sua that type ,u want to think negavtive also no time to negative .<br><br>girlfriend left is because 1stly , hairstlyle change ma . therefore might not be as attractive as b4, and also the commitment given to girlfriend will of cos be be way more lower . age 15,16,17,18,19,20  u tell me you true love , my arse ah..<br>During NS its the best time to test how strong ur relationship is .<br></div>

All this well, I have battled the image of being a "sufferer" by staying active, exercising and pushing my limits. Nobody have branded me "weak" before. Until NS.<br><br>I'm PesE1L9. I didn't choose it, they make me do it. I asked for an upgrade, MO ask if I'm crazy. I actually admire my friends in combat, their time pass by so much faster. We get posted to Unit straight away after 5 days chalet in Tekong, then we wait and wait and wait!<br><br>I already feel lucky to be a storeman, at least I have something to do. Moving stores to me is actually more fun then being the solo PA. Having to do everything by himself. And getting shot all the same.<br><br>Worst of all, I would say, is that when I gather with my male friends, and they talk about their BMT and other trainings, I have nothing to share.

But blames everything on NS. And when ppl hear his vocation is clerk. Then he kenna flamed. Simple?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey .. Why not you just wake up of your bloody idea. Who also know army take up alot of our time but you are not the only one. Why blame your surrounding? thousands of people had been enlisted and completed their national service and one day... you will ord too..<br><br>NS is a good time to see how strong your relationship is. Dont blame the army for taking up too much of your time. I can only say your relationship is weak. I have friends who still have GFs who supported them. Then can barely meet up once a week yet their relationship is strong.<br><br>Why not try to take something out from the army. you are already a clerk and nobody can change the fact. Open your eyes and observes. I believed there will be something out there for you to observe and learn..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was a clerk but I went for BMT also. After that was downgraded to clerk due to fracture and also i fat hahaha! But i took pride in what i do. I got an OUTSTANDING/EXCELLENT on my COS. To get that grading, my superior has to write in to my S1 and my S1 has to write to CPC. I revamped the whole office I was working in, right from the DBASE database they were using, to the filing system, the leave system, the licence processing system...I did all these. In the end, no matter where you are, its the sense of responsibility that you impressed on people. Who says as a clerk cannot excel in army?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All I can say is that you're stuck in this situation like it or not, so make the best out of it, and make something out of this two years. As u said, this is 2 yrs of ur life, u dun want to look back and said i gained nothing out of this two yrs but feeling bitter abt NS and the gal who left me. Instead, you should use ur time wisely, do some courses, take up a language, or something like that, rather than curse and swear and bite the dust. It'll just make u and all around u miserable.</div>

That sense of personal pride, and willingness to see beyond their present state.</div>
