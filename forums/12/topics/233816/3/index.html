            <div class='col-md body'><br>Please go and die. And don't leave a mess when you are done. I think you are a whiner and a loser. Fancy being a 9-5 clerk and complaining about army. And to think you are being paid, fed, clothed and housed. I was a combat soldier throughout my 2 1/2 years NS. I am still serving my NS men liability now, with only a few more to go. I went through most of the shit tekans when i was in army, you name it, I probably would have done it. I was a stay-in personnel with an operational unit. The only time I got to go home is on Sats and Sundays.<br><br>And mind you, I served in the 90s, when the cookhouse was manned by NS cooks, and not professional cooks like now. We had to do cookhouse duty - cleaning up after the cooks are done. The food smell bad, taste bad, lacks variety, and has added ingredients like small stones... I stayed in those one story long houses at tekong. Look at the chalet you guys have now. And all those restrictions as to when you guys can be given corporal punishments. I was punished with pushups, situps at any time of the day, before lunch, right after dinner, easily into 100s at any time.<br><br>Heard of log PT? I did that. You seen people tekaned until they puke? I have. Back then, there was no such thing as heat stroke, not because the training was easy, but because people were tougher. You people have it easy nowadays and you still whine like a baby. Why don't you go fuck yourself?<br><br>The only reason your gf wants to dump you is the fact that you are a right loser who cannot take NS like a man. No woman in their right mind would want you as their bf.<br><br>Listen to me, serve your NS like a man, like most of us. Treating it like a plague will only serve to make you feel worse... something a loser like you should try to avoid.</div>

Very simple, if you think combat side is easier and if you are medically viable, why don't you request to be posted to a combat unit? All talk and no walk does not make you a hero.<br><br>You get to leave home at 7, we stay in the whole time. When you guys are at home watching tv, we are out digging trenches, and doing stand 2 duties in some forest, on a cold, unforgiving night. With perspiration pouring down our heads and soaking our uniforms, making our bodies even chillier. Next morning, we move off to another objective, under the hot sun, in our sweaty uniforms. While you guys are in the comfort of the air con rooms doing your admin stuff.<br><br>I don't begrudge the fact that you guys have mental stress. But we do have ours too, we fight fatigue, lack of sleep while we are out there. Isn't that mental stress too?<br><br>A simple question, will you ever trade an admin vocation for a combat one?<br><br>I think the answer is clear.</div>

I gave him my two cents. And how am I not being constructive? Pray tell?

Life in NS is much better now, compared to our forefathers. Even what I went through in the 90s is nothing compared to what they did. You have your stress, so too many others. And there are tonnes and tonnes of young men who went through NS before you. Being a clerk may not be an enjoyable vocation, but so too are the infantry men, the armour guys, the engineers... Many combat soldiers have suffered injuries that have scarred them till now. Some have died. I have seen a few in my time. You heard of any clerks going through all these?<br><br>True, you may say that they lead a better life than you. But that is very subjective and something that i totally disagree. But the thing that is not subjective is that you guys lead a very pampered life now, and you are not the only one going through this. Such is life, there will never be a bed of roses waiting for you.<br><br>Try to make the most out of everything. True, I have suffered injuries which plagues me till now and I have had a lot of experiences - good and bad, in NS that I will carry with me for life, I have made life-long friends, but all in all, I would like to think that I have become a better and tougher person.<br><br>Think about it...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I really dun understand why clerks must also complain about NS. All they do is sit at the desktop. OK maybe they get scolded by their superiors all the time, but combat vocations also receive that treatment, somemore under the hot sun!<br><br>For threadposter, wad u need is support and attention. Yes NS life sux, but dun forget many of us have gone through and passed it. I did have some moments during NS feeling down and lonely, but i told myself nt to tink about it as there is no pt in thinking. So i would suggest just do and get over wif it for 2 years. Stop thinking so negative all the time and life would b more pleasant. From my experience, those who keep harboring a negative POV of NS tend to be equally negative in the civilian world. This is a characteristic thrait in which most ppl will detest u of.</div>

We are saying that cos the topic starter said that clerk is a tough vocation. We are just putting things in perspective. Nothing against a clerk.
