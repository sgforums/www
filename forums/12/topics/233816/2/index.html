            <div class='col-md body'>The thing, with u people is, u all only focus on your own point of view, if u all have look at a third party point of view, to be honest, from all the post i have read, its all personal, it has no logical sense at all, instead of grumbling about how your girlfriend has broken up with u, or how NS has ruin your life, if she really love you, don't u think, she would have cherish the relationship, this only prove one thing, human are lonely creature, she broken up perhaps there is third party involved, which is the typical case, she wants someone who can be there to share her happiness, joy, sorrow, woes, she needs someone to be there for her, but you can't do there, as u have a national commitment, (N.S) on the other hand, u would probably feel, we have been together for 3 years and now due to this bullshit N.S, u want to break up with you, i hate to say this,assume, this probably is an excuse that she use to break up with you,and btw how old are u, 21, perhaps  its has be a breaking point for u, loneliness fall into your world, nobody can console you at all, what can you do at this very moment, suck it all up, and move now, find another better woman. Blame everything on the woman that break up with you, perhaps this will make you feel better.Last but not lest, woman tend to be more sensible than man, they could be thinking, since I am still young, why should i waste my time on someone who is serving NS, can't commit time for me, there are much more man out there, can commit as much time as what you have done before.</div>
