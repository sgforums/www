You are truly going through a bad patch in your life, I have gone through some other bad patches and there is one thing I know, it will pass. Not many people like doing NS, and even less go through problems like you did now, so it's hard to imagine what you're going through. I'm truly feeling apologetic about your situation now, and I believe things will only get better, I mean what could be worst, you must be at your lowest point right now. I suggest that despite your problems, you should be brave and look on the bright side, the reason is that if you go to work or hang out with friends, and keep complaining and having an agitated temper easily, what happens is that you're going to make people run away. Instead, if you take things on a lighter side, your friends/colleagues may try to understand your situation. Trust me, nobody enjoys hanging out with grumpy uncle.</div>

It's more on who ya mix around with and how you handle the situations which would make your life more easy or difficult.. Enjoyable or plain sufferings...<br><br>NS can be a fun and good experience when you're holding a POSITIVE MENTALITY, mix around with the RIGHT people and do the RIGHT things... Next time out in the society... You'll find that life is more or less the same...
