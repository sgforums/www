            <div class='col-md body'>Ok I am sorry for that, but I feel that he is really exaggerating in his announcements that he want to kill himself. It might mislead people into worrying for him unduely. I feel that a person who wants to kill himself/herself is really at the end of his options it is a very serious situation that needs professional help. What I am worried is that, what if we get used to people like TS claims about wanting to end his life and we get numbed and jaded over the amount of similar posts. And just 1 day a person who seriously contemplating suicde, posting his/her post here as a last resort to seek out some sort of help, and we began to think this is just another person like this TS here. And she felt despaired and really proceed to end his/her life. Will we be okay when that happens??<br><br>Anyway, to the moderator, if I have in anyway violated the rules in this forum, I am very sorry and I will refrain from such similar post. Thanks for you kind reminder.</div>

SAF should be restructured, remodelled and privatised. SAF Pte Ltd will still serve the interest of the country first before anythingelse. In this manner, soldiers get paid a decent wage and have a job which they will be proud of. Whiners of the old system wont have anything to complain about. In the end, everybody gets what they want and everybody is happy. On top of that, SAF pte ltd will earn extra income for the government by tendering for peacekeeping missions for the UN.</div>

Everyone of us guys have to go through that crap. LPPL! Anyway, you are not alone. Most of us may have the same problem and believe me that this is only the beginning. SAF will still hunt you after you ORD. However, just do what you can NOW. So you have to serve NS, there is nothing you can do but serve. So finish and FXXX off! That what SAF mean also. Plan if you can take any couses after your army for what?... Earn a better living LA! = You got money. GF? Now its a good timing to have lost her. Why? YOUR A FREE MAN! Enjoy what you can't do when your with her. Go Party with your best buddies or your new Army buddies. Enjoy every freedom you have now before you have to settle down. BTW! I don't thing you GF is the only girl in Singapore right? Even if she is, you can always import in or 'outport' yourself out la. Don't let them look do on you. Fxxx Them! Tell yourself " I show you!" "I will be happy and successful!" " In your FACE! You Ass!"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Yo! The key thing is don't let them look down on you!
