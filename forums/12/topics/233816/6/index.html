            <div class='col-md body'>After reading all this, I really Thankful that I was posted to a good unit and life was pretty uneventful. Never, had to chiong sua there, never had to clear SoC. Even for IPPT everyone is trying to help you pass. Had great colleagues and although my place was a mainly regular unit, I never had to suffer their politics.<br><br>Ord lo.<br>Even now, if they ask me for reservist, I wouldn't mind too much as long as its not too soon in my career.<br><br>The first few months in NS is definitely the hardest. Most people get depressed, demoralised and jaded. I was too.<br><br>All I can say is that it does get better as the days go by. After you know your buddies well, life can be quite interesting. Nobody ever said NS is fun except for some girls or gays who have not been through NS.</div>
