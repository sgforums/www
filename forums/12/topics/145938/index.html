If your aunt really has her strong worthy cause and her relationship with the boss really ain't that extreme bad... It's quite unlikely that the boss would fire her even if he claims that she's 'redundant'.. For the truth speaks for itself... If her boss does, it would only goes to prove that he's not a capable one...<br><br>I guess alot of EQ would be involved...</div>

One manager had taken part of my pay and denied I tendered on the date I specified on my letter just because he did not see it.<br>I could have gone to MOM but didn't. Now I wished I did. cause they are still in their high ranking ass kissing positions and doing more harm to more people like you and me.</div>
