            <div class='col-md body'>I'm finally back in army serving the remainder 4 mths after my uni studies.  All personnel there is younger than me, even my dept ic is 1 yr younger than me, my vocation is a veh mechanic.  Bsides this, I noticed that my campmates all hav gf, I so jealous, I the oldest there and yet I dun hav a gf, all of them even go niteclubs which I really disapprove, I really wonder why they go niteclub drinking and asking for girls where they already hav gfs, I really feel sorry for their gf.  However, what I most concerned now is finding a secure job, but can love come later? Should I go for lov now if I hav someone in mind or shd I conc on my job first, like to hear your comments???<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>
