Even though you and her is from the same school and level, it doesn't make her natural defenses any less. She might think you are one who always talks to girls online. And many more (only girls can think of those crazy ideas. I'm not a girl, don't ask me. Maybe FeowFeow? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">). Take it one step at a time. Get to know her more and make sure she gets to know you more. You can easily tell if a girl you talk to is attracted to you. A simple thing like "you too hors.. sleep early hors.." can mean that. By the way, i would encourage you to use MSN rather than SMS. SMS ensures that if the girl is polite, she would reply you and you two can have a long chat. MSN ensures real-time response and to me, more intimate than SMS. But FTF is still better. Phone comes second. (unless you and her have 3G phones. Video conference. Then i have nothing to say.) BTW, you're in the same school with her, right? Then maybe get your presence a little more noticed by her. Try to appear within her sight, etc.<br><br>So, summary. Talk to her on MSN more often. Drop very mild hints every now and then. (my every now and then doesn't mean once every day. It means once around 4 / 5 days.) Try to register your face in her mind.</div>

The easiest way to talk to her is by joking to her. Start by "suan" her or some sort of way to make her abit angry so that she will say u back 2. Once u established some sort of friendship then start your plans to date her. Check out her profile. Check her email, friendster or her friends. Find out more abt her and u will get your answer to the question. RIght now jus establish a good friendship with her. And don ever b shy in dating chicks.</div>
