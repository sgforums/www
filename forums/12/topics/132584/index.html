            <div class='col-md body'>He is trying to teach you a lesson in life. If you have the opportunity to find something at that point, seize it. In the brokering business, theres many gains and losses; those that change lives for the better or destroy them overnight. It is a fickle business and you usually see most of those who amassed a big windfall to splurge them all away. In this kind of place, one sees that money's power is second to none.  And many just hate the way that money, being an intangible, can wield such misery to humankind and by spending that money, it mitigates that misery as it brings perceived power back to the individual and perhaps also by spreading that misery to others in the hope that one is not alone and will feel better. So, this money-misery trap, lubricated by greed, goes on and on and the same principle applies for the IR/gambling in casinos debate where gamblers try to wage the money power struggle  in the hope of finding answers all day.  And about your folks being a broken record, every individual contemplates about where their goals in life are heading, what they have wanted to achieve, what were the things they did wrong, and whether they were realized or wasted dreams,  people at different stages  like those in mid-life are still fuzzy, unless you are some enlightened saint or on the death row. Whatever achievements must eventually be abated by self-contentment. For you, you look more towards hope and tomorrow. Logic applies naturally in your analysis of the world. For the older folks, they cannot do much more, illogics serve as a deveil's advocate, indeliberateness to buy time, and they can only use the past as a benchmark of things to come. Besides, it is also his ways of expressing fears and feelings about the dis-attachments that are a result of your growing up and losing you one day. So, there are always correlation in all these that we see in different people at different ages. The wierd idiosyncracies you find in many old couples quarreling or scolding each other everyday actually encourage and reinforce their togetherness to walk the remaining journey they themselves are uncertain about.</div>
