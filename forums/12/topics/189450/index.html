About your gifts... No, you shouldn't be giving them out... At least not at this point if it helps?<br><br>Sorry to say this... But from the way you've expressed yourself, it's quite unlikely that the girl is totally numb or stupid.. It's quite likely that she has chose to be irresponsive. To just suddenly confess that you're interested in her to a girl who has no previous relationship experience is quite like to shock or freak her to an extent. Do you have much handling experience yourself? Cause from the way you've described yourself, I say you don't seem to be so... The 'boo effect' from an inexperienced guy telling an inexperienced girl could be quite a bad math unless she's really keen on you (which like I've mentioned, don't seems to be the case...?)... The fact that you've ACCUMULATED all your gifts for her over such an extensive period is quite unlikely to touch her unless she harbours special feelings for you.. IN FACT, it's more likely to give her the FREAK unless she's quite an OPEN girl... If you really must, I say start SIMPLE.. Just a simple arrangement for meet up and birthday gift if you like should do the trick... (in the event where she is not comfortable for meet up, do NOT push for it... Be a gentleman and just give her a present...)<br><br>At this point... Would you like to explain why you think she's the 'hard hearted' kinda girl...? Maybe you should really be having more contacts with her to have a 'feel' of how she might be seeing you...? (note. READ hints if they're there and not simply to IMAGINE that she's interested or uninterested in you...)<br><br></div>
