We always have a choice to pick our friends.  It's not always us being picked as friends sometimes it's the other way round.<br><br>Why they do such things is probably they're mentally messed up.  On a positive note think of your best friends that will go through "Knives Mountains Fire Seas" with you.  Always remember the good friends and treasure them cos they are difficult to come by :~ Don't pre-occupy yourself with "people" who wound you like this.  Because they're NOT Worth it.  I think I've erased that "guy" off my memory.  Can't remember how he looks like although I still remember the hurt. No big loss though.
