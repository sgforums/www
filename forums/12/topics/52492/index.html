You want a lasting one, don't you? Allow her to make her own choice; you can only influence without pressure.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Talk to her about your female friends? If you can achieve the talk-about-anything-thing-under-the-sun AND if she does the same as well - you chances of getting her will raise by a significiant percentage.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Don't advance steadily towards getting her - the chase. Be her friend first and move slowly from there.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>breaking up only right? not yet break right? or u want to be the catalyst and accelerate the breaking up effect? i wont prompt u to go in rite now if they not yet break, best is to let them work things out first. you wont want to end up like a fool for failing to break them up... even if she is 101% confirm breaking up u cant know when she will bounce back to him, and u also wont know when that 101% will become 0.101% sure of breaking up..</div>
