            <div class='col-md body'>i can understand how u feel. It happen to me ytd. When i see her i knew she is the one. There is no other girl who can capture my heart so well. Speak of other fishes in the sea. To me she is the best fish there is. "there are better fishes out there", to me is juz a lousy form of consolation, at least to those who are suffering now.<br>I waited till she brokeup. And she said we are impossible. She has some1 she likes. we are impossible. If i were to continue we cant even be frens anymore. I've always been treating her like the apple of my eye. All i can say is we are all actors. If God gave us the script, we have to suck thumb act out our roles. Some ppl are juz lucky to have gotten the main male actor role. More often than not, it is not the love that holds us back. It is the memory. Wait a few more mths and ask her out. You will realise the feeling will be completely different. We are now trapped by happy memories. With me, lets clench our teeth and move on. Follow ur heart. If u think u wan to be by her side, by all means. As long as u do it without regrets. Im helpless as you are. When our roles as 'calefeh' have finished, we have to throw in the towels.</div>
