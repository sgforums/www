            <div class='col-md body'>...Right<br><br>Okay..I sympathise with you. I mean yes.. anyone will feel like crap after being cheated on. A lot of people have been through that and guess what? They are still living, they're over it and they are happy being with OTHER people who love them. You have a chance to do that. Trust me.. it happens all the time.<br><br>You say you will continue waiting for her..and that you believe in true love. I'm sorry but I don't see how a one sided relationship will or could ever be true love. The more you persist on continuing to pursue her.. when she is obviously not interested anymore, the more she will resent you. She will resent you because you don't seem to be getting her message. She does not love you anymore and will not in the future. Even if for some weird reason she decides to confine herself to a relationship with you.. will you be happy? You can't force somebody to love you. Its impossible. It's not like the movie where the guy constantly pursues the girl and she finally falls in love with him. Life is not a movie.<br><br>And please don't ever consider suicide over someone you've broken up with. Or ever threaten to kill yourself if she leaves you. Because that is pathetic. If other people dont have to result in killing themselves over a break up.. I dont see why you cant do the same.<br><br>Is it really worth it.. losing your life over someone who doesn't love you anymore? How about finding someone who loves you in return. Isnt that a better choice to make?</div>

Caring friend end up = caring slave. Then the girl find another guy who makes her so happy... leaving you all alone again.<br><br>Channel the energy back to your parents, brothers, sisters, friends.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think, even though you said that you will get over her, you still are hoping that you can get back to her. In my opinion, this is like a friendship. When you two have broken off, things will never be the same again. Hoping for memories to replay in real life is just wishful thinking.<br><br>When you signed up to walk this journey called Life, you signed an agreement that there would be changes. Change comes all the time. But it's how you cope and respond to it. Nobody here said that it would be easy to forget her. However, everyone is encouraging you to forget her, because that's the best path for you.<br><br>I think, that in the very unlikely case that you and her get back together, you won't be happy. The happy and romantic images that replay in your mind is just a fantasy.<br><br>Everyone's telling you that you'll have much better chances with another girl. You're too blinded by love to see that she's just harming you. You deserve better with another girl, and better off with someone who will make you happy instead of the miserable state you are in now.<br><br>Everyone is a loser in times of their life. What differentiates the winners apart from the losers is that they see what is better for them, and they try to get there. Everything starts with a try. After that, even if you fail, you just have to try again. Fail? Try again. Fail again? Try again.<br><br>There was this other person who posted in this thread, he/she said that Edison tried a thousand times before he succeeded in inventing the light bulb. If he hadn't tried, maybe we won't have the lightbulb today. Maybe we won't have someone like him to take as an example for a person who never stops trying.<br><br>Maybe you could be the next person who never stops trying. Maybe you won't be rich and famous for never stopping, but that's not important. What's important is that you are satisfied with yourself.<br><br>Personally, i feel that there are only 2 options now.<br><br>Stop or move on.<br><br>There is no reconciliation.</div>
