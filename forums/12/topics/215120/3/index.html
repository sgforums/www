I know what she is going thru right now and also she had 19 other boyfriends b4 me... the first 5 of them broke her heart since then she had a very bad perspective about men from what i can see, hear and gather she is like taking revenge on men and herself she won't listen to anyone not even her parents who time and again advice to get her back onto the right path but she just won't even give a damn...<br><br>During out times together I know that she is willing to change for me she try to quit glue for good by cutting down and spending a lot of time concentrating on other things i noticed that she is slowly changing for the better and among things she is like leaving her group of friends for good...<br><br>But after about 3 months she went back to her bad habits, i guess a leopard can never change its spots by then she was going out with this other guy when i was overseas training for abt 2 months.....

You will survive this...<br><br>You wanna try getting back tog can go ahead. If get back together, good for you that u can accept her despite some of her bad habits. But you must also accept that you may not be tog forever... and u may have to go through this again if u break up next tiem..<br><br>If cannot get back tog... move on with your life.

And if she doesn't love u anymore, will she even be bothered? Like someone mentioned above, it will only cause her more guilt.

            <div class='col-md body'>Is she your first girlfriend?<br><br>If so I can see why it's so difficult to let go. But there isn't much you can do. She's happy with another lad, and won't return to you. Keep yourself occupied with other activities and avoid her for at least 6 months (after reporting her to the authorities).<br><br>You may think it's not right, but let them take care of it, okay? You're not Superman. If she's not going to listen to you anymore, your efforts will be in vain, and the problem will simply drag on.<br><br>Eventually you won't feel any pain when you look back. Now move on.</div>
