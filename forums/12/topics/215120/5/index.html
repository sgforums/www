The beginning is always extremely raw and hurt a lot but after time, no matter now long, the pain will decrease. when you feel like hurting youself, YOU MUST RESIST! If you die, the girl will only feel guilty and upset that she had somehow caused your death. you said yourself that you want her to have a good life, right? So you shouldn't do that, don't ever ever do that.<br>In the past I used to hurt myself physically also, and one day I realized I shouldn't be doing this at all. I want the other person to be happy too, but it doesn't mean that he will be happy only when I am by his side.<br>your case's a little special, I suppose. She's a glue-sniffer and u r a counsellor. Do what you deem fit because at this point what we say won't get into your head, except for 1 point you must remember:<br><br>DO NOT HURT YOURSELF!!<br><br>no matter how much you feel like it, never ever do it. your problems don't end just by killing yourself. you just transferred your pain to all those who love you, that's all. And that would be very very selfish of you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Threadstarter,<br><br>The advises given to you are very straightforward and all point to one direction. But from what you say, if you really mean it, I think you're an immatured little boy who thought the world revolves around Korean dramas love stories.<br><br>I've seen similar people too in my life. And sad to say, 2 years back, I have a friend who leapt to his death for the sake of a girl. He never knew how badly it tore up his parents and friends. I still recall seeing his parents screaming at the robot which transported the coffin into the furnace.<br><br>We were all SAF guys then. Made up of specialists &amp; officers. Many could not lose the composure choked back tears. I recalled standing there with tears welling up my eyes and rolling down my cheek while I stood there intentionally showing no emotions. Then his mother shouted at the coffin "Mummy love you!" Immediately, her husband also echoed, "Daddy also love you!"<br><br>Up till now, I still cannot help it but feel pain whenever I re-visit his friendster account which his sister still maintains. I see more testimonies adding in speaking of his anniversaries. But the pictures will not change. Because there're no ways that his sister can still add in anymore latest photos.<br><br>You end up as a cloud of ash for the sake of a girl who had no reservations to dump you. And leaving those who love you? When you decide to take the leap down the building or touch no ground while in the noose, have you ever thought about <strong>life after death</strong>?<br><br>Your life here is temporary... but after death is forever. Where will you be?<br><br>Even if you decided not to die. But you persistantly dwell in the pain, one day you see her with her new bf, holding hands. Or you happen to bump into Youtube of a video showing her having sex with her new bf, how would you feel? The advises given to you by all the members here are explicit. There is only one direction for you &amp; that's to let go. Whether you want to do it or not is up to you.</div>

Avoid crossing paths with her.<br><br>Are you nursing any injuries? If not, make use of the gym in camp and go for jogs.
