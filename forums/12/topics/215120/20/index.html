Is becos of people like you who make others suffer. if you die imagine the driver of the car had to go to jail just for the selfish person like you. who is going to take care of his wife and kids.<br><br>TO ANYONE OUT THERE! IF YOU WANT TO DIE PLEASE DO NOT CAUSE OTHERS TO SUFFER FOR YOUR MISTAKE!!! DO NOT FOLLOW THE ABOVE EXAMPLE!<br><br>2) you suck lar. kena dump by one girl already want to die. Siao ever think of your parents who took so many years to bring you up. Die for a girl who dump you crazy. She must be laughing her head of when she saw the dump things you have done.<br><br>3) Ever wonder why she dump you? Learn from your mistake and improve. Do not be like a sissy still need others to advice or wake you up. 21 years old liao leh haiz no wonder so many girls feel that guys like u is still so immature.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wah piang... i just started reading AA and this tread is really bo liao.  Cant imagine a counsellor trying to kill himself for his 'client'.  makes me wonder if those helplines actually helps.<br><br>knowing that you're still in NS and doing things like that to yourself makes me wonder how chio your ex-gf is... or rather how mature you are.  if you're really thinking of killing yourself, go get an insurance policy and commit suicide a yr later (if i'm not wrong, beneficiary will only get the payout 1 yr after policy is taken up in the event policy holder commit suicide).<br><br>at least your parents will get some returns for their 'investment'.<br><br>get a life bro~  there're so many trees out there.  why kill yourself over 1 rotten tree??<br><br></div>
