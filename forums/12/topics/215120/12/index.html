            <div class='col-md body'>I think I will juz follow my Heart..... Lastly what i send to her<br><br>Evelyn I know saying all this to you is crap even your sister talking to<br>you, you won't even listen to her but please spend some time reading this ok<br>I believe this will make some sense to you or i am talking rubbish. But<br>please read this.....<br><br>Eve I always believe in fate well i believe if we are mean to be together we<br>will be together, if not just too bad blame it on no one. I realise I got<br>myself too blame not that I don't understand for being too truthful to you<br>but on the other hand I feel that the moment I saw you you are the one for<br>me already so i don't regret my actions but seems to me like god got other<br>plan for you and me, well I accept it. But I am a person that like to go<br>against fate like in My Date With A Vampire 3 Ma Xiao Ling and Kuang Tian<br>You I am like them so i will still wait for you I believe that you can<br>achieve something if you put all your trust and faith into it like when we<br>were together I put all my heart into the relationship till now I don't even<br>regret it not even for a second.<br><br>Seriously untill now i don't understand why we two broke up is it because<br>there is a third party or something else I don't want to know I juz know<br>that the three months we were together was the happiest times of my life I<br>thank you. But there is something which I don't understand after we broke up<br>you said that I am not being truthful to you, as a matter of fact I can said<br>that you were wrong i did try to commit suicide so that i can forget about<br>you, I can tell you I don't even care about anything in this world not even<br>my closest friends or my family members I only know that i want to end my<br>life because there is no longer any meaning for me to carry on my life for.<br><br>As for why I want you to quit glue, I think you can continue to do it also<br>because I am doing it myself now maybe it is because I know what the feeling<br>is like when you are very high on glue, at the moment I forget about<br>everything there is in this world including you, but when the effects of the<br>glue wears off I want more of it to forget about you but I cannot do it<br>because I want you to be etched inside my head forever.<br><br>Lastly Evelyn can you please tell me what actually went wrong in our<br>relationship so that I can make amends to you. I know saying all this to you<br>is crap but please spend some time reading this ok I believe this will make<br>some sense to you or i am talking rubbish. But you going on and on with so<br>many different boyfriends in so few months I don't get it I seriously don't<br>get it. Evelyn during that time that you said that were pregnant I was happy<br>that our relationship is now on a even greater height we even have the fruit<br>of our relationship in you and that is our unborn baby but in the end it was<br>all just a mistake in your miss menses, but I don't get it you give me a<br>second chance here I don't get it I should be responsibel for what I have<br>done and not you bearing the consequences alone, do you get it...<br><br>Evelyn please read this and get back to me, I really mean it till now I am<br>still waiting for you. So whenever you need someone to talk to or you need<br>someone to lean on I am here so come approach me ok, I am hoping that you<br>will give another chance to call you Lao Po again.....<br></div>
