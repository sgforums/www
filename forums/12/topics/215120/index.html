Even if you can go back, she will still break up with you again. The only solution is allow time to heal everything. Just remember this: when you felt so sad, where is she? By hook or by crook, get her out of your mind. No panadols, alcohols or suicide. I suggest you take a break from girls. Hang around with your buddies. Play some sports. Don't drive. Be patient with yourself. In time to come, you will find another girl and this gf is meaningless.</div>

But that is not the question here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>For tankh80, well, to ease the pain, you could meet up with friends, pick up a new hobby or a sport.<br><br>Remember to value your life.

            <div class='col-md body'>Death is not a relief but a more prolonged pain process for your family and friends... Just like me last month, me had to attend four funeral wakes of my colleagues and one of them was a suicide case where he jumped...<br><br>He left behind his grieving parents and a seriously traumatised younger sister who was badly shaken by the incident... Also he left behind a huge group of friends who grieved and cried for him...<br><br>Why? Just because of relationship failure... The world doesn't stop revolving for a single second even your girl had decided to leave you... It's good that you see her true colour of unfaithfulness and her easy crumpling to external temptations... Yes, you loved her much but she two-timed you while you are in NS... You said you would wait for her return to your side but can you guarantee that she won't two-timed you again?<br><br>You're still young and there's much more things and girls in the world, so why ponder and brood with her? Like some people would say, it might take two or three or more relationships to actually find your Miss Right, so how about moving on to look for your real Miss Right?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is so pathetic.<br><br>You are a counsellor. You of all people should know how to handle with emotions. And you cant even handle yours. Get a grip please.<br><br>Anyway, love is already lost. End of story. Like others say, no point in killing yourself. You are only giving burden to your family. Your family wont go and beg to the gal to wail and mourn for you. Once you are gone, thats it. You are gone.<br><br>If you really love her, then be RESPONSIBLE for your commitments as a counsellor. You are using your love as a leeway for her to do more glue sniffing or whatever. If it was other people, Im sure you would have taken action and reported against them.<br><br>What kind of counsellor is this? You have let your petty love go wild!! This shouldn't be happening. Do what you think is right. What you want is her only to be with you! You do not care whether she is alright or not. Buck up and see the reality please. Be responsible for your duty. Not fallen in love with.<br><br>Do whatever you think is correct. If killing yourself can cure your problems, then go ahead. If everyone is like you, I think I will be seeing lots of dead bodies around. If you think you have to be responsible, then you should know your own next step.</div>
