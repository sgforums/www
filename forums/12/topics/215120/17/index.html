There is no more relationship with her. Whatever you do now and whatever you feel now has nothing to do with her just like it has nothing to do with us. You are having a relationship with yourself. You are having a relationship with a girl in your own mind. You have created a girl in your own mind and is having a relationship with the girl in your own head. It is definitely not her. She is gone for good.<br><br>You need a relationship with somebody. You cannot have a relationship with a creation in your own head. In fact I would suspect that the three months you had with her, what you thought the relationship with her was and what the relationship in reality was, were different!<br><br>You really have very good imagination. Why not channel it into some creative project and make something beautiful?</div>

Just feel the pain and tell yourself that the pain will go away one day.<br><br>In the meantime try to find another girl that you like as much as her. I can tell you that it will not be easy, that is why I told you to accept that you cannot have her, but do not get rid of your memories of her. Instead treasure those memories even though they are painful.<br><br>You can work towards finding another girl that you will like as much as that one.
