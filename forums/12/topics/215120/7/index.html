(from your first post she shows no remorse), she's not worth it! lets just say, IF she does decide to come back to you, Who's to say she wont cheat again?<br><br>2) You are basically using your life as a gun. saying come back or else,<br>Bloody INGRATE! She doesn't love you anymore! have you for once spared a thought for those around you who still love you? how would your mum feel knowing her son of 21 years have been doing all these things to himself, all for a gal?! Can you even begin to imagine the heartache?<br><br>3) She doesn't love you anymore. that part is apparent. why force her to be with you? do you think she'll be happy? If YOU really love her as much as you say you do, let her go. Let her and yourself have a chance of happiness apart.<br><br>Tankh80, I know I sound harsh, but I really cannot stand ppl who regard their most precious possesion, their life, as something so CHEAP!!!<br><br>My ex tried this. and i can tell you it won't work. it only prove to me that my decision to leave is the right one. Sad to say, he is still doing this with his current gal,<br><br>LIVE for yourself. not for her!<br><br>You CAN and WILL be happy again without her, you just have to give yourself that CHANCE!<br><br>LOOK at your mum. your dad, your grandparents, Do you really wanna break their hearts for someone who may not even shed a tear for you at your funeral?<br><br>Please NEVER hurt yourself again!</div>
