The girl wants to find her love, let her go. Being together is what you want, but is that what she wants?<br><br>Instead, you should keep your part of the bargain and do what is necessary to help her get rid of her glue sniffing habit.</div>

Im going to be crude here.<br><br>You can't get her back once a girl dumps you. She does not like you and she is not good for you. Can you imagine yourself suffering over this girl while she does not care about you? You are a mentally weak person. You allow a girl control your emotions. When you are like that, it is such a huge turn off.<br><br>Girls are not attracted to this. It's not manly. She left you because the other guy was more fun/manly/whatever. The fact that you tried all means to win her back showed you are not in control of yourself, rather she is the one in control. Work on that. Work on being the one in control.<br><br>Learn not to take girls personally. This girl is nuts and she doesn't like you. She is not good enough for you, short-term or long-term. YOU DESERVE BETTER. Think of yourself as David Beckham. So many girls are waiting in line for your attention. Give them the chance. This girl is out. She failed you.</div>

Here, you are not only breaking the code of ethnics for a counsellor (fine, you are a volunteer), but this is also extremely unprofessional, to be romantically involved with your 'client'.<br><br>If I am wrong, kindly ignore the above statement. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> There is this heavy mote of self pity and extremism in your post. You are trying to foster that knight in shinning armour phenomenon, thinking that your love for her will enable her to straighten her route to a brighter path. It can be incredibly noble for such self sacrificing ideals, but we must have a common understanding that your love is NOT a panacea to her addiction because your love is nothing more than a speck of whirling dust in her eyes; currently, your not the only man in her life my friend.<br><br>Please burn this theory in your mind: if you are in a relationship with someone of inferior esteem/mental state - if one cannot enlighten/evolve their partner to be positive/stronger mental state, your partner will influence you to become like themselves. Understanding this, your suicidal thoughts are probably the result of being with her and it has affected you at subconscious level.<br><br>To kick her addiction requires little of your love; what she needs is professional counselling or intervention of lawful organization... to learn the consequence of her own karma from the foolishness of her doing. I suggest you give up having that idea of changing her, via having a relationship with you - that sort of love is terribly narcissistic. If you truly love someone, you will do what is necessary for her to kick the addiction, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>even if you are out of the picture</strong></span>. This is to the extend of her hating you for the rest of her life because true love will not allow you to haughtily see her engage in self destructive behaviour, if you had to power to do prevent it.<br><br>What is love to you? Just to have her by your side?<br><br>That's so fcuking self absorbed! Because ultimately, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>you will discover that the one you love the most is but yourself. </strong></span><br><br>You would rather <strong>NOT </strong>incur her hatred by accepting her self destructive behaviour in a manner where you would try, in vain, to contain it yourself, than to risk this relationship/friendship with her by reporting it to organization that could actually help her, in their own ways, to break her chain of addiction.<br><br>The addiction and bad social influence she is being subjected to is beyond you - it has claimed her soul completely. If you wish to live in denial, thinking that your love could change her... would change her... alas... please wake up your idea cause I am saying it twice: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>it's beyond you</strong></span>.<br><br>The bottom of all; you attempt suicide. For gawd sake, if you think that she is the one engaging in self destructive behaviour and needs to evolve, I reckon you are also in need to change yourself because attempting suicide IS INDEED a form of self destructive behaviour.<br><br>Read what I had said or scroll through with selective perception - your choice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Dudex you are not the one who have to face this type of reality. I too also have my fair share of breakup. There no doubt, that you will be feeling very depressed and sad too. But never ever think of commit suicide, it the most stuipd thing ever. Find some stuff to do. Example, go out more with friends? find some activity to do to keep your mind busy.<br><br>There no such thing call undying love. Soon u will get over her and than u know how stuipd u really are..during this period of time. Do thing think carefully.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dude, im sure most of us here have exp b4 breakups. Initially, we will feel sad and mayb sucidal. Thats normal, cuz we love them too much. Too dependent sometimes.<br><br>Time will heal, thats a fact. She dont love you no more, no pt waiting like a fool. Keep yourself occupied. Theres someone else better out there.<br><br>Most girls dont keep their promises. Dont believe 100% during relationship when they promise you forever. Dude, ive heard this somewhere b4. The lady is never your wife until she die.<br><br>b4 im wit my current gf (she in uk studying), im wit my ex who 2 time me. Im damn sad i went to shave my beloved head botak. Went to her working place , buy her dozen blue roses and beg her come back. You prolly think tt doing extreme stuff wit make their heart soften. But nowadays, girls are not like this anymore. In the end, i can only watch her being lovely with her bf and walk away.<br><br>When the time comes when u got a new girl, u think back, u prolly will c ur past as a lesson learn. Chill around for time being, give yourself a rest.<br><br>Move along...</div>
