Do you seriously think the girl will want you to die? She wants you to live well as her counsellor. At least, live for her and be a success to her. At least she will be happy that you lived for her as much as possible. At some point in time you will realise something though. Your life is more important than anyone else's.</div>

Really dunno how to get ovet this harsh times sometimes i really wanna get over with my life i try to take as much as 20 panandol with alcohol and still i am here talking to u guys, i try to commit suicide by standing in the middle of the road but the driver just manage to brake in time tell me guys am i seriously so stupid u must be thinking that i actually am right in actually fact i think i myself am very stupid why should i end my life just coz of a girl right but i really cannot get her out of my head i find that while i m driving outside i kind of like think of her suddenly and lost concentration on driving almost got into accident outside haiz sianz she is now with her new stead already and i also made a promise to her that i will wait for her to come back to me she knew about this and told me that she won't even come back to me anymore what to do man this is life anyway guys advice me on this really appreciate your help on this...   </div></blockquote>Hi threadstarter,<br><br>It is a waste to end your life this way. Because you have a greater commission to accomplish. You will have a career, the girl that God has prepared you for... do you think it'll be fair for this girl whom you've not yet met?<br><br>I advise you to widen your social circle. Get to know more girls as friends. If you're going for your uni after you ORD, it'll be a great opportunity for you. Else, you can join social activities amongst car outings. But open your eyes wider when dealing with girls who stick to the car/bike guys.<br><br>I bumped into my ex sec class mate after 7 years since we last met in 1996 when we went back for our O levels results. We're now married for 3years+<br>Had a number of gfs before and all ended up in tragedy. Did consider suicide. But now when I think back, how foolish and selfish I was to my wife whom I married years later.<br><br>Be strong &amp; let nature pave the way for you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, heard of the real case from my friend. One of his army friend committed suicide becos of a girl. I wun go much into details and some simple pointer for u to consider.<br><br>He was playing soccer with his camp mates and was very happy until next day, they receive news that he committed suicide. That guy's gf suffered from shock and her parents send her to other country to further her studies and to forget abt the past.  After several years later, she came back, forget abt all the past, living happily, starting her career. Her ex was just another forgotten hero.<br><br>What am I driving at? If anything happens to you (touch wood), all of us may or will remember that such mishap happens to  one of our forumnites. But as years goes by, you will eventually be forgotten.</div>
