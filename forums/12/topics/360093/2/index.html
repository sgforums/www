              <p>So tell me, who is more dumb? The person SEEKING advice or the person GIVING advice?</p>
              <p>You should be able to help your girlfriend since you are her boyfriend. If you give up easily and simply surrender to your own selfishness only to help yourself and not other, then I can tell you that you will NEVER made to be a good boyfriend to any girls out there.</p>
              <p>To put it simply, you can help yourself but you don't want to waste your time and effort to think about how you can help your girlfriend.</p>
              <p>If you were to at least tell us what you have done to help her, I can understand that you are desperate and TRULY concerned about your girlfriend. But instead, you merely throws the ball of responsibilities at us in Aunt Agony forums.</p>
              <p>DO YOU REALLY THINK I WOULD HELP SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T EVEN WANT TO HELP HIS OWN GIRLFRIEND?</p>
              <p>Telling us that you can't help her much doesn't means that YOU CANNOT HELP HER AT ALL. It just meant that you simply DO NOT WANT TO HELP HER.</p>
              <p>It's so funny that you can actually AFFORD to pick and give retarded comments to people who has taken efforts to read and post in your topic when YOU ARE ACTUALLY THE PERSON WHO IS SEEKING HELP IN HERE.</p>
              <p>Since you want to be such an UNGRATEFUL BASTARD in here, then you shall get ONLY ADVICES to console your own situation and NEVER GOING TO GET THE SOLUTION.</p>
              <p>Understand? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>you parn, ARE A SELFSERVING RIGHTEOUS BASTARD who is only concerned with people's
              appreciation for his "wonderful advice". Yet you only seem to dole out
              useless comments like "do you want us to advise you to sleep with her?"
              what the fuck was that about?</p>
              <p>I did not start with name calling.
              You did. and note: I did not call you dumb. The only thing i said was that your comment sounded dumb. If
              you took offense at that, you could come back and tell me your logical
              explanation about how you felt it was not dumb, or if it was really
              meant to be useful. Instead you chose to attack me, that i was selfish, ungrateful and a bastard. Ad hominem?</p>
              <p>I did not say i could not help her, I did not say i don't want to help her. I want to help her, but because i do not want to seem intrusive and overly paranoid, I came here to ask for relevant advice. eg. possible alternatives, are they really addictive, whether she can actually be weaned off the pills etc BEFORE I APPROACHED HER. AND I DID APPROACH HER ABOUT IT.</p>
              <p>If i was selfish, I would not even bother to ask for help, and simply let her do what she wants. I actually thanked people for their input, but your comment made me feel like I had some ulterior motive for the request for help.</p>
              <p>DO YOU THINK I CARE IF YOU WANT TO HELP ME? I DON'T. Because there are plenty of other helpful individuals here who are willing to help regardless of who the other person is and regardless of expressions of gratitude. If you have nothing constructive to add, please do not post just for the sake of increasing your total post count.</p>

              <p>I don't feel bad for all the other dense forumers who have always failed to notice this MAJOR FAILURE on your part as a boyfriend.</p>
              <p>If you are not committed to be someone else's boyfriend, then you be better off without a girlfriend.</p>
              <p>I don't even need to curse you at all, because I know that's the inevitable fate for guys like you who are not committed to your own relationship at all.</p>
              <p>Don't treat your girlfriends like your sex toys, cos girls aren't your slaves or sex toys.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Better pay more attention and focus on your role as a boyfriend before the inevitable happens.</p>

              <p>So you ignore the fact of why I'm here, and then tell me that approaching is insufficient. Perhaps you could tell me in your great wisdom what I should do.

              <p>Hah! Listening to any of your "advice" would be like taking the highway to hell. Indeed I'm an "ungrateful bastard" who has never thanked you for any of the wonderful advice you've given to me.</p>
              <p>So parn, how does it feel being a self righteous fuck? ego masturbation feel good?</p>
              <p>You disgust me. Honestly, I can keep both, and I shall be extremely happy, not only knowing that you were wrong, but that you lead a sad existence built upon attempting to cause pain and suffering to others in your mind.</p>
              <p>so go fuck yourself. <img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
