            <div class='col-md body'>i agreed with Devil1976. Envy n jealousy r facets of the green  eye monster. Most if not all singles r envious of couples u know or see onthe street, but u got 2 weigh ur priority in life n also whether the right person is right there, right now in ur life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's common to have this phrase in life once in a while.<br>It may be so called "unnecessary Feelings" by Yun. I would say that you're looking for a 'ideal friend' that can share your heart delights and that could be very subtlely sub-concious activity in your mind.<br><br>Do you always picture yourself and a girl (regardless if you're interested or not) having fun together in your mind? It can be just purely a very normal but special kind of relationship? Do you have all those images in your mind?<br><br>I think i've faced tat before. And it was quite depressing thinking that no one understands you and everyone else were doing their own things. Heh...it's all about i, me and myself.
