            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Ahworm,<br><br>Well, it's bad that relationship can turn out bad and hurting. Being together as lovers or couples takes lots of patience, care, trust and understanding in order to maintain the relationship.<br><br>According to you, you said that during the third year into your relationship, you took her for granted and thought that she will never leave you, right? If being "sian" with her, then why start this relationship in the first place?<br><br>If you decide to cool things down with her, you have to talk to her on that. Don't just leave without a word and not to reply to her email. You are being irresponsible. You said that you have changed, how? You have to show it not by saying it. "Actions speak louder than words". If you still love her, ask her out and talk abt it. If things don't work out, it's time for you to move on and concentrate on other things that benefit you.<br><br>Think abt it.<br></div>

The more u being through together, the more you will take it for granted. Perhaps overtime, feelings starts to fate and the "sian" feeling comes in. Think about it, did u make an effort along the way to spark up the relationship again? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>To ignore your gf for a few days is a <strong>BIG turnoff</strong> for her. The way you treat her is like telling her, "i am freaking piss off with you, but yet i not gonna give u time to reason urself out". Once, i gave silence treatment to my gf, which made her cry.. the feeling is so painful. She cant voice out her thinking and made her so worried about me. Dont you think your ex-gf will be somehow in my gf's shoe?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Love is something like fragile glass. Once broken, never will it be the same again. But if you like her alot, give her more time. Let ur sincerity touch her.

"i dun think we can be together again... you have changed to a better person, and you'll definately make a very good bf, but i no longer have that kind of feelings for you.."<br><br>i realiased i can't hang on to her anymore. i decided to leave her without a word. she e-mailed me, telling me that she is angry at me for leaving without a word. for the past few days i have been ignoring her like an idiot. still i decided not to reply. it's a good cooling period for me, temporary. after abt a month, the things we did start to flash back... i know i still miss her, still love her deeply... i messaged her... i told her i still love her. i asked her does she miss me during this period.. but her answer wasn't what i expected...<br><br>i have been thinking all these while.... she said she used to love me deeply... but the bond we built up during the whole r/s, doesn';t allow me to have second chance? it's not as if i never change.. i have changed, even till now i'm still my changed self...<br><br>btw, i'm 23, she's 21...<br><br></div></blockquote>Why regret when you know that your actions will lead to the eventual downfall of the relationship. Felt abit sian? Then probably the threatening air of breaking makes things more exciting? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Don't worry, you ain't the first case, neither would it be the last.<br><br>Throughout your post - you stressed alot of points about she saying how much she loved you deeply, great bonds; those were the days. Time change, people change. Furthermore, a small crack in the wall could collaspe a whole castle - you made the crack and when you had chance to mend it, you din, instead you made the crack bigger. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Chemistry and development of feelings is two different thing. You can develop feelings over the time, but with haste - you lose more than you gain. Your desperate attempt to get her back turns her off because she sees you as someone totally different and no longer the original you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Is not that she doesn't want to give you a second chance - she has already lost the love, so what's the use of a second chance? delaying the inevitable? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
