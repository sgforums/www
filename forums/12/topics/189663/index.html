            <div class='col-md body'>I canÂ’t accept that my life is such a failure that I need to shut myself from the world and hide away. Do not be mistaken, IÂ’m not referring to achieving academic excellence, being rich or anything along that line. But I feel so painfully that I do not measure up, even fundamentally as a person. Beside my parents, I hardly have any friends who genuinely care for me. My personal life is characterized by subtle rejections and unhappiness. After a long muddled period of depression and frustration, IÂ’ve pinpoint my source of unhappiness to 3 main issues:<br><br>1) Physique--- I hate myself for being so short and diminutive physically. I accept that thereÂ’s nothing I can do regarding my height; I tried very very hard to train up but see little improvementÂ… I hate to see myself in the mirror sometimes<br><br>2)Relationship--- Loneliness is not exactly a problem, as IÂ’ve long got used to being aloneÂ… I appreciate there are still things which I can enjoy by myself. But whenever IÂ’m in a social setting, e.g. meeting my classmates for project discussions, going to my grandma place where IÂ’ll see my cousins, I just feel immensely inferior when everyone I know is now blissfully attached. My heart just sinks each time I see another fren or cousin finding a partner.<br><br>3)Emotional detachment from people around me (in a general way)--- IÂ’m Â“likeableÂ” enough for most friends to behave cordially towards me, but not enough for them to include me in their social life. I could sense that beyond school, my classmates are not willing to spend anymore time with me.<br><br>It just hurts badly each someone I asked out (be it a gal IÂ’m interested in or an old friend) turns me down in a polite and friendly way. Neither would they ever contact me backÂ… the answer is so subtle but obvious enough. My problem is not about striving for the love of one particular person, but rather I feel rejected by the world at large sometimes.<br><br>I know my problems most probably stems from my immense inferiority complex and being too emotional/sensitive. IÂ’ve tried hard to Â“changeÂ” certain aspects of myself, tried expanding my social circle but these negative traits seem deeply embedded in my personality.<br><br>What can I realistically do now? Over the past 3-4 years, IÂ’ve observed my mood swinging like a pendulum. During periods of Â‘highÂ’ I would try to work on improving my life. The negative response from people around me coupled with a low mood would swiftly drive me back into a depressive, loner mode.<br><br>Sometimes i just feel so overwhelmed by all these that i can do nothing but lie bed with a blank mind...<br><br>i appreciate the time taken to read this lengthy &amp; somewhat complicated post... thanx a lot<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>pete_parker<br><br>Try asking a group of people to go out together. It is much easier to get others out that way. In additional, it is easier to 'break the ice' when engaging in group activities.<br>People reject an offer to go out for various reasons, it is not necessary be that they do not like going out with you. Maybe they are just busy. Try contacting them again who knows what will happen.<br>Everyone is unique in a way, no one is similar to the other.

            <div class='col-md body'>HmmmÂ….. as you know already majority of your prob lies in your inferiority complex.<br><br>Try and figure out what is it about yourself that makes you feel u cannot match up to others. Is it just the fact you are single? Is it because u donÂ’t like your physique?<br><br>The way to improve on your inferiority complex is to not focus on the Â‘badÂ’ points that you canÂ’t changeÂ… eg. Being short.<br><br>Try to change the things u do not like about yourself, like if you are overweight, try and exercise moreÂ…<br><br>Focus on the things that you know you are good at. Give yourself credits for your strengthsÂ…<br><br>Finding a partner is not easyÂ… some singles I know have the best of personalities and are good looking as wellÂ… why are they not attached? Time is not right yet I guessÂ…<br><br>Emotional detachment from ppl : u mention that youÂ’re likeableÂ…. But Â“not enough for them to include me in their social lifeÂ”  well what happens most of the time is that you must learn to connect with ppl. Like for an example, I got to know a gal whoÂ’s a friend of a friendÂ… IÂ’m friendly with her but we never really just talk, so one night we were meeting up with a group of friendsÂ… but unfortunately the rest of the group will be pretty late, hence itÂ’s just the two of usÂ… I panicked insideÂ…. Never being alone with her (whom I found a tad bit intimidating) I was worried we will have nothing to chat about and be miserable in each otherÂ’s companyÂ…<br><br>But as we sat down and begin to talkÂ… we just chatted about everything under the sunÂ… she told me of her likes, dislikes, her life and I told her about mineÂ…. And I confessed that I was a little worried about meeting with her earlier and she felt the same, she thought I was friendly but just still pretty cold, as we werenÂ’t that closeÂ…. Things changed since that night, we became genuine friends.<br><br>You have to learn to not just talk to ppl but to connect with themÂ…<br>You mention that when u try to ask them out they always find some way to refuseÂ…<br>Think about it, can it be something you say or act that put ppl off? I have friends who talk without thinking and itÂ’s offending, they are still my friends but if I were to just gotten to know them, I may not wish to get to know them too wellÂ…<br><br>Surround yourself with friends who are frank. Brutally honest who will tell you when you sound like a jerkÂ…<br><br>ThatÂ’s all I can think of nowÂ…<br><br>I too have inferiority complex. And I also have my high and lowsÂ…. But IÂ’ve learn to give myself more credit. And remember no one is perfect, and do not compare yourself or what u have with anyone else.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey<br>though you may say that i will not understand how you feel, i just want to tell you that you are in no way inferior to others okay? So what if you are short, only those who judge you based on your height are meanie monsters who do not deserve any bit of our attention.  You have to believe in yourself, that you are not any bit as awful as you make yourself to be. LIve your own life, the time will come when your partner will appear. Meanwhile just live your own life okay, its nothing shameful to be a bachelor or a spinster. The most important thing is that you must be happy. I know its easier said than done but just try wont you?

            <div class='col-md body'>I think yours is an identity crisis more than anything. Have you ever wondered by whose standards are you measuring your "inferior" self against? And on what basis do you conclude such yardsticks to be the appropriate benchmarks to be measured against? Look, if you were talking in pure academic terms, I suppose I could still understand if you failed to measure up in terms of your grades(at least, there's something tangible even though it might not be a comprehensive and accurate reflection of one's ability), but how you could find an 'acceptable standard' to measure your personality and character is just beyond me. Taking your last point about emotional detachment as an example, it's pretty obvious there isn't a particular type of person who would fit into all sorts of social setting - case in point : oftentimes, a talkative person is unlikely to get on with a quiet one without the pair ever regretting not getting to know the other party(quite simply, the quiet one will probably view the loquacious chap as being too noisy for his liking and likewise, the talkative chap viewing the quiet bloke as too reserved for him). Hence, is there even a realistic chance of having a 'perfect' conversationalist who could appeal to both the quiet and the talkative chap? You just can't ever please everyone in life, can you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>First and foremost, I think you need to resolve that ambivalent dilemma more than anything - what is it you really want and what are the things which constitute being acceptable?<br><br>Personally, I don't see how this "IÂ’m likeable enough for most friends to behave cordially towards me, but not enough for them to include me in their social life" syndrome should ever affect anyone. The reason being human relations and chemistry between people work in such subtle ways I don't believe going out of your way to fit into the culture of others is ever a solution to your problem, even if it's fuelled by a deep sense of insecurity. I mean if you had some common interests with those whose social circles you're trying to be a part of, I can't see why they wouldn't want you in them. That said, if you're not a part of their social circles simply because you do not share their culture(which is most probably the case anyway), then I don't see why you should feel desperate(and dejected when you don't succeed) to be a part of the group either. In truth, you're probably better off not being a part of someone's life with which you cannot really identify with and feel miserable being anything but yourself just to accomodate him/her.<br><br>Don't read me the wrong way though because I'm not trying to encourage you to be anti-social by any stretch of the imagination, but I think it is imperative you understand(and this isn't rocket science  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) that it is not likely you'll find an intellectual in the company of street thugs; a teetotaller in the company of alcoholics; or an atheist in the company of preists. In essence, do mingle with people if company is what you seek - however, do not feel compelled(and deem yourself a failure in the process) to fit in with a particular group if there is simply no chemistry between you and those whose lives you wish to be a part of. I'm sure there're enough people out there for you to find those who share your interests, passion and values.<br><br>I suppose if you could resolve the ambivalence in you, points 2 and 3(ie.relationship and emotional detachment) will pretty much take care of themselves. When that happens, I don't see how you could be that bothered by your physique anyway given you'd probably feel more confident and less inferior.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> As Bill Clinton famously remarked, "Life is shaped by the opportunities you turn down as well as by those you seize."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I suppose you should try to mingle in a group rather than focus on one friend or two.

Stop thinking of 'superficial' friendly..? Anything SPECIFIC happened which cause you to label them as that? (other than the fact that people could be busy with their own lives...?) Making such 'definitions' are really the only reason why they are 'superficial'... Not to mention that you're making yourself think too narrowly and possibly even in a very shallow manner....<br><br>UNDERSTAND... The fact that you're feeling bored / lonely / unoccupied has not much to do with how your friends are living their lives...<br><br>1. <strong>Find things to do. </strong> You've got nothing to do because you're not looking for things to do. With or without to accompany you. I used to be quite a loner (in fact to an extent, I still am) but I was never really lonely... Your life is how ya arrange it to be... And likelihood would be that most activities you choose to do would probably involve PEOPLE in one way or another to an extent... That's why INTERACTIONS come in... And REMEMBER. Those are NOT 'superficial' unless you're treating them as so....<br><br>2. <strong>Find closer group(s)</strong> If you have an activity which involves a group (kakis) which would enjoy it with you.. There.. You've got part of your life already... Otherwise, meet around people... Widen your social circle... I'm quite sure after a while you would just find people you can stick around with or a group which you can be 'attached' to...? But REMEMBER one great possible hindrance is YOUR OWN MENTALITY... If your thinking always SHIELD you from the others... You can easily guess why people are not so convinced why they should be sticking around with you...<br><br>Don't worry... You're probably normal... You're going through so much effort likely because you're trying too hard but in a wrong way.....</div>
