              <p>Put a hidden camera to record all the bad things they did as evidence.  Play the record to your dad and keep a copy hidden as you might need it in court in future, if need be.</p>
              <p>Peep at their passports and find out if all their papers and sponsorships are legally processed.  If not, report it to the immigration office and have them deported for good.  Work on lope-holes, such as to see if their stay required them to be employed and they are not.  I believe your dad can only sponsor one person, unless they are registered employees.</p>
              <p>Follow them on the next trip home and on the trip back to singapore changi airport, put some illegal stuffs (how illegal the stuffs can be depend on how bad you are).  Do that in the China airport during baggage check-in, not in Singapore airport.  This trick can serious kick their ass back to China and deported for good.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, ask your maids (or yourself) to spits saliva on their food, take their clean clothes (underwear is best) and mop the floor and put it back, buy some laxative and flavor it on their food.  Just make their stay uncomfortable.</p>
              <p>Last advise, find or hire a charming guy to seduce that woman and ultimate catch them on bed with photos.  That put some sense in your dad.  I am not sure the law now, but if your dad divorce her because of her misconduct and your dad can prove that he has many financial burdens, the court might nullify the support.  But before your dad divorce her, might sure all properties (those already paid in full) are back to your dad's nominee names, giving excuse that your dad lost money in business and these properties are mortgages.</p>
              <p>Let justice be done.</p>

              <p>Hmmm, well, i'm sorry to hear about this... That's really got no choice. He's your dad afterall and she (the china woman) is your step-mom which means u gotta 'respect' her cos' she's half ya mom.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No matter what, we just can't change the fact. So face it!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When Life throws you a lemon, make a lemonade outta it. =)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Life is never a bed of roses... So what to do?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I do personally dislike those China(S) even though not all are so bad, or low-class... Sometimes it's not only the China women (step mom) will do that. Some local ones might be even worst off than that. =)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So Cheers, ya? Either you stand up for your maids n granny or if u cant do anything, then try to talk to your dad (which i think there could be some little chance that might helps...) Like some peopple suggest::: hide a camera, Record what your step-grandma said...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whatever it is, cheer up. Only then u'll be able to get the clearer pic of where u stand n how u'll be able to help... =)</p>

              <p>Very interesting responses.  Let's assume the story is true for the moment and let's assume that this chinawoman is indeed trying to milk TS's father.</p>
              <p>My gut feel is that this chinawoman may have her own toy-boys outside (i.e. extra-marital affairs).  I doubt she can find 'satisfaction' with TS's father.  The way she treats TS's father, yells at him and scolds him, psychologically she won't be able to submit to him in bed.  She would want a strong man to give her pleasure rather than this weakling whom she is manipulating.</p>
              <p>But this may also become her Achilles Heel.</p>
              <p>In that case, hire a PI, get the evidence that she is cheating.  Then can divorce her and not lose too much $$$.</p>
              <p>Makes sense or am I imagining too much?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Sigh, has it occured to anyone at all that TS did not make any reply at all after the initial posting? Now that set me thinking if this story was really genuine. And as per normal majority of the forumners here let their emotions run high and called for blood vengeance. Tsk! Tsk! Tsk! Until TS started replying the posts here I don't think anyone should just freely 'give' advices while TS sat behind his screen and laughed at our stupidity for believing him.</p></div>

              <p>hello friends</p>
              <p>thanks for all the constructive advice and thanks for being the listening ear i need.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>just to clear matters up. yes my dad is aware of the things going ard in the house, but hes not fully aware of everything. and he cant do anything much because hes seldom around the house and even he is being intimidated by the old bitch. he doesnt want conflicts to arise so hes playing the peacemaker on both sides. telling my grandmother to give in while telling the old bitch she shouldnt be doing this and that, but of course to no avail since the old bitch tyranises the entire household.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my grandma doesnt tell my dad things because she hates to trouble him.shes already living under his roof, so she tells me she tries not to create trouble for him as much as possible. and thats why she doesnt want to bother my dad. and thats what makes me sad because she is suffering in silence. and she doesnt want me to tell my dad what she confides in me and so i try to obey her wishes. otherwise she might not tell me that whenever she gets bullied again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well as for the moeny part. i really have no say. im just worried that the bitch will manipulate my dad so that every single hard earned cent he makes goes to her and none to him. i dont care about myself. i can work and earn my own. im just worried about my dad. what about his retirement money? the company that he so painstakingly built up just taken away like that?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what i can do is limited. and i need to respect my dad's wishes. he doesnt want me to know much so whenever i try to ask about these affairs, he'll shun them and just change the topic telling me that i shouldnt be thinking or worrying about such things</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i really hope he has a plan for himself. i dont see why i should make up a story just to get attention? i dont know why people would doubt me.</p>
