              The chinawoman is doing nothing wrong, its only that you do not like what she is doing. I think she is doing a good job enriching herself and benefiting her family.
              Your dad, on the other hand is the one who is not doing the right thing.
              So you should talk to you dad. If he is aware, he'll realise that he is in a major dilemma, of which he cannot get out of. That chinawoman got him trapped. His business, the house, the marriage, he is trapped good. The alternative for him is to deny his stupidity, and enjoy the flattery of the chinawoman while she skillfully milk him.
              
              Do you know the story of the frog and the scorpion?
              The frog was carrying the scorpion across a stream, and the scorpion stung the frog. The frog ask "Why did you sting me, I am helping you across the water?" The scorpion replied,"I am a scorpion, I do what scorpions do."
              
              What is the chinawoman doing? What is you dad doing?

              <p>jaydunkfull,</p>
              <p>I'm sorry to hear your grandma is in such a plight.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately.. there is nothing much you can do to help her if she doesn't want to help herself.</p>
              <p>Getting involved with a mistress and having her tear up his family is a common bane among businessmen. Yours is not the first case I know.</p>
              <p>It is not a very good strategy to go drama mama on your dad.</p>
              <p>If he is doing a peackeeper role..he's likely not willing to make a bold move divorcing his wife ..AGAIN.. As a businessman.. he has his face value.</p>
              <p>Can you imagine a man.. getting divorce TWICE ?.. His friends and accquaintance will laugh at him for being such a FAILURE in his personal life.. and how is he going to gain credits in his field of work ?</p>
              <p>Since you are working in his company. Here is what you need to do to ensure your father don;t get gobbled up and spat out like a piece of chewing gum.</p>
              <p>BE INVOLVED , or if you can.. assume control of key departments in his company.</p>
              <p>Financials..- accounts.. audits.. investments. etc. Shares</p>
              <p>ALL planning and marketing aspect.</p>
              <p>If you can secure yourself an important foothold.. you can help prevent her family from taking full control.</p>
              <p>Keep him close to you as much as possible.. make him tote you around on his business trips, using the reason " Learning the ropes". Position yourself to BE his successor.</p>
              <p>And you really need to . keep your cool..Observe..be rational and speak up when you need to.</p>
              <p>If you go drama and emo.. your stepmom will use this opportunity to kick you out of the company for good.</p>
              <p>Good luck.. and BE STRONG !</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I find your logic is kinda twisted. It's like saying that it's perfectly acceptable for a psychopath to go around raping girls simply because they are who they are and are just doing what they need to satisfy their own desires, whereas the blame gets pushed to girls who don't carry a pepper spray in their handbags or walk in dark alleys.</p>
              <p>The analogy, "The Frog and the Scorpion", though interesting, but does not fit into the situation TS' father is in. Let me post two links here for those who wants to know more about it.</p>
              <p><a href="http://allaboutfrogs.org/stories/scorpion.html">http://allaboutfrogs.org/stories/scorpion.html</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog"><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog</a></p>
              <p>The objective of the whole story can be summarized as "to illustrate the purportedly insuppressible nature of one's self at its base level". I don't think "milking money out of SG men" is part of an insuprressible nature of PRC women, or any woman out there. It can be a motive, an intention, but definitely not something embedded in any human's genes.</p>
              <p>And to TS, I don't have much advice for you, but tell your father what your grandmother had told you. If you do not wish to put her in a spot, you can always convey the events as a third party. Instead of saying "Po-po say that old bitch bullied and screamed at her", you say "Last night, I saw that old bitch builled and screamed at Po-po!" (you have to actually be there at that point of time, of course).</p>
              <p>And you asked, "what if Po-po doesn't want to pour out her grievance to me after I spill the beans to Dad?" So be it. At least you gonna expect him to do something serious about it, because it's like, hello, she's your dad's mum? I won't say the same if he's an unfilial bastard though. And it's definitely better than knowing that she's suffering day after day yet doing nothing about it.</p>

              <p>I don't put words in yours or anyone's mouth. I'm simply reasoning on the psychopath example based on your logic. The purpose of that example is to highlight to you how ridiculous your logic is when you said that bitch who just came in and broke up TS' family is only acting in her own interests and is doing nothing wrong, and instead, the blame goes to TS' father.</p>
              <p>When a psychopath preys on a victim, isn't he/she acting in his/her own interests as well? So, tell me, would he/she be doing nothing wrong, or not?</p>

              <p>I don't put words in yours or anyone's mouth. I'm simply reasoning on the psychopath example based on your logic. The purpose of that example is to highlight to you how ridiculous your logic is when you said that bitch who just came in and broke up TS' family is only acting in her own interests and is doing nothing wrong, and instead, the blame goes to TS' father.</p>

              <p>This is a digression from the thread, well anyway briefly here goes.</p>
              <p>What the TS step mother is doing is distasteful, bullying the grandma and hustling the father. and behaving abnoxiously (abnoxious as we define it ourselves). I clearly said what she is doing is not liked. She has not crossed the line into insanity.</p>
              <p>How can that domestic situation compare with that of a psychopath, who prey on people, due to a disease of the mind.</p>
              <p>The TS father, is not entirely blameless.</p>
              <p>I am not surprised by the chinawoman actions, neither am I by the father's "peacekeeping" role. Both are not out of the ordinary. Both are not anywhere near a psychopath situation.</p>
              <p>The father is pivotal in any conciliatory actions.</p>

              <p>I understand what is happening within your family, I have an uncle who has the exact same problem.</p>
              <p>Mummy once told me not to marry a China woman, she said, marry the woman, marry the whole family.</p>
              <p>It's probably the one-child policy that has led the people to be so aggresive.</p>
              <p>+oil, I think the best way to control this problem is to grasp the financial holdings of your father's company, and to withdraw(or request for him to invest in you) as much funds as possible, placing them under your own name. By doing so, the assets will be under you and no longer under him.</p>
              <p>Furthermore with your property not being under your father's name, you're on the losing end no matter what. Chances are the woman is going to will her assets within her own family.</p>
              <p>However, there are really nice China Chinese Woman, regardless of these stereotypes, but no matter what, marriage is never about 2 people. Factor in her family and WHAMP! The woman might be diamond! But her family is gonna be hot coal you have to walk over.</p>
