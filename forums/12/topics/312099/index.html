              <p>my dad married this china bitch. she was the one who broke my family apart. ive seen her ugliness since i was a kid. when my dad bring my sis and i out on weekends, she'll call and bug him, make a lot of noise, accuse him of being with my mom still even though he was with us. she'll be damn loud and unreasonable with her ramblings and my dad would quarrel with her over the phone both sides screaming away while my sis and i would cower at the back seat of the car, watching and not daring to make a sound.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>later on they got married and i had to meet her whenever i visited my dad. she was friendly and nice in front of us but i know there are many things going on that we didnt know. it was just a front she was putting on. so she worked with my dad in the office. slowly, she brought over more and more of her family. first it was her mom, then her sis and family, who were working for my dad, then her dad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in the mean time, she convinced my dad to buy property. it wasnt in my dad's nature to invest so heavily as he has never done so all the while before he met this bitch. she convinced him to buy a merc. he even bought a unit at sentosa cove under the bitch's mom's name! it just struck me as weird that my dad was owning so much property. and he isnt making big money. im suspecting that all these property would eventually land in the hands of these chinese bastards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so now they are living in this landed property. my dad, the bitch, the bitch's mom. my grandma their children and 2 maids. this old bitch(bitch's mom) is damn evil. she is very bad to my grandma and the maids. she'll verbally abuse my grandma and the maids, always scolding them and screaming at them. as though she was the one owning the house. screw her la. if not for my dad would she even be here? she'd order the maids around and once she even slapped one of them! even my grandmother (dad's mom) doesnt do that.she's like a bloody tyrant in the house. and everyone else, including my dad and grandma would give in to her. they are the ones compromising and listening to the old bitch. she stays on, citing the reason that she has to look after their kids. what bullshit. she doesnt do anything. its the maids looking after the kids and all she does is sleep and go to church.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>there will be conflicts and my dad being the peaceloving kind would just give in to her. and my grandma too. that old bitch disconnects the phone so my grandma cant call people. and my grandma is bed ridden so she cannot defend herself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that f old bitch doesnt give the maids enough to eat. for lunch, there would just be the two old people and the maids at home. she would disallow the maids to cook more than one dish. this is abuse man. they eat only rice and one dish, which is usually vege call that lunch. how is that enough?! and no one dares to stand up to her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that old bitch is f unreasonable. so shell make a lot of noise saying we are the ones who are driving her away and keep threatening to want to go home back to china. and to appease matters, my grandma was asked to coax her to come back and live with them ( she went away to stay with her other daughter after one of the conflicts) like what nonsense is this. she is the one who is in the wrong and we are the ones who are always giving in to her. even my grandma is being bullied by her you know! and all she can do is keep quiet and shou wei qu.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>like what the hell and my grandma called me and told her over the phone crying. and i dont know how to help you know. i feel so helpless. i dont want to see my grandma suffer and get bullied like that</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>screw those bloody china people. havent they done enough damage to my family, to many other families, to many people's ricebowls</p>

              <p>From your post, I could imagine your frustrations and anger. However, as this situation is actually caused by yours lovingly - Dad, had you spoken to him privately as to what is he actually going to do with the misery that your step mom has caused. I don't for one single moment of your post what your dad is doing whilst all these is taking place. Don't tell me he's that blind to all the damages?</p>
              <p>I do not think any amount of words and postings here will change much to your situation unless your dad do something about this. I cannot say much lest to offer my sympathy and a listening ear.</p>
              <p>I think you will need to see if your dad has planned for his retirement and departure, so please have a talk with him asap. I think with such complicated relations I hope that he would be wise enough to draft our a will to avoid the hassle of future conflicts  over property, businesses and assets.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents worth.</p>

              <p>TS, personally i feel that you should talk to your dad. dont know what your china mum has over him, but you should push the issue of your grandma being abused.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if need be, hire a good lawyer to see how to sort things out to ensure that should the worst happen, at least your dad and your family will be able to retain at least a good portion of your dad's hard earned money and assets. dont let them take away everything that your dad has worked so hard for!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i sympathise with your situation and hope that things will turn out for the better. maybe last time when you and your sis were young, can't do much. but now that you've grown up, time to make a difference. indifference is your enemy. all the best.</p>

              <p>K, i take back what i said. but i feel better on err on the side of caution. even if TS is a fake story, why not give him the benefit of the doubt and help? honestly IMHO what he says might be  true, i have personally encountered a few cases similar to his.</p>

              <p>Hmm, your 'story' sounded too far-fetched and too dramatic leh like those hokkien Taiwan serial. Sure it's real or you wuliao and made up this tale to entice us to readleh?</p>
              <p>Your 'lao beh' so blind one meh? Cannot see all these things happening even though it's right under his nose?</p>
              <p>And you? How old are you ah? How come you know all these are happening in so detailed situation? Eh you said, the old bitch disconnect the phone then how come your grandma can still call you one ah? Then you said your grandma bedridden. Eh bedridden can still make call meh? Your story too many loopholes leh.</p>
              <p>Okilah, assume you say all these are true how come you never stand up for your grandma? If your father really so blind and no one can help your grandma best is to go to town council and seek the committee for help leh. You just vent here no use mah. Must be on the go! Action speak louder than words. Go seek help lah.</p>
              <p>But don't just bluff bluff because in reality you just don't like PRC people hor and you just want to give them a bad name.</p>

              <p>jaydunkfull,</p>
              <p>How's the relationship between you and your father ?</p>
              <p>Legally married is not a big deal.. divorce doesn't mean she'll take everything.</p>
              <p>If your father is a businessman, he's not as stupid as you think.</p>
              <p>How many children your father and your stepmom has together ? If yes, are they closer to your father than you and your sis ?</p>
              <p>Now is the time you need to tighten up your father-daughter relationship.</p>
              <p>Have you seek advise from your mother ?</p>
              <p>She will also want to make sure your interests are protected.</p>
