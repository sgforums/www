With situations like this, it is difficult to gauge the real scene, but I suggest your friend to date his gf out and have this nice talk to her. There are tactics to find out through communication:<br><br>She is standing at advantage. Under Beggar Theory, useless to employ pressure. I suggest use emotional wordings and style of communication (especially against Cancer, Pisces, Scorpio). Never start the session with a bout of scolding. She will never talk in this way. Place empathy, hold temper, seek understanding and always show concern. Gradually she will give in and reveal the things that are happening provided situations are revolved around non-love external matters. E.g. family problem, rebellious, etc.<br><br>If it is a change of heart, she may not expressed them if the above tactic were to employ. Then, observe a time frame to keep check.<br><br>Cheers   </div></blockquote>Good one...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
