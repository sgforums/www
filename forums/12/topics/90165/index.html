The world is more cruel than you think, if you are not the bad guy, others will gladly be. Treating others badly or deceive them to pull yourself up the ladder is ALRIGHT, but rule of thumb is try not to get caught doing so.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
