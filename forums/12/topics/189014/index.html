            <div class='col-md body'>1stly, there is nothing wrong with effeminate men. It makes the variety and diversity of human life so much more interesting. If every guy was some macho-wannabe MCP male, it would be boring and honestly, quite disgusting.<br><br>2ndly, u should clarify with him, if he wants to be treated as a male or a female. U never know, your friend might be transgendered. In that case, according to his wishes, u should respect them and treat him as he wishes to be treated. This is esp important since u have said you are his friend.<br><br>Assuming he does say he wants u to treat him like a guy, then treat him like one, but don't expect him to live according to your own social prejudices of gender. A bit of acceptance and tolerance, especially from a friend, is not unreasonable right?<br><br>Otherwise, if u cannot deal with the fact that he might be an effeminate male or a transgendered female, u might as well break up friendship with him. He deserves a better friend than one who cannot accepts his friends for who they are.</div>
