              <p>Because I can only see two reasons why you want to apologize. You have a conscience and you really want to apologize for something so vile you did. Or you want to get back with her or something. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Just make sure you're not taking advantage of her emotionally, just
              because you find out she likes you doesn't mean you should turn 180
              degrees and reciprocate. Sure it'll make her happy, but will you be
              happy?</p>
              <p>But if you want to sorta fix things and probably be
              friends after, then you have to stop trying to say what you want to say
              and just say it.</p>

              <p>The question now is, are you thinking of her out of guilt, or are you thinking of her, because you have now fallen in love with her?</p>
              <p>If it is out of guilt, just leave her be. If you apologise for not reciprocating her feelings, the only thing you will be doing is lightening your own guilt - but at the cost of her feelings. She would feel even worse than she is now, and you will have hurt her even deeper.</p>
              <p>If you find yourself falling for her now, then go after her. There is no need to hold anything back, just tell her directly that you like her and want her to go out with you. But make sure you are serious about it, and not just fooling arond with her.</p>

              <p>It is good that you doubt yourself instead of jumping right into a relationship with her.</p>
              <p>But don't wait too long, she might look for another guy for support, and once you comfirmed your feelings for her, it might be too late already.</p>
              <p>Wait till you are sure and ready before you approach her; apologise to her, and ask her out with you.</p>
              <p>As I said before, if you find yourself not to have any true feelings for her, then just leave her be. If you apologise to her and tell her that you do not want a relationship with her, it will only make her even more upset.</p>

              give her some time to accept and absorb the facts. 
              
              after a while if she's still showing u a cold shoulder or not acting normal, confront her. i do admire guys who got the guts to confront matters at hand, instead of avoiding the problem. if she's mature enough she'll try and tell you what she's angry about etc. 
              
              if everything is good, u both might be back as friends again. :D
