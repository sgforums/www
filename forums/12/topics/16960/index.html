            <div class='col-md body'>Short one... In fact TWO. I have the habit of staying back in the office to chat alone in the evening at times.<br>During the last 7th month, I was using the PC facing my office's glass doors. As the PC is in a 'show case' facing the user upwards, I was looking down MOST of the time. Halfway through typing, I noticed the presence of a person's face (reflected by the PC screen's light as the whole place is dark without lights on) staring into my PC in front of me.... I just slowly looked up and looked around but saw nothing... The place's very much empty. So I just dismissed it as a fact that I've been staring into the PC for too long. The next day I just suddenly fall very sick. I was quite ok around these days, can't understand the cause of it. I just dismissed it as I've caught a cold for staying back late in office.<br>This 7th month I was more wary because of my previous falling sick experience. I was using the PC in the PC room. Again ALONE. 1st I thought I heard chains sound along the corrider just outside the PC room. I took a look and saw nothing. Then I continued. This time round I felt a gush of wind rushing along the corridor towards my direction. &lt;- Heard the gush of wind and felt it as it rushes into the PC room... VERY STRONG and cannot be mistaken. Just to add, our office is an ENCLOSED area. No wind can blow from outside. Never happened before, not even in the daytime. Try opening the limited windows during a heavy rainy day with lots of strong wind and the effect would be DIMINISHED due to the layout of the rooms. (By the way, the air-con's also automatically off after a timing) I just continued typing and dismissed the wind. Shortly after I felt a 'presence' on the chair besides me staring at me as I look into the PC... (Once again a reflection on the 'person' because of the screen. Oh ya, it's DARK in there.) I turned to look at it. Empty. But the chair is placed in such a way that it's facing me (or my PC) instead of facing the PC infront of it. I figured out that it SHOULD be facing the PC OR the other way direction as the person leaving the seat should be turning the other direction for the door. Weird? I DISMISSED it and continued chatting. The next day I fall REAL SICK. On MCs for 2 days and still can't recover.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> It happened during the period of AA Outing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Apart from being a supernatural force, 3 other RATIONAL explanations I can give to you would be...<br><br>1. A dream<br>2. I don't know how to explain this, but kinda like a 'sudden shock' or at times TREMBLING kind of feeling when you are sleeping. Something 'normal'?<br>3. You're having a SEIZURE. Meaning your brain was emitting ABNORMAL waveforms.<br></div>

In fact TWO. I have the habit of staying back in the office to chat alone in the evening at times.<br>During the last 7th month, I was using the PC facing my office's glass doors. As the PC is in a 'show case' facing the user upwards, I was looking down MOST of the time. Halfway through typing, I noticed the presence of a person's face (reflected by the PC screen's light as the whole place is dark without lights on) staring into my PC in front of me.... I just slowly looked up and looked around but saw nothing... The place's very much empty. So I just dismissed it as a fact that I've been staring into the PC for too long. The next day I just suddenly fall very sick. I was quite ok around these days, can't understand the cause of it. I just dismissed it as I've caught a cold for staying back late in office.<br>This 7th month I was more wary because of my previous falling sick experience. I was using the PC in the PC room. Again ALONE. 1st I thought I heard chains sound along the corrider just outside the PC room. I took a look and saw nothing. Then I continued. This time round I felt a gush of wind rushing along the corridor towards my direction. &lt;- Heard the gush of wind and felt it as it rushes into the PC room... VERY STRONG and cannot be mistaken. Just to add, our office is an ENCLOSED area. No wind can blow from outside. Never happened before, not even in the daytime. Try opening the limited windows during a heavy rainy day with lots of strong wind and the effect would be DIMINISHED due to the layout of the rooms. (By the way, the air-con's also automatically off after a timing) I just continued typing and dismissed the wind. Shortly after I felt a 'presence' on the chair besides me staring at me as I look into the PC... (Once again a reflection on the 'person' because of the screen. Oh ya, it's DARK in there.) I turned to look at it. Empty. But the chair is placed in such a way that it's facing me (or my PC) instead of facing the PC infront of it. I figured out that it SHOULD be facing the PC OR the other way direction as the person leaving the seat should be turning the other direction for the door. Weird? I DISMISSED it and continued chatting. The next day I fall REAL SICK. On MCs for 2 days and still can't recover.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> It happened during the period of AA Outing.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div></blockquote>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)
