I dont think so... but honestly speaking, I really tried my best for my O lvls last yr.. not only for maths.. but for other subjects as well.. but all the worrying and the "wad ifs"  keep appearing in my mind.. for example, wad if I cant get into poly IT course if I fail my maths how? coz I heard tat without maths, the chance of getting into a poly course is very slim.. almost none.. and even if u appeal to the lecturers, they wont give a damn to u if u never met requirements.. Wad if I fail my maths so badly till I cant even enter a ITE computer course how? wad will my relatives say about me? I am 19 this yr btw.. I repeated once in my N lvls.. during this CNY, my relatives keep asking me about which course I intended to enter in poly, how many pts I think i can get for my O lvls and so on... all these make me very stressed...
