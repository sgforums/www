            <div class='col-md body'>in the 1st place, u shoudn't get married, if u think everythins are so call "your own". look at the mirror &amp; ask urself....y u need a husband? if he's not inside ur life...or u r not ready for him to come into ur life....think.....<br>not easy for two person to meet....but is easy for two person to break!!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mikki1980:</div><div class="quote_body">this is embarrassing to say because i have never actually made public in forums about my married life...i hope some of you can advise me quite reasonably and sensibly to the following situation.<br><br>I'm married 27, bcos of my work. I usually have 4 to 5 days off continous for each 2 week. I'm someone that like to travel, so usually I will take short trip around, eg. Phuket, Malaysia...etc. Bocs of busy work, my husband will not join me and he allow me to travel alone. I will travel alone or with friends.<br><br>I always wanted my "own time", so my husband will take it that travelling is my own time. Something happened this week. One of my guy friend from Finland come to SIN, last tuesday. Cos of my off day, I accompany him around SIN everyday, everynite, we will party till 3 or 4am. Then a group of my friends sugguested that we go to Batam over the weekends. Due to every nite also party till so late. When I back home, my husband already sleep. So I only told him that I will be leaving to Batam on sat. morning, when I will be leaving on sat. nite. I wil be back on sunday nite. When I told him, I can feel that he is not happy.<br><br>I have 4 days off again this thursday, that is 2morow. I already get bus ticket to travel up to KL with this Finland friend. Cos of me working night shift, I have not "seen" my husband after I return from Batam. We only sms each other. When we are on MSN last nite, he asked me am I travelling again this thursday cos of my off day. I told him, I will go to KL with Finland friend and already get bus ticket, returning on sunday morning. I told him, I planned to meet him after his work before I go to bus station. And only when I meet him then inform him. After hear this, he gone "mad"....... he said that I dont respect him.... etc......<br>I told him it's my own time, I get to decide what I want to do... then he said I should at least inform him or "discuss" with him.....etc<br>I told him, my friends r my friends. So I never introduce any of my friends to him. He know non of my friends. And I will never let him go out with me to any of my "own" function.<br>He is quite upset over this. And cos of this whole week, he never get to see me, he suddenly gone crazy.<br>I feel that he keep saying all this things to make me feel guilty, I m only doing my OWN things, so why should I let him know?<br><br>Can all of u "help" me......<br>He is correct to be "mad" about me? I m doing my OWN things in my OWN time.<br>Those are my friends, I dont want him to know any of my friends, cos it's my own life, dont want him to join us. Is it wrong?<br>What's wrong with traveling with a guy alone to another country? I already married.<br><br>Can any care to share some views? I wish to see this in a 3rd party view.<br>Thanks alot.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
