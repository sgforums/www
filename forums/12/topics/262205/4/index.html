            <div class='col-md body'>You are slightly older than me and you are married. I am not. Yet somehow I feel sorrow for your husband and you (to a lesser extent) because I know the responsibilities and commitments involved in marriage.<br><br>I will not spend this post shooting you because many here did. What I can offer is some <span style="color: red;">comments</span> on how you can try to salvage this strained relationship:<br><br>Go for marriage counselling, marriage courses, marriage advices, anything that is related to MAINTAINING A HEALTHY MARRIAGE.<br><br>Yes, you have your own space and time. Your husband has his own space and time too. Why didn't you two sort it out before you two agreed to exchange your vows in marriage? Perhaps you two have something in common or share a common thing that binds you two together? Find it back and re-evaluate.<br><br>Now is not the time to assign blame to who or who. It is time to get back on track in your married life. You can carry on being right and justified in your stand BUT it will NOT help solve the problem at hand. Being married is, as many said here, about 'WE' and sharing of lives and compromising and such. You are no longer single and you have to be accountable not only to yourself, but also your husband.<br><br>Sure, your lifestyle is different from his when you two were single, but did that stop you two from getting married? Did that stop you from loving him? Did that stop him from loving you? Did that stop anybody else you or he knows from giving their blessings to you two?<br><br>Let me ask you one last question: In 5 - 10 years time, where do you see yourself in?</div>

Apparently speaking, your husband hasnt earned the respect/right to be "in the circle".  If you like thinking about your friends more, or you simply wont miss your husband, Id say its perfectly ok to ignore him all together and live the life you enjoy living!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That is why I am not married. I like my freedom and independence.<br><br>I answer to no one but myself. I don't see the need to inflict that on another human being.<br><br>I think that saying sorry to your husband won't hurt. Suck your pride in.<br><br>You need to tell him where you are going and who you are with. You are both involved together for life now. Sometimes people worry for a good reason and that worry makes them angry because they love you.<br><br>For example : my parents  came down to Melbourne recently, I have their handphone number at all times because I am in Canberra. Recently there was a gunman on a rampage who killed one person in the CBD - I had to call my parents to check if they are ok. Couldn't reach parents on the phone - so I just worry and worry until I got angry about their handphones being switched off. When I called the land line - I was an angry person but to hear them on the other side - that was relief. I did blast them anyways for not bringing their handphones out and it was because I was so worried for about 5 hours.<br><br>In this world, loved ones can be taken away quickly. So treasure what you have. Your friends if they are encouraging you to behave like you do , they are not your friends.<br><br>I have friends whose husbands I know and whose wives I know. I make a special effort to know their partner because the person is important to them and that makes them my friend too.<br></div>

Hope after reading all the posts here will help you understand that he is not being unreasonable be simply needs you to give him some attention and maybe in future talk to him before making any decisions ........ let him into your life, after all you two a married right ??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
