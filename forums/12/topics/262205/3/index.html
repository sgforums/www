Your husband dosen't need to prove that you're wrong ...... you are wrong in the first place ......... you're married, YES !! even in marriage there is this so call "personal time" but there's also respect and trust.<br><br>I believe your husband has given you both of that ....... but have you ?? If you respect him enough, you should have at least let him know your decisions ..........  If you believe so strongly that you've done nothing wrong, then why are you feeling guilty ????  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>And you've also said that the things you like doing he dosen't but will sometimes do it with you. That shows that he is trying to change himself for you and yet you can still you things like you are what you are and don't know how to change and that he should accept you for who you are without even putting in any effort ?????<br><br>The very basics of any relationship, there should always be respect, trust and the willingness to compromised.

I usually have 4 to 5 days off continous for each 2 week. I'm someone that like to travel, so usually I will take short trip around, eg. Phuket, Malaysia...etc. Bocs of busy work, my husband will not join me and he allow me to travel alone. I will travel alone or with friends.<br><br>I always wanted my "own time", so my husband will take it that travelling is my own time. Something happened this week. One of my guy friend from Finland come to SIN, last tuesday. Cos of my off day, I accompany him around SIN everyday, everynite, we will party till 3 or 4am. Then a group of my friends sugguested that we go to Batam over the weekends. Due to every nite also party till so late. When I back home, my husband already sleep. So I only told him that I will be leaving to Batam on sat. morning, when I will be leaving on sat. nite. I wil be back on sunday nite. When I told him, I can feel that he is not happy.<br><br>I have 4 days off again this thursday, that is 2morow. I already get bus ticket to travel up to KL with this Finland friend. Cos of me working night shift, I have not "seen" my husband after I return from Batam. We only sms each other. When we are on MSN last nite, he asked me am I travelling again this thursday cos of my off day. I told him, I will go to KL with Finland friend and already get bus ticket, returning on sunday morning. I told him, I planned to meet him after his work before I go to bus station. And only when I meet him then inform him. After hear this, he gone "mad"....... he said that I dont respect him.... etc......<br>I told him it's my own time, I get to decide what I want to do... then he said I should at least inform him or "discuss" with him.....etc<br>I told him, my friends r my friends. So I never introduce any of my friends to him. He know non of my friends. And I will never let him go out with me to any of my "own" function.<br>He is quite upset over this. And cos of this whole week, he never get to see me, he suddenly gone crazy.<br>I feel that he keep saying all this things to make me feel guilty, I m only doing my OWN things, so why should I let him know?<br><br>Can all of u "help" me......<br>He is correct to be "mad" about me? I m doing my OWN things in my OWN time.<br>Those are my friends, I dont want him to know any of my friends, cos it's my own life, dont want him to join us. Is it wrong?<br>What's wrong with traveling with a guy alone to another country? I already married.<br><br>Can any care to share some views? I wish to see this in a 3rd party view.<br>Thanks alot.<br><br></div></blockquote>do you err. sleep with your "friends"?</div>
