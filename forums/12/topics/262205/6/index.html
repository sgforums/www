You said you didn't have  a chance to tell him about the trip because you came home late and didn't have a chance.  Do you think it is a good excuse? Do you think it is better that he knows what's going on beforehand, instead of finding it out through internet messenging? Afterall, you stay together in the same house.</div>

I usually have 4 to 5 days off continous for each 2 week. I'm someone that like to travel, so usually I will take short trip around, eg. Phuket, Malaysia...etc. Bocs of busy work, my husband will not join me and he allow me to travel alone. I will travel alone or with friends.<br><br>I always wanted my "own time", so my husband will take it that travelling is my own time. Something happened this week. One of my guy friend from Finland come to SIN, last tuesday. Cos of my off day, I accompany him around SIN everyday, everynite, we will party till 3 or 4am. Then a group of my friends sugguested that we go to Batam over the weekends. Due to every nite also party till so late. When I back home, my husband already sleep. So I only told him that I will be leaving to Batam on sat. morning, when I will be leaving on sat. nite. I wil be back on sunday nite. When I told him, I can feel that he is not happy.<br><br>I have 4 days off again this thursday, that is 2morow. I already get bus ticket to travel up to KL with this Finland friend. Cos of me working night shift, I have not "seen" my husband after I return from Batam. We only sms each other. When we are on MSN last nite, he asked me am I travelling again this thursday cos of my off day. I told him, I will go to KL with Finland friend and already get bus ticket, returning on sunday morning. I told him, I planned to meet him after his work before I go to bus station. And only when I meet him then inform him. After hear this, he gone "mad"....... he said that I dont respect him.... etc......<br>I told him it's my own time, I get to decide what I want to do... then he said I should at least inform him or "discuss" with him.....etc<br>I told him, my friends r my friends. So I never introduce any of my friends to him. He know non of my friends. And I will never let him go out with me to any of my "own" function.<br>He is quite upset over this. And cos of this whole week, he never get to see me, he suddenly gone crazy.<br>I feel that he keep saying all this things to make me feel guilty, I m only doing my OWN things, so why should I let him know?<br><br>Can all of u "help" me......<br>He is correct to be "mad" about me? I m doing my OWN things in my OWN time.<br>Those are my friends, I dont want him to know any of my friends, cos it's my own life, dont want him to join us. Is it wrong?<br>What's wrong with traveling with a guy alone to another country? I already married.<br><br>Can any care to share some views? I wish to see this in a 3rd party view.<br>Thanks alot.<br><br></div></blockquote><strong>You Are Married, Stop Being Selfish.</strong></div>

I usually have 4 to 5 days off continous for each 2 week. I'm someone that like to travel, so usually I will take short trip around, eg. Phuket, Malaysia...etc. Bocs of busy work, my husband will not join me and he allow me to travel alone. I will travel alone or with friends.<br><br>I always wanted my "own time", so my husband will take it that travelling is my own time. Something happened this week. One of my guy friend from Finland come to SIN, last tuesday. Cos of my off day, I accompany him around SIN everyday, everynite, we will party till 3 or 4am. Then a group of my friends sugguested that we go to Batam over the weekends. Due to every nite also party till so late. When I back home, my husband already sleep. So I only told him that I will be leaving to Batam on sat. morning, when I will be leaving on sat. nite. I wil be back on sunday nite. When I told him, I can feel that he is not happy.<br><br>I have 4 days off again this thursday, that is 2morow. I already get bus ticket to travel up to KL with this Finland friend. Cos of me working night shift, I have not "seen" my husband after I return from Batam. We only sms each other. When we are on MSN last nite, he asked me am I travelling again this thursday cos of my off day. I told him, I will go to KL with Finland friend and already get bus ticket, returning on sunday morning. I told him, I planned to meet him after his work before I go to bus station. And only when I meet him then inform him. After hear this, he gone "mad"....... he said that I dont respect him.... etc......<br>I told him it's my own time, I get to decide what I want to do... then he said I should at least inform him or "discuss" with him.....etc<br>I told him, my friends r my friends. So I never introduce any of my friends to him. He know non of my friends. And I will never let him go out with me to any of my "own" function.<br>He is quite upset over this. And cos of this whole week, he never get to see me, he suddenly gone crazy.<br>I feel that he keep saying all this things to make me feel guilty, I m only doing my OWN things, so why should I let him know?<br><br>Can all of u "help" me......<br>He is correct to be "mad" about me? I m doing my OWN things in my OWN time.<br>Those are my friends, I dont want him to know any of my friends, cos it's my own life, dont want him to join us. Is it wrong?<br>What's wrong with traveling with a guy alone to another country? I already married.<br><br>Can any care to share some views? I wish to see this in a 3rd party view.<br>Thanks alot.<br><br></div></blockquote>You sounded like a party girl and like her own freedom and freinds more than you love your husband. Why marry in the first place if you want to have fun so much outside of married life?<br><br>Do you know what is 'MARRIED LIFE' really means? It meant whatever you do, you MUST consider your other half feelings and action too.<br><br>Yes, everyone now and then need sometime of their own but not to the extend of going to party until 3 4 am in the morning and moreover going out with another guy!!!<br><br>So what if your friends suggest going to Batam? Is it really that necessary for you to go leaving your husband all alone at home? And base from what you posted you do that alot - the travelling alone or with friends part.<br><br>Well, good luck to your marriage which seem to be non existence. I wouldn't be surprise if your husband found another who truly want to spend time with him instead of alone or rather be with 'friends'. And don't say it wasn't fair on you and starts to blame him saying it's all his fault <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
