I think he has accepted you for who you are<br><br>3. You only feel guilty coz you know deep down you are in the wrong and since you do, just apologise. Apologies don't kill you<br><br>4. Spare a thought for his feelings. Just update him what you are doing and let him know your friends<br><br>5. This is not even much to ask. You just need to stop being so self-centred</div>
