I like you... as a friend <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">" and i asked why.. and he said "Hai... We're friends what.. no longer a couple..."<br><br>u see,  his actions are really confusing... still like him alot...<br><br>what shd i do? ah! so confused. guys, what is he thinking?!?! i really need solid advice...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>grr..thats why i say, guys suck</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in life, timing is very impt.<br><br>1 very good example would be getting into a relationship before and after NS.<br>if you met someone who treated u nice and all, started getting used to his attention and all, but when he goes NS, u will feel completed "abandoned". thats why people say before NS dont get into relationship unless u prepared to break up.<br><br>but after NS, u meet this same particular guy, but he has completed his NS, is working, then u will have more time to be together to let the relationship progress.<br><br>what i trying to show is that timing is really very very important in life.<br><br>like the saying goes, you gotta wait for the time to ripe. but before that time comes, you know there is a lot of ruhua show for u to marathon.<br><br>bide your time well, good things are worth the wait. why the rush to be together now, if you 2 are meant to be together, you got like half your life to see him daily. lol. this is to all couples out there.<br><br>!!!
