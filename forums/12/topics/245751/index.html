            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, here's what i just mentioned to some friends back in Singapore.<br><br>it seems they are of the following disposition.  And here's my observation.<br><br>their boyfriends are lovey dovey with them long distance thru the phone and internet.<br><br>And the ladies are kinda keep defending their boyfriends. They keep telling me, that their boyfriend is truthful with them, telling them things, and are lovey dovey with them.<br><br>One even went to the extent to pretend to want to fly the girlfriend over to USA to live with him, but somehow, the airticket got cancelled by the airline. (I dont believe it for the moment cos I know how this e-ticket thing works.)<br><br>Anyway, the ladies do suspect that their b/f are using them, but against my suspicion, they rather believe that their b/f is true.<br><br>Here's how I lay down the facts.<br><br>Females likes the idea of being in love.  It gives us a high &amp; females are more emotionally attached.<br><br>Men likes the idea of females being in love with them, it gives them the high that they can string any females around until they find their one true love to which they will forsake everything, even family.<br><br>(And yes....even if they are married, they will later 'realise' he was only making do until his ONE TRUE LOVE show up.)</div>

You can't spawn something out of nothing; surely, there are unseen issues going around without your knowledge that is affecting him subconsciously.<br><br>A seemingly smooth going relationship, at times, is not a good absolute measure for a relationship (especially if scant emotional communication and deep conversation is relatively amiss)<br><br>He spoke about incompatibility and differences - what exactly are these differences? How difficult are those challenges? Are those challenges/difficulties recognized/understood by you as well?<br><br>Uncovering the above questions might resolve much of your conundrum unknowingly. I will explain why below.<br><br>There are times in a relationship when people start reviewing their relationship, even if the ride went on pretty smoothly devoid of emergency break. Ironically, their horror came to them as 'far too good of an experience to be true' and they want to retrograde few steps back to decide if it was really true. This is uncannily true for relationship citing incompatibility as a reason to end it, actually having incompatibility belonging to insignificant magnitude that <span style="font-style: italic;">shouldn't</span> induce break up.<br><br>Of course compatibility is relative and subjective to individual perception. It becomes a quagmire only if love is not substantial enough to surmount challenges. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If Love makes a fool out of human, then the fool has the greatest of courage because a fool knows no danger.</strong></span><br><br>Then came the sweet aftermath; so tender the feeling he exude and empowered strongly in your soul, paradoxically, only to inflict more confusion in your heart.<br><br>He works to retain your emotions for him, yet he's not willing to face the challenges of 'incompatibility', as reasoned by him, with you in union. So self absorbed his affection for you as he has removed the source of burden and tacit responsibility he had to shoulder as a boyfriend previously, yet he's reluctant to allow you your needed recovery to take flight to your next phrase of life.<br><br>His act of 'goodwill' actually bring calamity to your long term growth if this persisted indefinitely because you will always be emotionally bounded by him.<br><br>If you can't handle it, then avoid putting yourself in such predicament.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yup! same thinking like yun. maybe he loves the feeling of love ba. and also that he is confused, and his actions are making things worse. like after breakup service like someone mentioned, you will not have the time to heal or wake up from the reverie.<br><br>is like he wants your company yet does not want the committment. as such he likes you as a friend. but frankly, how many friends will go around feeding each other etc.<br><br>timing to be together also plays a part. maybe he really is not ready for a relationship(read: committment) right now, so no point forcing him. if you were to spend a lot of time with him again, you will fall back into the fairytale syndrome before you can wake up. and when his confusion acts up again, you will be in a nightmare once again.<br><br>notice that in your relationship with him, he is the main factor. His actions will have a direct impact on you.<br><br>Suggest you take some time off, be friends and keep it that way. do not cross the fine line between lovers and friends. because u need some time to really adjust yourself and let him come to a decision.<br><br>if you continue doing the lovers stuff as "friends" then be prepared for this "friend" status to last some time because it might cause him to not make a decision.<br><br>take care tho.</div>
