I like you... as a friend <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">" and i asked why.. and he said "Hai... We're friends what.. no longer a couple..."<br><br>u see,  his actions are really confusing... still like him alot...<br><br>what shd i do? ah! so confused. guys, what is he thinking?!?! i really need solid advice...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>im facing the exact problem that your ex bf is facing.

            <div class='col-md body'>When a person's actions don't match what he says, I'd disregard what he says because actiona speak louder than words..... But in your case, it seems that thw fella's experiencing some kind of conflict in that his head doesn't agree with his heart.......<br><br>From his action as described by you, it is plain that he has some feelings for you. Minimum. he enjoys your company. To what extent, it's difficult to say coz there are just not enough facts........ This is his heart talking! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Yet, he seems hesitant and wants the r/s to end - this is his head talking! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>At the end of the day, even though he likes you, he is just not prepared to commit to an exclusive r/s with you for reasons best known to himself........... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Probing to find out what his problems are will not do you any good coz there are things which only he can help himself.......... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Best way forward is to just continue being good friends and see how things develop. Shun qi zhi ran ba. After all, ru yao zhi ma li, ri jiu jian ren xin ma!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>In any case, there's nothing you can do about this r/s problem. So just leave it one side first lor. But your exams are something you can do plenty about! So, focus on being at your best for the exams! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Dun worry about not being left on the shelf coz you won't!
