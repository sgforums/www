            <div class='col-md body'>Joycelyn,<br>it's great that your communication links with yr b/f is so open. I guess yr b/f may be saying all the "bad" things abt his past cos he may not want to say the nice parts in case you compare or just purely dislike hearing abt them.<br>I believe that for a couple to ask questions especially about their partner's previous dates, a number of people, subconsicously or not, only want to hear what they really wish to hear. So when asking sensitive qn such as on issues on intimacy, before asking I think the person should consider a few qns first such as (1)Can I bear it if the reply from my b/f or g/f is not as I expected or not in accordance to my values and beliefs? (2)Will I compare myself with the ex of my present partner?.<br><br>The present and future is more impt than the past. But how many of us can actually do that?</div>
