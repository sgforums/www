            <div class='col-md body'>Sometime dun really knw wat ger is thinking..<br><br>Use to know this ger for a few month, and after that she told me that she had feeling for me, but she already had a bf.<br><br>But i told her let nature run it course loh. She confess to me that her bf never treat her well.. always 3 or 4 day will quarrel. And dun feel any more secure with her bf.<br><br>So time go by.. (dun have to post the full story)<br><br>I was able to hold her hand. She told me that i am the guy she would like to be. After few week, when her bf look her up, she told her bf that she is giving their relationship last chance.. so i respect her decision. Coz she would like to choose btw me or her bf so i give her the time. At one time, her bf got call me up and look for me telling me to have a fair battle (she was at that time at her bf home). But i just quietly never say much.<br><br>But the next day, she can told me to "Si Xin" coz she still love her bf. Wow, I was wondering how come she suddenly had the decision, it just becoz her bf told her that he change alot for her? or wat? Or just that her bf one words is equivalent to my 10 words?<br><br>So had to let go of her.. but i know she had a feeling for me coz when she was watching para para sakura, she SMS me to go and watch when i am free. (those who watch para para sakura should know the story)<br><br>So we becae frenz..<br><br>But now she told me that she is restricting herself not to think of it and admit that she is trying to tok to me less. Coz she fear that her bf will be angry..<br><br>Is this the way to become frenz? when u r restricting yourself<br></div>

I told her that i dun mind.. really dun mind.. coz to me, if i like someone, i dun really care her past what she had done.. just be trustful to each other..<br><br>Her bf even say this "If i dun do it wif you, I do it wif who.. everyone got s*x desire blah.." When i heared this, i was very angry.. but i really couldn't do anything.. "You Xin Wu Li" I once saw her bf on the net, and i ask her abt the above sentence.. he told me that "She is mine, I can do whatever I want to her", isn't he Selfish?<br><br>domoyoji33: The spare tyre that u say, she also got ask me.. ehehe she ask whether i will accept her when she breakoff wif her bf, i say i will if i am still single..<br><br>I ask her once, how come when u r at your bf home, you come to the decision to ask me to "Si Xin", what make u had that decision? She was unable to answer.. Coz that day at her bf home (her bf beside her)i ask her to say that she dun love me anymore (so that i wll Si Xin), she said it..<br><br>That day my sky was so dark.. so i ask her again, if i let u have the chance to say it again will u still say, she said se won't coz that day i force her to say. Wha Piang..<br><br>Today, she SMS that whenever she c those bike on the road, she will think of me.. hai.. i SMS her that maybe it good for you to choose your bf, coz it a test btw u and me wheather we r really that compatible or whether i will be able to wait that long.<br><br>But she never reply back..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IdoIne, it seems like her bf is very 'big man dominant' kind of a person. He seems to be conrolling her life &amp; she could be living in fear of him &amp; he could hv been threatening her somehow... she is like a bird in a cage... u r a nice person so thats why she felt more comfy with u. well, its up to her to decide how she wants her future to be.. just be friends for moment lor .. give her time to analysis her feelings &amp; future she wants to be... just be patient but i do also agree u should give urself some space to other friends too</div>

Despite what people have said about her (and I'm in NO POSITION if whatever they've said is right or wrong...) I guess you should still let yur heart have a little say then what others have to say about her (no offence, but especially when they don't really know her at all...?)<br>BUT...
