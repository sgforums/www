              <p>the seat is not even warm yet and you're leaving the seat? how can?</p>
              <p>in other words, warm her up first, get her to know you and vice versa to the extent that you two are so farking comfy with each other, like know each other for years liao, then you confess.</p>
              <p>by then, she would already know you like her and won't be freaked out or awkward.</p>
              <p>what u should do now is to go totally cool and behave like friend, then slowly pick up the pace by going malls, outings etc.</p>
              <p>u made a mistake so now, you must be very patient.</p>

              <p><br>If you only asked her out, and didn't say it was with other people, make it just one on one.</p>
              <p>Do not confess just yet, only confess after you receive positive vibes from her that she enjoys your company. Get to know her better first before popping any question.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>
              <p>Doing it through MSN is just so, "hum ji". A face to face approach would be better, IMO.</p>

              <p>henshin. take it easy.. ignore whoever said your a fool here.</p>
              <p>U already made your move and u confessed right? Now, its just that she never give u clear answer right?</p>
              <p>Let me , Uncle Zark help u out. 1st impression, it seems that she dont wanna be with u as couple. Not taking your DIY gift means she dont accept your confession.</p>
              <p>U should learn that when a gal behaves like this, they are probably never experienced this kind of stuff at all. Shes feeling awkward cuz she probably never thought that her good buddy actually liked her for so long.</p>
              <p>One thing that u can correct your mistake is that, tell her face to face that u know that she doesnt accept u and just tell her that u hope u both can be normal as before. Tell her that u only hope to be frens now.</p>
              <p>Liking some1 or confessing at the wrong time isnt a mistake.. if she got feeling for u, no matter how romantic or not the way u confess, the gal will accept u, dont u agree? For this time, she never have the same feeling as u, do u wan to be together with some1 who doesnt have feeling for u or vice versa? Just be normal frens for now, and find other gal, u will never know who is your future gf whom in fact is far more better looking and attitude than the gal now. Be positive and dont be wussy anymore.</p>
              <p>Things will changed for better, No worries... :D</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>DOnt worry bout only 2 months of knowing each other and ppl said its too early. Some ppl only know each other for few days and they together happily.. Its about feeling of both parties, henshin. No worries. Shes not the only flower in this world, u never try look other gal how would u know if theres anything far more beautiful and smells good?</p>
              <p>This is the right time to become the man of word and courage, henshin. Dont show your pity face when u face her.. just be normal and accept that this is only one-sided love. Ok?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>nooblet let me teach u how to salvage. since u kan cheong and scared her into avoiding u when u came rolling in like an elephant, what u should probably do now is to tell her truthfully that u were pretty much an ass for not considering her feelings and coming onto her so abruptly.for now try to chill out relax and make small talk till u get back the trust again,only then got foundation to build upon mah</div>

              <p>don't worry, she'll forgive you.</p>
              <p>you didn't rape her, right? you didn't kill her family right?</p>
              <p>and what's wrong with expressing your love? if guys cannot express love, then humans will be on the brink of extinction.</p>
              <p>she is angry because you kind of betray her trust.</p>
              <p>usually, girls who treat guys as friends and buddies will feel betray when the guys tell them they love / like her, because it's like all along, you friend her cos' u have romantic feelings to her.</p>
              <p>worse still, you're really kan-cheong and still give DIY gift....very sweet, but timing is wrong.</p>
              <p>so now,</p>
              <p>1) go up to her face-to-face like a real man with a steel penis and say to her seriously the following words in a very matter-of-fact, solemn tone:</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------</p>
              <p>"Ok, I'm sorry I say those words the other day."</p>
              <p>(give a slow, relaxed sigh here before continuing next sentence)</p>
              <p>What I want you to know is that you're a great girl, and if possible, I would still like to be your friend.</p>
              <p>(at this point, give a very soft sigh with your lips closed, look away and walk away, don't turn your head back)</p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------</p>
              <p>this will really rape her mind and she'll feel a bit guilty.</p>
              <p>then, for you, just wait for time to heal things, then treat her as a friend......don't contact her for a period of time (a couple of weeks to 1 month+).</p>
              <p>when the storm calms, go slowly, as a friend, not her suitor or anything. do things as a group, then slowly narrow to you and her when things are more positive.</p>
              <p>u must slowly edge in and in, dropping a bit of little sweetness once in a while......slowly more and more....you get the idea.</p>
              <p>the gift or anything else should wait until she accepts your love.</p>
