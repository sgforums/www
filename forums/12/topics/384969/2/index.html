              <p>TS, I dun mean to sound pessimistic, but you better find another one.</p>
              <p>Some girls enjoy the chase and are blind to their close guy friends around them. The worst kind of scenario is &gt;&gt; you wait, hoping she will turn back for you. Then she happily married liao and you already too deep into it, cannot turn back, become depressed and come here start another thread years later.</p>
              <p>Read between the lines; their favourite line is "You are a good person/friend/companion/, but ...&lt;insert excuse here&gt;"</p>

              <p>can kind and experts in relationship able to intepret this, as im really at a loss of what she means and wants</p>
              <p>I like this girl, but somehow after confession things seem to remain as friends. according to her, she feels she's not ready to go into a relationship. And can guys trust what girls say when they turn down a guy? like say be friendship for now.</p>

              <p>NO NO NO NO NO!!!! Dont give up...</p>
              <p>Sometimes the girl got interest in you de... just that she does
              not want to go into relationship with you so quickly, cause it will
              make her look like she can be gotten easily. By rejecting you, she
              can also see whether you really like her and you will still be
              there for her. If you leave her now, then to her it would mean that
              you arent serious about her at all, and only wanted to play play
              with her.</p>
              <p>Sometimes girls do things opposite of what they want, you must
              see it for yourself. Sense it!! You must sense the way she rejected
              you, whether it was a direct rejection, simply not interested kind
              or the other kind in which she rejects you but does not indicate
              that she is not interested in you.</p>
              <p>Its hard, but you will know, as in after your rejection and the
              girl does not shun you or wat, that probably means that she still
              likes you as a friend and you should still stay by her side and
              help her. If she totally ignores you and becomes a stranger to you,
              then its strong indication that she wants you to get lost and not
              give you anymore false hopes.</p>
              <p>I got rejected twice before the girl I like became my gf.
              Sometimes persevere will get you the girl, whereas other times, no
              matter how hard you try, you are still alone. Good Luck!!</p>

              <p>this is the best answer so far</p>
              <p>most gals, especially if she has not been in a relationship before, are unlikely to say yes after you confess. they are shy and afraid of getting in a r/s. so if you get an ambiguous answer like 'take things slow', 'stay as friends', 'I'm not sure', it may be good news for you.</p>
              <p>Stay on a few more weeks and months and she will be yours. and like what MaNyZeR said, it will also depend on the tone, how she rejected you, and her behaviour towards you after the confession. you have to judge yourself</p>
              <p>however, if she says stuff like 'i'm already attached', 'I like someone else', 'I have no interest in you at all', then it is GG for you. Don't waste time on her anymore</p>

              <p>Why the anxiety to make or go into a relationship - simply put - there is no love but sth else hiding behind the word love.</p>
              <p>Insecurity and the need to be constantly validated that one exists - are two factors. One who is insecure - whether it is work, friends or .... will only feel comfortable when certainty is prevalent.</p>
              <p>If one is really secure within - who cares about relationship security or ... one simply relates and lives</p>

              <p>The solution lies in becoming self-fulfilled and the abilty to relate and share. Otherwise, one can go on chasing another, owning another one is bound to derail and cause misery and suffering not only to oneself but the other and others around.</p>
