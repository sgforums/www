              <p>Haha...</p>
              <p>First of all, I am no relationship expert, otherwise I would be too busy with a harem to be here. Only posting to share a thought.</p>
              <p>Usually, girls are more matured than guys, and she probably is more aware of her priorities, such as studies/work, projects, all matters related to education/career.</p>
              <p>That she is telling you to take it slow is to let you know where you stand, and hopefully, you will accept and respect her views and remain friends, which I am sure she will treasure in time to come and if you are sincere and you really love her, her feelings for you may grow.</p>
              <p>But if it doesnt, then know that love cannot be forced or grow in the shortest time. I am sure you still have a whole life ahead of you to find and experience what life can offer you.</p>
              <p>In summary, dont attempt to possess her, make her your steady and disallow other guys near her. Love is not about possession. Love grows from sincere and genuine concerns by friendships, and it will be returned in kind if the feeling is mutual. Focus and help yourself in your studies/job and help her too. </p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>Hi azoboi,</p>
              <p>May I know the age of your friend and you? If the two of you are still studying, then such a reply will not be surprising, especially if she aims to continue higher levels of education. </p>
              <p>Nevertheless, if she starts to distance herself from you, it is likely that she has no interest in you, and has said what she said just to make you feel better. If she continues to treat you as a friend and remain close to you, then what I have mentioned in the previous paragraph is likely true.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>NO NO NO NO NO!!!! Dont give up...</p>
              <p>Sometimes the girl got interest in you de... just that she does not want to go into relationship with you so quickly, cause it will make her look like she can be gotten easily. By rejecting you, she can also see whether you really like her and you will still be there for her. If you leave her now, then to her it would mean that you arent serious about her at all, and only wanted to play play with her.</p>
              <p>Sometimes girls do things opposite of what they want, you must see it for yourself. Sense it!! You must sense the way she rejected you, whether it was a direct rejection, simply not interested kind or the other kind in which she rejects you but does not indicate that she is not interested in you.</p>
              <p>Its hard, but you will know, as in after your rejection and the girl does not shun you or wat, that probably means that she still likes you as a friend and you should still stay by her side and help her. If she totally ignores you and becomes a stranger to you, then its strong indication that she wants you to get lost and not give you anymore false hopes.</p>
              <p>I got rejected twice before the girl I like became my gf. Sometimes persevere will get you the girl, whereas other times, no matter how hard you try, you are still alone. Good Luck!!</p>

I like this girl, but i don't know if she likes me, one thing is that ppl always say that we are like a couple. matchedmaked in heaven. she treats me like a bf, but i did not tell her how i felt about her. so now she has a stead, but she treats me like how she usually does. I don't wish to repeat the same mistakes of others telling girls they like them at the early stage. so my advice...just wait, and stay by her. she will soon realise she can depend on you. and when she realise that, she will always depend on you and start to like you.</p></div>

              <p>Hi azoboi,</p>
              <p>It doesn't matter how many friends she has by her side, the most important thing is that you remain a good and supportive friend to her for the time being. Anyway, as I have previously asked, may I know your age?</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi Azoboi....</p>
              <p>she maybe have something else that she put as first parioty for example study??give her some time..</p>
              <p>BUT you might want to consider thisShe wanted to recject yoy but bcos,she may treat you as friend and nothing more then that,however bcos you're her friend she dosen't want to hurt you.</p>
              <p>Girls will also use term like: "i will prefer you to be my god brother" or "i like this guy for the past 3 years and im still waiting for him" or "you are too good for me"</p>
              <p>and for guys, they popular phrase sounds like this  "i'm not a good guy and you can found someone out there much better than me..."</p>
              <p>so cheers...</p>

              <p>Sometimes the girl got interest in you de... just that she does not want to go into relationship with you so quickly, cause it will make her look like she can be gotten easily. By rejecting you, she can also see whether you really like her and you will still be there for her. If you leave her now, then to her it would mean that you arent serious about her at all, and only wanted to play play with her.</p>
              <p>Sometimes girls do things opposite of what they want, you must see it for yourself. Sense it!! You must sense the way she rejected you, whether it was a direct rejection, simply not interested kind or the other kind in which she rejects you but does not indicate that she is not interested in you.</p>
              <p>Its hard, but you will know, as in after your rejection and the girl does not shun you or wat, that probably means that she still likes you as a friend and you should still stay by her side and help her. If she totally ignores you and becomes a stranger to you, then its strong indication that she wants you to get lost and not give you anymore false hopes.</p>
              <p>I got rejected twice before the girl I like became my gf. Sometimes persevere will get you the girl, whereas other times, no matter how hard you try, you are still alone. Good Luck!!</p>

              <p>wait for her. true love is worth waiting.</p>
              <p>actually your story reminds me of mine. the only difference is i didn't confess to her. she told me she dun intend to go into any r/s throughout 3 yrs of her uni life and i believe her. anyway, i dun intend to get into any r/s during my uni life too.</p>
              <p>i'll be waiting for her. i'll have to wait till 2012 where both of us graduate from uni. only after we graduated then i'll start to take action.</p>
