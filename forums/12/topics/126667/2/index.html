If they ask you a question, you answer them...but with a close-end answer. Give a short and direct answer as in "Yes" "OK" "No" or other etc answers.<br><br>And don't be concern with what they think or might misunderstood. People always enjoys putting other people down...especially Singaporeans (True and a sad fact...don't know what's their problem anyway...don't care. :-P ). Let them think and misunderstood all they want...as long as you already tell them your side of the story once, your job is considered done. If they are too stupid to grasp your explaination, not your problem anyway...nobody is born the same and perfect. So maybe you may have problem expressing yourself or people may have problem understanding you...there's nothing you should do about it as long as you are accountable to what you have done and did and that's enough. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Once they realised that they can't mess with your emotions anymore, they'll stop trying or they might die of their own inner frustrations. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Just like a wall...imagine yourself going against a wall.
