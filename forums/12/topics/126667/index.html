Pornography is still banned in Singapore and a person found in possession or distribution of any pornographic materials, whether in the form of publications or electronic media, can be charged under the Singapore law.<br><br>Returning to the original post, perhaps bismarck you could try speaking calmly with your mother to reassure her that you were not doing anything illegal and were merely fixing your computer problems that night. You may think your mother was imagining things, but you couldn't blame her for that when you were apparently trying to hide something or do something furtively. Wouldn't you do the same thing in her shoes? Insomnia can be frustrating, but that is still not a good reason to justify the use of harsh tones on your mother.<br><br>Explain nicely to her. She was just being concerned because you are her son. If she doesn't believe you, then there is nothing else you can do, except maybe not to let her catch you hiding something again. No point arguing with her over such a small matter.</div>
