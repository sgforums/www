Amy asked Jackson's mom (i don't know her name so i'll call her Kate) what to do. Kate said to either wash his mouth out with soap or bite him back. So Amy bit him back(she didn't break the skin, but she did leave teeth marks because Jackson left them too). Then when Jackson's dad(i'll call him Jeff) heard that Amy bit Jackson, he told the police she was abusing his son (or something like that) so Amy will be on trial tommorow, some one will represent her.

            <div class='col-md body'>when an adult bites a toddler back...its a case of abuse. No matter wat.<br><br>The law will be fair and met out the proper sentence.<br><br>As for you...if a child bites you, wont it be better to tell him off verbally and if all else fails isnt it better to ask the parent to find another day care? then to end up in court and lose everything you have in one day.<br><br>children are by nature childish. So when amy started a childcare...i am sure that she would have anticipated all kinds of kids.</div>

Though she was told by the mum that she's allowed to do that, the law only sees EVIDENCE....<br><br>Just like a doctor won't just prescribe a certain medication to a patient according to what a patient or his/her relative might say....
