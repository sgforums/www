I know you are trying to be responsible in not affecting your colleagues, but resigning wont take down their workload at all, a new colleague on the job needs time to learn, it wont reduce their 150% workload at all... give yourself a long break, 1 week or 2, go on a holiday, self travel or with some friends, just get yourself away from this island for a while, trust me, i've been through something similar like you, time will seem the longest and worst friend of yours now, seconds pass like days, extra loads of time and you dont know what to do with it, but no worries, its the healing process at work, i took 3 years to completely put everything down, so its only a matter of time... you have my best wishes and the only thing i hope from you is that you wont change your character and beliefs about relationships... stay the faithful way you've been always.<br><br>Take care</div>
