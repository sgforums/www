Its 2 different guys.<br><br>Same scenario, the first time she came up wif lies after lies until I found out the truth.<br><br>Just when I thought history will not repeat itself, things happen again. What is wrong wif some of these gals.<br><br>Neglect?<br><br>Lost of feelings?<br><br>Its better to ask the gals. However,it actually varies from person to person.<br><br>Sometimes, its a blessing in desguise.<br><br>There are always better gals out there.<br><br>Once trust is broken, its very difficult to fix it back. Why make yourself worry all the time? Learn to let go. I noe its painful. But it will be short term.</div>

Anyone have any idea what should i do during this post breakup period. I am feel very sad, cheated and lost sleep. Anybody care to share your experience? </div></blockquote>Personally none.  But my sis has a really bad experience.  Her boyfriend of 7 years cheated on her, with her best friend cum niece (her mom was my cousin)of the same age.  My sis was devastated, and her friends stood by her all these while.  My parents were involved because of the relative issue.  Me?  Stuck in between because I'm very close to her brother.<br><br>How she got over it?  Her friends accompanied her, as long as she needs, even overnight, to cry their feelings out.  It took her months to pick herself up and now, she's with this new bf whom she met in UK.<br><br>It's better for you to find out early, at lease now you know both of you are not meant to be together.  Confide in your friends, and crying is not shameful for a guy.  It's a release of feeling and emotional stress, and you needs it.  Dun bottle up.  You may also want to find your support from religion and hobbies.  Do something you enjoy, pamper yourself for a while, maybe involve in community services.  Just some suggestions, at least it helped me go through my breaking up aftermath the last time.<br><br>Take care.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sometimes when a guy do stuff, they don't know what the girl is feeling.<br><br>we are diff kind of species so girls dun understand guys and guys dun understand girls.<br><br>i always argue with my bf coz of attention as he dun really bother giving attention to small matters like saying romantic stuff once in a while.<br><br>we girls do need romance in life. not just spending time together but also once in a while try sweeping the girls off their feet. We would think you're very sweet. but in this case its the girl's fault not the guy's.</div>
