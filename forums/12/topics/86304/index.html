The reason why i don't open myself up is maybe due to reason of afraid of getting hurt and hurting people. What do i mean by hurting people? I can't return the love and concern back to people who give it to me. I just can't. It's a long story why i can't. I'm so afraid of intimacy with others which explain why i can feel so lonely. Sometime, i feel that i'm letting my life slip me past and it already has. Shunning the guy who likes me and end up him hating me. i'm just so scared of love and handling relationships.<br>Even with friends, i don't dare to make new friends and even talking to them.

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess i should say, we are comrades in the same situation.<br><br>Fear... is part of our everyday life. Even i can't handle the mundanity and corruption of life itself. Every morning, i wake up and juz wished tt i'll get run over by cars on the way to sch. Every nite, i wished tt i'll juz sleep off into the dream world and never again wake up. Every lectures and labs, i'll sit alone in 1 corner to work on my own, nt wanting to interact with any1 on private affairs. I juz keep to myself, even though it amplifies my pain.<br><br>I've done my research. I should say we are undergoing teens depression. Rather than a clinical approach, here's some possible solution.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">1. Rally the flock. People of kind gathers together to give each other support, physically and morally.<br><br>2. Seek spiritual support. Pretty self-explainatory.<br><br>3. List out all the causes of your distress, and tackle them 1 by 1.<br><br>4. Get a life. Get a hobby. Personally, i'm into music, drawing, poetry and song-writing to vent out e negative feelings within me.<br><br>5. Get committed and love wad ur doing. It helps to use work to numb out your feelings, but e initial step is always e hardest.</span><br><br>Nice to meet u. Send mi a msg if u (or any readers out there) care to make friends.<br></div>

I'm someone who is hard to get know unless you know me for a long time. The reason why i don't open myself up is maybe due to reason of afraid of getting hurt and hurting people. What do i mean by hurting people? I can't return the love and concern back to people who give it to me. I just can't. It's a long story why i can't. I'm so afraid of intimacy with others which explain why i can feel so lonely. Sometime, i feel that i'm letting my life slip me past and it already has. Shunning the guy who likes me and end up him hating me. i'm just so scared of love and handling relationships.<br>Even with friends, i don't dare to make new friends and even talking to them.

After you walled yourself, you begin to realise that something is not right; then your sentry relax. One fine day, something casually knock against the wall you conjured and all sentry quickly goes back into action and you build a second layer wall to protect further.<br><br>In the end, you discover that you have less and less space within your emotional area and you experience a choking effect.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br>TO LOVE is natural.<br><br>CloUdiSm Remix III state and acknowledge: <strong>Love brings up everything unlike itself</strong>. In simple, it means that love brings up everything - all the good, bad and ugly into surface. You can't love love's positive aspect because your deemed the seemingly negative traits as unloving. The truth is: its a whole package. You cannot reject some portion of the package because you didn't like it. If you force your way, it become more expensive instead.<br><br>When we buy value meals in Burger King, we cannot remove the fries component just because we didn't like it. If we buy the burgers and drinks separately, after careful calculation, in fact, you are paying much more. The smart ones will change the fries to onion rings instead or cheeze fries when buying at KFC... but what if you are in Long John Silver?<br><br>Acceptance and to work around relationship is critical.<br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If you desire true companionship, learn to release yourself and open up. You cannot seek for companionship (friends/BGR) unless you decide to get out of your hut and hunt for food. Sure, you can stay in your hut forever, but eventually, <strong>is that what you want?</strong> Nobody will go into the hut and give you food. If you don't attempt to open that door and walk out, nobody will make you.<br><br>Cheers</div>
