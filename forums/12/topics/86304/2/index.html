WHICH is what i keep telling you guys, if u like a girl DUN say it, coz she'll shun you.<br><br></div>

I'm someone who is hard to get know unless you know me for a long time. The reason why i don't open myself up is maybe due to reason of afraid of getting hurt and hurting people. What do i mean by hurting people? I can't return the love and concern back to people who give it to me. I just can't. It's a long story why i can't. I'm so afraid of intimacy with others which explain why i can feel so lonely. Sometime, i feel that i'm letting my life slip me past and it already has. Shunning the guy who likes me and end up him hating me. i'm just so scared of love and handling relationships.<br>Even with friends, i don't dare to make new friends and even talking to them. I just so afraid. It's getting worse and worse. I'm facing social starvation in my life now.<br></div></blockquote>So am i so am i, am also socially starved. So you are not alone which is the significant thing.<br><br>Why don't you relate the long story, maybe it will help you and others like you.<br><br>It seems you define intimacy as being with a guy. So the reason your depressed now is coz u aint got a bf? Or is it worse then that, if we define intimacy as normal friends, which you may not even have? But i believe its the bf part.<br><br>So you should just be open, but not too open you know what i mean? GO out with them, but do not get too attached, because ANYONE who gets too attached will end up getting hurt because they are held only by a string which is the opposite pary's committment.</div>
