How come there's nothing for me to look forward to as well, but i don't hate it?<br>Alternatively, set some short and long term goals, so you can have some meaning in your life. Do some charitable work, exercise, pat a cat, study harder, start a diary/blog, do a website... these are all some examples of stuff you can do.<br><br>No direction in life? Then plot one!<br>Full of uncertainty in the future? We all face this problem. Who knows what the future will bring? But most of us don't worry too much about it, and just get on with our lives. Why? Because there's nothing we can do if Osama decides to start a 911(2). Just get used to it and carry on with your life.<br><br>Never getting the girl you like could be because of your confidence, but i think you should hop over to <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=forum_display&amp;forum_id=1225" rel="nofollow"> Dating Tips for Men </a> for some advice.<br><br>If you decide you're going to live in vain, then you most definately will. Life is a matter of choice. You decide what you're going to do with it. Do you choose to live, or to just breathe and survive?<br></div>
