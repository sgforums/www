            <div class='col-md body'>yeah.. there are lots of guys who don't own a house, car or any of the 5 C or 5 B who are happily married.   But I think people always find it easiest to lay the blame on someone else.<br>Recently my brother-in-law's daughter, had been naughty and climbing up and down a chair. She refused to sit still no matter what people said or did.  So she fell on her head when she lost her balance. The first thing she said when she stopped crying was that her daddy didn't take care of her. Well kids ar 3 is starting to blame parents for their own misbehaviour. So I guess adults do that even more..</div>
