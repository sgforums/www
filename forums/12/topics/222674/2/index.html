            <div class='col-md body'>There are all types of people out there.  You cannot choose your parents or siblings. But you can choose to be your life partner, so don't blame the other party for being materalistic. you always have a choice. Besides, we are influenced by our family, friends and general environment - so its no one's fault we have become shallow people today.   Just listen to some people today, and all that comes out is: I WANT, I BUY, I HAVE, Branded, David Gan (this is real, some girl barely in her teens spent 500 on her hair to be done by Gan. Her parents are so proud. So don't blame the girl because if I were her mom, I would have given her a tight slap because 500 could have been the salary of some poor family) , Glamour, Star, In-crowd, lose weight, bitching talk, I, I, I, I I, blah  etc. Maybe its just that people here replaced emotional need and need for connection with material goods to just feel good - but it ain't workin' cause looking at the unhappy faces - anyone can tell without some happiness index.<br><br>Even old folks put it down to the fact that times has changed and they too become kia-su, materialistic and etc, just to keep up. Moving forward, if you do not want to become a labeled as materialistic, it starts with the person in the mirror. It also start with the kind of thinking and lifestyle and also whatever values you have and impart to the people around you and the future generation. I also see some down to earth and polite kids coming out lately. So who knows. Someone is doing something right after all...<br><br>I observed guys choose with their eyes and girls choose with their ears.<br>Maybe the world should reverse and guys should choose with their ears and girls should open their eyes more.<br><br>Anyways, too bad. I'm taken and my husband is more materialistic than I am - I have less clothes, shoes, watch and everything else than he has. He is always spending on some thing and I am always saving and eating leftovers as lunch. Anyways, my sis is still available.<br><br></div>

They can command a higher standard from you, simply because they are physically attractive. After all, if you give up a chase, she still has other people chasing her. Because she is pretty, she can afford to play with the heads of people. An example of this can be seen in the recent news regarding the NTU Professor who got played around like a fool.<br><br>I won't say they are materialistic but the possibility is very high. There might be some who don't believe money should be included in love. You just need to take the chance and chase her.<br><br>Those guys with more money have advantage but it does not mean they will win the girl's heart. Higher odds but no guarantees. Just like a soccer game between Chelsea and Tottenham. Chelsea should win Tottenham but until the game is played, the result is not known.<br><br>doko<br></div>
