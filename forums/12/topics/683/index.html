            <div class='col-md body'>Don't know why.. but I was never satisfied with what British Council taught me the other time.. =( it was my 'A'levels then..<br><br>Well, like what they say read and write and speak. and also one more if you're a student, correct your friend's essay.<br><br>Our mind when we have reached (20???) it cannot absorb like a spounge anymore. Like what you may have done for you Pri and Sec sch days. It cannot absorb everything, and even if you constantly practice the same words, you also will not remember it. Taking a simple $10 note. can you tell me the exact design of it when you have seen and hold it almost everyday??? I doubt you can. coz it our mind don't work that way anymore.<br><br>best is to learn a little bit a day, learn how to use it and use it frequently in your daily life. Things are picked up more easily when you're relaxed and casual. Just look at it this way, when you chat with a friend, you seemed to remember more things than when you read a text book that's full of info right?? I'm sure you will remember the days. as we get older our hypocampus (one that stores our short term memory before it becomes a long term) does not work as well liaoz, so you stress it also no use...
