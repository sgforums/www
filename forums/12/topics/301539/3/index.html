            <div class='col-md body'>First , I must clarify this .<br><br>lalalaworld is just a random name and this is a secondary account of mine in SGForums ..<br><br>Secondly , my voice comfirm not girlish d . Its rough .<br><br>Thirdly , hair not those "Once you see = gay" ... plss .<br><br>Maybe I had over exagerated my voice (: .. I tried acting "cute" to them ..And yes I do ... But it must once again be said that ITS NOT "Ehh ~ Dun like that larr" those really sissy voice.<br><br>And I forgot to give more details about the camp. My NT class got scolded by the DM during one of the assembly (During camp) , got scolded by the council teacher. I'm not the one saying that the sucks alot but it do. They don't even want to cooperate on the mass dance. There are 27 people in that class , 2 are Chinese (male) , XX are chinese (Female) and there are only 7 girls ...<br><br>It's not easy ,mind you.<br><br>I have no problem with my appearance and the natural "voice" sound.<br><br>I suspect these 2 reasons :<br><br>First: I tried acting "cute" to them by like having kee-na (children's) voice ..<br>Just to be over friendly with them lar ..<br><br>Secondly : Well , I suspect this relates to my appearance too ... I may have phychological (sp) problems .. I am confident in my "Weath" and family background . its like having 95% that no one will say that I am a poor fellow. But its just that I have pimples all over my face :X .. Though its only the cheeks .. And this somehow like makes me feel  "lower" than others and not worthy to others .. I dunnoe how to relate this lar ...<br><br>And hoor .. I am not like dun have self-confident .. I am confident in doing everything but thinking about appearance somehow makes me like not being good .. and I dunnoe lar .. will start walking weirdly BUT ITS not like shake butt those really chao ah gua lar ... its like "jelly" leg like that .. I dunno if because of the appearance that really link to my behaviour or what ..<br><br>Anybody studying phycho can help me ??!! And its not like just appearance lar .. I have this "jelly" leg (which like makes me walk like gay but not shake butt -.-ll) whenever I am near a stranger (normally girls ) ..<br><br>Well , I thiNK I have reveal all my problems ... do help <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> thank !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>pimples does not matter with gays... infact, pimples make u manli-er...<br>friendliness also doesnt matter, i'm friendly and no one calls me gay...<br>try this, walk with chest out, back straight, legs firmly on the ground with more weight placed on them each time they com into contact with the ground(the ground wun collapse, no need to be butterfly feet) when talking, dun gesture too much, listen more den talk, act alittle aloof but not too much. ignore silly comments, show confidence but not too much or people will think u show-off. wait for your turn to talk, dun interrupt.<br>mix around wif guys more den gals, be sterner to the kids, scold them if you need to... heck care about their feelings.<br>when ur seniors call u gay, just stare at them and say: "hah, look whos talking!" or just ignore them and stare hard at their eyes... remember to show displeasure...<br><br>p.s: vulgarities would help alot too... lol<br><br>ciao, jia you on the trip to be a man  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
