I was the care taker for the NT class. They were horrible and they sucks alot ! But what did I do wrongly that some people called me : Bla-po , gay , or whatsoever shit !<br><br>I shouted at them , act normally and did nothing wrong. Maybe I am too friendly to them at first by not shouting at them .. I just did my duty by keeping the lines straight . And my "head" council told me: Take charge of the class lar , don't be a gay here. WTF ?! Too good to them = gay ?<br><br>My friend told me that I have a accent , asking if I am Singaporean ? What to do ? Lim Bei born in Sillypore and people asking If I am a sillyporean. Maybe when I speaks , i tend to "curve" me tongue more arr ? LOL<br><br>When I talk to the sec 1 , I try to use the "childish" manner cuz if you are too fierce to them , they will give you the black face ad a chicken word for you.<br><br>Maybe I have a phycho problem , due to my appearance ? I dare not say that I am ugly or handsome , just having pimples make me feels ugly .. I myself seriously don't know whats going on.. What did I do to let them call me a gay or sissy ????<br><br>I am a forgive and forget person , I don't normally pick a fight with people , though I must admit that I don't have much friends .. Just some hypocrites friends maybe ?<br><br>And during the CCA tour , I went to my CCA booth , if I am not wrong , someone said : They Gay councillor .. Wah Lau eh ... maybe I am too sensitive ? When My friends don't talk to me or having a late reply in MSN = They trying to act big and ignore you ..<br><br>I am a straight , I like girls and never will I love the boys .. =.= what should I do ? If everybody talk bad things at your back. Wow lau eh , call me gay ! WTF ... feel like quitting the council .. any suggestion ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div></blockquote>get a gf</div>
