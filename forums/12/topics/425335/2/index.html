              <p>ya, alot of peoples do not know that keeping secret is a stress, let it out, if you notice those top peoples who keep alot of confidential secret are alway having stress that lead to poor health like heartattack, stroke or chronic illness.</p>
              <p>Remove the Secret, openly admire a person is the best, when I admire one, I just tell him/her</p>

              <p>He is not married. He was interviewed before like last year. </p>
              <p>He is 36, runs a training company, charity organization and chairman of youth executive club. An over achiever i guess. Think it is obvious why any woman would fall for a guy like that. </p>
              <p>1) He runs a business. </p>
              <p>Usually a man who runs a business is rational and good at managing things. Probably good at finance as he has been operating for a good 5-6 years. Which is one of the main reasons i m drawn to him as i m in business too but less the rational i guess. ha..</p>
              <p>2) He set up a charity foundation</p>
              <p>Which is very admirable and it has been something i always wanted to do or rather many of us wanted to do but lack the energy and courage, finding excuses and delaying it. He is a kind man, a very kind man who devotes some of his time travelling to cambodia providing education and encouragement to the children there. </p>
              <p>3) He is a chairman of youth executive club</p>
              <p>To be a chairman, people has to vote for you. This shows he is popular and likeable among his peers. He has mentored many younger people and it is apparent in his fb that people thank him for his mentorship. </p>
              <p>4) Nitty Gritty</p>
              <p>He spends time with his parents, brings them for dinner and shows at esplanade. Appreciate his grandma's cooking. It really reflect his filial side. He also has great appreciation for the government and what they has done for singapore. Seems like a grateful person. </p>
              <p>I sincerely apologize if i bored you with my "obession"with this guy i hardly even know. It's crazy cos i can never say it to anyone in my world and this is the only space where i can express it and hopefully get some good advice. </p>
              <p>It's funny if you believe, some people give you peace just by looking at them. His presence calms me and each time I see his pic, as if a quiet motivation for me. (though i tried not to do it so often, as he is not "real".) </p>
              <p>Did you have such admiration for someone before? If you were me? What would you do? </p>

              <p>Admiring is part of human emotion, it is good to admire someone who is good, well behave and nice looking, so if you see that person, just tell him/her, I like your look and the way you live, keep it up. I will very much like to take you as an example.</p>
              <p>But becareful, admiring can lead to envy and jealousy which is harmful to one, overly admiring can also lead to depression, learn to admire people with no strings attach, you will be in much better to admire a person, the so call profession admiration</p>

              <p><br>Well it is ok to admire someone, i do admire alot of great peoples in this world, their achievement, their contribution and their sacrification for this world, typically these are positive admiration. As i said, good for us to emulate it.</p>
              <p>The problem is that you do not know his real personality, his private life and his way of living. You only know his achievement on paper and his physical look and you start to secretly admire him. What happen if he gets married, he commits a crime, he have a love affair, he break or divorce with his gf or wife..how do you feel.</p>
              <p>I am seeing idolism here rather than admiration. </p>

              <p>Gosh Angel, I wonder what you do in real life to be so skeptical about people. haha....</p>
              <p>I do know a bit about him as I have been following his blog for 2 years you know. Also, he is still single as his frens would often tease him to find someone and get married soon and not be so career minded, etc.</p>
              <p>I think my point here is to try to get to know him rather than stop admiring him. To know more of who he really is and what he is like. And moreover, I am not trying to be his wife or gf, just wanting to get to know him as a fren first.  If like you said,  you have admire someone before, you should know it is not as easy as saying "stop admiring" him and just stop. Only if it is that easy.....</p>
              <p>Anyway, thanks for your comment.</p>

              <p>thanks for your constructive motivation.</p>
              <p>I am thinking of dropping him a message on fb to start messaging him first rather than meeting him straight. Think he will straight away reject me and guys don't like woman who are tooo direct right? hehe...</p>
              <p>Just that i have to think of a topic to strike off a conversation.......that will last....hmmm...</p>
