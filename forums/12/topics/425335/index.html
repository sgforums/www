              <p>He is not married. He was interviewed before like last year. </p>
              <p>He is 36, runs a training company, charity organization and chairman of youth executive club. An over achiever i guess. Think it is obvious why any woman would fall for a guy like that. </p>
              <p>1) He runs a business. </p>
              <p>Usually a man who runs a business is rational and good at managing things. Probably good at finance as he has been operating for a good 5-6 years. Which is one of the main reasons i m drawn to him as i m in business too but less the rational i guess. ha..</p>
              <p>2) He set up a charity foundation</p>
              <p>Which is very admirable and it has been something i always wanted to do or rather many of us wanted to do but lack the energy and courage, finding excuses and delaying it. He is a kind man, a very kind man who devotes some of his time travelling to cambodia providing education and encouragement to the children there. </p>
              <p>3) He is a chairman of youth executive club</p>
              <p>To be a chairman, people has to vote for you. This shows he is popular and likeable among his peers. He has mentored many younger people and it is apparent in his fb that people thank him for his mentorship. </p>
              <p>4) Nitty Gritty</p>
              <p>He spends time with his parents, brings them for dinner and shows at esplanade. Appreciate his grandma's cooking. It really reflect his filial side. He also has great appreciation for the government and what they has done for singapore. Seems like a grateful person. </p>
              <p>I sincerely apologize if i bored you with my "obession"with this guy i hardly even know. It's crazy cos i can never say it to anyone in my world and this is the only space where i can express it and hopefully get some good advice. </p>
              <p>It's funny if you believe, some people give you peace just by looking at them. His presence calms me and each time I see his pic, as if a quiet motivation for me. (though i tried not to do it so often, as he is not "real".) </p>
              <p>Did you have such admiration for someone before? If you were me? What would you do? </p>

              <p>He is not married. He was interviewed before like last year. </p>
              <p>He is 36, runs a training company, charity organization and chairman of youth executive club. An over achiever i guess. Think it is obvious why any woman would fall for a guy like that. </p>
              <p>1) He runs a business. </p>
              <p>Usually a man who runs a business is rational and good at managing things. Probably good at finance as he has been operating for a good 5-6 years. Which is one of the main reasons i m drawn to him as i m in business too but less the rational i guess. ha..</p>
              <p>2) He set up a charity foundation</p>
              <p>Which is very admirable and it has been something i always wanted to do or rather many of us wanted to do but lack the energy and courage, finding excuses and delaying it. He is a kind man, a very kind man who devotes some of his time travelling to cambodia providing education and encouragement to the children there. </p>
              <p>3) He is a chairman of youth executive club</p>
              <p>To be a chairman, people has to vote for you. This shows he is popular and likeable among his peers. He has mentored many younger people and it is apparent in his fb that people thank him for his mentorship. </p>
              <p>4) Nitty Gritty</p>
              <p>He spends time with his parents, brings them for dinner and shows at esplanade. Appreciate his grandma's cooking. It really reflect his filial side. He also has great appreciation for the government and what they has done for singapore. Seems like a grateful person. </p>
              <p>I sincerely apologize if i bored you with my "obession"with this guy i hardly even know. It's crazy cos i can never say it to anyone in my world and this is the only space where i can express it and hopefully get some good advice. </p>
              <p>It's funny if you believe, some people give you peace just by looking at them. His presence calms me and each time I see his pic, as if a quiet motivation for me. (though i tried not to do it so often, as he is not "real".) </p>
              <p>Did you have such admiration for someone before? If you were me? What would you do? </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Wat is yer admiration going to materialise to? All those winning points u gave is not doing u any gud until u make the brave move to approach him.</p>
              <p>U forgot point no (5) - He like u?</p>
              <p>As for Point (1) - I know a lot of people running biz but not exactly tat successful. I know a fren drive a 5 series BMW who runs a lighting biz. But it is not exactly doing well and his BMW was bought second hand since BMW have bad resale value.</p>
              <p>Point (3) - Even I wuz voted into a committee - doesn't mean I am popular. They brought me in bcause I was aggressive volunteer who work hard a lot not because I am popular or I am cery capable. Although I am much more capable than Ice Kosong n his gang (littlemissbonker n Cocochips).</p>
              <p>Point (4) - But this one, you hit the nail, u so rite. People who r against PAP seem to suffer from certain personality disorder n r unemployed (no wonder they not happy wif PAP). For example - Ice Kosong - he spends his whole life in the Sg forum berating other people here, he is against PAP, he personally don't like women and women's rights and he is unemployed. So yes, people who support the govt tend to have better personality, caring and more gentleman.</p>

              <p>haha...that's really funny fireice! </p>
              <p>Nope he is not jack nor does he has a surname khoo. Who is that btw?? </p>
              <p>And thanks for analyzing and breaking down into points , Color money honey! Yes he is very gentlemanly, if you have seen him you will know what i mean. </p>
              <p>I went to his charity event once in support of the yellow ribbon and he is like just a metre away from I am yet I lack the courage. I hated myself for being so timid! I saw him smile and laugh with others and i am just so hoping i m the one he is talking to. He did throw a few glances though, but we didn't talk. </p>
              <p>I know, i am kinda of not realistic and i know it's just wishful thinking on my part. But did anyone of you have this feeling when you saw this someone and think he/she is just the "The One" you have been looking for half your life? It's crazy i know, I don't even know him. But through these 2 years of observation, i think i might just know him a little. </p>
              <p>Yes I wanted to be brave but I have never ever approach any man in my life. How do i do it without appearing too forthcoming or desperate or needy? </p>
