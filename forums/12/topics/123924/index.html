But at a younger age, there's a higher tendency for your parents to be more firm in their stands.<br><br>At a younger age, take things more easily. Express your interest in this guy.

You can try the same trick as above in showing him around a bit. Ultimately, let your mum understand that whether she accepts it or not, you'll still be with this guy COS YOU LOVE HIM (pls only say this when you really mean so yeah?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ).

Moms are protective lot of people. She is feeling fearful for her daughter that if her daughter married the muslim guy, converted and then realised she does not like it/ie regret. Then how?  BTW, are people allowed to convert back to non muslim? I mean I don't know but sometimes, children should try to understand the concerns of a mother from their point. So of course, they would not be happy cause all they want is for their children to be happy.<br><br>I am not saying she should not lead her own life. I am saying in essence she should also think about where her mom is coming from. perhaps it can help her answer her mother's concerns and convince her mom IF eventually she really want to convert to Muslim and marry a malay guy. Perhaps the indirect message is not clear but I think this is clearer.  I am not the instructive sort of people. So I do talk in riddles or challenges at times.<br></div>
