            <div class='col-md body'>If you are a guy, guess you would had realised thru NS that respect had  to be earned. As a soldier, we had to respect the rank that the person is wearing. Whether we respect the person anot, is a separate issue.<br><br>I had a almost similar situation at home. Some of the differences are, we are from a less well off family and there is third party involved. Or should I say, afew 3rd parties involved.<br><br>Home was a 3 room flat. Since young, Y chorosome contributor had a hot temper and demended respect from us. Whenever he was home from work and we were busy with homework and did not greet him, he would ask why did not greet him and demanded it. Crazy asshole. And he did not stay long in any job.<br><br>When my elder sis finished her O levels many many yrs back, she did well enough to qualify for engineering course in the poly. But she was stopped from doing the engineering course. Reason, Y chorosome contributor said he cannot afford to support my sis in poly, and me in sec, and my younger bro in pri sch. When my mum said she could find work to help pay for the tuition fees and my sis she said she will so some Part time job too, he yelled NO. He did not allow my mum to work. As a result, my sis cannot further her studies.<br><br>As I grew up. I was like disgusted by his MCP ways. If a man do not wish to let his wife work, then he better be earning more $$ to give her and the family a good life. But this is not in my case. Mum was not allowed to work, and family was not well off. And whenever mum spent abit more time with her parents side , Y  would be yelling at her after it. I felt that my mum was like a caged cow owned by a poor farmer. No freedom, yet have to work like a cow at home. Whenever Y return home, dinner must be served on the table, everything laid on the table for him. After dinner, he just leave everything on the table and went to sleep or went out.<br><br>I started working PT at NTUC while I was doing the 3 mths course in the JC. All the way thru JC, I was working too. I paid for my own uniforms and lecture notes, books etc. And during the JC1 holidays, I was working as a waiter in a hotel. And Y demanded that I have over all the money that I had earned to my mum, for her to " safe keep " the money for me.But I know once I handed over the $$, it will be the last that I will ever see my $$ cos Y will surely use up my $$. I refused to hand over my hard earned $$, and Y said ;" IF you dun hand over the  money, then you better STOP wroking !! "<br>I was like  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> . Hey I'm not asking for money or what. As a JC student I'm earning my own pocket money for my own use. Why should I be giving up my money.   Since young, all our ang pao $$ would be given to mum for " safe keeping " . But end up being spent by Y.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Things got out of hand in the last 4 yrs. y stopped contributing to household expense. Y was involved with ball room dancing and spending lots of $$ on the lessons and leisure sessions. And flying to australia and malaysia for the competitions, or supporting friends taking part. This from a cabbie who not rich.<br><br>Then, last 2 yrs, an uncle passed away, leaving some $$ to Y. He quitted his job and opened a food stall. A partnership with his dance partner. Y claimed that she had lost her accounting job. Once, Y's Hp was ringing and that woman slipped her hand into his pocket to fish out the HP for Y to answer. And whenever there was any dispute or quarrel regarding work, Y will be jumping to that woman's defence and shift the blame to my mum<br><br>Things got out of hand and my mum stopped working at the stall. ANd gradually they had afew quarrels and stopped talking to each other. Luckily, my sis, my bro and me are all on my mum's side. Nobody is talking to Y rite now. End up now, nobody gives a damn to him. My mum at 1st, though not speaking to him, still washs his cloths for him. BUt since he had on a few occasion not returned home to sleep at nite, my mum had stop. Y nows wash his own clothes, eat outside and basically just came back to sleep in the living room and shower.<br><br></div>

Even when my sis, younger bro , me or my mum return home to find him sitting in the living room reading the papers that my mum bought, nobody is talking to him.<br>I had told my mum to get a divorce,but she refused. Partly maybe is due to problems with " saving her face " and partly maybe bcos, if divorce, the flat had to be sold. Even if we buy over Y's share, we might have a problem to finance it.  And she would not want to let Y off with the money Y got from selling his share of the flat. That will only let Y have the $$ to spend on that woman.<br><br>I had told my mum.. its ok. I can reduce the amount of money Y can get out of selling the flat.I had a way to achieve that. And I had told her, I totally had no respect for Y now. And I do not intend to support Y when he is old. He can sue me in the family court. But I will fight my case. I had prove that I supported myself since I was 16, and that financially Y did not help with family expenses. IF he had the money to spend on dancing and on another woman, why I shld be [paying for his old age. And he choose to smoke. I will not pay for his health care in old age. Since young we had been exposed to that unhealthy habit. I shld be the one suing him for exposing us to 2nd hand smoke.<br><br>Respect had to be earned and not demanded. One can demand respect for the rank. But that will only make others feel that that person is not worthy of that rank. like wise, i used to respect Y , not for a person, but for the fact that he was my Y chorosome contributor. But Now, totally NO RESPECT at all for a person like Y.<br><br>LIke what I had told my bro and sis. They can go support Y in old age for all they want. I will not give a single cent to Y. He can sue me in court if he wants to.But  I will fight my case and counter sue for introducing me to 2nd hand smoke as a child. If the court makes me pay for his maintainance, well I will. I will pay him a lump sum and rid of all contacts with him. His live or death is none of my concern. And I will proceed with the legal plan to get rid of him in the household.<br><br>I know someone will say that I am cruel. How can I plan to do this to the Y contributor when he is old. When I think unless you are in the situation like bismarck or me.. you will not feel the hatred.</div>
