By using the phrase "legalised casino" you imply that the stock market is a form of gambling. I beg to differ. When you invest in shares, you are giving a portion of your money to the comapny.

What do you gain when you part your money at the blackjack table?Do you get back a share of the casino's profits? No. YOu only get entertainment and a small chance to triple your money. thus when you gamble, you have actually put yourself into a lose win situation as the casino will have a higher odd of winning your money.<br><br>Investing requires you to do your homework. If you dont do your homework, you have just put yourself at a higher risk of losing your money. Gambling requires no homework. At the most, you just need to learn how to play the game and lose your money.<br><br>Btw, not all funds make money. I have always advised my relatives and my friend;s grandma NEVER to put their money with fund managers. Fund managers always charge a service fees whether or not the fund makes a profit.<br><br>So there is a very big difference between investing and gambling.
