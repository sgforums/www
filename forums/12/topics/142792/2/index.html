I certainly don't think there's anything romantic about thinking we are all a bunch of halves walking around. If I'm not half a person, and you're not half a person, why on earth would any of us spend one minute, let alone a lifetime, looking for "another half" that doesn't exist and that none of us whole people would have any use for anyway?<br><br>On The Other Side we're probably closer to our soul mates than we are to any other spirit, but we're hardly joined at the hip. We and our soul mates happily pursue separate friendships, separate interests, separate work and studies, and above all, our own separate identities. With our soul mates we enjoy the most intimate love there is -- free, unconditional, liberated and liberating, with a mutual knowledge only true identical twin spirits can share.<br><br>Like all spirits on The Other Side, each of the soul mates can choose to be born on earth for another lifetime. They might only come here once or twice, like my Spirit guide Francine. They might feel the need to come again and again -- I'm on my fifty-fourth time around, and my last, I'm delighted to announce. But compared to eternity, even fifty-four lifetimes amount to about a minute and a half.<br><br>Which brings up an obvious question: What are the chances that you and your soul mate are ever going to show up on earth at the same time?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Magnus,<br><br>Don't think Auntie Yun meant it to be depressing, rather, just sharing something with us? : )  Perhaps what the article says is that we should open our minds a little, &amp; maybe accept that your true soulmate may Not be the 1 you marry, but may be your granddaughter (as the author has stated), or even your sibling or friend.<br><br>Perhaps what this article is saying is that, if we constantly harbour the narrow ideals of what a soulmate is, we may be going on a fruitless search.  Why plant doubts in your own head &amp; heart about your own partner?  It'd be totally horrible to go through each day asking youself after every quarre: Is he/she indeed my soulmate?  I'd hate to go through that.<br><br>Personally, I prefer to keep an open mind.  Whether my guy is my soulmate or Not, Nobody will ever know for sure.  But rather than waste our time pondering on what can't be answered, both of us would rather plan for fun days together, do stuff we enjoy together, &amp; make our relationship work.  To me, that is closer to what Love is all about, rather than always wondering if we're each other's soulmates.  For all we know, we are.  But even if later on, each of us finds out that our soulmates are our children/grandchildren, does it make a difference to the happy relationship/marriage we have?<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Magnus:</div><div class="quote_body">Felt a little sadness after reading Yun's post.<br><br>Is there such thing as soulmate?
