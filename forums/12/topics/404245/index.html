              <p>when anything comes to comparing your idol and your bf, you will choose to put in more efforts or sacrifice more for your idol than your bf.</p>

              <p>Your logical mind can't really distinguish between  fantasy and reality.</p>
              <p>It is possible to give up your bf and stalk your idol. You only have to be careless.</p>
              <p>You have to realise that to your idol, you are just one of the thousands of nameless faceless fans to be polite to. If you get too close too often the idol would be annoyed and call security to throw you out. Remember that.</p>
              <p>Better to live with your bf and enjoy the idol as a hobby only.</p>
