              <p>I am currently in J1 at a neighbourhood JC. I pondered over whether to study in a polytechnic or a JC and made the decision to join a JC. My result aren't fantastic but are well qualified for a neighbourhood JC. My L1R5 raw is 14. Having gone to the science stream, i have struggled since the beginning of the year. I took the popular PCME subject combination (H1 Econs) and i thought i could handle it well since i was a pure science student with A.Math in my secondary schoool. However, much to my disbelief, i have failed every single H2 test. As the promotional criteria states, i need at least 2 H2 subject pass (E 45%) to be promoted. I am now very depressed and full of regrets as my first 40% of my overall J1 grade for all 3 H2 subjects are extremely low. Now all the stakes are on my promos in 2 months time, a very crucial 60% which determine whether i get retained or not. It seems that all hope is lost as i can't even pass the simple common tests and lecture tests, how am i going to pass the difficult promos? I really don't want to be retained. I am now working extremely hard, but it has not been fruitful. I am mentally prepared to be retained but i don't know how to face my parents and relatives if i really got retained. Now i am wondering that i would have been better off in a Polytechnic. However, i am in a dilemma as i don't want to be restricted to a specific field in my future career and it seems too late to change to poly. Either way, i am going to waste one year. And poly life may not be suitable for me as well.</p>

              <p>Most of the JC papers...even neighbourhood ones, set difficult papers on purpose to cause all these woes though frankly I'm not sure if the wisdom behind this is even valid (to scare you guys to working hard).</p>

              <p><span style="color: #333333; line-height: 17px; font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold;">Hi <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" href="http://sgforums.com/users/215886">chifan</a>,</span></p>
              <p>You have many good advice from those replies.  Yes, failure is but a process of learning.  I was like you, almost wanted to give up after 6 months, but my lecturer told me, 'do your best.  If you fail, you can proudly tell yourself you have tried, but this is not your cup of tea. And you can move on in life.  But if you just give up, you are already a loser'. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Till today, I still apply this principle, in almost anything.  Even in treating my relationship, I will do my best.  If don't work out, I will not feel sad, but just move on, for I know this is not my.</p>
              <p>JC is never easy, imagine doing the course work all in less than 15 months+/-.  But the training is worthwhile.  </p>
              <p>Try reading ahead of time to prepare yourself.  You cannot depend on the teacher, but need to do your work first, in that case, when you come to class, you already know what you do not know, and can start asking question.</p>
              <p>Remember, when you ask a stupid question, you are stupid for that moment.  But if you fail to ask, you are stupid for life.  So, don't worry, ask when in doubt. </p>
              <p>I was a Poly Student (mechanical engineering).  But I realised that my learning is not sufficient, and I actually took A-Level privately in those night school, taking GP and economic.  In the end, I enjoyed it very much.  For Poly study is too practical, and does not engage my mind, nor challenge me to think.  </p>
              <p>I am into my early 40's, and doing my doctorate in Canada.  But I failed my o-level before, and repeated a year in Poly.  But when I look back, those failure just make me stronger. </p>
              <p>I wish you all the best.  The going will not be easy, but don't give up. </p>
