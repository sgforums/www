Is it a friend of hers? Part of being in a romance involves trust, just because you are her boyfriend does not mean you can control who she meets. It sounds like you get worked up easily, if she has to ask you for a cool-down period.<br><br>My point and advice: simple, ignore her for now, even if this friend of hers (this guy) is the devil, let her see that for herself, watch her come on in her own. Don't force anyone (even your gf) over what kind of people they can meet. Sometimes, people need to wait for damage to be done, even though warnings have been given countless times.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mr_sotong:</div><div class="quote_body">i really dont know what shall i do about this..... Last thursday night, i sms my gf n told her to stay away from the guy because that guy r trying to take advantage of her but she insist that they r just playing. but instead, she told me that we should cool down for 3 days. ok i wait.... monday, when i met her i tried to explain to her but she was trying to ignore n keep advoiding me. then on the same day i told her i will send her home, she agreed, but she left without telling me. on that night she told me she will give me a chance to prove i will return to my normal self in 3 days. i promised her. but now the problems is will she really give me a chance? also today when i tried to sit next to her she also advoid me by changing place. when 1 of my friend ask "if i sit next to u will u change place?" she replied "no" that really hurt me. that time i think my life not worth living for.......</div></blockquote>Your insecurity steps in because you subconsciously realise that your relationship could be walking into turmoil - you demanded her not to hang around that guy. However, the strange thing is that she replied your demand with three days worth of cooling down. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Obviously something is wrong with your relationship - why need to cool when there is nothing wrong with you, apart from being paranoid. Noticed that she used avoidance and ignoring tactics and claim to give you a chance if you 'return' back to normal.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> There could only be either/both of the two reasons for such happening:<br><br>I) Its with you - your paranoid nature had irritated her not once, but several times prior before this. You belong to the possessive group and apt to invaded personal freedom and privacy. Her behaviour is the result of your character and she felt that trashing your flaws wouldn't get anywhere better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) Its with her - There could be some funny affair going on between the guy and her. Not neccessary two-timing, rather, she could have developed feelings for him OR the other way round. Her avoidance and ignoring tactics buys her time to reflect, ponder and think about her next move and the relationship possible future.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Any critical problem your relationship undergo in the past? How long have both of you been together? How old are the both of you? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
