            <div class='col-md body'>both of us just 17.and this is the 1st problem lastly we have been in the relationship for abt 3 weeks<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Yunhaier:</div><div class="quote_body">Your insecurity steps in because you subconsciously realise that your relationship could be walking into turmoil - you demanded her not to hang around that guy. However, the strange thing is that she replied your demand with three days worth of cooling down. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Obviously something is wrong with your relationship - why need to cool when there is nothing wrong with you, apart from being paranoid. Noticed that she used avoidance and ignoring tactics and claim to give you a chance if you 'return' back to normal.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> There could only be either/both of the two reasons for such happening:<br><br>I) Its with you - your paranoid nature had irritated her not once, but several times prior before this. You belong to the possessive group and apt to invaded personal freedom and privacy. Her behaviour is the result of your character and she felt that trashing your flaws wouldn't get anywhere better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) Its with her - There could be some funny affair going on between the guy and her. Not neccessary two-timing, rather, she could have developed feelings for him OR the other way round. Her avoidance and ignoring tactics buys her time to reflect, ponder and think about her next move and the relationship possible future.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Any critical problem your relationship undergo in the past? How long have both of you been together? How old are the both of you? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers      </div></blockquote></div>

Last thursday night, i sms my gf n told her to stay away from the guy because that guy r trying to take advantage of her but she insist that they r just playing. but instead, she told me that we should cool down for 3 days. ok i wait.... monday, when i met her i tried to explain to her but she was trying to ignore n keep advoiding me. then on the same day i told her i will send her home, she agreed, but she left without telling me. on that night she told me she will give me a chance to prove i will return to my normal self in 3 days. i promised her. but now the problems is will she really give me a chance? also today when i tried to sit next to her she also advoid me by changing place. when 1 of my friend ask "if i sit next to u will u change place?" she replied "no" that really hurt me. that time i think my life not worth living for.......</div></blockquote>During the starting for a new relationship, we often do not have the 100% trust in out gf/bf. This is the thing that comes in. You feel insecure because you feel that your gf is not fulfilling your questions and things like not going with your way which really hurts you.<br><br>Try ponder about why your gf react this way? They dun react like this for no reason.<br><br>If you think it's your fault, think about it and apologise, forget about it and move on with life. Do not like this affect your relationship.<br><br>If you think its her fault, tell her about it and see what she says.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> After all, relationships are all about giving and taking. I believe your gf is just mad about you for being paranoid. In a relationship, isnt it so that each party is responsible for letting the others feel secure and safe <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ?</div>
