When both of you are together, there may be many similarities that both of you share.. To her, she treats you as a very close fren, a confidedent..<br><br>Although she does not say what the problem is, all she wants is a listening ear and a shoulder to lean on when she is feeling down.. Just give that listening ear and hopefully she will tell you her problems..<br><br>The problem with girls and guys are they don't like to tell their bf/gf or even their closest fren their problems.. They like to keep it to themselves until they are been probe into or when they feel like telling.. She may feel that at that time for her to tell you the prob is not an appropriate time.

Sharing of problems in a relationship is very important, by not sharing your troubles etc, you could prevent communication. Give your bf a chance to understand what you are going through, learn to share things more openly.<br><br>By opening up the unknown areas about you to your bf, your bf could learn more about you.</div>
