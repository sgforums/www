Hopefully you guys can give me some advice about this matter.</span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: x-small;">But first some background information:</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span lang="EN-US">I am an overseas Chinese living in the </span><span lang="EN-US">Europe</span><span lang="EN-US">, one day my dad said my niece is coming from </span><span lang="EN-US">Hong Kong</span><span lang="EN-US"> to the </span><span lang="EN-US">Netherlands</span><span lang="EN-US"> at our house to stay for 4 days.

By the way, we are not blood related; she is my “god-niece” (is that how you call it?)</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: x-small;">The moment we met at the airport we really hit off, she and her friends where surprised by the fact that I can speak pretty good Cantonese for someone who lives and go to school in a western country. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Everything is going as planned and of course I was very gallant to her. But then one night her friend is taking a shower and her male friend was hanging in front of the television we starting to wrestle a little. It was all very innocent, we started poking pushing each other and occasionally bumped some sensitive areas. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: x-small;">That night everyone is very tired and went to bed, I asked her if she wanted to go to my room and watch a movie (it was a genuine question, I had no evil plans) okay maybe a little fantasies but come on an hour ago I was grabbing her ass.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: x-small;">We were watching the movie peacefully on the couch in my room, since it was a small couch that only fitted me I suggested to lie in a position where her back is to my front (spoon if you will). As the movie got more exciting we were also getting more excited, we starting to kiss and caressing each other. At some point she stated she doesn’t want go all the way because she has a boyfriend so I stopped and we fell asleep holding each other. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>

But of course all good things ends quickly as day four has arrived and she has to go away. So I accompanied her and her friends to the airport and shopped/ate there. There was still a little time before she has to enter the gates so her two friends were chilling at a random store. That’s when we went to some quiet place, we were holding hands and gave a passionate goodbye kiss. </span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Okay that’s the bg information.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: x-small;">My question is should I or should I not go to Hk this summer and see if anything could happen between us? I was asking some of my close friends but in the end the conclusion was something like: “Nothing is going to happen she has a boyfriend” “you two live in two totally different worlds” </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: x-small;">“nay she is just playing you dude!”<span>  </span>“could you bring me a souvenir?” </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: x-small;">I can’t interpreted her signals, I mean we kissed and stuff, we promised to keep in touch via fb or skype whatever and the day at the airport right after we kissed she asked me if I had something to ask/tell her. And she wanted me to come to HK to see her. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-size: x-small;">What do you guys think? Go or no-go?</span></span></p>

              <p>Let me ask you a direct question. Will you want a girl who will do things such as kissing and hugging other guys behind her bf's back?</p>
              <p>If she can do this to her current bf, she can do it to you too.</p>
              <p>Putting that aside, you have been living in Europe for quite a while, and it can already by considered your comfort zone. If you were to move to Asia ( more specifically Hong Kong ) for the sake of chasing after her, will you be able to adapt quickly? Are you able to find a job to support yourself there?</p>
              <p>There are a lot of questions which you must ask yourself before making any rash decisions. I don't want to sound mean, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>perhaps</strong></span> she is the first teenage chinese girl whom you have seen in quite awhile who is very attractive, and that is why you got attracted to her. Ask yourself calmly, what do you truly like about her? If it is just another one of those "love at first sight", I can assure you once the 2 of you got together, the flames will die out pretty fast.</p>
              <p>Of course I am not going to stop you from making your own decision, as it is your own choice, but I will ask that you do not make any foolish move which you will regret later.</p>
              <p>Think about it thoroughly, what will you lose if you were to move over to see her? She <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>didn't</strong></span> mention anything about breaking up with her current bf, so don't get your hopes up too high. Also, what will your family and her family think? This is especially 'the case' if both of your families are very close.</p>

              <p>A fling.</p>
              <p>If you go to Hong Kong.. can you bear to see her in her bf's arms ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps you are looking to rekindle the flame/fling like what you had in Europe, I assure you.. it will not be the same. For in HK, she is in her own element.. in the environment which she needs to bear responsibility, where her real life continues.</p>
              <p>If her heart is in two places... yours and her bf's , can you tolerate it ?</p>
              <p>If you go for the sake of visiting .. as a tourist ...I believe you will enjoy it better.. keep your options open.. for in that foreign land.. perhaps there might be a new adventure with another soul..another new beginning.... perhaps not.</p>
              <p>But if you seek love from that girl you once held fleetingly in your arms....you must be prepared to be dissapointed.</p>
              <p>If I am you... I'd wait.. till the day she is no longer taken... before I take the flight of faith.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Good day everyone at the agony forum, I have a little crisis going on here and I can’t concentrate at work/school unless I solve this problem. Hopefully you guys can give me some advice about this matter.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">But first some background information:</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>I am an overseas Chinese living in the</span> <span>Europe</span><span>, one day my dad said my niece is coming from</span> <span>Hong Kong</span> <span>to the</span> <span>Netherlands</span> <span>at our house to stay for 4 days. She has graduated and wanted to sort of go backpacking in</span> <span>Europe</span> <span>you know the “see-the-world” trip before she works full time.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">My duty is to show her and her friends around and got a huge sum of money to cover their expenses. By the way, we are not blood related; she is my “god-niece” (is that how you call it?)</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">The moment we met at the airport we really hit off, she and her friends where surprised by the fact that I can speak pretty good Cantonese for someone who lives and go to school in a western country.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Everything is going as planned and of course I was very gallant to her. But then one night her friend is taking a shower and her male friend was hanging in front of the television we starting to wrestle a little. It was all very innocent, we started poking pushing each other and occasionally bumped some sensitive areas.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">That night everyone is very tired and went to bed, I asked her if she wanted to go to my room and watch a movie (it was a genuine question, I had no evil plans) okay maybe a little fantasies but come on an hour ago I was grabbing her ass.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">We were watching the movie peacefully on the couch in my room, since it was a small couch that only fitted me I suggested to lie in a position where her back is to my front (spoon if you will). As the movie got more exciting we were also getting more excited, we starting to kiss and caressing each other. At some point she stated she doesn’t want go all the way because she has a boyfriend so I stopped and we fell asleep holding each other.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">As days passes by (okay it’s just two/three days) we grow quite fond of each other, every time her friends isn’t in the same room we started to fool around. But of course all good things ends quickly as day four has arrived and she has to go away. So I accompanied her and her friends to the airport and shopped/ate there. There was still a little time before she has to enter the gates so her two friends were chilling at a random store. That’s when we went to some quiet place, we were holding hands and gave a passionate goodbye kiss.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Okay that’s the bg information.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">My question is should I or should I not go to Hk this summer and see if anything could happen between us? I was asking some of my close friends but in the end the conclusion was something like: “Nothing is going to happen she has a boyfriend” “you two live in two totally different worlds”</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">“nay she is just playing you dude!”<span> </span> “could you bring me a souvenir?”</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">I can’t interpreted her signals, I mean we kissed and stuff, we promised to keep in touch via fb or skype whatever and the day at the airport right after we kissed she asked me if I had something to ask/tell her. And she wanted me to come to HK to see her.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">What do you guys think? Go or no-go?</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> </span></span></p>

              <p>Sorry man.....but u need to understand, going on a tour is different with day-to-day living.</p>
              <p>When she went on a tour, she was trying to have some fun....apparently that went a bit overboard.....but if you try to continue on that and move to HK, or ask her to move to you, that is a completely different situation and a different mood already.</p>

              <p>What transpired bet the both of u is all gone - holding onto a cancelled cheque - is utterly dense - its real yes, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>only psychologically</em></span> (one keeps playing it on the mind, dwelling on what could have been or ...), the reality is everthing is change - that is the only permanence of existence.</p>
              <p>When one is a prisoner of the past, one treads oh so very carefully and the mystery of life and love is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lost</span> in roles n personalities cos one is identified (identifies) with the latter.

              <p>It makes no difference ( in this instance it is HK) - it could be in your neighbourhood , in class, at work - when one tries to objectify what is inherently a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">subjective</span> expereince to partake of - one always comes up short.
