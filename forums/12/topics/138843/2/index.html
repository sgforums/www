It's so humbug to type <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Ok, my personal opinion is that you are NORMAL.  Not everybody has to conform to the belief that you HAVE to be involved in some kinda relationship.  Do what works for you.<br><br>It is true that, in general, relationships entered into that young generally don't end in marriage (DISCLAIMER: There CAN be exceptions, but these are to be taken as the exception rather than the rule).<br><br>There are differing views with regards to the stance you've chosen to adopt: some, like you, prefer Not to be involved in too many relationships, but would rather sit by &amp; wait for the "Right One" to come along, &amp; which, hopefully, will end in marriage (but Not always the case, remember that).  Some prefer to hop into a few relationships, &amp; get some experience.<br><br>There are pros to both: People like yourself tend to get hurt less.  People who chose to have more relationships may figure out what they want earlier &amp; learnt to give &amp; take better.<br><br>Me? : )  I didn't have any stance nor expectations, but let life take its course (if you ask my parents, this is how I've always been).  So I ended up in many relationships, but ultimately, when life took its course, I have figured out what I want, &amp; thankfully, now I have what I want : )<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by NoTimeToWaitAr:</div><div class="quote_body">hi guys, this is my 1st post... i hv a problem, hope u guys will help mi.<br><br>i am currently a poly student. But fm pri till now, I haven been in a relationship b4. Most of my frenz hv gf or bf, but whenever i told them i didnt hv 1, they dun believe it. I told them that i prefer freedom rather than being tied by BGR, which is one of the reason. The other reason is that i dun like the feeling of being alone, be it with a gal/guy. Unless the gal/guy and i hv some common interest. Overall i like being in a grp.<br><br>Indeed i would like to hv a relationship. But fm wat i know, mostly these kind of relationship will end in ard 1 or 2 yrs time, unless the guy and gal love each other very much. So wouldn't it be a waste of time to contribute so much time in a relationship that will not last forever?<br><br>Actually there are some of the gals who hv told mi or hint mi that they are into mi, but i do not hv the courage to start this relationship.<br><br>Am i abnormal or am i tinkin too much?<br><br>i'm a guy who prefer quality than qualitity.<br><br>hope you guys out there cou;d give mi some advice.</div></blockquote></div>
