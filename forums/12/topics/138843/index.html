I used to have such thingy many fringing` years back (Venus in Virgo) and realise it was detrimental when I recalled now. You will eventually come to realise that love feels with the heart, not explored by the brain. Your surfacing exploration would only touch other people's lesson, not neccessary yours.<br><br>It's probably the same when I throw you a hypothetical scenario on how you would react when certain things happen in a relationship (say when you fell in love with a smoker and you disdain the idea of a lady smoker ALOT... a christian falling in love with a non-christian and worries about the religion conflicts... etc). Your answer MAY not reflect what you would do when exact scenario sprung up.<br><br>You are like in an isle, eyeing on the mainland from where you are standing. You have all the ability and resource to make that little boat to sail to where you desire to reach, but it's always the unknown and fear of the uncharted water that hinders your desire.<br><br>But of course, say if you are not interested in the people around you currently, there is nothing wrong with you NOT reacting even to their liking. A big however is when someone suitable comes along, do not succumb to your resistance, fear and false thoughts. You may come to regret severely in the future.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Think very hard before u make any decisions. U are young now.. and remember u are looking for a gf.. not a wife.. so no worries. (this is something, i sort of forgot when im younger =P im a perfectionist! one gf&gt;wife enough liao~ haha~~ )</div>

So I'll rearranged it for you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>"Indeed i would like to hv a relationship, but i do not hv the courage to start this relationship." -&gt; Taken separately from what you've wrote above, I took the liberty to merge them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>You are not abnormal at all, it's perfectly normal for you to be feeling this way. Please take note that your reason to your friend for not having a relationship is merely your EXCUSE to prevent people from thinking that you're weird. Don't tell them that, cos if they're stupid enough to believe you...they won't bother to introduce you to other girls. If they are sharp enough, they would have guessed your real reason anyway.<br><br>If you've realised that you need courage, you should also realised that you'll need to find it within yourself.<br><br>Tell us your fears and we will try to leviate for you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>[/b]</div>
