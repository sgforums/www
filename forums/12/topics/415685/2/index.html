              <p>In actual fact i think that we over focused ts's friend's
              comment. And singled it out for subjection. For every product there
              must be a cause as well as a process. A chain of events would lead
              up to this 'incident'.Eg, Maybe ts's friend was pissed cause he
              really liked science, envy? Why were you guys talking about oxygen
              tanks? Was your friend a professional diver? Is your friend an ego
              kia? How was your sentence phrased when you said that? What was the
              tone of your friend's when he made his reply ? Are your friends the
              'omg- got problem i better stfu and do myshit' type ?</p>
              <p>A few pointers to consider, anyway i over analysed it haha, i'm
              guessing you're stressed over your studies? anyway its already over
              so, just forget it liao la haha.</p>
              <p>bo liao &gt; i just watched gran torino, very touching,
              recommended. Cheers</p>

              <p>yeah in the past i was a very mean person who loved to be critical about everything... like how one speak, act or whatever... down to the very small things... in short being anal about everything... till one day it really pissed the lady I love a lot... I changed ever since then... </p>
              <p>sometimes we r wary on ppl but some ppl r just insensitive to others... they love to crack personal jokes or actually attack the person in words... i learnt it from the hard way that the best way to tackle such person is to ignore... the more you confront, the more he or she likes to make a joke out of you... i think i have lost my cool ever since i have entered uni... </p>
