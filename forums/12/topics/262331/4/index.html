Knowing her character and behaviour. Cross referencing to his character and behaviour. Finding out their commitment levels and faith in each other. (Ok I blown it too deep liao...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Not so cheem 1~)<br><br>The most fundamental thing from <span style="color: red;">my perspective</span> about a relationship between a guy and a gal is the level of communication and understanding. How well you know your partner will help to elevate your trust and faith in him/her. As well as your ease of sharing your thoughts and experiences with him/her. Be it good or bad, as long as he/she has the heart and willingness to listen, and keep in mind so as to help you or correct you when needed, any conflicts can be worked out no matter the severity of it.<br><br>I believe the relationship between the TS and his GF can be salvaged and emerged stronger than ever. Its only up to how mature the TS is and how well he can communicate with his GF.</div>

Since she like it to be this way, there is nothing you can do much NOW. I know sometimes is hard to let go, especially both of you LOVE one another b4.<br><br>Its seems there is some changes in her behaviour that she might think there are better ones outta there in the MARKET.<br><br>Is she Working outside? WORSE OFF! If she is working outside, there is possibility that she might have chances to meet some rich n caring guys outta there. That might change her view on you.<br><br>Stay Strong dude!
