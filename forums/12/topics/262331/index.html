            <div class='col-md body'>hellos people.<br><br>first and foremost, i would like to see some opinions on some issues that i'll be discussing below between my girl and i. Thanks alot for everything.<br><br>what would u do if ur girlfren's super demanding. demanding over issues like whre u go, wat you do and stuff like that? like she needs an explaination everyday kinda thing. u have no authority at all. zero authority i might add. she expects you to do what she says... and she doesnt care if it means changing you inside out.<br><br>she wants you to be with her 24 hours 7 days a week, and the only day u get to go out with others are the days she's out with her frens. she doesnt allow you to talk to a single GIRL in any form of communication and she expects to see all the history of any conversation with girls. and she only allows you to meet up with church frens once a week, or else she'll flare up for no particular reason.<br><br>and when u try to explain to her, she doesnt care about what u say. all she wants is to let u noe how she feel, which results in flaring up and threatening to break up kinda thing. she doesnt care about what u wanna say to her, be it agreeing with the issue or disagreeing with it. she's stubborn in that fact and she only wants you to listen to her.<br><br>basically, she wants you to listen to her all the time and whatever she says or instruct you to do, you must do it.<br><br>welcome to my life. how sad can it be. i've given everything to her, simply because i love her, but thats all im getting in return. its been a long 10 mths already. we just had a major quarrel. simply cos i was telling her that i have my band jamming practice session on saturday and she doesnt like the idea of it. thus, she decided to swicth off her fone and be sad about it. and when i try to sms her to get her to get back to me, she tells me to fcuk off and get out of her life.<br><br>how? im too sad to be actually sad already. its just so....... sigh.</div>

Thanks alot for everything.<br><br>what would u do if ur girlfren's super demanding. demanding over issues like whre u go, wat you do and stuff like that? like she needs an explaination everyday kinda thing. u have no authority at all. zero authority i might add. she expects you to do what she says... and she doesnt care if it means changing you inside out.<br><br>she wants you to be with her 24 hours 7 days a week, and the only day u get to go out with others are the days she's out with her frens. she doesnt allow you to talk to a single GIRL in any form of communication and she expects to see all the history of any conversation with girls. and she only allows you to meet up with church frens once a week, or else she'll flare up for no particular reason.<br><br>and when u try to explain to her, she doesnt care about what u say. all she wants is to let u noe how she feel, which results in flaring up and threatening to break up kinda thing. she doesnt care about what u wanna say to her, be it agreeing with the issue or disagreeing with it. she's stubborn in that fact and she only wants you to listen to her.<br><br>basically, she wants you to listen to her all the time and whatever she says or instruct you to do, you must do it.<br><br>welcome to my life. how sad can it be. i've given everything to her, simply because i love her, but thats all im getting in return. its been a long 10 mths already. we just had a major quarrel. simply cos i was telling her that i have my band jamming practice session on saturday and she doesnt like the idea of it. thus, she decided to swicth off her fone and be sad about it. and when i try to sms her to get her to get back to me, she tells me to fcuk off and get out of her life.<br><br>how? im too sad to be actually sad already. its just so....... sigh.</div></blockquote>Let her <strong>f</strong>uck out of your life. You don't need such a unreasonable girl.Since you can find a girlfriend I am sure you can find another out there.Good Luck.</div>
