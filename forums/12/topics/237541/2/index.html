She probably won't tell u because i)she doesn't want u to feel jealous/angry/sad/jealous or ii) because the past hurts, and she don't want 2 think about it anymore.<br><br>Either way, its up to u 2 decide if u really can forgive, forget and move on in life. But be warned that if u cannot forgive and forget, then it will be a sore point in ur relationship, and may come into action the next time u 2 quarrel.</div>
