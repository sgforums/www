Maybe as of now she is still uneasy talking about that particular period for it was the time she broke off with you and something happened. Give her time and someday she will talk about it of her own accord. Do not ask her about it or give her pressure about this.<br><br>I do not know how serious you 2 take this relationship of yours. Can get together, can break and get together again. It seems to me you 2 craved the company of each other. When there is smth else she will crave that at any cost and leaving you alone. You? I think you have not let it go as of yet.<br><br>I have a question for you: The feeling was so right that you 2 got together again. What if the feeling once again was gone like the time she ignored you or you ignored her? Please do not tell me that won't happen. It WILL.</div>
