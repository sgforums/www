              <p>hello. I have a problem pls advice</p>
              <p>I recently feel like avoiding my boyfriend because its awkward around him nowadays. I'm not being choosy or selfish (im so sorry if i sounds like it) but often i treat him meals and stuff. Isn't it weird? really sorry for being selfish but this is not what i was expecting. When we went to clubbing together with our group of friends, i caught him dance with other girls too but when i dance with some random guys, he scold me. And when the time comes when i finally had it with him, he gave me some stern warning that i will regret it if i broke up with him. I'm really scared. Even my friends asked me to not to do this and to continue on having a relationship with him. They asked me to endure a few months with him till he get bored of me or something but i cant wait that long. pls to the girls, how u break up with such a aggresive guy? i really cant take it anymore. pls i really need help i do anything</p>

              <p>I think you will more regret if you let him intimidate you to make you stay in this unwanted relationship.</p>
              <p>What you scared he will do to you ?</p>
              <p>Aggressors/abusers tends to scare you first to see how you react.</p>
              <p>If you react like a mouse and show your fear, he knows that's your weakness and will repeatedly use it to inimidate you so that he gets his way with you.</p>
              <p>If he dares to intimidate you again, simply tell him you have made a police report with his name, address and contact number listed. If anything happens to you, he will be the first person the police will pay a visit to.</p>
              <p>Aggressors are cowards, they only dare to bully those who are weak.</p>
              <p>Your friends who advise you to stay with him because they are fearful are a bunch of useless friends. Instead of protecting you, they'd rather feed you to that wolf.</p>

              <p>Dearest Pebly,</p>
              <p>Alot of girls have approached me and ask me whether they should break up with their boyfriends. I tell them that first and foremost, mutual feelings are essential in a relationship. Do you still love him? Do you still have the same feelings for him when you first laid eyes or given your heart to, initially? That isnt a hard question to answer.</p>
              <p>Quoting from my book , "The Master Ways to Develop and Bring Your Relationships Further" Chapter 3 : Feelings. Think about the reasons why you want to break up with him? If you are upset seeing him dance with other people, tell him that..Focus on that and resolve that issue. If it had happened before and still, nothing has happened thereafter, then a breakup may be the only way out.  Articulate and express the reasons with him as that will make him think that you really want to break up with him and the reasons are so predominant in the relationship.</p>
              <p>Next, you have to ask yourself how long do you plan to be single. Do you want to quickly recover form this relationship and bounce to a new one? Or do you want to focus on your studies/career first before finding another partner?</p>
              <p>The next chapter of my book, "The Master Ways to Develop and Bring Your Relationships Further" regarding Post BreakUps will discuss more about distancing yourself from your ex and reducing the heartbreaks.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>hello. I have a problem pls advice</p>
              <p>I recently feel like avoiding my boyfriend because its awkward around him nowadays. I'm not being choosy or selfish (im so sorry if i sounds like it) but often i treat him meals and stuff. Isn't it weird? really sorry for being selfish but this is not what i was expecting. When we went to clubbing together with our group of friends, i caught him dance with other girls too but when i dance with some random guys, he scold me. And when the time comes when i finally had it with him, he gave me some stern warning that i will regret it if i broke up with him. I'm really scared. Even my friends asked me to not to do this and to continue on having a relationship with him. They asked me to endure a few months with him till he get bored of me or something but i cant wait that long. pls to the girls, how u break up with such a aggresive guy? i really cant take it anymore. pls i really need help i do anything</p>

              <p>It is with horror and sadness that I feel for you on reading your plight. I am aware of guys who can be quite domineering and self centred, regardless if he is some gentlemanly looking scholar or tattooed chao Ah Beng. I understand my own gender species well.</p>
              <p>Selfish and only care for their own needs without a damn to others, and when the girl wants to break off, threats come flying, sometimes fake, many times real where passion is involved. Thus I comprehend your fear.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, courage is not enough, despite many others' advice, for the threats are real, and you certainly have no wish to come to mental or physical harm, nor would I want you to come to that stage.</p>
              <p>Some believe a court order or protection order will bind you, but unfortunately, that works only for people who have brains and have no wish to run afoul of the law. Thus you are trapped, and too late for regrets.</p>
              <p>It is good you share you plight here, so that many other readers may avoid getting trap as well. Macho is cool and attractive, but more often than not, the macho front is only a cover to hide deep insecurities and fear within.</p>
              <p>The true macho ones are the quiet ones. The only time you will get to see their true worth is at times of troubles and crisis as they will calmly and intelligently shine a path for others out of adverse situations.</p>
              <p>I have not the answers that will free you, but putting myself in the shoes of the chao ah beng, I may percieve his insight and views. To deal with an enemy is to first know and understand how he ticks.</p>
              <p>He has an ego - his pride. To allow you to leave him, would be a blow to his presumed 'macho' image. He does not love you, for if he did, he would be sincere to you.</p>
              <p>Dancing or flirting with other girls is never a sign of sincerity, so are threats of injury to you. You are only his toy, to parade around his friends that he is 'the can' - capable of getting a girl despite his ah bengness and jail experiences.</p>
              <p>Thus the trick would be to allow him his stupid ego to be supreme. Make yourself boring. Shave your head (hair can grow back) and tell him its the latest fashion later. Wear boring clothes, fully covered up, and claim the weather is hot. Dont put on any more makeup and claim you are allegic to lotions. Dont splash perfume anymore, better still, dont shower, tell him you did shower and he will feel disgusted.</p>
              <p>The keyword is 'disgust'. Make him disgusted with you. I know it may not be your way, but it is a necessary sacrifice, for your life is indeed in danger. No one else can help you except yourself. It will only be for a few weeks. Make him disgusted and dump you instead.</p>
              <p>Forget about your pride for these few months. Once he dumps you, you will be free, to grow your hair and be the real woman you truly are, more wiser and matured, to never make the same mistake again. Avoid him, and if he intends to patch back, tell him you saw an astrologer and your stars are not right for each other. Only harm will befall. This chao ah beng is superstitious too, being an uneducated bum that he truly is.</p>
              <p>This is only my suggestion, and only for your consideration. Most important of all, do take good care of yourself. Whatever that had happened in the past cannot be change, but you have the power to change your future. It is in your hands.</p>
              <p>Good luck and please, please take good care of yourself.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
