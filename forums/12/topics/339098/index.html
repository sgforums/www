              <p>reply her lor. it won't kill you, right? why think so much?</p>
              <p>besides, to some people, cousins are like friends to them. so what's the big deal when she refers to her cousin as friend?</p>
              <p>if you miss her, just tell her you miss her. life is fragile, you know, especially with terrorism abound. we never know when we will breathe our last. so let your loved ones know you really care, while you are still alive.</p>
              <p>don't waste time being frustrated or jealous over little things. life's too short for that.</p>

              <p>I agree with skythewood... It's called a "friend" so you shouldn't actually think too much on whether she wants or dont want to meet up with you. Maybe you're actually thinking too much between u both... And i'm quite sure with the situation and the relationship(I do not mean gf/bf) u both have now, u must be feeling quite tired...</p>
              <p>Do urself a favor and reply the sms instead of thinking of the 283905719057 possible outcome in ur head... You'll feel much better...</p>

A day before the meeting and she still hasnt called to cfm, and so i called her to cfm. She told me she couldnt make it..

              has she replied since? 
              
              i feel tt u've read too much into her "are you back?" sms. r u assuming tt she msged u cos maybe she misses u? 
              
              to be more realistic, it cld just mean: "i am bored today, and i suddenly want to ask u out... but i remember u went overseas. so i jus sms to check."
              
              sorry to be so harsh ah... :/ i bet u feel like replying her... and meeting up with her and all... but she really doesn't sound like she's very into you. nt even as a close friend... 
              
              if u still wan to gauge her feelings towards u, a good way is to do the counter-intuitive thing... u dun need to express ur liking for her verbally... u will be able to tell fr her actions if she is interested.
              
              dun try too hard to arrange a mtg with her... see if she asks u out (to make up for tt time when she cldn't meet u before u went overseas)...
              
              hmm getting to know someone is a process... dun need to rush into things... u may have strong feelings for her, but at this point, it really doesn't sound like it's mutual...
