            <div class='col-md body'>My friend is currently in a realtionship and I'm one of the people that she goes to when things get rocky... Well, I'm not the main guy, more like when everyone else is busy... But listening to her, I kinda feel for her, but I not in a possition to give any good advise... And according to her, my sort is advice is kinda unfeeling and not a good one at that... Well, couldn't blame her, I got no gf and by the looks of thing I won't be getting any in the near future... All I could do is just listen but every time I hear it, it kinda sounds like she is in a distructive relationship... But I can't judge that, I got no qualification...<br><br>According to her, his bf is the kind that is very temperamental... Just this week, she missed his birthday and he went ballistic... He won't see her even if she want to appoligise and he tore up a card which is special to my friend... And his anger will last weeks...(Is that normal?) Plus my friend seemed to be the one who is helping him alot... even gone all the way to miss 30 min of her exam just to see him and spend hours into the night to help him with his project scacrificing her exam study time... I told her it was a stupid move but according to her it was worth it somehow... But according to her, he has his good side, he went all the way to a 2hr bus ride after work just to meet her for a mere 15min... She also kinda feel that they were ment for each other according to astrology, dreams and other mythical stuff... It doesn't take a genious to know that those are unreliable sources but she seem to believe that is true...<br><br>The scariest thing she told me is that he once went ballistic that she won't sleep with him... BTW we're in our 18s... Is that normal...<br><br>I really like to help her but my advice is usually ones that, according to her is from a guy that never had a gf so I won't understand... So, what should my advice be? Atleast what should she do about missing his birthday?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its good you dun advice too deep, coz you dunno she will accept or not. You dun even noe how will she be affected by it: sae will she get it wrong den things get worse and she blames you?<br><br>Being 18... Ah... brings back old memories... I can only say all of you have many years ahead and there is always time to learn more and mature and grow stronger. You are doing very well by being there for her and listening to her. Offering advices is another matter, which I think pro councellors are better suited to help out.</div>
