Don't fall for a ger just because she is cute, nice, adorable, feminine, pretty, sweet etc. She has to understand you and you have to understand her.<br><br>Do you know her needs ? DO you know YOUR needs ? Can the both of you provide each others' needs ?<br><br>All these questions take a long time for you to find the answer.<br><br>If you already have the answers to these questions, then you will know how to settle this problem.

            <div class='col-md body'>hey.. this scenario is very familiar to me. Let's say, I went steady with my tution fren's gd fren. My tution fren, N, did not know abt it but he seemed to find C(my ex) and me very close.. but he tot dat it was because C was my kor kor.<br><br>We nver told N dat we were together. Since N and C were gd frens, and both knew me, it was natural dat N told C dat he had a huge crush on me... N called C almost everyday to tell C abt his crush.. and C in turn would tell me everything N said.<br><br>One reason we didn't tell N abt our relationship was becos I was afraid dat N would blab it out to all my tution mates.<br><br>So C finally.. i think gt very irritated with N and it caused some of the problems in our relationship. In the end.. C broke up wif me... and N and C's frenship was broken.. cos N started to dislike C for dumping me.<br><br>Hai..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmz ...... I have seen this situation before and had the girl asking me for advice on who to choose ... It sounds strange doesn't it ? The 2 boys like her, the girl likes the two ...<br>My friend Z knew her through irc, and asked her out and be his cyberstead, she eventually agreed, and they met about 1 year later ... ( sounds so strange ain't it ? ) well ... while Z was meeting the girl H, he brought X along with him. As it turns out, X also irced, and talked alot with H. Z found out about this, and thought it was nothing, so he kept quiet about the matter.<br>X and Z were rather good friends, but when X told H that he liked her, Z immediately distanced himself from X, and it ended up in a fight for a girl. The girl, confused and irritated upon who to choose, chose Neither !<br>It ended up the 3 of them being hurt ...<br>So you can take some of the advice above ... but DO Consider it VERY carefully. In case ALL of you gets hurt. That's all i have to say ...<br><br>------------------<br>The night is near and dawn is coming... I Lay awake on my bed thinking of you... I wonder ... when will we meet again ? When will we talk once more ? I Know my love to you is deep and true ... but i wonder how you feel for me ...</div>
