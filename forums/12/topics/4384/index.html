NOT ONLY love... When a certain portion of your life have benn 'disappointed' or likewise... You tends to hide from it or forget about it... DISCARDING it as YOUR PAST and NO LONGER part of your whole... Hence, the feeling of 'part of you felt dead' comes in...<br>The places, songs and words are just indirectly LINKED to him (that DESTROYED part of you?)... This is just a inborn nature of human....

Just noticed, VERY INTERESTING signature you've got there...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>I understand how you feel in this post... That's why I've always urge people to know their directions before they decide to move on.... ESPECIALLY after a blow... To move on is to pick yourself up, recognise your NEW direction and walk along the path... NOT to RUN away from your FEAR without knowing where you're heading for NEXT...<br>It's COMMON for people to come to realise one day that they've been 'RUNNING' for MOST of their life when they look back... Not understanding why are they on 'this path'.... Hence, LOST.....<br>The life you've spent after the particular incident is not superficial... It's AS REAL AS it is.... If it was led not for the fact of simply GOING AGAINST the incident... It is not truly wasted... EVEN if it WAS.... It was not toally wasted.....<br>What I would urge you to do is what you've already chosen to do... To face it and GRIEF... BUT... To RETURN to your life after that... Afterall, the PAST are just MEMORIES.... MEMORIES are just STORED DATA.... Go back and tidy up your 'storeroom'.... But don't forget to come back...
