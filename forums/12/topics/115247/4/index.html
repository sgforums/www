I'm supposed to be happy that humans are so crap then? Ok. Hurray!<br><br>I don't want to BE human, not that I don't want to feel human. there is a difference there. And I FEEL alien, not that I WANT to feel alien. another difference there.<br>Let's put it in perspective. I WANT to feel human, but I feel alien. I DON'T want to be human, but I am.  That is different from NOT WANTING to feel human and WANTING to feel alien. i don't think u can want to feel like you're something or not.<br><br>Putting your logic to use, then people who are saying that being gay is wrong and that being straight is right are simply stating personal views then. So are the people who say that being white is good and being black is bad. All of those are personal views are they not? But the point is that many personal views are bigotry, especially when it concerns other living beings. And please point out how I have been lacking in my manners. All thru my post I've been explaining things to you, instead of simply swearing and cursing at you like many of the other idiot forumnites do. If u do choose to percive my explaining my views to you as being rude to you, then really, there is nothing I can do. It seems like u think the only way I can be polite is to either agree with you or shut myself up? Lady or not, I try to be polite to people in general, despite their not being deserving of it. If you're expecting an apology from me for simply stating my views and how i think u're mis-interpreting my disagreement of your opinions is rude, then none is forth coming. From the point when u started saying that if im not human then im ugly, I'm already offended, but civility was forthcoming towards you, and I tried to explain my views, but YOU choose to be offended, then really, I would say you are overdemanding.<br><br>And finally, I know physically i am human. But mentally im not, no matter how much u say i am. And I'd hardly call your posts as nice. Accusing someone of not being civilized when they have been, is hardly nice, even by human standards. As for denouncing humans being bigotry, I suppose u think denouncing racists and sexists is bigotry too. Oh well. I should have expected it. You can't accept someone on a different wavelength. Just because they have a different way of thinking from you, they can't tell u about it, or you won't talk to them. Fine by me.</div>
