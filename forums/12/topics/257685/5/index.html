            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Time to Reflect </strong><br><br>It has been an interesting process and I have learnt much about myself and some of the people here in sgforums. A new moderator will be appointed soon in AA and with that, open a new chapter in the history of sgforums. When the flaming started a few months ago I created Â“Tan Ah TeckÂ” to voice my displease. I decided to play the role of a clown and inevitably appear as a nutcase for some. Frankly I donÂ’t care and I never regret doing so until yesterday when I snapped. It came as a shock to me too for this was never part of my plan.<br><br>I love sgforums, sorry to mentioned you FireIce, but you knows why I love this forum so much. It was an ideal place for me to start afresh and IÂ’ve put in much effort here. It really saddens me to see one of the main sub-forums going down the drain as results of the actions of a few people.<br><br>However with the coming of the new moderator, I no longer serve any useful purpose here. It is actually quite easy to play the clown thanks to this <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> , just add it to the end of a sentence.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But before I leave I wish to address a few persons, so please bear with me.<br><br>1) Vk, thanks for the pm exchange. I am surprise we do share some things in common after all. Sorry I will not be having coffee with you as Â“Tan Ah TeckÂ”? But maybe as my original nick? We shall see.<br><br>2) D and Q. I am not going to ask you guys to move on because it is easier said than done. Just like anger management, I thought I had graduated; well apparently I am still at Primary 1. Ladi is right, take a deep breath, hold your tongue and thoughts for 10 minutes. I donÂ’t think you two will ever be friends. So letÂ’s keep it this way. We each have our life to live. And Q, if you need a counselor feel free to pm me, I know a very good social worker from Fei Yue.<br><br>3) Neko Rin and rainee, all the best to you two. Getting married soon?<br><br>4) To Ladi and Space1999, thanks for posting in this thread in order to irritate me. I am not trying to be sarcastic but IÂ’ve learnt so much about myself from the two of you. Space good luck in your business, hope it prospers and Ladi, vk ask me to apologize to you but I refused, you know why? Maybe you are not interested to know and you donÂ’t give a damn but I still have to tell you, personal attack is acceptable but involving family members is not.<br><br>You guys might think me as a hypocrite or a coward but it is absolutely fine with me. You see it is very difficult to control what other thinks and we are talking about an online forum here. But to be fair Ladi, I do regret calling you a b<strong></strong>itch not because I am afraid that you might report me to the police. In fact you donÂ’t have a case against me. The reason is I have not met you in-person and it is really unfair to judge a personÂ’s character online. Who know you may be a nice person in real life. Besides, I know you will not be interested to meet a low-lifer like me anyway. Well God bless both of you.<br><br>5) And lastly to all the good people out there, God bless all of you! You are not insignificant; you are part of the sgforums family. And of course God bless sgforums too.<br><br>So can the new moderator of AA kindly lock this thread? I donÂ’t want this to be another senseless battleground. Maybe Jason can help if he happens to be here tonight. With this, I end my stay as Â‘Tan Ah TeckÂ”. Borrowing Andrew's line, Tan Ah Teck doesn't exist.<br><br>My name is Tan Ah Teck and I am an honest man.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I am surprise to receive quite a few pms regarding my identify and 2-3 calling me a coward for kow towing to Space, Ladi, etc. Very interesting.<br><br>Let me briefly reply them,<br><br>1) Without the acknowledge from its original creator, Â“Tan Ah TeckÂ” is just a few letters on the screen. Thanks for showing an interest in me, but letÂ’s keep it this way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>2) As far as I am concerned, there are not permanent enemies and we are talking about an online forum here. Look at Japan and US. But the main reason is I snapped. When you find that you are unable to control your emotions, it is time to back down. Besides, we have fun right Space? As for my position it has never been changed, my only concern is sgforums.<br><br>Who knows, I might be back one day?  Oh, another thing, donÂ’t believe in everything youÂ’ve read. ThatÂ’s what so interesting about this forum.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Take care and God bless.<br><br>(binarynwitz, God bless you too.) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

Im sorry we quarrelled in the past but i believe truly by following this path you can really find true happiness in your soul but if you do join please buy a groin guard, (you will find out why in the future why i tell you do this)<br><br>and for heaven sake don t join taichi, take you years and you will be bored very fast..<br><br>any question please pm i will be more than happy to help you on your journey<br><br>and i need to answer this<br><br>despite how tough you think you are , there are always tougher ppl there, the only difference is your speed and your techniques and the last part , the ruthlessness.<br><br>and even now i m sure i can take you on in a sparring match , streets or the ring.<br><br>but lets do it in the ring, then we can have a cup of coffee later to discuss techniques rather than both of us going to police station.<br><br>cheers<br><br>remember<br><br>Bruce lee was not born ready to fight, he trained endless hours to reach where he was, even though he died.<br><br></div>
