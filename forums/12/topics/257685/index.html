            <div class='col-md body'>Let me tell you a bit about myself. Since young I have trouble controlling my anger. I constantly got into fights and joined gangs. My parents give up on me and I donÂ’t blame. After one terrible incident which I was punished I decided to mend my ways. I read up on psychology, tried mediation, explore all as many religions as I could but none really help. I even took up marital art but later I was told to stop because the instructors found me too aggressive. Even when I was in the army I got myself into fights and I was surprised I didnÂ’t get into DB. But I never stop trying to control my anger.<br><br>At work I always volunteer to handle nasty customers, the nastier the better. I see them as a reflection of myself. For a few years I was at peace, and soon I came across sgforums and fell in love with this place. I am a clone, I am not going to hide it. I make new friends here who do not know my past and what IÂ’ve done.<br><br>For months I have trying very hard to stay positive but as I continue to see this group of ppl making a mess out of the place I love I decided to created a clone to voice my displease. Who the fu<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>ck do they think they are! I may be a loser but what about you ppl! All the while I have in control of my anger but today I snapped. One of the remarks from that group somehow triggered off my anger. I have never felt such pure hatred and anger for so long. Who the fu<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>ck do they think they are! Why are they doing this to sgforums a place I love! My hands were cold and I was burning with anger. Nothing matters to me anymore. My career, my family, my life, I donÂ’t give a damn! I just want them to STOP!!!!! I start to hear voices in my head again, their screaming is driving me crazy. It took my almost half a day to cool down and for the voices to go away.<br><br>But now I still canÂ’t sleep. I am afraid this will not be the last time and I might not be able to control myself.<br></div>
