Imagine 9 freaking years repeating the same kind of love cosmic lesson in life - this is terrible.<br><br>Both of you are probably people who encounter problems in that relationship, but doesn't really know how to handle them OR avoidance is a common practice. (Unless right in the beginning, this relationship isn't meant to be - meaning, it was born from poor ground) It is like there seemed to be meaning in a relationship to blossom, but as you both got closer, you discover the oasis is merely a mirage. The reality of relationship sinks in; either one of you back out - the whole cards of relationship tumbles.<br><br>Years of searching around - still this emotions isn't address. It hides like a crafty cockroach. It lurks and surface whenever possible relationship issues were encountered by both you and her and create much vaccum, which directly trigger her/your intention to have that contact and return to that state again.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Please understand that every relationship has their reason for existence and reason for non-existence.<br><br>Basically you have a choice - you can opt for a relationship with her, but I need to have a clearer picture on your past relationship with her. More details, the better - so that I could analysis and give you a complete neutral point of view.<br><br>OR<br><br>Learn that this relationship wasn't meant to be. You both reject the lesson of moving forward and love, which history ultimately send you both walking around the bushes and ended up in the same location many years back. If you cannot control emotions - don't land in situations that you know emotions will overwhelm you. Cut and destroy connections - it hurts, no doubt, not because you really like her or what - but <strong>because the result of your actions already sunk so deep and the pain of pulling them out forever is incredibly excruciating.</strong><br><br>You could leave the knife there - but you will die by the wounds eventually. Either one of you are indecisive - please note that this is probably one of the main cause of today's circumstances. Gain wisdom, gain enlightenment, embrace your lessons in love. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
