            <div class='col-md body'>my first post in Aunt Agony,<br><br>Vietnam women are pretty good, in terms of looks and character.<br>Most i've met or spoken to (business contacts/frens) are down-to-earth, honest and sincere. coz their life is tough, they appreciate things much more.<br><br>buy is a strong word i agree, they're (Vietnam) good women, you just have to find the right girl and give her happiness by treating her right and not expecting tons in return. (i suggest getting virgin in case you worried about HIV)<br><br>33 ~ 35 is a good age to get them if fate isn't working for you. hehe<br><br>but then january.. how do you look yourself? i would think it matters, as you've gotten dress up and look good to feel good and confident about yourself.<br>girls generally are attracted to confident guys, inner confidence.<br>and then.. you really need to chase a girl lor.. haha give her calls or sms to show you're interested in them.. thats my thoughts.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
