            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... maybe let me just sum up the type of guys girls dun like (or rather the types that I dun like myself <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>1) <strong>Mama's boy</strong> - His mama calls him every half hour on his mobile just to check how his date is progressing. Calls pour in after 10pm to remind his darling son to retire home early. He cannot quote a sentence without reference to his own folks. The kind of image he projects is that of a guy without his own opinion, easily influenced by his folks, friends and others. How can a girl be sure this kind of guy would stand up for her in times of needs then? He seems to be a ninny.<br><br>2) <strong>The Narcissist</strong> - This guy values his looks more than a typical vainpot lady does. An accidental ruffle to his hair cause him to blow. He wags his tail when anyone praises him on his looks and breaks away to talk to them becos he finds them more entertaining than his date. His date worries that should a fire breaks out, he would grab his mirror first instead of her.<br><br>3) <strong>Mr Ulmighty </strong>- He talks of his accomplishment at work, how well he's treated his girls, his fav topic (e.g. politics, stock market) and drones on and on except expressing his concerns for you, asking how's your day, what are your fav things. It's always about his abilities, what he's learnt, how knowledgable he is, where he's been. Nothing for you or ON you.<br><br>4) <strong>Green Eye Monster</strong> - Lets loose a menacing look/growl shd any guy toss a glance in your direction. He gets worried to know if you've got any guy friends and ask you not to meet them anymore.<br><br>5)<strong> The Interrogator</strong> - Barely knowing each other for a day, he's asked you where you've been, what you've done, what have you ate, what'll you do the next day, who have you been with, why, how, where, when, who, which? Serious invasion of privacy. Definitely not one out of concern as you can tell from the tone of voice. Which gal wouldn't run?<br><br>6) <strong>The Ungracious One</strong> - Talks with his mouth full (gross!) and spit saliva and rice unto your face unknowingly. In face of traffic, crosses road first leaving the gal to fend for herself without looking back to check on her safety. Does not hold the door for the gal but instead go thru the door first, unknowingly let the door slam in the date's face. When the girl is carrying heavy stuff, does not offer to help carry but instead talk and walk his usual guy speed leaving the girl behind juggling her stuff. If girl drops things under the table, does not offer to help her pick up item. What a guy...<br><br>7) <strong>Mr Shy</strong> - Looks at the floor, looks at the wall, looks at the potted plant, at the wall clock, looks at the cute waitress on your left, looks at the hunk on your right, looks even right down at your boobs. In short, he looks everywhere but at you in your face. How's that for a conversation?<br><br>8 ) <strong>The Starer</strong> - You're eating your food nonchalantly and turns around to find him staring at you almost dreamily. Even so, he does not break off his stare. Freaky.<br><br>9) <strong>Mr Busy </strong>- As you're talking to him, he's busy smsing away. He disappears from time to time to answer his call or make a call. Serious lack of respect for his date.<br><br>Any guy guilty of the above charges?<br><br>In short, your little actions even during a non-date reveals a lot about yourself and your personality. If even during a normal casual chanced meet you emit vibes that give clues to the above behaviours, you wont seem like an enjoyable date. Girls dun like to be around people that make them feel uncomfortable and uncared for.<br><br>Perhaps time to brush up on your social ettiqutte and skills.<br><br>Hope this helps.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys,<br><br>Don't be too desperate for girls and allow a girl to put you down. If a girl is ever rude to you even as a friend, don't let her treat you that way. Don't be down there and allow her to insult you or throw any sort of tantrums at you. Shoot back, especially the nice guys.<br><br>If ever, she does that to you, be ready to say goodbye unless she apologises. If you are wrong, apologise but don't think she is a girl and you are so scared of saying the wrong thing. Women are humans like you and me. They are not fairies.<br><br>There are a bunch of bad and good girls down there, just like there are jerks and gentleman. If you are lucky, grab the good one who likes you. Don't expect that she will make your life happy. Happiness is from within. Even the nicest girl will find problems with you. And don't wait too long for a girl, neither should you let a girl wait for you.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br>doko</div>

Yeah.. so do something about it lor.<br><br>And about that 'last straw', i dunno whether you should even have this contingency in place..... cos to me it seems like you've given up before the battle is even over.<br><br>Just my 2 cents.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by YouDonKnowMe:<br><strong>Hmm... maybe let me just sum up the type of guys girls dun like (or rather the types that I dun like myself <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>1) [b]Mama's boy</strong> - His mama calls him every half hour on his mobile just to check how his date is progressing. Calls pour in after 10pm to remind his darling son to retire home early. He cannot quote a sentence without reference to his own folks. The kind of image he projects is that of a guy without his own opinion, easily influenced by his folks, friends and others. How can a girl be sure this kind of guy would stand up for her in times of needs then? He seems to be a ninny.<br><br>2) <strong>The Narcissist</strong> - This guy values his looks more than a typical vainpot lady does. An accidental ruffle to his hair cause him to blow. He wags his tail when anyone praises him on his looks and breaks away to talk to them becos he finds them more entertaining than his date. His date worries that should a fire breaks out, he would grab his mirror first instead of her.<br><br>3) <strong>Mr Ulmighty </strong>- He talks of his accomplishment at work, how well he's treated his girls, his fav topic (e.g. politics, stock market) and drones on and on except expressing his concerns for you, asking how's your day, what are your fav things. It's always about his abilities, what he's learnt, how knowledgable he is, where he's been. Nothing for you or ON you.<br><br>4) <strong>Green Eye Monster</strong> - Lets loose a menacing look/growl shd any guy toss a glance in your direction. He gets worried to know if you've got any guy friends and ask you not to meet them anymore.<br><br>5)<strong> The Interrogator</strong> - Barely knowing each other for a day, he's asked you where you've been, what you've done, what have you ate, what'll you do the next day, who have you been with, why, how, where, when, who, which? Serious invasion of privacy. Definitely not one out of concern as you can tell from the tone of voice. Which gal wouldn't run?<br><br>6) <strong>The Ungracious One</strong> - Talks with his mouth full (gross!) and spit saliva and rice unto your face unknowingly. In face of traffic, crosses road first leaving the gal to fend for herself without looking back to check on her safety. Does not hold the door for the gal but instead go thru the door first, unknowingly let the door slam in the date's face. When the girl is carrying heavy stuff, does not offer to help carry but instead talk and walk his usual guy speed leaving the girl behind juggling her stuff. If girl drops things under the table, does not offer to help her pick up item. What a guy...<br><br>7) <strong>Mr Shy</strong> - Looks at the floor, looks at the wall, looks at the potted plant, at the wall clock, looks at the cute waitress on your left, looks at the hunk on your right, looks even right down at your boobs. In short, he looks everywhere but at you in your face. How's that for a conversation?<br><br>8 ) <strong>The Starer</strong> - You're eating your food nonchalantly and turns around to find him staring at you almost dreamily. Even so, he does not break off his stare. Freaky.<br><br>9) <strong>Mr Busy </strong>- As you're talking to him, he's busy smsing away. He disappears from time to time to answer his call or make a call. Serious lack of respect for his date.<br><br>Any guy guilty of the above charges?<br><br>In short, your little actions even during a non-date reveals a lot about yourself and your personality. If even during a normal casual chanced meet you emit vibes that give clues to the above behaviours, you wont seem like an enjoyable date. Girls dun like to be around people that make them feel uncomfortable and uncared for.<br><br>Perhaps time to brush up on your social ettiqutte and skills.<br><br>Hope this helps.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>[/b]</blockquote>woo, haha looks interesting. but accurate? must get opinion of girls mah!</div>
