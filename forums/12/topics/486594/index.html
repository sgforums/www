              <p>Hi, may I ask is there a cure for such syndrome? I admit that I have got such problem where  I am always absent minded and often screwed lot of things that I done.</p>
              <p>I have done admin job in my national service. I doesn't like it but I try my best to do it.  I am appointed to sort out documents and arrange them neatly according to
                   the date, from the latest onward and destroying documents that are 
                  outdated. When I arranged them, I took out the outdated ones and destroy
                   them. I arranged the rest of it in order and I have checked that I have
                   sorted them out properly, but there are still a few documents that I 
                  arranged wrongly where my senior have checked and he said that some of 
                  the outdated documents are still in. They are worried that did I destroy
                   the new ones. In the end, there are some new documents that are 
                  destroyed by me and they got angry with me. I have been doing this a 
                  couple of times and I still have such carelessness. I often got 
                  confinement for doing such mistakes. My supervisor was very angry with me and my colleagues complained that my brain 
                  is slow and often mess up and muddle things around.</p>
              <p>There are seevral times, one of the colleagues wanted to frame up. One of the case is he put the contact list of our entire unit camp in my bag. I was very busy at that time and I did
                   not notice. They phone me when I was on off day to ask me if I have 
                  accidentally brought home the contact list and they asked me to check my
                   bag. I was shocked to found out that it was in my bag where I am 
                  certain that I did not open my bag on that day, only before and after office hour where I change my clothes only and why
                   is the contact list in my bag, I am clueless. One of them wanted to 
                  frame me and use my absent-mindedness weak point to set me up.</p>
              <p>Even simple calculation, I am slow in working out. I am good in Maths and POA for calculation with the help of using calculators but they don't allow me to use calculators at work. Some of the 
                  colleagues saw me counting figures using my hands and they laughed 
                  at me saying to me still a primary school moron. They treated me like an
                   ignorance fool.</p>
              <p>I am worried that this might happen again if I am working in a company/premises in my job career. I am not sure what should I do? I am not sure are there something wrong with my brain? Is there a way to cure such illness?</p>

              <p>Now come to think of it, could it be maybe I am slow in counting numbers? I often rely on calculators. If there are no calculators and counting it mentally, I am slow. For example, without using calculatos, I calculate 50 - 9.90, I have a hard time thinking for about a few mins to solve and answer it wrongly. Not sure if that is the case...:/</p>
              <p>Maybe if I improve my mental sum, can I improve my thinking ability and absent mindness?</p>
              <p>Maybe if someone could work with me, he/she would not stand my slow brain syndrome and that is what happen when I am serving my national service in admin office.</p>

              <p>when you sort your documents, put the new ones one side, and those to be destroyed one side</p>
              <p>with these two piles, you can go through them one more time to double check yourself</p>
              <p>then ask your supervisor to check first before you destroy</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the aspect of studies, the ones who get As in their A Levels are those who have good memories, not because they are intelligent, but because they can memorise text upon texts. Bec I have seen straight A students who are inarticulate and unintelligible. For yourself, it would be highly possible to train to memorise blocks of texts and even dockets that u come across, memorise their profile and recall them the next day, just to activate the memory area of your mind. I am one of those who don't believe that a person is born either with a good memory or or a 'bad' memory. We can all recall n thus we can remember (unless we are elderly and hv alzheimers).</div>
