                              <p>Why is it so impossible to find good guys here in singapore?</p>
              <p>Here are my terms for finding love, guys, please tell me, am i
              expecting too much?</p>
              <p>I want a guy who will only look at me, has eyes for me, and once
              we're in love, he has to think that i'm beautiful and sexy no
              matter how my figure changes. I don't care if you have to look at
              girls on the internet, but when you save them on your computer,
              it's too much for me. He has to be faithful, loving, and be willing
              to spend ALOT of time with me.I don't care about porn, cos i know
              all guys watch porn, I don't care if u save porn on your computer,
              but i just cant accept pictures of girls on your computer.</p>
              <p>Guys, please tell me is it too much to ask for?</p>
              <p>I'm so unhappy with my current guy, all he ever does is think,
              look for, and look at girls.</p>
              <p>I have to dress so skimpy so that he won't look at girls, but it
              doesn't work. Why is everything a desperate bid by me just so that
              he will pay more attention to me and not look for, look at and
              think of girls? Do all guys do that?</p>
              <p>I wana be sexy in my own way, I can never dress the way i want
              to when i'm with him. I don't wana dress like modern girls, who
              show so much. I wana be sexy in a sophisticated way, I hate
              dressing in short shorts just to please him!</p>
              <p>By the way, do all guys save pictures of girls on the computer?
              Cos if it is, then I'm not sure I wana find a guy anymore.Maybe
              stay single or be a lesbian.</p>
              <p>Please tell me, what do Singapore guys look for in a girl? Are
              my expectations too much? Why does my current guy treat me like
              that? I feel so ugly and fat when I'm with him, I can never feel
              confident, beautiful or sexy with him.</p>
              <p>What is love about? I thought love was such a beautiful thing,
              until my serene, gorgeous, passionate picture of love got so
              destroyed by him.</p>

              <p>nini, I'm an example of a guy that doesn't look at porn, nor store anything related to it anywhere in my arsenal of storage devices... any pc repair specialist can confirm this... take my comp for all you want.</p>
              <p>There are guys out there who don't look at porn. I know I'll get whacked for it - let me say this - but many of them are godly Christians. make fun of us if you want, but as long as God's values and love is in his heart, there won't be space for porn.</p>
              <p>Guys do not deserve to have a decent relationship with girls if their attention is constantly looking at / storing porn or pictures of other girls on their comps, it the beginning of a very sad twisted relationship. </p>
              <p>I say dump him.. you deserve better. Dressing skimpy just to please him is lame. I tell my wife off if she reveals too much skin.</p>

              <p>I wana be sexy in my own way, I can never dress the way i want to when i'm with him. I don't wana dress like modern girls, who show so much. I wana be sexy in a sophisticated way, I hate dressing in short shorts just to please him!</p>

              <p>Why is it so impossible to find good guys here in singapore?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">In this era, yes it is still possible.</span></p>
              <p>Here are my terms for finding love, guys, please tell me, am i expecting too much?</p>
              <p>I want a guy who will only look at me, has eyes for me, and once we're in love, he has to think that i'm beautiful and sexy no matter how my figure changes.

              <p>Guys, please tell me is it too much to ask for?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">You are setting 'rules' for the relationship that you desire. Do not restrict your other half as you will restrict not only him but yourself too, love is not about rules and regulations. Do not expect a guy to change, if he really love you. Only he himself is able to change.</span></p>
              <p>I'm so unhappy with my current guy, all he ever does is think, look for, and look at girls.</p>
              <p>I have to dress so skimpy so that he won't look at girls, but it doesn't work. Why is everything a desperate bid by me just so that he will pay more attention to me and not look for, look at and think of girls? Do all guys do that?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">You need not dress skimpy in order to attract his attention. Do not let his behaviour bother you that much, as this is a fact that you cannot change. If a guy will be attracted to you because of your skimpy outfit, that guy must really be a xdd. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> It's common for guys to look at other girls. Relax, don't take it to seriously and stress yourself out.</span></p>
              <p>I wana be sexy in my own way, I can never dress the way i want to when i'm with him. I don't wana dress like modern girls, who show so much. I wana be sexy in a sophisticated way, I hate dressing in short shorts just to please him!</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Find a person who loves you for who you are and not what you are? Simple?</span></p>
              <p>By the way, do all guys save pictures of girls on the computer? Cos if it is, then I'm not sure I wana find a guy anymore.Maybe stay single or be a lesbian.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nowadays people seldom talk about love, to them it is more like a business transaction. In this era most people seek loveless sex, illusionary love, etc.</span></p>
              <p>What is love about? I thought love was such a beautiful thing, until my serene, gorgeous, passionate picture of love got so destroyed by him.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lastly, love is about self-love, to love, to change and to accept.</span></p>
