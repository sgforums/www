              <p>according to the rules, hijacking 1 thread = 500 EXP points</p>
              <p>if after hijack and can sustain the hijack for more than 2 posts, then 100 more EXP for each post.</p>
              <p>if can make more than 2 hijacked posts, then it becomes a combo (meaning, 3 posts = 3-hit combo). for combos, it's 150 EXP for each hit.</p>
              <p>after the 10th hit combo, we can do the Finisher and that nets us 5000 EXP, which increases rate of levelling up.</p>
              <p>i know it's not easy to understand, and i took 20 mins to understand myself when i first played.</p>

              <p>aiyah, let her be lah.....what's wrong with people advertising blogshop? somemore she's doing it in her signature, which is non-intrusive.</p>
              <p>the people at SGClub.com pretty much advertise their blogshop banners and URLs in their signatures.</p>
              <p>i highly respect and commend people who run blogshops cos' it's not easy and takes some bits of guts.</p>
