              <p>Why is it so impossible to find good guys here in singapore?</p>
              <p>Here are my terms for finding love, guys, please tell me, am i
                  expecting too much?</p>
              <p>I want a guy who will only look at me, has eyes for me, and once
                  we're in love, he has to think that i'm beautiful and sexy no
                  matter how my figure changes. I don't care if you have to look at
                  girls on the internet, but when you save them on your computer,
                  it's too much for me. He has to be faithful, loving, and be willing
                  to spend ALOT of time with me.I don't care about porn, cos i know
                  all guys watch porn, I don't care if u save porn on your computer,
                  but i just cant accept pictures of girls on your computer.</p>
              <p>Guys, please tell me is it too much to ask for?</p>
              <p>I'm so unhappy with my current guy, all he ever does is think,
                  look for, and look at girls.</p>
              <p>I have to dress so skimpy so that he won't look at girls, but it
                  doesn't work. Why is everything a desperate bid by me just so that
                  he will pay more attention to me and not look for, look at and
                  think of girls? Do all guys do that?</p>
              <p>I wana be sexy in my own way, I can never dress the way i want
                  to when i'm with him. I don't wana dress like modern girls, who
                  show so much. I wana be sexy in a sophisticated way, I hate
                  dressing in short shorts just to please him!</p>
              <p>By the way, do all guys save pictures of girls on the computer?
                  Cos if it is, then I'm not sure I wana find a guy anymore.Maybe
                  stay single or be a lesbian.</p>
              <p>Please tell me, what do Singapore guys look for in a girl? Are
                  my expectations too much? Why does my current guy treat me like
                  that? I feel so ugly and fat when I'm with him, I can never feel
                  confident, beautiful or sexy with him.</p>
              <p>What is love about? I thought love was such a beautiful thing,
                  until my serene, gorgeous, passionate picture of love got so
                  destroyed by him.</p>

              <p>B4 i met my ex, like many guys, i actually had my own preferences like not too short or look like this or that...</p>
              <p>But when i got together with my ex, he first thing that sealed my lock was actually her courage...then i began to appreciate her for the way she looked even if she didn't have my basic requirements before, to me she was the most prettiest girl ever..lol..been a few months and i still have that mentality that i want to wait for her...damn racial and religious barriers</p>

              <p>because mine is not easily available anywhere. it's not the usual type of booty you're thinking of. For a lot of them, i had to join underground, non-mainstream forums just to land my hands on them and was lucky enough to get special membership since i knew some of their top guys heading the forum. And since i've a non-verbal binding contract not to betray their trust, i can only sell the normal ones. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>even if i wanna sell, it would be like 1 file for US$20, no kidding.</p>

                  your dinning table, period.</p>
              <p>3. Hell, plants know when is dinner time? They are living
                  things, no? Phail !</p>
              <p>4. No one is interested in wat u can do seriously.</p>
              <p>5. Too bad no one wanna play with someone who is that retarded.
                  My point is i am very sure the joy of playing with our pets is much
                  more enjoyable than playing your retarded police and thief.</p>
              <p>6. LOL, why use hands when there is a better way?</p>
              <p>7. Why dun u use the living thing example that u stated above?
                  ROFL</p>
              <p>8. Dun be sad that u got no sense of belonging here cos u are
                  not welcome in either sub-forums nor shoutbox. GTFO.</p>
              <p>9. LOL U gotta read up more on fishes dude. I got 2 Arowana at
                  home and they recongize all my family members and have diff
                  reaction when u r near the tank. Like i said, if u dunno anything
                  bout fishes stfu and move on.</p>
              <p>10. Elite tard u mean?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>1) thanks for worshipping and making me a legend. i knew it.</p>
              <p>2) none of my business since i hate to eat fish even. they stink. come on, fish meat is not meant for human consumption.</p>
              <p>3) plants know when it is dinner time, only that they ain't able to walk around and source for food. the only time u see them hungry is when they wither.</p>
              <p>4) neither am i in yours.</p>
              <p>5) at least i don't do bestiality. thanks. and any local here, i am sure they played police and thief when they're young.</p>
              <p>6) because with hands, u can feel the dang thing being killed, since your skin can feel. Tools are only 2nd resort.</p>
              <p>7) plants know what food is nice and what is not, only that they can't say it out cos' of inability to speak.</p>
              <p>8) i'll GTFO after u die maybe? the thing is, why would i wanna even "belong" to some group? i've a style and character of my own; being in a close-knitted group will influence me and make me lose some of my original style. Me don't wanna be like 50 of you folks here, liking the same bands, liking same music, speaking in same tune, Yes-ing to everything, sharing same opinions of every imaginable topic, wearing the same brand of clothes. No thanks!!!!</p>
              <p>just so you know, i truly admire the concept of Individualism. Check it out on wikipedia.</p>
              <p>9) can u pls stop deluding yourself?! it's just a placebo effect you're having!!! it's like, i keep 2 fish at home (example). then i go to the tank and look at them etc. And just because they happen to jump up or swim around doesn't mean they know me. It's co-incidence, dude. Your stupidty = really pisses me off now</p>
              <p>10) not elite retard or elite tard, but a real elite in a class of his own.</p>

                          u talking about dogs, cats, then yes. But rabbits, reptiles, fishes
                          etc don't even know who feeds them daily and that's what PISSES ME
                          OFF cos' i spend tons of $$$ to pamper them and they bite me hand.
                          Blithering Idiots!!!! Saying fish can recognize humans is akin to
                          saying plants can surf the web.</p>

              <p>9) before i went to NS i was the one feeding my fishes. whenever i go near the tank they will come to me. during NS my family feed them. when i go near the tank they dont even bother about me. so does this show u that they can recognise ppl?</p>
