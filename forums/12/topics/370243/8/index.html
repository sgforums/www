              <p>sorry, i only saw alligators and that picture of the alligator and i assume he's talking about alligators. i read posts too fast sometimes and make mistakes.</p>
              <p>what prehistoric fish i study? i don't really study lah, just read up on them once in a while. My interest is more on dinosaurs and prehistoric mammals (megafauna) cos' they more fascinating than fishes. Although i'm no expert on prehistoric fishes, i can tell u at one shot the coelacanth (spelling?) is one of those prehistoric fishes that survived till today. it was caught off the waters of Africa (can't remember exact sea) and a lady identified it. During that time, scientists thought this fish was extinct until they saw the one that was caught. Read about all these in my 1993 prehistoric book.</p>

              <p>6) i don't care either cos' it's freshwater fishes anyway. if you tell she's rearing interesting pets like a lioness or a chicken-sized dinosaur, then yes, i'll suck up to her and lick her boots.</p>
              <p>and yes, i'll kill your fishes if i ever see them and i'll make sure i do a clean job of it.</p>
              <p>i cannot accept live hamsters being fed to these farking fishes. Don't tell me there's no other alternative food and that you always need to buy hamsters and small rodents from pet shops daily just to throw into the pond to feed the fishes. I see you on the same level as those idiots who use masking tape to stick a bird to the ground and let the cat come to eat it.</p>

              <p>see my post to elindra above. those stuff i learnt was years ago when i had plenty of interest in prehistoric life (since young, i always want to be paleotologist but really regret SG has no subjects like that <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif">)</p>
              <p>obviously, by now, i can't even remember the names of those prehistoric fishes, but most of them had bony armour and plates on their bodies and the prehistoric sharks even dare to attack and feed on those long-necked reptiles (Elasmosaurs, which look like the fabled Loch Ness monsters etc.), which is quite scary.</p>
              <p>one of those big bony fish was Dinycthis (wrong spelling but the sound sounds like this) that was 9 m long, roughly size of an SBS bus. these large bony fishes have insane jaw-force, second only to the T-Rex.</p>

              golden rule and treat us as you would like to be treated: Be
              honest, fair, kind, and considerate.</p>
              <p><strong>Romance.</strong> It's another night on the couch with
              take-out and TiVo? Just because we're staying in doesn't
              mean the evening can't be romantic. Light a few candles and see
              where the night leads. Treat us like your girlfriend, even after we
              become your wife. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yourtango.com/.../barack-and-michelle-inspire-4-date-night-ideas"> Date nights</a>, making out in the <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yourtango.com/20099080/how-to-have-sex-in-a-car">car</a>,

              started <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yourtango.com/dating">dating</a>—all of the things that
              made us fall in love with you don't have to stop just because
              now there are bills to pay, a house to be cleaned, and kids that
              need to get bathed. Bring home flowers for no reason. We're not
              talking $100 bouquets of roses here.  Even the $10 bouquets
              from the supermarket are enough to make us smile.</p>
              <p><strong>Time.</strong> We understand relationships can't be
              all wine and roses; simply making the time to be with us and
              treating us like your top priority says "love" more than
              all the fancy gifts and lovely letters ever could. This includes
              helping around the house. The realities of a 21st-century
              relationship are that both partners probably work. If you happen to
              get home before we do, why not take vacuum the living room or throw
              in a load of laundry?  If you take the garbage out without
              being asked, chances are you'll be getting a big ole smooch
              when you come back. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yourtango.com/200920888/5-man-chores-will-get-him-do-housework"> Read: 5 "Man Chores" That Will Get Him To Do

              know how to boil water. But greeting us at the door after a long
              day with fish sticks (or whatever you can wrastle up) makes us
              swoon, because it shows that you've been thinking about us and
              our hectic day. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yourtango.com/20072155/a-recipe-for-divvying-up-the-cooking-and-savoring-the-meal-together.html"> Read: Cooking For Two</a><br> <strong><br> Communication.</strong> Women are vocal creatures. We know you love
              us, but it's nice to hear you say it, too. We can also be
              insecure. We wish we weren't, but the reality is that we often
              notice our wobbly thighs and forget about our gorgeous eyes. So let
              us know when you think we're hot. Tell us we're beautiful.
              It helps us feel good. Plus, when we feel sexy we're more
              likely to act sexy. Words of appreciation aren't half-bad
              either. Tell us you love the lasagna we made. Thank us for driving
              the kids to school. Notice that we cleaned the bathtub. It
              doesn't have to be over the top, just let us know that you see
              the effort we put in, and you're grateful. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yourtango.com/20073115/which-love-language-do-you-speak.html"> Read: Which Love Language Do You Speak?</a></p>
              <p><strong>Sex.</strong> Yes, we love <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yourtango.com/sex">sex</a>. But, remember that there
              are four bases to cover in the bedroom, not just one. Try stopping
              at each base instead of being so focused on the home run—believe
              us, we'll thank you for it! Likewise, remember small physical
              touches like <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yourtango.com/200632/massage-your-main-squeeze.html">massages</a>.
              One can never, ever, have too many shoulder rubs. And scratching
              our heads is pretty great, too.</p>
              <p><strong>Consistency.</strong> This doesn't mean be boring
              and predictable. It means that we know you will (usually, no one is
              perfect!) give us the love and support we need. Knowing that
              you're coming at this with the same desires and energy as we
              are goes a long way to making us feel secure.</p>
              <p><strong>Engagement.</strong> Of the mental kind, not the
              "I'm getting married in the morning" kind. You
              don't have to like everything we like (we might be a little
              concerned if you do), but showing interest in our passions, be it
              career-related, a sport or a hobby, goes a long way. Listen when we
              talk to you. We're not speaking just so we can hear our own
              voice; we want to connect with you and this is one valuable way we
              do this. This also means paying attention to the little things.
              Whether it's the name of your best friend's husband or the
              fact that you hate Nicolas Cage movies, it's the little things
              you remember about us that's so endearing.<br> <strong><br> Humor and Humility.</strong> These two tend to go hand in hand.
              This doesn't mean that you have to crack jokes or entertain us,
              but just being able to laugh at yourself is enough. Guys who take
              themselves too seriously bring everyone down. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.yourtango.com/20086091/self-deprecating-humor-works.html"> Read: Self-Deprecating Humor Works</a><br> <strong><br> Challenge.</strong> Not the kind that makes a relationship constant
              work, but the good kind that surprises and motivates us to do, be
              or achieve what we desire. Studies show that partners who prod each
              other to meet goals—in other words, don't support lazy or bad
              habits—are ultimately happier than those who don't hold each
              other accountable.</p>
