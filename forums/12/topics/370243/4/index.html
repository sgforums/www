              <p>because generally, if gals make the 1st move, they'll feel desperate and that's not a good feeling for them. And since i'm total stranger online to TS, obviously she won't PM me so easily.</p>
              <p>for me, i only trust off-line love.</p>
              <p>anyway, if i really want to "court" TS, i would have PM her liao, or use other method, instead of using "hard-sell methods" in my post.</p>
              <p>that post is meant to be a joke, in case u still don't get it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>Why is it so impossible to find good guys here in singapore?</p>
              <p>Here are my terms for finding love, guys, please tell me, am i
              expecting too much?</p>
              <p>I want a guy who will only look at me, has eyes for me, and once
              we're in love, he has to think that i'm beautiful and sexy no
              matter how my figure changes. I don't care if you have to look at
              girls on the internet, but when you save them on your computer,
              it's too much for me. He has to be faithful, loving, and be willing
              to spend ALOT of time with me.I don't care about porn, cos i know
              all guys watch porn, I don't care if u save porn on your computer,
              but i just cant accept pictures of girls on your computer.</p>
              <p>Guys, please tell me is it too much to ask for?</p>
              <p>I'm so unhappy with my current guy, all he ever does is think,
              look for, and look at girls.</p>
              <p>I have to dress so skimpy so that he won't look at girls, but it
              doesn't work. Why is everything a desperate bid by me just so that
              he will pay more attention to me and not look for, look at and
              think of girls? Do all guys do that?</p>
              <p>I wana be sexy in my own way, I can never dress the way i want
              to when i'm with him. I don't wana dress like modern girls, who
              show so much. I wana be sexy in a sophisticated way, I hate
              dressing in short shorts just to please him!</p>
              <p>By the way, do all guys save pictures of girls on the computer?
              Cos if it is, then I'm not sure I wana find a guy anymore.Maybe
              stay single or be a lesbian.</p>
              <p>Please tell me, what do Singapore guys look for in a girl? Are
              my expectations too much? Why does my current guy treat me like
              that? I feel so ugly and fat when I'm with him, I can never feel
              confident, beautiful or sexy with him.</p>
              <p>What is love about? I thought love was such a beautiful thing,
              until my serene, gorgeous, passionate picture of love got so
              destroyed by him.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>1) Seems like you lack a little self-confidence in yourself :(</p>
              <p>2) Unless he's saving pictures of girls he goes out with (other than you), I don't there's anything wrong with that...</p>
              <p>At least it's better than saving pictures of hunks and drooling at those right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>Anyway,Â I have seen photoshop videos where they photoshop a picture of a fat lady to that of a top model look using some tool which I forgot the name at the moment... Amazing...</p>
              <p>Also, one can even smoothen the skin, etc, with photoshop...Â </p>
              <p>In the end, pictures are just mere fantasies of humans.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>3) You don't need to dress for him; dress for yourself. Be yourself. Don't conform to him too much, and neither should he conform to you to much as well.</p>
              <p>Â </p>

              <p><strong>Why is it so impossible to find good guys here in
              singapore?</strong><br> <br> That's because SG gals, majority of them are blind. They see guys
              in finance jobs, they snatch. They see balding 40-year old uncles
              working as managers, they drool and lick. In the end, these idiots
              regret that they never set their sights on really warm guys like
              me. Sure, me is poor, but at least I don't rape and I can think of
              150 ideas for a date to make it special.</p>
              <p><br> <br> <strong>I want a guy who will only look at me, has eyes for me, and
              once we're in love, he has to think that i'm beautiful and sexy no
              matter how my figure changes.<br></strong><br> Some guys like me don't like to lie. If i think u fat, then i'll
              pay money to send you to slimming centre. Guys are visual creatures
              and rely heavily on sight.<br> If u become fat and ugly, there's no way our eyes can accept.<br> we put in effort to make our penis hard and strong, and the least
              gals can do is to make themselves look presentable at least.</p>
              <p><br> <br> <strong>I don't care if u save porn on your computer, but i just
              cant accept pictures of girls on your
              computer.<br></strong><br> <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Guys like me have 46 GB of porn in my external hard disk</strong></span>, although
              yeah, i don't save pictures of girls on my PC. Porn is more than
              enough......why still need pics of other girls?!</p>
              <p><br> <strong>I don't wana dress like modern girls, who show so much. I
              wana be sexy in a sophisticated way, I hate dressing in short
              shorts just to please him!<br></strong><br> Which is why i say u and me would be a better fit than your current
              guy.<br> i personally feel girls who dress in short shorts = not much taste
              and i don't think much of them.<br> <br> SG girls + short shorts = typical SG xmm, who is cute to look at
              and fark, but nothing much in personality and style</p>
              <p>i prefer ladies who are elegant and know how to dress, not those
              who just wear t-shirt + shorts + slippers and go out everywhere</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p><br> <strong>By the way, do all guys save pictures of girls on the
              computer? Cos if it is, then I'm not sure I wana find a guy
              anymore.Maybe stay single or be a lesbian.<br></strong><br> why be lesbian?! that's a waste. u need a warm and tender heart
              like me.<br> stick with me, and we can watch porn together, but i promise you, i
              have no pics of others girls, now and in the future.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p><br> <strong>Please tell me, what do Singapore guys look for in a girl?
              Are my expectations too much? Why does my current guy treat me like
              that? I feel so ugly and fat when I'm with him, I can never feel
              confident, beautiful or sexy with him.<br></strong><br> Because he's a jerk and girls like you love jerks.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p><br> <strong>What is love about? I thought love was such a beautiful
              thing, until my serene, gorgeous, passionate picture of love got so
              destroyed by him.<br></strong><br> A sincere gal like you should be with a tender passionate guy like
              me.<br> Together, we can change our lives. Yes we can, yes we
              can!!!!!!!!!!!<br> Remember that your future is in your hands. PM me now.</p>
