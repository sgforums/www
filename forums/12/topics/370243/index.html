              <p>I want a guy who will only look at me, has eyes for me, and once
              we're in love, he has to think that i'm beautiful and sexy no

              it's too much for me. He has to be faithful, loving, and be willing
              to spend ALOT of time with me.I don't care about porn, cos i know

              look for, and look at girls.</p>
              <p>I have to dress so skimpy so that he won't look at girls, but it

              <p>Of course not all guys save pictures of beautiful girls on their desktops/labtops and look at porn.</p>
              <p>But the chances of you bumping into such a guy is lower than the chance of striking lottery ( Consolation Prize ).</p>
              <p>Your bf is one of those guys whom we known as "flower-hearted" ( Though to a lesser degree ), no matter what you do will not change him from looking at other girls and thinking of them.</p>
              <p>The question now is, do you still want to continue this relationship or not?</p>

              <p>Why is it so impossible to find good guys here in singapore?</p>
              <p>Here are my terms for finding love, guys, please tell me, am i expecting too much?</p>
              <p>I want a guy who will only look at me, has eyes for me, and once we're in love, he has to think that i'm beautiful and sexy no matter how my figure changes. I don't care if you have to look at girls on the internet, but when you save them on your computer, it's too much for me. He has to be faithful, loving, and be willing to spend ALOT of time with me.I don't care about porn, cos i know all guys watch porn, I don't care if u save porn on your computer, but i just cant accept pictures of girls on your computer.</p>
              <p>Guys, please tell me is it too much to ask for?</p>
              <p>I'm so unhappy with my current guy, all he ever does is think, look for, and look at girls.</p>
              <p>I have to dress so skimpy so that he won't look at girls, but it doesn't work. Why is everything a desperate bid by me just so that he will pay more attention to me and not look for, look at and think of girls? Do all guys do that?</p>
              <p>I wana be sexy in my own way, I can never dress the way i want to when i'm with him. I don't wana dress like modern girls, who show so much. I wana be sexy in a sophisticated way, I hate dressing in short shorts just to please him!</p>
              <p>By the way, do all guys save pictures of girls on the computer? Cos if it is, then I'm not sure I wana find a guy anymore.Maybe stay single or be a lesbian.</p>
              <p>Please tell me, what do Singapore guys look for in a girl? Are my expectations too much? Why does my current guy treat me like that? I feel so ugly and fat when I'm with him, I can never feel confident, beautiful or sexy with him.</p>
              <p>What is love about? I thought love was such a beautiful thing, until my serene, gorgeous, passionate picture of love got so destroyed by him.</p>

              they only have eyes for their own girl. Maybe that's why girls here

              <p>If you can't accept the flaws of your partner, your life with him will be miserable. You can either change yourself, or ask him to change.If you are to do neither, the relationship will fall apart sooner or later.</p>
              <p>On a side note, you can't stereotype SG guys because of your bf. Not all SG guys are like this.</p>
