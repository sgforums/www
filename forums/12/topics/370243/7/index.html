              <p>Why is it so impossible to find good guys here in singapore?</p>
              <p>Here are my terms for finding love, guys, please tell me, am i
              expecting too much?</p>
              <p>I want a guy who will only look at me, has eyes for me, and once
              we're in love, he has to think that i'm beautiful and sexy no
              matter how my figure changes. I don't care if you have to look at
              girls on the internet, but when you save them on your computer,
              it's too much for me. He has to be faithful, loving, and be willing
              to spend ALOT of time with me.I don't care about porn, cos i know
              all guys watch porn, I don't care if u save porn on your computer,
              but i just cant accept pictures of girls on your computer.</p>
              <p>Guys, please tell me is it too much to ask for?</p>
              <p>I'm so unhappy with my current guy, all he ever does is think,
              look for, and look at girls.</p>
              <p>I have to dress so skimpy so that he won't look at girls, but it
              doesn't work. Why is everything a desperate bid by me just so that
              he will pay more attention to me and not look for, look at and
              think of girls? Do all guys do that?</p>
              <p>I wana be sexy in my own way, I can never dress the way i want
              to when i'm with him. I don't wana dress like modern girls, who
              show so much. I wana be sexy in a sophisticated way, I hate
              dressing in short shorts just to please him!</p>
              <p>By the way, do all guys save pictures of girls on the computer?
              Cos if it is, then I'm not sure I wana find a guy anymore.Maybe
              stay single or be a lesbian.</p>
              <p>Please tell me, what do Singapore guys look for in a girl? Are
              my expectations too much? Why does my current guy treat me like
              that? I feel so ugly and fat when I'm with him, I can never feel
              confident, beautiful or sexy with him.</p>
              <p>What is love about? I thought love was such a beautiful thing,
              until my serene, gorgeous, passionate picture of love got so
              destroyed by him.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Don't really know what you meant by good guys? Good as in what sense?</p>
              <p>Actually if you are really seeking after good guys in Singapore, you should look for ugly guys. I know this sounds crazy and insane, but someone I trust once told me this "Ugly Guys makes Beautiful Love."</p>
              <p>I think as a Singaporean girl, it is necessary for you to accept the fact that it is normal for all Singaporean guys watch porns and will save pictures of other girls in their computers or mobile phones or even their personal cameras.</p>
              <p>Of course there are many Singaporean guys out there who doesn't behave in the above mentioned manner. It's not because they are high and mighty and overflowing with grace that is preventing them from doing so, it's because they have their own inner fears of being looked down upon by their female peers and of course they all shared the common lack of self-confidence in themselves.</p>
              <p>Always dress yourself up in the most satisfactory way to your own desire. Your guy has to EARN it if he really want you to dress up according to his desires, and make sure you make him worked for it.</p>
              <p>I can't even imagine dressing up according to a guy's desire because they have such awful and degrading dress sense for girls. What kind of love do you think your guy has for you if he always expect you to dress up like his personal whore?</p>
              <p>It's so appalling easy for any Singaporean girls to achieve undying love from Singaporean guys. All you need to do is to remember this important keyword: SUPPORT.</p>
              <p>Support him even when you know he's obviously in the wrong and being unreasonable and throwing his worst tantrums as compared with a child.</p>
              <p>When it's time for decision-making, make sure you do your best to convince your guy that he is the one who's making the decision even though the ingenius idea may came originally from you.</p>
              <p>Maybe now you can understand why so many married men seek personal companionship in other outside girls and not with their own wives. These girls know the ways to all men's heart.</p>
              <p>I know the love you are seeking is completely different from the love that Men desire to give you, and it's easier to buy that love than to change those Men that you're unfortunately stuck with.</p>
              <p>Go for an uglier guy and even though he may not be able to fulfill the love that you are seeking, at least you will be pleasantly pleased and surprised to embrace the kind of love that ugly men can provide for you.</p>
              <p>Because I'm quite sure Snow White was a Beauty, but Prince Charming was Ugly and Charming.</p>

              <p>6) pls don't digress. when i talk about killing fishes, i was talking about elindra's fishes since i was replying to her, obviously. don't take things out of context, k? use your brains.....no, i mean, use your common sense. Who in this right mind other than u will try killing crocs? btw, crocs ain't fish. They're reptiles. i'm worried for scientific knowledge.</p>
              <p>and btw, u obviously don't get the sarcasm, do u? as a nature-loving man, u think i'll dumb pets of any kind into the canals, especially when i personally hate animal abusers?!</p>
              <p>and btw, don't u freaking dare to feed dwarf hamsters to fishes. i'll rip your fishes apart to get out the hamsters' corpses i have to.</p>

              <p>u dont have to worry about them. they r just very strong fishes.
              they wont attack u. but they may bite u in self defence. the most u

              <p>LOL I'm not the only ray keeper in Singapore. No one has died from keeping stingrays as pets yet.</p>
              <p>And Schmike was telling you about the Alligator GARfish. It's a fish and not a reptile <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>You obviously lack knowledge in freshwater fish because a lot of them do dig to bury to ambush prey or even dig the sand for food.</p>
              <p>Oh pray tell what kind of prehistoric fishes do you study <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> btw a number of fishes Schmike gave as examples are considered living fossils. Since you're such an expert on prehistoric fishes, maybe you can tell us which ones <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>2) yeah, i know that, but it mainly applies to saltwater fishes
                  in the seas and oceans. Freshwater fish, as far as i know, hardly
                  do this. And i'm preaching this to you from the top of my
                  brain.</p>
              <p>6) pls don't digress. when i talk about killing fishes, i was
                  talking about elindra's fishes since i was replying to her,
                  obviously. don't take things out of context, k? use your
                  brains.....no, i mean, use your common sense. Who in this right
                  mind other than u will try killing crocs? btw, crocs ain't fish.
                  They're reptiles. i'm worried for scientific knowledge.</p>
              <p>and btw, u obviously don't get the sarcasm, do u? as a
                  nature-loving man, u think i'll dumb pets of any kind into the
                  canals, especially when i personally hate animal abusers?!</p>
              <p>and btw, don't u freaking dare to feed dwarf hamsters to fishes.
                  i'll rip your fishes apart to get out the hamsters' corpses i have

              <p>2) u need me to list out some examples of fishes that do bury themselves to ambush for preys in freshwater? seems like the top of ur brain is just the bottom of mine.</p>
              <p>just to teach u to b smarter. here r some of them: freswater stingrays, pacman catfish, fire eel, etc...</p>
              <p><br>6) seems like u dont even know what elindra is keeping.</p>
              <p>elindra: if u need some of my monsters just let me know. im very willing to let them go into ur tank for that 1 moment. seems like i need to pump up my golden dorado big n fat now.</p>
              <p>since when did i talk abot crocs?</p>
              <p>btw small mammals r part of some of my fishes' natural diet.so u going to rip my fishes with ur bare hands?</p>
              <p>u r repeating what i said? this is a miracle.</p>

              yes, break up with him, punch him in the ribs and tell him that
               Love built on beauty, as soon as beauty, dies. 
              
              Then leave him to his sad miserable porn watching life.

              <p>Don't really know what you meant by good guys? Good as in what
              sense?</p>
              <p>Actually if you are really seeking after good guys in Singapore,
              you should look for ugly guys. I know this sounds crazy and insane,
              but someone I trust once told me this "Ugly Guys makes Beautiful
              Love."</p>
              <p>I think as a Singaporean girl, it is necessary for you to accept
              the fact that it is normal for all Singaporean guys watch porns and
              will save pictures of other girls in their computers or mobile
              phones or even their personal cameras.</p>
              <p>Of course there are many Singaporean guys out there who doesn't
              behave in the above mentioned manner. It's not because they are
              high and mighty and overflowing with grace that is preventing them
              from doing so, it's because they have their own inner fears of
              being looked down upon by their female peers and of course they all
              shared the common lack of self-confidence in themselves.</p>
              <p>Always dress yourself up in the most satisfactory way to your
              own desire. Your guy has to EARN it if he really want you to dress
              up according to his desires, and make sure you make him worked for
              it.</p>
              <p>I can't even imagine dressing up according to a guy's desire
              because they have such awful and degrading dress sense for girls.
              What kind of love do you think your guy has for you if he always
              expect you to dress up like his personal whore?</p>
              <p>It's so appalling easy for any Singaporean girls to achieve
              undying love from Singaporean guys. All you need to do is to
              remember this important keyword: SUPPORT.</p>
              <p>Support him even when you know he's obviously in the wrong and
              being unreasonable and throwing his worst tantrums as compared with
              a child.</p>
              <p>When it's time for decision-making, make sure you do your best
              to convince your guy that he is the one who's making the decision
              even though the ingenius idea may came originally from you.</p>
              <p>Maybe now you can understand why so many married men seek
              personal companionship in other outside girls and not with their
              own wives. These girls know the ways to all men's heart.</p>
              <p>I know the love you are seeking is completely different from the
              love that Men desire to give you, and it's easier to buy that love
              than to change those Men that you're unfortunately stuck with.</p>
              <p>Go for an uglier guy and even though he may not be able to
              fulfill the love that you are seeking, at least you will be
              pleasantly pleased and surprised to embrace the kind of love that
              ugly men can provide for you.</p>
              <p>Because I'm quite sure Snow White was a Beauty, but Prince
              Charming was Ugly and Charming.</p>
