              <p>Like i've said, i dont really care about porn, but saving pictures of girls is just too much for me, it makes me feel like I'm so ugly that he has to look for girls on the internet.</p>
              <p>I don't want to change him. I want to love him for him, but if i cant accept this flaw, is it still possible to continue?</p>
              <p>Are all Singaporean guys like that? Cos i've met a few foreigners, and none of them are like that, they do watch porn, but they only have eyes for their own girl. Maybe that's why girls here don't bother looking for singapore guys...They're all the same, always lusting after girls..</p>

              <p>Think you have a serious problem !!!</p>
              <p>I don't see saving pictures of girls  into PC = anything. Face the fact - a lot of ladies buy magzines to look at stars, or fashion - does that mean anything ?<br>People also have micheal jackson picture in the PC - don't think they are thinking of sleeping with him !!!</p>
              <p>Grow up - stop drawing non-sense conclusion in your brain. Maybe what you assume males are - is a reflection of your own thought to the other sex - so stop lusting after guys !!!  See a doctor !!!</p>

              <p>I wish i got no money and then find my true love that love me for who i am and not what i am. Seriously if you are poor like a church mouse, u love her enough to want to motivate urself to not have her live in such hardship.</p>
              <p>Must not underestimate the power of lurve !</p>
              <p>Anyways i yet to experience that kind of love, and also to the point of trying desperately to survive on love and fresh air alone. lol.</p>
              <p>But seriously ... if u really NO MONEY.. i seriously doubt u got it in you to woo and date girls. Unless you are one of those scum sucking maggots that cheat , scum , use and abuse the girl and her feelings.</p>

              <p>One has a brain, hands and legs. WIth that, there is NO reason why one has no money.</p>
              <p>It's what we do with our capabilities that allows us to survive, not money. Some are lucky, get a dream job or struck it rich at the lottery. Some with brains earn more money. Most work and have some money.</p>
              <p>But what we do with our money may either help us to survive or make us worry where the next meal will come from. The very basic lesson of managing money is to live within one's means.</p>
              <p>It is often when we spend more than we earn that will land us in trouble. Is that prada bag necessary? Is that sports coupe - a box on 4 wheels, worth it?</p>
              <p>Some claim there is no job avaliable and are currently unemployed. I ask - no job or purely waiting for that job that pays more so that you can spend more?</p>
              <p>It's not a crime to spend. It makes you happy, gives you pride and comfort, but when one's spending becomes a liability and the source of your worries, then, it is your bad spending habit that is everything and with liabilities, you become nothing, and not due to money or the lack of it.</p>

              <p>a) i can only love a woman for 15 mins for every 8 to 9 hours interval, because i need the extra time to work, sleep and play computer games</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>b) please dont save prawns in your computer because you will need to pay $500 per film (even if it last only 30 seconds it is counted as one film). for second offender it is jail, no need to negotiate</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>c) if your figure change and you become too fat, i am sure your dearest boyfriend/husband will look at slim slim girls and when having sex with you he will think of those slim slim girls, too bad, the truth hurts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>d) be fair to us guys, sex only last a few minutes or even one hour but computer games can entertain us many many hours, like 16 hours at one go.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>e) last resort for you: go and watch Absolute Boyfriend at Mysoju dot com. the japanese will sell you a robot to be your bf.</p>

              <p><strong>Why is it so impossible to find good guys here in singapore?</strong><br><br>That's because SG gals, majority of them are blind. They see guys in finance jobs, they snatch.

Sure, me is poor, but at least I don't rape and I can think of 150 ideas for a date to make it special.</p>

              <p>i prefer ladies who are elegant and know how to dress, not those who just wear t-shirt + shorts + slippers and go out everywhere</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><br><strong>By the way, do all guys save pictures of girls on the computer?
