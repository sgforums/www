So was nw it's hols again and i have come to realise i really have very few close friends who i can call out, meet for a meal to tcss(or well...really heart to heart talk)...<br><br>btw, close friends as in like a CORE grp of friends(inner circle)...if any of you watch Meet The Parents(quite similar to friends in the Circle/Ring of Trust). So this problem really started when i left sec sch. During sec sch, i had a super close clique of 4 friends, we were with each other nearly everyday, even though only sec1 same class(after tt split class all over the place, some drop to normal, some went up and saw more remedial lessons). but even though timing all different, we still make it a pt to tcss b4 morning assembly, during recess we go each other's class find each other then head dwn to each, and after sch(NEARLY everyday, we played bball, or went cycling, or swimming, or treking(bbhill or mandai res)...or just go hse play guitar/piano/sing song,ps2(3 not out at tt time). Can easily say the BEST time of my Life. Can cycle out for supper and talk till morning man....can really tell this guys anything...and u know they'll be there for u. i mean we would go all out for each other. when get thrown out, we let them in the hse till parents cool down, if someone broke up, we accompany them till 4am to listen(kk, i was the one tt was dumped hahaz).<br><br>Then after tt all different jc/poly. we still meet up abit, but then 2 alrdy attached, their wkend(chope alrdy)...but still meet for mthly bball. then later another one got attached, then left me. my JC class quite tight, but most their closest frens still their sec cliques. then i had 1 classmate who studied with me in sch till late in the evenings...but then he also got attached in J2. then army, command sch, unit....all 3 segments got close friends...but didn't really find a grp that was like my sec sch. Then uni even worse, almost everyday in lib studying, all the ppl i know all go home study, or back to hostel....so i study alone.<br><br>I knw for sum, their parents is their best friends and i do envy them. i've tried to say the least, but my parents are quite quiet and they are always give highly diplomatic answers like politicians liddat. but i do thank them for their listening ear, but sometimes i just want some.......advice/wisdom/guidance. I recently joined a church(but only meet 1-2 a wk, even then i feel like their bz, cant really connect, wavelength different), cuz the guys ard my age all left the old church(for one reason or another), so din really have ppl to talk to(younger ones can't really understand, only can laugh and play with them but still immature thinking).<br><br>Soooo...wow wad a long post. =x but yeah just wanted to find out frm anyone, who are your close core clique...and...where and how do u meet them!? hahaz.

              <p>1   be 100% trustworthy. Trust is aan important factor in having good friends.</p>
              <p>2  have a good sense of humour [ not spiteful ] there has to be a reason why people will want to spend th eir time with you and if you can make people laugh in a fun way [ without hurting others feeling ] this is a bonus</p>
              <p>3 Do interesting things and read interesting books on interesting topics. Interesting people don't want to hang with boring people who don't know about the topics that interest them</p>

              <p><br>pt 3 will not be a problem if you are talking about very closed friends for many many donkeys years.</p>
              <p><br>They have their own committment and family. That is why the friendship beginning to drift apart.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do have 4 friends I know since primary school. After ns...less and less contact. After married, no contact..till now...already more than 20 yrs. Is that call close friends? Not really liao.</p>

              <p>Everyone has to move on at some time of their life.</p>
              <p>You can try joining CCA in uni if you can handle the workload, as most of the players will train and meet frequently.</p>
              <p>It is also about time that you look for another half as well. Once you come out of uni and enter the workforce, depending on where you work at, it may be difficult to find another half.</p>

              <p>sooo i'm pretty new to this forum(although i pink IC since birth =x)..but well let's try it out.<br><br>well, i'm 21, just completed my NS jan'10, then my sch started in Aug(yup 8mths break!)...then now i just finish my exams(mind shagged out)...kinda got 1 mth hols(can't really decide how to really use my time productively yet). So was nw it's hols again and i have come to realise i really have very few close friends who i can call out, meet for a meal to tcss(or well...really heart to heart talk)...<br><br>btw, close friends as in like a CORE grp of friends(inner circle)...if any of you watch Meet The Parents(quite similar to friends in the Circle/Ring of Trust). So this problem really started when i left sec sch. During sec sch, i had a super close clique of 4 friends, we were with each other nearly everyday, even though only sec1 same class(after tt split class all over the place, some drop to normal, some went up and saw more remedial lessons). but even though timing all different, we still make it a pt to tcss b4 morning assembly, during recess we go each other's class find each other then head dwn to each, and after sch(NEARLY everyday, we played bball, or went cycling, or swimming, or treking(bbhill or mandai res)...or just go hse play guitar/piano/sing song,ps2(3 not out at tt time). Can easily say the BEST time of my Life. Can cycle out for supper and talk till morning man....can really tell this guys anything...and u know they'll be there for u. i mean we would go all out for each other. when get thrown out, we let them in the hse till parents cool down, if someone broke up, we accompany them till 4am to listen(kk, i was the one tt was dumped hahaz).<br><br>Then after tt all different jc/poly. we still meet up abit, but then 2 alrdy attached, their wkend(chope alrdy)...but still meet for mthly bball. then later another one got attached, then left me. my JC class quite tight, but most their closest frens still their sec cliques. then i had 1 classmate who studied with me in sch till late in the evenings...but then he also got attached in J2. then army, command sch, unit....all 3 segments got close friends...but didn't really find a grp that was like my sec sch. Then uni even worse, almost everyday in lib studying, all the ppl i know all go home study, or back to hostel....so i study alone.<br><br>I knw for sum, their parents is their best friends and i do envy them. i've tried to say the least, but my parents are quite quiet and they are always give highly diplomatic answers like politicians liddat. but i do thank them for their listening ear, but sometimes i just want some.......advice/wisdom/guidance. I recently joined a church(but only meet 1-2 a wk, even then i feel like their bz, cant really connect, wavelength different), cuz the guys ard my age all left the old church(for one reason or another), so din really have ppl to talk to(younger ones can't really understand, only can laugh and play with them but still immature thinking).<br><br>Soooo...wow wad a long post. =x but yeah just wanted to find out frm anyone, who are your close core clique...and...where and how do u meet them!? hahaz. (mb it's my ppl skills, although i'm quite cheerful, crazy at times, a tat sarcastic...but i dun tink obnoxious)</p>

              <p>Just have an open mind, friendly, sociable and nice attitude and you will make friends along the way.</p>
              <p>Also, you should consider finding a girlfriend. In a few years, time will change and your friends will have different commitments to relationships and marriage. So you should start to look for a life partner.</p>

              <p>I can identify with you, for me, university isn't the platform for close friendship and my closest friends are still the 3 guys I know best from Poly and the other closest one is another 3 guys from secondary school.</p>
              <p>For me, I think the quickest way is to start with those small group or individuals with similar interests and then built from that foundation. Hard to break into a sizeable group unless you're someone charismatic or something.</p>

              <p><br>  You are welcome. You will see the difference it makes. You see all the the triad garbage always so concerned about connections. Connections is the closest thing these pathetic people can have to real friendship as they can't really trust each other.  Sure gangsters do things with their friends but it is really the lowest denominator things that they do. Here is one more pointer below and I hope that I have made a difference.</p>
              <p>4 praise people for the things that they are good at or have done well.</p>
