Its in the past and doesn't really matter anymore. You don't want to stir things up do you? Since all you want is her as a good friend back..<br><br>What you could do is what Devil suggested, tell her you haven't seen her for a while, and maybe want to catch up with tea or movie. And that you miss her friendship..(maybe not so directly though.. yr choice.)<br><br>See how she reacts..~</div>
