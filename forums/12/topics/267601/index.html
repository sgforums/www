            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a student preparing for exams, and encountered a couple of obstacles in school life recently.<br><br>Well last year, i played in a rock band made up by my classmates. But due to internal conflicts and other factors, a bandmate and I broke away for the band. They were hostile and prejudiced towards us, till this year where we all gradually still made up as good friends, having quite a strong bond.<br><br>But just a week ago, a notice on 'Prom Night Audtions' came out. We were invited by the strongest band in our school (who has lack of members) to take part in the event. Not knowing that our ex-bandmates still regarded us as part of them, we agreed. So recently, one of them came to asked us for suggestions on songs to play for the auditions, and we broke the news to them.<br><br>ALL were very angry. One was angry by giving cold shoulders, another by flaming us openly and propaganda-ing people to dislike us, last by pretending that he accepts it but stabs us hard in the back. We tried to explain ourselves but were ignored. We really didn't know we were still part of it.<br><br>Another thing, there's this publicly-acknowledged 'babe' in school, who has an long list of males trying to woo her, be it outside strangers or school people. Just take my class for example, out of the 15 or so males, 5 has admitted being interested in her.<br><br>So, we were sort of attempted to be matchmaked by some nosey close friends of hers, and soon a rumour-like scandal on us spread around. And apparently, people started having negative attitudes towards me, some resorting to underhand and desperate means. Mainly through propaganda among their own cliques and backstabbing.<br><br>In short, within a short 2 weeks, i have turned into Public Enemy No. 1 (well in my class.) And speculating people told me be careful of this and that. I don't even know who to trust. And just as different people are allying and ganging on me.<br><br>So, perhaps i would like to hear advise from you all on how to handle and solve the problems i'm encountering, especially on Class Politics. As in my four years in school, it's the first time and is forced to enter.<br><br>Worse, in my 4 years of secondary school life, all these are happening to me for the first time within this 2 weeks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Thank you for reading, though i need to say sorry if i wasted some of your time reading this slightly long and maybe irrelevant comments. I just wanted a way of releasing the tension in my mind.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was an outcast in my class during the last two years of Secondary school. There was a lot of rumours and gossips about me, and it spread to other classes too. In the end, I gradually keep to myself. I considered changing school, and I spoke to my form teacher about it. She told me to stay on and say that by transfering school, I am just giving them mroe things to say about me.<br><br>Somehow, I pulled through that two years, by focusing on my studies, and having a small, but close grp of pple as friends. They encouraged me to keep my head up, not be bothered about the gossips/rumours. It helped that I was kept busy by my CCA activity of which I was active in. It helped to take my mind off a lot of things, and I told myself not to let my parents down again, as I had done during the PSLE by doing very badly and entering a school that is well-known for gansterism more than anything else.<br><br>First of all, u have 2 identify who are really ur friends. i would say that guy who left that band with u would be a good friend of urs, since he and u are almost in the same situation.  Concentrate on ur studies and tell urself that other people's perceptions of u don't really matter. After all, when u leave school, guess what? 80 per cent of them u won't even contact or see them on the streets anymore. So why worry?</div>
