Last time, people work for a marriage regardless of how sh|t because it is an irreversable process, but now - people are getting married for different reasons. Married because of unborned child, for money, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Since people married for different reasons other than true love towards one another and the wanting to live and go through live with that special someone - you don't really catergorized under love isn't it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Therefore Love does last - don't get influence from whatever the environment is happening. If you know what is right and feel the same, work towards it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess these things are happening more often nowadays, but that doesnt mean love dun last, it only meant that people's views towards love and marriage are  no longer matured.<br><br>Being the busy pple, we are, while we are pak-toring,  all we wanted is to see each other, tok a bit, share each other problems, then thats it. after pak-toring for many years, it seems  natural to get married but yet, thru the process both neber really tok abt what each wan from married life, what they expect from a HUSBAND/WIFE and not a BF/GF.  so they think they are ready cos they are so happy together  as bf/gf but when get married, some will start to realise that this guy or girl is not fufilling his/her expectations as a spouse and so they start to get disillusioned...<br>and all these could have been MINIMISED if our idea about marriage is not so shallow. There has to be more practical communication about marriage...some will think such communication may destroy the romance of a marriage, but as i always say, do some practical thinking and communication before you enjoy the romance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually ah... partly is like.. ppl nowadays more open.. so more daring.. last time married then they accept good or bad.. they just make do... (im not saying no good or very good)<br>nowadays.. ppl tend to be more open minded divorce getting more acceptable.. but then again ppl tend to take things for granted.. as in a bit not happy only divorce... ppl tend to forget the fact that.. romance do die down as time pass its very hard for any couple to experience the same level of passion for each other over time as when they first started out.. that's why some couples see it as a sign to break i cannot say this is correct or wrong cause it really depends..  but i think people should understand more before.. getting married or committing themselves just like my friend he only know he's gf(fiancee now) for few months then engaged!!! oh my to me its too fast but on the other hand only time will tell.... 2 cents...</div>
