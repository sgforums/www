              <p>at the end of the day, friends come and go but family comes first. Family stays with us for life. I guarantee you that if his best friend r/s continues, it is bound to come between the both of you in future.</p>
              <p>It's selfish of him....why don't you tell him if you have a best friend of the opp gender and treats him likewise, how would he feel? If he can't accept it, try your best to convince him it's best to drift away from his best friend. If he can't, then you better choose another guy. Cos it's a union that's meant to break eventually.</p>

              <p>This is always better den "and everyweek have to check HER schedule and see how he's gonna fix ME for dinner".  It's simple to say... but well always look at the bright side of life *whistle away* ~~~ I know its hard, im acting otherwise, but im trying too =) but i guess you should talk to him nicely about it, I've given up my supper kah ki whom i met almost every single day for supper, my wednesday friday and sat clubbing kah ki (they all girls also), for my current gf, cause because she's worth it ^^</p>

              <p>This kind of situation is not abnormal. U have to strike a delicate balance. When I have gf, my good girl friends still contact. Its all about trust really. If ur partner starts to distrust u too much, u must show her that u are trusthworthy.</p>
              <p>Simple things like, the things you do for ur partner must not be less then what u do for ur good friend.</p>
              <p>Most of my good friend who is of opposite sex , we at some point were in a r/s before. And seperated in good terms. And the very few close one that I never had any rs with, they are not just normal friends. We are attracted to each other not sexually, but more like mutual respect of each other. The understandings we can achieve and not to mention certain intelectual capacity to satisfy such a close r/s.</p>
              <p>Most of the time my gfs before wont really accept it, but slowly they will understand.  But if they truly give me an arbitrary "me or her" kinda situation...  which was like once, we just went our seperate ways.  And after that, we still became good friends.</p>
              <p>But sometimes you could feel that both are trying to resist each other. Thats why its important to hold on to ur principals and professionalism. Its not hard.. and not easy at the same time.</p>
              <p>Anyways, one of the ways to ease it in, is to go dinner or any social activity together and ur good friend if got partner, bring the partner along lo. Given that sometimes conversations may end up about how the good friend de partner will say how she tells him quite a bit about you... or that he heard about you..etc. May get awkward, but like I said, its  a delicate situation, and u must navigate the minefield carefully so nobody misunderstands. If no partner, then she can bring her other friend or what and become friends lo</p>
              <p>One important thing to note tho, you cant be an asshole or a bastard to the girl and expect the entire situation to succeed. As a guy, you must pave the ground and treat her as well or better. Or itsgoing to be really hard to reconcile the differences</p>

              <p>I think he's trying to strike a balance btw his bestie and his GF. my BF is a friend kinda person, he treasure friends very very much. friends and GF is as improtant to him. I have to accept that i guess. but i believe once he get older and when all his friends get settled down, his perspective might change alittle.</p>

              <p><br>Last time one of my guy friends, his gf best friend is a guy. Yeah, they always hang out and spend more time than the bf with the also. One day though, I went to class early and caught her with her best friend smooching.</p>
              <p>many years after, the gf dumped the bf and is now married to her best friend with one kid.</p>
              <p>So there is high probability that ur bf may like his bf. After all, how many bf is so discipline to hang out once a week? Come on, even my best friend will ffk on me and put their gfs first before their own bfs.</p>

              <p>nonsense la....no such thing as a best friend platonic r/s. Mirroring what hugh hefner said, wait you see your bf fucking his best friend then you know. Human beings are deep and u never know what they really think. Once they succumb to temptation, that leaves many broken hearts.</p>
              <p>Used to have an army friend who fucked his good friend after a drunken stupor. And they were actually sane enough to ensure penetration. They felt so pai seh after that...but they were sane at the time of act u know. Temptation hits u where and when u least expect it.</p>

              <p>For the sake of clarity lets have BF,bf = boyfriend, (and not best friend).</p>
              <p>A guy can have a best (good) friend of the opposite sex, but there should be a limit to the fraternisation. There should consideration first for the immediate beau, the good friend should be secondary, not the other way round.</p>
              <p>In this modern age, the spouse would have many contacts, some of the opposite sex. Some are good friends and have families of their own. It would not do for a harmonious family relationship (not to speak about the pride of the affected spouse), if the two good friends were to behave openly in an affectionate manner. The good friend can be there for consultation, and be included in all family functions, but there should be a limit to the fraternity. This is just common sense.</p>
              <p>Else one is being selfish, without due consideration for the feelings of the other.</p>

              <p>Fugazzi I guess u speak fr the men point of view.... Not many woman can accept their love one with another bestie SHE.  It take more then just understanding, a big heart maybe to accept it</p>
              <p>Like wise, when woman with a bestie HE, man have problem with that too. this prob is will be there for a long long decade =)</p>
              <p>I will accept my BF besties SHE but like what FireIce  post earier</p>
              <p>(no matter how magnanimous u are or how much u say u trust him, it is still like a splinter in your finger)</p>
              <p>Thanks for everyone's comments and i manage to see it in a very different point of view good and bad =) some how already know how to deal with it</p>

              <p>I think you should really hang out with your bf She friend and see how she is like. But I think he have already crossed the line by asking your available timing, then book his friend out. And every week seems a little frequent. </p>
              <p>For me, I would book my friends 2 weeks later from anytime of the day, and inform my gf first. Then maybe meet twice a month. Gf and friends very different, must draw line and treat differently, if not what for be in a r/s. </p>

              <p>Well, is hard to try to be someone's best frien and hang out, it very much depend if i can click with her or do we have a common interest to be such a close friend hanging out. she a heavy smoker and i really dont like hanging out with smoker .... i guess it does some how make sense, but trying too hard to be someone friend somehow not sincere</p>

              <p>BB,</p>
              <p>In life especially in Singapore, we internalized alot of wrong messages about how we should treat our relationship.  </p>
              <p>I will do this extremely short -- Don't sell yourself Short. Remember this Thread is about <strong>YOU</strong>. Not him or her</p>
              <p>Just because you have intimate (physical) relationship doesn't mean that you cannot move on with another person who would put you first in "Focus"  You have the same capacity to growth from this relationship and love another person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>BB: I guess we can't chance the fact that they are child hood friend. and having emotional affair with her is inevitable, every time when we quarrel or cold war, he will turn to her. and i know this is inevitable too.</strong></p>
              <p>It is right that you cannot changed the relationship between your boyfriend and his childhood. But obversely your boy friends has not learned to grow out of his childhood friend.....</p>
              <p>Do you see what i am saying? when you quarrel He runs to her....and not turn around and solve problems between the 2 of you??? Where is the relationship?  You have a one sided affair with him.  </p>
              <p>If you truly want this relationship to work out i suggest you either bridge the gap between you and his best friend or talk to a mediator.</p>
              <p>I can tell you one thing physical and sex can only stretch so much......thereafter its about emotional support.</p>
