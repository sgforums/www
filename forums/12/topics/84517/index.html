Hmm...just read that it is very bad luck...sometimes involving death of love ones....well, it could means a pet as well lah. Not really must be death....of humans. For me...I just happened to jump off a block of flat for curiousity in my dream, but i woke up before i reached the ground. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Think i funked one of my exams later on.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>So just take it as bad luck then...don't want to scare people around here lah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
