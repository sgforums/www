            <div class='col-md body'>okie guys, i think the topic must have mislead you. but i wan to say one mre time....my story not ra....i am not stupid enough to put an ra story in aunt agony. So i decided to post out the whole of my story out... you all want to say what you all say lah....<br><br>Dave quietly opened the house door, hoping not to make his return known. He had been out the whole night, partying at the downtownÂ’s pub till late. Unlike his usual clubbing nights, that night is one that he never had expected.<br><br>He was sitting on a red couch, enjoying his gin tonic when a lady approached him for a chat. Her name is Eva, aged 24, an Australian. Her company had sent her to Singapore to meet with some Singaporean customers.<br><br>Â‘So, how do you find Singapore?Â’ Dave asked, taking another sip from his drink.<br><br>Â‘Oh, Singapore is great! The food, the people, the surroundings are fantastic! Oh, and the retail shops as well.Â’ Eva added, while revealing a wicked grin.<br><br>Â‘Wow, I am really happy to hear that from you, but how do you find the Singaporean guys?Â’  Dave mumbled, the effects of the drinks growing in him.<br><br>Â‘Well, actually, you are the first guy I have really chat with, I have been really busy with my work the last 3 days and today is the first day I get to hit the pubs!Â’ Eva replied happilyÂ…<br><br>The pair continued to chat, but the effects of the drinks grow in them as time progressed. Both felt the chemistry between them growing and half an hour later, they were making out at the nearby hotelÂ…<br><br>Taking off his shoes slowly and carefully, Dave think back on what he has done 4 hours ago. He suddenly felt guilt and fear coming to him like a big gust of wind. He knew it is the drinks that caused him to do the things he never should have done, but it was all too late. Â‘How am I going to face Vinny?Â’ he muttered softly.<br><br>Â‘Finally, you come back to me.Â’ Dave jumped at the voice, slowly turning his head to Vinny.<br><br>Â‘Well, I went out for a drink, got drunk and fell asleep on the streets. When I woke up, I quickly rush back home,Â’ Dave replied, faking a smile. Â‘Next time I will never gotten myself that drunk again, I promise!Â’<br><br>VinnyÂ’s face is unreadable. She is leaning against a wall, looking at Dave.<br><br>Â‘Piew, I need a bath!Â’ Dave said, feeling the increasingly uneasiness in the house. Â‘Well, time to wash my stinking body before the flies get into this house!Â’ Dave chirped, and walked silently towards the bathroomÂ…<br><br>Â‘So, do you have fun playing with that Australian girl named, well, let me guess, Eva?Â’ Dave stopped immediately and turned surprisingly to Vinny.<br><br>Â‘wwwhhÂ…what! Did you spy on me just now? How could you do that!Â’ Dave exploded, feeling nothing but anger in his mind.<br><br>Â‘Oh no my darling,Â’ Vinny smiled, Â‘I did not even leave this house nor had I followed you to the hotel.Â’<br><br>Â‘Dave, there is a secret that I have kept to myself since the day I met you. But now that the time has come, I shall tell it to you, my love.Â’ Vinny spoke in a mysterious tone, her face filled with a mixed of anger and sadness.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">This is not the Vinny I knew anymore. Who is she? How come she knew what I did? </span>Dave wondered, puzzled by the sudden change of situation.<br><br>All of the sudden, a blue light surrounds the room. Dave felt fear has come back for him, he knew something is terribly wrong.<br><br>Â‘My name is Vinny La Quez. Ever since I was borne, I have special powers. I can predict the future, see the past. I can cure a sick person, but I can also kill one. Conclusion? I am a witch.Â’ Vinny spoke, her voice filled the whole room.<br><br>Â‘ I have many lovers before you; all of them did not give me the love that I want. They broke my heart by telling lies to me!Â’ Vinny exploded, with anger in her eyes.<br><br>Â‘ And then you came along. You give me the love I have always wanted, and you have been truthful to me for the past 5 years. Why? Why do you lied to me!Â’ Uncontrollable rage filled the room.<br><br>Dave was speechless. He is now overwhelmed with fear, unprepared of what will happen later.<br><br>Â‘Do you want to know what have happened to all my past lovers?Â’ Vinny replied sweetly.<br><br>Â‘Vinny, no. Vinny, I am so sorry. This is the one and only lie I have made to you. I know I am in the wrong now, I am sorry Vinny, my love, my sweet heart.Â’ Dave yelled fearfully, walking slowly towards Vinny.<br><br>Vinny laughed loudly, shaking her head. She looked at Dave sadly and answered Â‘Too late Dave, Too late.Â’ Â‘ What you have done cannot be undone. Goodbye my love.Â’<br><br>Â‘Deletrius aperentious!Â’ She yelled, sending a wave of light towards Dave.<br><br>Â‘NooooooooÂ’Â….<br><br>Dave opened his eyes slowly, relieved that nothing has happened to him. He looked around quickly for Vinny, and saw a piece of paper on the spot where Vinny stood.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">My dearest Dave,<br>To kill you is the hardest thing I will ever do. I thought that it would be the same, killing you like the past lovers I have. But no, when I cast the spell, all the memories I have with you have flowed into my mind. I knew I couldnÂ’t kill you, so I cast a spell on you. After the clock strikes twelve, you will never remember this girl called Vinny. All memories of her will be erased.<br><br>You will be the last love I will ever have. Goodbye my darling.<br><br>Vinny La Quez</span><br><br>Dave looked up the clock, it is 11.30 am. The paper on Dave hands crumbled into a lump of dust. Dave felt a pain in his heart. He knew Vinny is the one he loved and always loved. Erasing all memories of her is not what he wanted. He sat down on the ground, wishing he were killed than alive. If he had not been to the pub, this would not have happenedÂ…<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yup i also believe that everyone deserves a 2nd chance. people can only learn from mistakes. but this thing of sleeping around with another person i m sure is intolerable. imagine if ur wife committed this mistake. will u still forgive her? going to pubs to drink etc has their disadvantages like this. if u r happy in life and happy with ur loved one.. y go to pub to find that extra so called happiness?<br><br>as for me, i made a mistake with my loved one also. i broke the promise that i made to her and she has since yet to forgive me. it is not as if i did something very big wrong like sleeping around but tt i went out at nite to meet her very own fren who was crying. i heard her out when she had no one to cry to and now my own gal is so angry and refuses to forgive me. i feel so helpless. things were goin out VERY fine between us all the while until this happened. i regret going down to console that gal classmate of ours. now it has strained my relationship with my own lovable gf. i feel so guilty.<br><br>btw... dun think that my gal is unreasonable or wat. just tt this classmate who happened to be her best fren busted her before. they then fell out. but my gal did eventually reconcile with that classmate but things were not as close between them as before. so any way i can seek redressal for this mistake??? i have asked her but she says nothign can be done. it is not as if i committed a crime. please..anyone can tell me what to do?</div>
