            <div class='col-md body'>That day you drank too much alcoholic drink, that's why you can't think properly.<br><br><strong>Alcohol and Psychology</strong><br>To understand what had happened, you must first understand the basic effects on alcohol.<br><br>Basically there are afew states which you can reach based on different level of alcohol in blood concentration. Euphoria, Lethargy, Confusion, Stupor, Coma, Death.<br><br>Based on what you've said, I infer that your alcohol level in blood is quite high. Based on what you've said, you seems to be fall on the state of confusion.<br><br>The state of confusion incoporate these 3 general characteristic.<br><br>1. Profound confusion Â— <span style="color: blue;">uncertain where they are or what they are doing</span>. Dizziness and staggering occur.<br><br>2. Heightened emotional state Â— aggressive, withdrawn, or <span style="color: red;">overly affectionate.</span> Vision, speech, and awareness are impaired.<br><br>3. Poor coordination and pain response. Nausea and vomiting often occur.<br><br>The high concentration of alcohol is your blood cause you to have hightened emotional state, like overly affectionate. Of course you know what you are doing at that point of time.<br><br>See, just the effect of alcohol is enough to cause a lot of trouble.<br><br>Next is psychology.<br><br>Psychology also plays a major role in this unfortunate event. Your emotional state at that day was Anger, Happy, Disappoint and Sad. It all stated at the shop when your Mother-In-Law opposed your decision. It's made worst when your future husband shouted at you infront of so many people. By then, you are experiencing an overflow of emotional signals.<br><br>You are very very unhappy at that time, and naturally you need to confide to someone. You poured out all your feelings to your manager, and that when you feel alittle better.<br><br>Because you wanted to forget all the unhappy things, you subconsciously wanted to drown your sorrow with alcohol. And the more you drink the more you feel better, but that's temporarily. Soon you lose your ability to think.<br><br>These are the two major factor that contributes to what happened that day.<br><br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_alcohol_on_the_body#Effects_by_dose<br><br><strong>Analysing the manager</strong><br>And this so called 'nice and helpful' is actually a wolf in sheep's clothing. He told advantage of you when you are drunk and couldn't think properly at that time. He know that when you are drunk, your psychological defence at that point is the weakest. That's why he got himself a golden chance to ahem you.<br><br>This kind of person is definitely a hypocrite. He said that he will take responsibility of what had happened, I believe this is untrue and bull5hit. Imagine if he can be so unfaithful to his current family, I guess his integrity are highly questionable.<br><br>If he is a genuinely good person, he will definitely reject the sex and other actions as well. He is capitalizing the from the fact that your are unable to think critically and incoherent.<br><br><strong>A fact IS a fact</strong><br>Since this has already happened, I think we should not dwell in the past. Now the most important thing is to devise a solution to this problem. I have to leave this for you.<br><br>Death is not the best solution always. Some may say that Death is a solution to solve all problems, but I have to disagree with this. Imagine what happened when you committed suicide. Your families and friends will be very sad! Other things might also happen, too many things you know.<br><br>Although I doesn't know what's your religion, but I believe almost all religioin have a chapter regarding about death and sucide.<br><br><strong>Lesson learnt</strong><br>After this incident, I am sure you've learnt many precious lesson in life. Remember, you must learnt from your lesson and never never make the same mistake again next time.<br><br><strong>Present</strong><br>What's most important now is afew urgent issues. To check whether you are pregnant or not, go to see a gynecologist. Don't rely on those test kit, because they are not 100% accurate.<br><br>Then you should go to hospital to check for Sexually Transmitted Dieseas and HIVs. You'll never know what disease that old man got in him.</div>
