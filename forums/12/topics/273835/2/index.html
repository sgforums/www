            <div class='col-md body'>Can see some of the insensitve and childish comment here. Doesnt mean ur occupation = personal character! And at this point of time still can ask her to find new bf!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Well my friend told me before, when if u want to bed a gal, best time is to get her drunk when she is feeling down. Cos by that time gals cant differentiate what is right and wrong.  In ur case I think its a mistake that can be prevent but what done is done, no point thinking why u did it in the first place. Some gals do make this mistakes and u r not the first......<br><br>I suggest...<br><br>1) u dun tell him the suituation unless u wana ruin ur relationship. End ur personal contact with ur manager and carry on ur life.<br><br>2)If u cant take the gulit, its best to heart to heart with ur bf and prepare for the worse. At least u can live ur life with nothing to hide.<br><br>Hope this helps....</div>
