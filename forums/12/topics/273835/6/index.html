            <div class='col-md body'>luckily my eyes are trained enough to read through walls of text tightly compacted together in size 8 fonts..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> luckily it wasn't THAT long..<br><br>O.k i admit maybe the in-law is a bit annoying but that kind of thing happens, and it was unfortunate that it wasnt solved before the marriage.<br><br>but i got 1 thing to say about ur manager. I think he aint so 'nice and protective' after all.In my opinion. A real gentlemen will stay through this with a solid mind and since its gonna be YOUR wedding soon even with ur state of mind , all drunked up. Sounds tempting  i know , but still... there are some situations i wont bang a girl.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> well.. i mean in THIS situation.<br><br>Ur situations pretty dramatic.. like those kimchi drama's plus with some hongkie scenario.<br><br>But i think , what is done is done liaw.  If u really love your BF maybe u should talk to him. And if he dumps your @ss because of this ,  know that he has contributionary negligence in his part. And maybe u can be more calm n stop become so emo and sit down have a 1 on 1 talk. Before you reach the part about sleeping with the manager , be sure to explain and emphasise on the point of ur emotional state before gown trying and the point where u ran off in your gown and etc etc..  dun forget to add.. emotional state + lots n lots of alchohol. Most likely he will be FUKING pissed off but yeah.<br><br>And as for drugs.... there are many forms of drugs + with alchohol to make u in a state of... mmmm how should i say...  blur and wanting. I know. But hopefully it wasnt it.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi....crystal gal...<br><br>First...I want to say....dont hate yourself so much....it was not actually your fault, because you were drunk...this is very important.<br><br>Drunkenness is a very serious psychological impairment.<br><br>So......pls, about this having sex while you are drunk.....pls, from what I can see, you are more of a victim, and the manager is more of a perpetrator, could possibly be a criminal (rape).<br><br>If Im not wrong, in court, even for many cases, being drunk, or being under the influence of drugs, can reduce someone's culpability. Also, having sex while someone is drunk, might be considered rape.<br><br>This is how serious drunkenness is.<br><br>From all angles that I can see......you were in a vulnerable position, mentally, pshychologically, and also plus the influence of alcohol, an intoxicant. So you were actually a victim, someone who had been taken advantage of.<br><br>Pls dont feel guilty as if it is your fault. You shouldn't feel guilty when u get robbed, it is the criminal's fault, not you. Although, u can say u should take precautions not to leave ur handbag on the chair and let the opportunity arise for example, but that is all.<br><br>It is the same in this case, you should take precautions not to get drunk in such an intense emotional state and let the opportunity arise for someone to prey on you, but that doesn't diminish the fault of the perpetrator, the manager, it is his fault, not you!<br><br>Pls give yourself some time to calm down, and start realizing this.<br><br>It is very normal, when women are raped, or taken advantage of when they are drunk or in unclear situations, that they start to blame themselves. I think you are going through the same process.<br><br>For now just give yourself some time to calm down, and stop blaming yourself, it was not your fault.<br><br>You are a victim, remember!<br><br>Just resign from the job, and then think whether u want to report him to police or not, it is your choice.<br><br>About the Boyfriend.....later on, you have to try to meetup and explain to him, I believe he doesnt get the full picture about this situation. He must have missed the point about reluctant/ drunkenness being-taken-advantage part. The perspective should totally change, from you being a cheating girlfriend, to you having a misfortune and being a victim. I believe this perspective is totally lost, and not registered at all in his mind, or your mind previously.<br><br>And my advice for you personally.....just be strong....and keep a positive attitude....you met with a very unpleasant and unfortunate incident....sometimes things like this can happen in life....but dont lose heart ok....and dont worry, u will emerge as a much stronger person.....and....never tolerate any suicidal thoughts.....<br><br>I wish you all the best,<br><br>Although we can only talk on internet forum, but I truly hope, and wish, that you will recover soon and emerge stronger. My best wishes,<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess the percentage of unrelated stuff is too high in this thread.<br><span style="color: red;"><br>Please, keep to the topic and try to help TS instead of having your own conversation or quarrel...</span><br><br>Also, i feel that no one really think about TS's BF... If TS really love his bf, she might want to know what her BF want most and give what her BF wanted most.<br><br>Be it break, or forgiving her, i guess is most important that both parties negative feelings will be minimized...<br><br>Also, if the TS bf really love her, and she still really love her bf, being together is best isn't it?<br><br>To TS, you might also want to post and update us on what happen after currently so that we can help you more ^^<br><br>Anyway, all the best to you TS.</div>
