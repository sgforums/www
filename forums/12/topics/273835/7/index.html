Im not sure if Crystal Gal wan to bring this into laws and check if she could sue that manager.</div></blockquote>Hi Zarks, thanks....but i do not intend to sue him..i have known him for two years, and only i know his character well enough..though I may not like him, but he has always been like a fatherly figure to me..many times, he confided to me his family probs and there were many times when i did confide in him when i had problems with my ex-bf's mum and cant confide with my ex-bf..<br><br>He has never done anyting ungentlemanly to me before..and on that fateful night itself..we were both high in emotions and heavily intoxicated...<br><br>As I mentioned in my past postings....i don't dare to say that I am 100% unaware of what was going on.........i was drunk..yes....but if i say i totally don't know what is happening...then i am lying...i keep thinking over the past month....on that night...i did think he was my boyfriend then...but maybe it was also because of his sense of security and reassurances/maturity (which i had really hoped to receive from my ex-bf)...that caused me to make such a mistake..i did make the first move first...and sadly to say...a willing party in the wrong sense...<br><br>I hate to say it....but i am really grateful to my manager...i don;t blame him for what happened...i know he is having a horrible time too....he is feeling very guilty for what happened as well...maybe others may think i am naive to believe him....but i know him long enough to judge him....he is a perfect gentleman...the reason why he confided his love for me is because he is confused just like me at that time....his family problems is really too complicated..<br><br>The fateful night should never have happened...and i take full responsibility for my current situation....by confessing to my ex-bf and leaving my manager once and for all...i hope to move on with life....i will live with this guilt forever, but i do hope that all will move on..<br><br></div>
