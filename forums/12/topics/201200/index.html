            <div class='col-md body'>one thing few ppl know is, the shape of your chest cavity area affects whether you are going to be fat or thin or average. breath in, and see in the mirror the shape of the upwards curve of your bottom rib cage. if it is a deep semicircular curve (mesomorphic) you will tend to put on fatty weight much more. if it is a gradual upwards curve you will be tend to be of medium muscular build.  if it slants more like the top of a triangle (endomorphic) you will tend to always be thin/slim and harder to put on weight.<br><br>do not diet by skipping meals, when you keep not eating your body's metabolism slows down (goes into starvation mode) and breaks down your food slower. and then you will probably eat more after skipping some meals.<br><br>if you want to gain muscles, do not listen to body building magazines and eat lots of meat and 6 egg whites. its better for your digestion and enzyme break down of food if you eat more vegetables and fruits and some brown rice and just enough meat. brown grains cuz those give you b complex vitamins which gives you energy.<br><br>one problem nowadays is ppl are all eating to much meat. many fast food / western food / hawker food / anything does not come with decent vegetables. our bodies are meant to be 80% alkaline and 20% acidic. meat is all acidic and vegetables and nuts grains etc are alkaline. many ppl have mild acidosis, causing tiredness.<br><br>about your weight, if you have bad metabolism / body shape, just try to slow down putting on weight by not eating fast food or oily food, like indian food, char kway teow, deep fried, etc. fast food etc are saturated fats which are very hard to for your body to get rid off. also dont use bleached refined chemically processed veg oil like everyone does. i only cook with grapeseed oil or ev olive oil.</div>
