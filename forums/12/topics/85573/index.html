Well, my story goes like this...i like this girl relly much in my class, but she doesn't seem interested in me. Now i and her are just friends. I am quite plump, and she is slim, so i think she would not be interested in me, but i relly like her. I haven't told her yet, because if she were to reject me, we wouldn't even be frens. Then, i will be so sad.......because i want this frenship to continue....she is always telling me that she likes this guy and that guy and, it relly hurts me to hear her say all that. Tell me, what shud i do? I dun noe whether to pop the Question or not, for fear of destroying our frenship. What if she rejects me?</div>

From the things she've been telling you, it's quite likely that you won't stand a high chance for now.. But in the future? Things are always an unknown...<br><br>Sometimes a friend can mean so much more than a bf. And just like you've mentioned that your appearance probably won't appeal to her, your only chance is for her to know you better and decide for herself.. You are already considered lucky enough in the sense that you can at least still be her friend? Some people (especially if they're not appealing to the other party) might not even get anywhere close to there...<br><br>So accept a FRIEND? If things should be it would be in the future...

Time flies.. ppl change... Noone knows what will happen in the future..<br><br>Loving someone doens't mean that you must have that person.. Maybe down the road.. when both of you become so close friends.. you understand her so well.. and somehow..someday.. you find that actually she's not the girl you wanted.. By then.. maybe you can actually confess to her that you did like her b4.. but that was long time ago.. whatever it is.. you are still friends.. there's nothing more than that..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Like i said earlier.. if you really wan to confess to her.. be prepare for the worst.. dun pinned too much hope on it.. However.. if you jus wanna tell her about you liking her.. and that's about it.. then go ahead.. jus say it out.. and that's it.. then after.. treat everything as per normal.. you still treat her as friend.. dun let her feel that you treat her extraordinary.. something more than jus a friend..<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">*think about whether you should or not.. if you wanna have her.. are you confident in getting her?? if not.. DUN! </span><br><br>Cheer...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Well, my story goes like this...i like this girl relly much in my class, but she doesn't seem interested in me. Now i and her are just friends. I am quite plump, and she is slim, so i think she would not be interested in me, but i relly like her. I haven't told her yet, because if she were to reject me, we wouldn't even be frens. Then, i will be so sad.......because i want this frenship to continue....she is always telling me that she likes this guy and that guy and, it relly hurts me to hear her say all that. Tell me, what shud i do? I dun noe whether to pop the Question or not, for fear of destroying our frenship. What if she rejects me?</div></blockquote>She treats you as a normal guy friend that she is not interested to consider as a potential bf.</div>
