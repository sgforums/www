              <p>I pretty much have same route of succss with everyone until graduation. My career was a F9 though for the past 3 years after graduation.

              <p>I usually dread the idea of gatherings cos really i feel i am just a blue collar temperory worker despite gotten a university degree.</p>
              <p>I always try to look at the positive sides of thing in this issue but the inferior feeling does come to me sometimes also. Other people are like maybe more than 4k, maybe some 3k still, while i am like just 1k plus worker. I know that there are million of things to be grateful about even though i have this rough patch to deal with.</p>
              <p>I really have not figured out this problem well, otherwise I would not been still down over this sometimes. I have not fully learn to leverage on my situation and my self esteem is also hurt. I should have learn from this instead of being negative and come out a much stronger self esteem than everyone else. I will do it. just do it and try to do it.</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>The key word here is COMPARISON - that is your undoing.</p>
              <p>Comparison is neurosis, it is utterly divisive and emotionally debilitating. Comparing oneself is disrespectful of oneself and consequently it is such tht one is bound to compare others. How lah, it will contaminate/permeate/percolate relationships, work etc etc. Discord is what one is sowing. What is there to harvest but misery!</p>
              <p>As for self-esteem what you deem as ''hurt self-esteem'' is other-esteem. Now the other(s) or in the eyes of other(s) u seem like a failure or simply not good enough. It is not them but your compromise to be accepted to be included and now it is not happening. Self-esteem means that which one creates out of onself from within. Till then it is not self-esteem. understand and reconcile if u can.</p>

              ?????degree holders getting such a long time getting a decent job in spore????how come??
              think trying arder is useless in spore....remember each company is controlled by a job agency who in turn probably pays hr manager of that MNC company to employ foreign werkers from overseas.foreign workers pay thousands of dollars to agents.how much are u paying them?
              
              technically from way it goes.......one may never get a job in spore and the world is having economic problems.
              
              overseas oportunity:
              1)usa:most jobs are currently out of economic service
              
              2)australia:unless u intend to become paralyzed waist down or severely injured in industries.even mining workers from the USA went to australia to work and one sued his company because a huge rock fell on his head and he suffered neck and back injuries.
              
              3)Europe:never looked good at all.
              
              4)china: pay too low good as getting another type of national service
              
              5)Canada:high unemployment rate dating back to 1980s.
              
              6)New zealand:Unknown as most exports get sent to australia
              
              7)India:too hot and havent seen any new buildings apart from those back in 1950s or 1960s.
              
              8)Africa:high technlogy and materials in some parts.
              
              9)Brazil:Same as above
              
              10)Japan:good as higher paid national service if u can get in
              
              11)south korea:same as above
              
              12)hong kong:too crowded....but less crowded than spore.housing issues still in progress as in 1990s.anoither 10 years will be best
              
              13)malaysia:pay is no good and not a good moral place to have folks werk in
              
              14)thailand:political turmoil every 10 years but would still be survivable
              
              15)indonesia:too hot of a climate

              <p> </p>
              <p>instead of comparing and getting all demoralised, you might want to start</p>
              <p>1) Defining your priorities in life</p>
              <p>2) Set your life goals</p>
              <p>3) Work towards achieving your goals</p>

              <p>I always try to look at the positive sides of thing in this

              Other people are like maybe more than 4k, maybe some 3k still,
              while i am like just 1k plus worker. I know that there are million

              <p>I really have not figured out this problem well, otherwise I
              would not been still down over this sometimes. I have not fully

              I should have learn from this instead of being negative and come
              out a much stronger self esteem than everyone else. I will do it.

              <p>Still need to plan further ahead. Actions should be taken into our own hands.</p>
              <p>The key is not whether one can survive with current pay or whether TS wants to progress further in society. The key here is that TS feels demoralised when he compares with his peers.</p>
