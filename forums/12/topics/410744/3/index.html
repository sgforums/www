              <p>the foreigner come to sg to bully us.</p>
              <p>the government let them bully us.</p>
              <p>the boss of the company like them because they save money for the company.</p>
              <p>they 1 person live in sg no live no family of course can survive with low salary. but what about us, we need money to pay bills.</p>
              <p>the government control everything and make us suffer. we went to N.S. it's 10 years of reservist. the government say it's our duty. but why is the foreigner with no education or fake education can easily get a job when we sg people cannot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remember one incident. 5 SG graduate. from australia university, NUS and NTU. they went to interview for an engineering job at TUAS rubbish incineration plant.</p>
              <p>one of them is me. we chatted. so from HR person we chatted to, an old uncle who is retiring that time. he told us there's only one vacancy. so 5 of us agreed that we sms each other if one get the job. because everyone of us is equally desperate for the job.</p>
              <p>we wear smart. tie, long sleve. a full formal wear. we waited for our turn for the interview. A foreigner poped up from no where, rushed up and saw us. he asked " Yuan ge nana... this place is yuan ge nanan... the interview place... yuan ge nana, ... for the master engineer ...yuan ge nana... position?"</p>
              <p>one of us told him yes . he wear a polo t-shirt. jean and sandal. he's carrying a bag. the old man asked him if he bring his certificate. he said yes . he took out a diploma from nan yang poly and a degree from his own country. the old man took and copied a set for him.</p>
              <p>when the interview session actually started. he went to ask the interviewee that he is in a rush and need to go first. and that interviewee actually let him do it. when he should be the last as he came late.</p>
              <p>3 weeks passed. 5 of us didn't get the job. the old uncle phoned one of us said the foreigner got the job. he's asking for 4K.</p>
              <p>1 month later. i recieved a sms saying that the foreigner have resigned and went to United Kingdom and work.</p>
              <p>when i open up the news paper to hunt for job again. we saw the same advertisement but we cannot apply .. it wrote. "those who have applied before need not to apply again"...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this is how foreigner kill singaporean. he ruined our career, make everyone of us suffer with no job, and they don't treasure the job. I am working in a company and I see foreigner come and go. they never stay. company hired F.T because of the propaganda of the government saying that singaporean is lousy.</p>
              <p>we served the army. the army teaches us discipline. we went through the difficuit education system of singapore, after PSLE. Got 3 As. went into Express stream in Maris Stella, O level got 5 As. went into JC, and went to army. suffered 2 1/2 years there as a specialist, went into NTU, 4 years. after obtaining good results. come out and the whole working industrial is saying "singaporean are lousy"?</p>
              <p>What made singaporean lousy? the government is the one who created who we are. if we are lousy, isn't that mean the government is lousy as well?</p>
              <p>Why is the foreigner better then singaporean? Their country don't have a proper education system, they never went through the disciplined life of a soldier.</p>
              <p>if our people are lazy, lousy and are losers, isn't it mean that our army system is not correct. we went through the national service with no meaning at all.</p>
              <p>if our people are worst them foreigner, then our education system is wrong also, we went through so many years of studying to come out with an answer that we are lousy.</p>
              <p>the foreigner have experience. yes that's because they started working earlier when we are still studying.</p>
              <p>philipinos left school with a degree at the age of 21 to 22. we left uni at the age of 27. because we need to serve N.S . boss like foreigner because they save money for the company by getting lesser salary. it's not that we need higher salary but we are staying in singapore and all our expenses go to singapore.</p>

              <p><br>Relax, I think the government is aware of the social unrest that policy has created and is limiting the influx of foreign PRs. Post in Speakers Corner maybe?</p>
