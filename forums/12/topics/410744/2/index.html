              <p>Some people even at 1.5K they like what they do and are content at it and may perhaps be extremely successful 10 - 15 yrs down the track. Which history has proven again and again of the successful people that earned way less.</p>
              <p>But no... people cant see that far. No hindsight. They want fast... want now. Like credit card.</p>

              <p>the foreigner come to sg to bully us.</p>
              <p>the government let them bully us.</p>
              <p>the boss of the company like them because they save money for the company.</p>
              <p>they 1 person live in sg no live no family of course can survive with low salary. but what about us, we need money to pay bills.</p>
              <p>the government control everything and make us suffer. we went to N.S. it's 10 years of reservist. the government say it's our duty. but why is the foreigner with no education or fake education can easily get a job when we sg people cannot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remember one incident. 5 SG graduate. from australia university, NUS and NTU. they went to interview for an engineering job at TUAS rubbish incineration plant.</p>
              <p>one of them is me. we chatted. so from HR person we chatted to, an old uncle who is retiring that time. he told us there's only one vacancy. so 5 of us agreed that we sms each other if one get the job. because everyone of us is equally desperate for the job.</p>
              <p>we wear smart. tie, long sleve. a full formal wear. we waited for our turn for the interview. A foreigner poped up from no where, rushed up and saw us. he asked " Yuan ge nana... this place is yuan ge nanan... the interview place... yuan ge nana, ... for the master engineer ...yuan ge nana... position?"</p>
              <p>one of us told him yes . he wear a polo t-shirt. jean and sandal. he's carrying a bag. the old man asked him if he bring his certificate. he said yes . he took out a diploma from nan yang poly and a degree from his own country. the old man took and copied a set for him.</p>
              <p>when the interview session actually started. he went to ask the interviewee that he is in a rush and need to go first. and that interviewee actually let him do it. when he should be the last as he came late.</p>
              <p>3 weeks passed. 5 of us didn't get the job. the old uncle phoned one of us said the foreigner got the job. he's asking for 4K.</p>
              <p>1 month later. i recieved a sms saying that the foreigner have resigned and went to United Kingdom and work.</p>
              <p>when i open up the news paper to hunt for job again. we saw the same advertisement but we cannot apply .. it wrote. "those who have applied before need not to apply again"...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this is how foreigner kill singaporean. he ruined our career, make everyone of us suffer with no job, and they don't treasure the job. I am working in a company and I see foreigner come and go. they never stay. company hired F.T because of the propaganda of the government saying that singaporean is lousy.</p>
              <p>we served the army. the army teaches us discipline. we went through the difficuit education system of singapore, after PSLE. Got 3 As. went into Express stream in Maris Stella, O level got 5 As. went into JC, and went to army. suffered 2 1/2 years there as a specialist, went into NTU, 4 years. after obtaining good results. come out and the whole working industrial is saying "singaporean are lousy"?</p>
              <p>What made singaporean lousy? the government is the one who created who we are. if we are lousy, isn't that mean the government is lousy as well?</p>
              <p>Why is the foreigner better then singaporean? Their country don't have a proper education system, they never went through the disciplined life of a soldier.</p>
              <p>if our people are lazy, lousy and are losers, isn't it mean that our army system is not correct. we went through the national service with no meaning at all.</p>
              <p>if our people are worst them foreigner, then our education system is wrong also, we went through so many years of studying to come out with an answer that we are lousy.</p>
              <p>the foreigner have experience. yes that's because they started working earlier when we are still studying.</p>
              <p>philipinos left school with a degree at the age of 21 to 22. we left uni at the age of 27. because we need to serve N.S . boss like foreigner because they save money for the company by getting lesser salary. it's not that we need higher salary but we are staying in singapore and all our expenses go to singapore.</p>

              <p>firecracker,</p>
              <p>this is how sporeans kill their own fellow men.they have chinamen and brought in by PAP and astrociously stupid hellhole policies.in the end everyone starves to death.</p>
              <p>i saw this coming  in spore way back in 1994 because i found they were imperfect gov....so i worked every day and at night i pieced myself back one by one.finally many mamy years later i managed to bring everyone out of spore at an enormous cost to myself.</p>
              <p>everyones corrupted...the hr manager...the dude from china...undertable ...they dun obey from job agency ...they will be reported etc etc...list goes on.u can fight.......at what cost......?u need to tarck the agency the hr manager is dealing witrh and take out top levels all the way down.gangsters dun need to sell .illegal dvd to make a livin...they can always go into hr jobs and offer $$$$ to clinch deals with hr manager.if hr manager refuses to listen......the job agency manager can always report him to police......nothing to lose as the manager of hr agency has 101 criminal records or so.</p>

              <p>what u should do?</p>
              <p>1)dont send resume to job agencies if u do u could be marked by them for 1 month or so in an attempt to either net u in or turn u desperate.they have contacts with most hr manager of all spore MNC.</p>
              <p>2)go for cheapest job full time  in yer degree level as most companies hr manager are already monopolised by agencies.the hr manager has to listen to job agencies for alot of reasons.why  cheapest salary jobs????the pay might be so low until the manager of hr agencies wont want to waste effort getting foreigners into that lowly paid company.like a shark that wont go into waters with not much food.but they would if agencies were to be desperate enough.</p>
              <p>3)stat boards and gov jobs are not usually touchd by job agencies as they would be reported upon by CPIB corruption police units and be thrown into jail immediately.</p>
