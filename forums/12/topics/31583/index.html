Any way I want.<br><br>These were my opinions and imaginative with a bit copying and mixing.<br><br>Just like a techno dj messing around with dance club<br><br>But believe this!<br><br>What I had written here is purely imaginative, u canÂ’t believe every thing that came to ur eye,<br>IÂ’m not broadcasting , neither am I publicising. And I Â‘m not earning any money from here at all!<br><br>This is not a newspaper,<br>This is not a magazine,<br>If any of my stories, fictitious were to cause any discontentment,<br>The moderator will be doing his job and ban me from entering but he didnÂ’t!<br><br>Which means, I got the right to carry on!<br><br>And pls donÂ’t ever say IÂ’m trying to get famous becos of this weeny messages and stories<br><br>There is more than it meets the eye, it all either from references books with a bit of my alteration or my imagination, famous horror writers from the past, I love them!<br><br>Not the going rounding and rounding spectacle writer<br>Much earlier than him!<br><br>And it is until; now then I told you!<br><br>Since IÂ’m not getting any money from all this, IÂ’m not getting famous bcos of all this imaginative stuff,<br><br>IÂ’m not a monk, I donÂ’t leads a monk life, IÂ’m just love writings and reading horror stories,<br><br>I donÂ’t cursed! I eat just like everyone of you, I think of money too, pls donÂ’t ever say IÂ’m a monk!<br><br>What I had written here, if any actual events in the outside world were to take place, similarly to what I had written or composed here, it is purely coincidental and not intended!<br><br>Oh just like the TV, how wonderful!<br><br>U canÂ’t be so gullible to trust everything u saw on the digital highway, including here!<br><br>And now I had came to my senses! U must too!<br><br>All in my imagination, not meant for any one, not meant for anyone, IÂ’m practicing my writings and composition since I flunked along time ago!<br><br>What I had written here is all my imagination, u canÂ’t be so naÃ¯ve, u canÂ’t be so foolish to trust everything I had wrote here!<br><br>Although, it seemed raw, the formatting of the passages and everything, it is just like what u saw on any foreign webpages!<br><br>I donÂ’t have to thank or compliment anybody, the reason is becos IÂ’m  not getting any incentives from writing hereÂ… this is my  way of practicing<br><br>I wouldnÂ’t call it a hoax bcos IÂ’m composing and synchronising words, making sure it appears at the right time, my own way of imaginative writing! CanÂ’t be real! Not real at all!<br><br>U guys whoever ur reading right now were intruding and still are, on my privacy<br><br>Can u believe my imagination of a 20 years old kid?<br><br>U just have been release from the cinema, purely steven spieberg types of productions!<br>Supernatural or science fiction, any way u wanted to call it!<br><br>This could be meant for childish amusement, if u want to take it this way and it is a way for you to cure ur fears over my words!<br><br>Â“God must be crazyÂ” with jungle ranger and the reporter on a wilderness,<br>they were making fun of god Â‘s name, wasnÂ’t it!<br><br>Could it be consider a parody?<br><br>Humorous exaggeration of authorsÂ’ style but mine is a bit of a low class!<br><br>Go ahead earn as much money as you want, it is none of my business, IÂ’m just minding my low-class, imaginative stuff here! And IÂ’m not a mental patient, it is apparently demostrated by my twists and turns in my writings, IÂ’m not Saint, IÂ’m a street walker just like any of you!<br><br>U said IÂ’m a naÃ¯ve person, ur even more of a naÃ¯ve person than me since u trust everything I wrote.<br><br>This is not publicising, not a permanent ink, this is my own way of creative writings!<br><br>DonÂ’t worth even a cent at all, so stop believing it!<br><br>StQwerty stands for Street Qwerty not  saint!<br><br>I donÂ’t imprecate, this is way I do whenever I felt hungry, my way of dieting! Very effective for those trying to lose weight!<br>gotta thanx the moderator and ah nic, jason for not getting in my way when i sweated out my words<br><br>this is not real, this is imaginative<br><br></div>
