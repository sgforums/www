            <div class='col-md body'><p>I have problem with a msian colleauge, in fact not only i am facing the problem. as usual when in office he will make all sort of weird sound from his nose else he will do disgusting  stuffs. But the main issue i had with him is he always serve customer and make the customer very angry. fyi we are a group of engineers and techinican. he is our techinican cum driver. my boss will come telling us to help follow up on this case. make customers happy. why always have to be me and my other colleauges to cover his dirty work? he screw up everything and we had to clean for him and get scolded by the customer, as customer only see us as a whole. he had tons of other bad habits. when we tell this to our boss, he will be like shieldiing him and say there is nothing he can do and give a smile. we were like wtf? this msian guy had been with us for more then 1 year. for 1 thing is he is very money face. stingy and always try to boss around with new colleauges with simple knowledge of what he is suppose to do with the job. do you guys out there working in IT firms had such colleauges? i never had any problems with other msian guys. he is the one and only ultimate person that really get on my nerves.</p></div>

              <p>true, i not against any malaysians here btw. i had ex-colleauge from malaysia. who can really perform. you are right i should put disgusting coworker.</p>
              <p>new updates on what he do during office hours.</p>
              <p>1) as usual disgusting behaviour. Irraiting Nose sound. every 15sec or more he will don it once. already spoken to him on this (tell him to see a doctor if he have problem with the nose, he simply ignore us)</p>
              <p>2) as a deliveryman, the van should be kept at tip top condition. He can lost his way in sin gapore despite tell me us he here for 10 years already. give him advice on what roads is best to take, but he simply ignore it.</p>
              <p>3) Job assign to him not completed yet want to claim those hours he stay in the customer place.</p>
              <p>4) Customers dont understand his english accent, customer request to speak in chinese as it is easy to communicate but he still want to reply in english.</p>
              <p>5) Confidential information like salary, he would ask my fellow new colleauges what amount they are getting monthly.</p>
              <p><br>6) Bossing around new colleauges  when his IT  Knowledge is nearly zero to 10%.</p>
              <p>7) When he is in wrong, he start pointing fingers at people.</p>
              <p>I dont understand why my boss is still keeping him, is it because he is cheap labour or what? of cause to sack or not is not up to me. aleast at the very mininum he should least have a meeting with him including us.</p>
              <p>Do you guys have colleauge like this in your company? be it FT or locals?</p>
