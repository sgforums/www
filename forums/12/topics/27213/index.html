If not just stay away, because it's going to hurt and it hurts alot especially to the wife. I know because I've been through it. You don't want a third party to ruin your marriage with your loved one so don't ever be a third party to someone else.<br><br>Don't be blind by his sweet talk. There are no reasons that the husband cannot leave the wife if he wants to. Don't tell me for children sake or money sake or whatever. If he stray in the first place, he has already betray the thrust of his wife and children. The children will not grow up healthy in an evironment when parents are always quarelling. So with or without him,  it makes no difference. I chose to leave with my child, because there is no way to be in this kind of messy relation. If I can leave with a child and support myself, I do not see why the third party have to cling to a married man.<br><br>And the outcome ? My husband beg me to stay. He ask for forgiveness and left that woman. So to the third party whom she claim he loves her deeply, is just a stupid fool being make use of by a irresposible man. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> </div></blockquote>......  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
