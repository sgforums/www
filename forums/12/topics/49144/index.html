Woman don't even understand themselves at times about what they want and guys don't know how to respond to woman's needs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Its a vicious cycle.<br><br>If you are looking for guys with such 'features' - logically, you wouldn't pick your present bf would you? Of course, there are something good about him other than this that you obviously saw and appreciate.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: If you want him to learn and understand about this part of your thoughts - communicate in a non-hostile way. Afterall, you also hope to see your bf grow from this relationship isn't it? Everyone will gradually improve - when both parties help each other, the growth would be huge.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi sweetie,<br>I think you know ur bf better than anyone of us here. And I'm sure you know what type of pattern he is before going into a r/s with him. Since you know he'll only wait for the sky to fall, why not tell him straight what you expect him to do and what you want rather than playing mind games. Don't expect a guy to be able to read your mind coz like what you mentioned sometimes we girls don't even know what we want.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I still believe in being honest with each other, no matter what it is. Even if it's going to be some argument which will break out later, at the end of it all, don't you think you'll understand him, and he too, better?<br><br>If you want him to call you and apologise and explain matters to you personally, tell him. Msg him that and the ball will be in his court. You decide from there what next step to do. Isn't it better that way?<br><br>Trust me, all you need to do is to take the first step and dun let this drift you guys apart. It isn't worth it. take heart my dear lady  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by yuiko:</div><div class="quote_body">keke i don't think he's that kind of guy..for what i know from him..he will just wait for the sky to fall <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote></div>
