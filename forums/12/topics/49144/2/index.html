            <div class='col-md body'>I am a guy and wanna share my personal experience similar to this.<br><br>I sort of made a small mistake (which was very very trivial) and I tried to CALL my female friend after reading an email sent by her. I thought it'd be more sincere and maybe can iron out the problems on the spot. Not only she didn't pick up her personal line, she didn't bother picking up the mobile phone nor reply my sms. Next day, I  got slapped with a very harsh email relating to the same problem. So, question is, what on earth is a sincere apology when sometimes girls just dont want to face the issue, verify it, before passing judgement of their own ?<br><br>It was because of the issue above, that my female friend, who made a mountain out of a molehill, 2 of us never contact each other no more because I cannot stand such people who dun bother to listen to the other side of the story. Its simply unfair.<br><br>Not trying to flame the girls here. Just sharing my bad experience.</div>
