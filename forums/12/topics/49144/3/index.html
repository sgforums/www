Not saying you're immature now and that you'll be mature in a few years later   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <strong>(reason for this is: age does not equates to maturity level)</strong> but there are many things which you should consider: <strong>(not some hard and fast rules you have to memorise, just some quickies)</strong><br><br>1) When a guy apologises, it's not all the time that he's at fault. Well sometimes he is, but then again he's doing so, for both of you, for the r/s that both of you are in.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>2) As above, it's not a guy's duty to apologise all the time. Whoever is at fault should just lower their 'pride' and face it. It's not that hard to say 'I'm sorry' to the one you love, should you hurt him in any way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>3) Do not take the one you love for granted, coz you may never get a second chance to love him again.<br><br>4) Love has got no fixed definition and you cannot define it as it's varies according to every individuals.<br><br>5) Love your partner for what he is, not according to what you expect him to be. Never expect the one you love to change but accept him as for what he is. Coz it's the 'originality' that matters most, not the 'pirated version' of him.<br><br>6) Learn to be more tolerant towards ur guy, gals have higher tolerance level than guys afterall. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>7) Tell him what you want straight in the face and leave the ball in his court. Do not expect him to know what you want, coz guys will never be able to read what you want, when you don't know what you want at times. Don't play mind games and be frank. Coz if you can't be frank to the one you love, who can?<br><br>Aboveall, I hope you've learnt something new thru this episode and moving on to understand each other better and also what both of you seek for in the r/s. Always rem, anger is a letter shorter than Danger. Don't say things out of impulse for you'll regret it when you looked back.<br><br>Cheerz to your r/s and best wishes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by yuiko:</div><div class="quote_body">hmmm..abit chim for me to understand can u explain to me??cuz that day when i talk to my bf he said alot abt me..got quite a number of bad points of me..so now must try to change lor cuz human being can hardly see their bad points ma..must wait for pplz to point out for them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote></div>

( if we still remember the past)<br><br>then now, we start to get annoyed by things he/she did wrong.... started to quarrel and fa bi qi... cos we feel he/she did not live up to our <span style="color: red;">expectations</span>!!!<br><br>so as we can see... EXPECTATIONS KILLS LOVE.... we want our bf/gf to be someone we expect to be perfect in our mind... BUT who is perfect?? I myself do get angry wif my gf when she did something that i feel i don't expect "my perfect partner" should do....<br><br>so... be realistic to our EXPECTATIONS... keep reminding ourselves what i have said and u will find we r more forgiving as we all know no one is perfect..... we will find love everywhere and great....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br></div>
