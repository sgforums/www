I miss-read the "hope no intended pun or mischeif for your post on tis topic". Oops. In that case....here's my reply. Firstly, why would I want to pretend I do have body odour, if I didn't have? I don't think I'm so bo liao (fine, maybe at other things, I am, but this is kind of embarrassing, don't you think? ) Maybe it's just to draw in the crowds to reply my topic? In that case, I would have chosen another type of topic, like say, "I'm so bored, it's so monotonous everyday." or "I feel depressed...I don't know why. I'm always so pensive.... " and so on, so forth.  If you read my posts, I don't see that they might be suggesting some underlaying, mean, poking fun, at people with BO. If so, sorry, to those who might have taken offence. I was just trying to make it funnier. Sorry. I do have BO, I was embarrassed to post such a topic, if anybody is offended, tell me, I'll edit all these posts. Actually, I was trying to get people to symphatise with me. Heh. It is embarrassing. People covering their noses, pinching their noses, coughing so horribly (heh. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ), taking deep breaths, going out of their way to avoid me... I didn't ask for body odour either. Arrg, forget it.<br><br>Anyway, I'll like to go for the operation...when i have the money. I can't use my parent's CPF and so on, because we ( my family and I )need that. Anyway, thanks. My situation is better now, I've used deoderant, and I don't mean to poke fun at people with BO, seeing that I'm one of them... It's just the sweaty smell on my back now.</div>
