Mmmmm, It's like....say, I bath after a few minutes, I can feel myself sweating like h, a lot. Even if I'm not exercising... Then, the smell isn't tooo bad yet. I always sweat whether I'm exercising or not. Even if I had just bathed, I still sweat a lot. Usually, there's a difference even though my family tells me there isn't. I can't really smell anything but the reaction of people.... Haiix. But when I life my arms to check, yeah, I can smell it, but I don't think that I can lift my arms every few minutes to check in front of people, and I can't go toilet so often and....besides, the smell would kill them. When I lift my arms though, the smell....is really...you know, nan ren wei? Yeah. I'm not really sure, I guess I can't really smell myself and I find it rather embarrassing to ask them where it stinks... I'm not really sure, but it's a 1m radius thing.</div>

Haiix.</div></blockquote>Sigh, Ive been through what you could be feeling. Its a struggle of the mind right? School classes and travelling on public transport for me sucks the most. I don't really care about people's responses anymore (mostly stares too and defensive spasms of actions), but I'm really bothered that my presence is very imposing on their comfort. Can't live normally because wherever Ill go, I'm an object of disgust. Everybody also assumes its the lack of hygiene. Beh.<br><br>Anyway, back to it. Somehow I missed that you're still going through puberty so lets not make any premature conclusions yet. There are many many reasons why one can have body odor despite regular washing and using anti-bacterial products. Mine, I found out its called Bromhidrosis, worst of the worst. The smell ranges from fecal, musty, uh cat urine, sewagy, fishy or rotting. Oh yes, that bad. Theres no treatment for it at that. So you have to explore your own body odor to try geting into the root of the problem okay? Find out how it smells like, which part of the body it comes from, which food you took aggravates it, if you have any other disorders which leads to BO like candida, leaky gut or tract infection, etc etc.<br><br>For support and further information: Ill pm you my email (in case you wanna fall into the privacy of mailing) and a body odour support group. In that group, there are people all around the world suffering from BO, speculating together on cures since there really isnt any yet for them or minimizing the effect. It is so far the best source of info and emotional relief.<br><br>Lastly, you mentioned you sweat a lot? Check out Hyperhidrosis. Excessive sweating.<br>http://www.raffleshospital.com/news_room_20050722.html<br><br>"Botox is sometimes used to treat hyperhidrosis by blocking the nerves that trigger the sweat glands. However, it may take several injections to achieve the desired results. The injections are painful and only have a temporary effect. In addition, <strong>although Botox stops the sweating, it does not prevent body odour.</strong><br><br>For severe cases, surgery is the only solution.<br><br>Surgery is crucial for those whose sweating is so profuse and <span style="font-style: italic;">whose body odour has become so offensive that it affects their social or professional life.</span><br><br>Consultant General and Endoscopic Surgeon Dr Peter Goh has this to share about a past patient of his:<br><br>Jennifer* was an 18-year-old girl who suffered from excessive perspiration for many years. She had such wet and sweaty palms that she was embarrassed to even shake hands with acquaintances or hold hands with her boyfriend. She also had a <strong>strong smell emanating from her armpits, especially after sports.</strong><br><br>Jennifer finally had an operation performed where two tiny 2mm holes in each armpit was made. Her sympathetic nerve trunk was cut at two levels on each side. This dried up the sweating in her palms as well as her armpit. The operation took only half an hour.<br><br>The same day, at lunchtime, Dr Goh saw her holding hands confidently with her boyfriend.<br><br>You are cordially invited to an exclusive interview with Dr Peter Goh, who will discuss treatment options for excessive sweating."</div>
