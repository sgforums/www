            <div class='col-md body'><br>1- Miss Feminist<br><br>"This woman postulates that all the ills of society are orchestrated by men and the best thing a man can do to improve himself is cut off his testicles and grow a pair of ovaries. She believes that women are angelic creatures who would make the world a utopia if only the male "patriarchy" would allow them toÂ¡Â­Â¡Â­.<br><br>I have met women like this, trust me, it is only talk with air in it. As far as I know, the few of them (who coincidentally married to rich people) ended up divorced, with kids and struglling to make a living. You forgot to mentionÂ¡Â­they always say : "MEN cannot be trusted."<br><br>2- Miss Take<br><br>She's out for your money -- pure and simple. Miss Take is the ultimate in high maintenance. She expects a man to finance her entire life Â¡Â­..<br><br>This sounds like the typical China whores most Singapore carrots are finincingÂ¡Â­.watch your CPF, men!!!!<br><br>3- Miss Romance<br><br>This type of woman lives in a fantasy world of Lifetime Channel movies and romance novels. Every night she goes home alone Â¡Â­..<br><br>Mostly refer to immature Singapore womenÂ¡Â­that is why Korean "romantic" serials are so popular here. They failed to see that the Koreans are famous of being MCP and beats up their wives as hobbiesÂ¡Â­.<br><br>4- Miss Elusive<br><br>This woman is closely allied to Miss Romance, but with a dark side. She is usually one of the "walking wounded" -- someone who has been hurt in past relationships and so subconsciously avoids or sabotages new relationships in the presentÂ¡Â­.<br><br>This type always moan "I have been hurt beforeÂ¡Â­.." , hey you deserve to be hurt again until you mature upÂ¡Â­..<br><br>5- Miss Angry<br><br>Like Miss Feminists, Miss Angrys really don't like men. They scorn the male gender and can rattle off all the wrongs and misdeeds of every man they've ever encountered.<br><br>Are we talking about BUTCH here?<br><br>6- Miss Insecure<br><br>This woman seems great at the start because she's very nice, accommodating and treats men well. But her inner insecurities don't take long to surfaceÂ¡Â­.<br><br>This is the type which most likely will end up having depression or throwing their/someoneÂ¡Â¯s baby down the blockÂ¡Â­.<br><br>7- Miss Bitch<br><br>Miss Bitches are the sulkers, pouters and ball-busters of the female world. They are very unpleasant people who treat their fellow humans poorly, care only about themselves, and aren't concerned at all if they hurt you or anybody else.<br><br>We have lots of these in Singapore, they only turn to angels when they see Ang Mo, that is why 1/3 of Singapore men married foreign brides last year<br><br>8- Miss Me<br><br>A close relative of Miss Bitch, Miss Me is entirely focused on herself. Miss Me needs to be the constant center of attention no matter what she does or where she goes. She is a selfish, self-indulgentÂ¡Â­..<br><br>If they climb up to be your boss or even worst, your wife, you are screwed for life, man!!!<br><br>would like to add this to your post, maybe we could identify certain types here in our daily situations? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>excerpts from the ladder theory<br><br>As to the first point, that of money. Well most guys know that women dig guys with money. Would Donald Trump be fucking models if he wasn't rich? That question is rhetorical. Now I don't even believe this is wrong, I think it is just nature. But I also think women who are this way (and it is almost all of you) should be honest and admit that they are basically whores, and stop saying bad things about the so-called "actual whores" who are just trying to earn an honest living.<br><br>Most women read this and say something like, "Well I'm not the average woman because..blah...blah...not true...blah blah...my boyfriend/lover/husband/masseuse was poor...blah...blah."<br><br>If you thought something like this you are very likely the average woman. If you read it and went "Hmmm..." and then you went back to doing physics, then you have a case.<br><br>Looks are not to be discounted. I see many girls revert to about a seventh grade emotional level when they see some guy at the club, or some guy from a crappy movie. I think everyone has seen this phenomena, and it seems to have become an alarming trend in women of increasing age.<br><br>The attraction category is broken down further in the next section. This is a change from previous versions of the ladder theory that included looks here instead of attraction. I feel this is a more accurate depiction, as evidenced by experiment and peer review.<br><br>The last 10% was my effort to give women the benefit of the doubt. A common question men ask of women is "Tell me what you want in a man?", which is like asking how many guys she's slept with, an invitation to be lied to. Because she'll almost invariably answer with some combination of<br><br>Â• sense of humor<br>Â• intelligence<br>Â• sensitivity<br>Â• emotional stability<br><br>As far as I can tell this is mostly rubbish. But in an effort to be fair I have included this, since there seem to be a few rare cases of this. Just none that I have ever seen.<br><br>Another thing to watch out for is the code words women use. Here is a translation guide for dealing with women.<br><br>Says: I want a man who is motivated and has goals.<br>Means: I want a rich man<br><br>Says: I want a man who knows how to treat a woman.<br>Means: I want a rich man<br><br>Says: He's from a really good family.<br>Means: He's from a really rich family.<br><br></div>
