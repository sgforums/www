Just like it is OK to feel murderous. It is best not to have feelings (takes a long process, needs religion) but if you have them, just don't act on them and you will be OK.<br><br>Feel jealous? Do nothing about your jealousy or try to turn it positive. No point denying it. If it gets "underground" that is worse.</div>

It feels weird, but im not particularly angry or something, just frustrated at myself for being so weak(and protective?) and unable to control my emotions  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>btw, we are not together, still in the process of courtship.. i know u guys will say since she is not my gf, what even gives me the right to be so concern of her, but im just so confused  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Well, technically speaking you don't really have that position to feel jealous, as even you have probably stated the reason why.<br><br>And jealousy belongs to some rudimentary emotions - same level as anger - just that it's even harder to eradicate, but it's almost as destructive as anger in impact when overwhelmed.<br><br>Anyway, I doubt you have reached to such a stage. I mean everyone would be saying that jealousy is normal, but normal is not good enough a reason for it to manifest into effect. Akin to that of anger is normal, but that rationale is never good enough for me throw a punch at someone just because it's normal to feel angry.<br><br>I think the great thing about Love is that it alone will allow anyone to experience an entire gamut of emotions and humans should always learn to deal with them. But when it comes to different emotions, our ability to handle them varies according to our personality and psychological archetype.<br><br>Don't fret just yet. Learn to understand what's going in and out of your emotions and learn to study them. Then gradually engineer it in such a way that it could make your life a whole lot easier and implement it as part of your core value and mindset.<br><br>P.S: The key to evolve our emotional flaws is to work from within. Superficial solution are usually short term and does not address the root of problem.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
