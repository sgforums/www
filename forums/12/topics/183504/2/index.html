It won't be easy for her to get over it if she had such big reaction over that loudmouth's comments which is totally idiotic.<br><br>I supposed you have your gal friend's mobile number. Don't try to call her too often. Maybe two sms everyday telling her you are still waiting for her to pick up your call or reply back. Once she cool down, I'm sure she will reply you. This is a time where you have to show your sincereity towards the friendship. But remind yah...she probably lost a lot of confident.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Delta 5:</div><div class="quote_body">Today at my campus I was finishing up a presentation report with my gal classmate at the study area near the carpark at around 5 plus, while waiting for my friend from SMU to fetch me back home. He arrived 10 minutes early, but another of my guy friends happened to tag along too. My gal classmate was feeling thirsty at this point, so she excused herself to go to the vending machine just around the corner. That loudmouth who happened to tag along assumed wrongly that she went to the washroom further down the corner and just blurted out loudly: " Wah that gal is so FAT, look at her I think she can squash a full-grown man... Wah I din noe u like to hang aroung fat gals nowadays haha"<br><br>Of course, needless to say, she overheard everything. She came over, packed up and ran off with wet eyes.<br><br>I was stunned. Really stunned. Because of that a nice friendship and working relationship may be lost <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  I called her just now intending to apologize on that guys's behalf but she did not answer. This is really terrible. I am ashamed of that loudmouth who has hurt and shattered a perfectly nice gal's self confidence. Of course I shouted at him to get lost and that I din wan to see him around my faculty again. He tired to apologize to me but i jus shrugged it off. I loathe shallow people like that.<br><br>Now I feel terribly sad for her. Hopefully I will get to see her and apologize to her on that jerk's behalf soon <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div></blockquote>That male friend of yours had no right to say that even behind her back... if he's really a friend of yours then i pity you and him together. Maybe this is a routine conversation when other less-than-perfect people are not around you guys.</div>

Xiao Shuai Di Di!!!... hmmm much better.... hehehe<br><br>anyway back to this gal, did this happen today? if it did, it's no wonder that she is not answering your call...<br><br>Most gals, esp if they are over the society's opinion of average figure, have a lower tolerance for such criticisms. reason being, they know they're not slim, and they know that there will be ppl (insensitive a$$holes who think that way) but to hear it out loud, in front of a friend, I'll run away too.<br><br>it's not that we are weak or that we do not know how to take a joke, sometimes even if you know it's a joke, it HURTS.<br>NO MATTER WHAT, IT"LL HURT.<br>it's as simple as that.<br>but good news is, I doubt she'll hold it against you, as you are not the one who made the uncalled for insensitive hurtfull remark. BUT, it'll take her some time to recover and be able to face you without feeling embarassed.<br><br>What I'll do is that I'll apologise once and let her know that you do not under any circumstances feel the same way as that A$$hole, and leave it as that. continue as you were before this incident. I know she'll understand.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi iceFatboy,<br><br>Many people have the impression that I just tell them off, but it is Not true.  If there's a genuine case, &amp; this person seems open to help or constructive criticism, then I get very serious in helping them.  Not all my replies are harsh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>However, when a person only wants to whinge, or despite repeated attempts at helping them, they don't listen &amp; come back to you to repeat the same problem over &amp; over again, my patience is limited.  Most importantly, my time is limited.  That's when I often give a very stinging reply.  Harsh, it may be, but they need shaking up anyway  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by iceFatboy:</div><div class="quote_body">feow2,<br>quite surprised at your post.<br>a nice touch.<br><br>we all do comment about people behind their backs be it "FAT", "SKINNY", "PRETTY" or "BIG BOOBS". Anyway, just shrug them off like rain on an umbrella, won't hurt you. move on... world too beautiful for one stupid comment to put a dent in you.<br></div></blockquote></div>
