            <div class='col-md body'>Today at my campus I was finishing up a presentation report with my gal classmate at the study area near the carpark at around 5 plus, while waiting for my friend from SMU to fetch me back home. He arrived 10 minutes early, but another of my guy friends happened to tag along too. My gal classmate was feeling thirsty at this point, so she excused herself to go to the vending machine just around the corner. That loudmouth who happened to tag along assumed wrongly that she went to the washroom further down the corner and just blurted out loudly: " Wah that gal is so FAT, look at her I think she can squash a full-grown man... Wah I din noe u like to hang aroung fat gals nowadays haha"<br><br>Of course, needless to say, she overheard everything. She came over, packed up and ran off with wet eyes.<br><br>I was stunned. Really stunned. Because of that a nice friendship and working relationship may be lost <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  I called her just now intending to apologize on that guys's behalf but she did not answer. This is really terrible. I am ashamed of that loudmouth who has hurt and shattered a perfectly nice gal's self confidence. Of course I shouted at him to get lost and that I din wan to see him around my faculty again. He tired to apologize to me but i jus shrugged it off. I loathe shallow people like that.<br><br>Now I feel terribly sad for her. Hopefully I will get to see her and apologize to her on that jerk's behalf soon <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Delta 5<br>If this girl had any sense she'd know better than to blame you for what happened.  I can only hope she takes some time to get over it and things gradually return to normal.  In the meantime a funny / encouraging SMS could show that you care.  Something in the line of "Hey sorry about the other day, he's a jerk for not recognising what a nice person you are.  Don't let that a-hole get you down!  Hope to see you around soon."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Delta 5:</div><div class="quote_body">Today at my campus I was finishing up a presentation report with my gal classmate at the study area near the carpark at around 5 plus, while waiting for my friend from SMU to fetch me back home. He arrived 10 minutes early, but another of my guy friends happened to tag along too. My gal classmate was feeling thirsty at this point, so she excused herself to go to the vending machine just around the corner. That loudmouth who happened to tag along assumed wrongly that she went to the washroom further down the corner and just blurted out loudly: " Wah that gal is so FAT, look at her I think she can squash a full-grown man... Wah I din noe u like to hang aroung fat gals nowadays haha"<br><br>Of course, needless to say, she overheard everything. She came over, packed up and ran off with wet eyes.<br><br>I was stunned. Really stunned. Because of that a nice friendship and working relationship may be lost <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  I called her just now intending to apologize on that guys's behalf but she did not answer. This is really terrible. I am ashamed of that loudmouth who has hurt and shattered a perfectly nice gal's self confidence. Of course I shouted at him to get lost and that I din wan to see him around my faculty again. He tired to apologize to me but i jus shrugged it off. I loathe shallow people like that.<br><br>Now I feel terribly sad for her. Hopefully I will get to see her and apologize to her on that jerk's behalf soon <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div></blockquote>i understand how the girl feels.. but its not your fault. you were not the one who said it.</div>
