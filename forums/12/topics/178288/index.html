The school encouraging boys and girls to grab some hand they can hold onto. Even though it can be as little as a year ago when these boys and girls were prohibited from doing so in JCs. Now you see signs everywhere that tells u to get a girl or guy. Overt and subvert social pressures for you to get attached.<br><br>The university has got to be the biggest and most intrusive match-making agency in Singapore. It canÂ’t wait for you to fall in love. It has to meddle to make sure you would. It orchestrates moves that cultivate this oppressive couple culture which pushes you to date. Maybe it does so to be in line with govtÂ’s plan that we should all start dating as undergrads so we can get hitched n have babies immediately after we grad. But what horrible implications these stuff bring onto people like me. I was happy to single until I went into university. Once, twice, thriceÂ…perhaps for at least a hundred times I resisted the kind of message that says u should be dating. But as u know even a drip of water can make it thru a stone if it does so persistently over time, after these images and messages were flashed at me for countless times I started to wonder if I needed to be attached in order to be happy in university. From the speed I see my friends settling for mates it seems so. And I feel so much of an outcast that I m single. Like I m somewhat inferior. Like I m not part of their community anymore. Everyone no longer has time for friends as their beau is of supreme importance and takes up most of their time n attention. These things haunt me so much that they make my university life miserable. I yearn for companionship but it neednÂ’t come from a lover. Yet things donÂ’t seem to work that way. EveryoneÂ’s top agenda is to look for a date and whereÂ’s friend on the list? For some, I doubt it is on the list even. Why must the varsity turn everyone into Â“desperate housewivesÂ”? Why canÂ’t they just let things be?<br><strong></strong></div>
