              <p>Remind her that a relationship requires <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>compromise, understanding and maturity</strong></span>. It is more strategically viable to bite the tongue and withhold displays of emotion and just keep a certain distance instead of risking the blessings of one of the most important people to the future marriage, while you promise her that you will talk about it to your mum. Assuming she is an understanding and mature girl, she would be receptive to that logic.</p>
              <p>During that time, however, you have to also be vocal about what your gf feels of your mother. That doesn't mean putting your mum down for her actions- she's acting that way because she's overexcited at you having such a gf. It is as important for her it is for you to have your current girlfriend. Just gently remind her that your gf feels quite uncomfortable when she displays such grandoise affections or emotions when she is around. Get her to understand your gf's likes and dislikes so that you mother is better able to get on your gf's good side, while at the same time, do the same for your gf (i.e. get her to know ur mum's likes and dislikes. An extremely happy mother = happy father = happy child = happy future.</p>
              <p>Forming and<strong> enhancing</strong> a harmonious relationship between both parties will prove to be an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">extremely</span> important and invaluable strategic asset to all parties in the future. It is better to set the stage for it to beneficially grow now than later, when resentments increase.</p>
              <p>Good luck. :)</p>

              <p>Remind her that a relationship requires <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>compromise, understanding and
              maturity</strong></span>. It is more strategically viable to bite
              the tongue and withhold displays of emotion and just keep a certain
              distance instead of risking the blessings of one of the most
              important people to the future marriage, while you promise her that
              you will talk about it to your mum. Assuming she is an
              understanding and mature girl, she would be receptive to that
              logic.</p>
              <p>During that time, however, you have to also be vocal about what
              your gf feels of your mother. That doesn't mean putting your mum
              down for her actions- she's acting that way because she's
              overexcited at you having such a gf. It is as important for her it
              is for you to have your current girlfriend. Just gently remind her
              that your gf feels quite uncomfortable when she displays such
              grandoise affections or emotions when she is around. Get her to
              understand your gf's likes and dislikes so that you mother is
              better able to get on your gf's good side, while at the same time,
              do the same for your gf (i.e. get her to know ur mum's likes and
              dislikes. An extremely happy mother = happy father = happy child =
              happy future.</p>
              <p>Forming and <strong>enhancing</strong> a harmonious relationship
              between both parties will prove to be an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">extremely</span> important and
              invaluable strategic asset to all parties in the future. It is
              better to set the stage for it to beneficially grow now than later,
              when resentments increase.</p>

                      girlfriend ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The main reason was because i know she dislikes my mum and she was scheduled to come over to my house today, before i actually got off work and i don't want conflicts to happen which would strain it further if they see each other and my mum tries to engage her but she tries to blow my mum off. Her relationship with my mum is already semi strained and if she comes over to my place without knowing that my mum is here then something might occur that might anger one of them. I mean my mum would sometimes tell her that she should't do certain things but that's my mum and its part of my family and she will stay that way.</p>
              <p>We were supposed to go somewhere today, but upon knowing that my mum is coming back, she hung up the phone and has since not contacted me. Even though i told her time and again that i will still see her as per usual timing.</p>
              <p>I do think my mum has expectations, but then again, i think that my gf's expectations for me far exceed my mum's expectations for her, or my expectations for her, but then again who hasn't? She doesn't try to "control" her.</p>
              <p>Depends on what you mean by overbearing, my mum does talk. A lot. Some people might find that overbearing.</p>
              <p>The thing is, she just started working recently, and my mum will ask her stuff like all manner of work related, or that she will have a random conversation either with me or my sibling and expect my gf to chime in.</p>
              <p> It is really just a conflict between 2 very headstrong personalities. Both are very stubborn and won't let up, and i guess that i am caught in the crossfire.</p>

              <p>Seriously, why do you let your mother bypass you for invites and "instructions" ? Your mom is obviously a manipulative person, and she knows how to get her way. No wonder your gf don't care for your mom.</p>
              <p>If your mother has any request, tell her to talk to YOU not your gf. And ask for some time to think about the request or to "check your schedule".</p>
              <p>Then you discuss whatever request with your gf.</p>
              <p>If your gf is not comfortable with her request, then you go tell your mother. And please don't say it was your gf's idea. Just tell your mother you have other plans.</p>
              <p>She don't have to avoid your family forever, as long as you know how to play your part to shield her from those prying family of yours.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">1) I always go and meet her at her home almost 80% of the time. She is the one that wants to go over to my place because its near her work place so she can get some rest or do some work instead of taking the long journey home and i will send her back via car later at night. The nature of her work means she will have work to do after working hours. Dunno where you get the idea that i never go to her place to meet her when its her choice to come over to my place.</div>
              <div class="quote_body"><br></div>
              <div class="quote_body">2) I always tell my mother that i have other plans, for example, today i was supposed to go somewhere with my gf, and i already told my mum before hand that i will be going out even though today is the first day she is back and she expects me to be home for dinner.  In fact, when my mum's in Singapore i really only go out with her maybe once every 2 weeks at most. 90% of my free time is spent with my gf even when my mum is around.</div>
              <div class="quote_body"><br></div>
              <div class="quote_body">3) Most of these "invitations" were asked when they are alone together, which i cannot prevent 100% of the time and often i am not aware of it. I have already highlighted this to my mum many times but i cannot control what she does and does not do behind my back because after all she is still my mum.<br></div>
              <div class="quote_body"><br></div>
              <div class="quote_body">my mum's main issue is that she doesn't want the children to "break away" from the family after marriage because my elder brother has migrated to another country and is almost "seperated" from the family. My girlfriend however, seems like she wants to minimise all ties with my family even before or after marriage except maybe during CNY. <br></div>
