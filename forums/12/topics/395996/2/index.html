              <p>I see. Which mothers would like to see their sons seperate with them after mariage. No one i guess. Next time when your Gf is a mother, she will also have the same thinking as your mum mah. My advice is, if your Gf really does not like your mum, then mimise all contact with your mum until those important festivals loh, like new year, birthday. But thats only Her. Will she object you seeing your mum after mariage or something ? Or will your mum mind only you and not your gf came back and find her.</p>

              <p>If she wants to do work, then tell her to stay in her office and wait for you to pick her up.</p>
              <p>Since she doesn't like to mingle with your family so much, it doesn't make any sense for her to want to go wait for you at your home knowing your family lives there.</p>
              <p>Set aside time for your parents, ask your mom out for a One on One lunch , so your mother can enjoy uninterrupted quality time with you before AND after marriage. </p>
              <p>Your gf/wife can minimise all ties with your family, but YOU don't have to.</p>
              <p>This "doesn't want the children to break away" thing is what all mothers use to win the power struggle, she is putting you on a GUILT TRIP.</p>
              <p>When you have your own family, you are no longer attached to your mom's apron strings. You will have to decide the fate of your own family.</p>
              <p>We all know mothers have a hard time letting go. And yes, mothers can be very selfish too.</p>
              <p>But what must happen , will happen.</p>
              <p>You must also understand that your gf comes from a broken family, she will feel inferior when she compares her family background to yours. Her aversion to your "happy and wholesome family" may be a innate defense mechanism to dealing with the hurt and disappointment of her own broken family.</p>
              <p>You can only seek her understanding, but you really should not put too much emphasis for her to "embrace" your family.</p>
              <p>Do understand that the success of YOUR own herd , does not depend on the "approval" of your blood family.</p>

              <p>Who's more important? Your gf or your mom?</p>
              <p>In my opinion your gf is still immature and lacks empathy since she's unable to see things from your mom's point of view. Besides, from what you have posted, I don't think your mom has done anything wrong. She was just being herself. If you gf was mature enough, she will be able to accept your mom's social shortcomings and not react in such a negative way.</p>
              <p>Get your gf to grow up or you're gonna have some major problems in the future.</p>

              <p>How can my suggestion possibly lead to any form of animosity between the both of them? By not telling someone what the problem is, the problem is not going to get solved. In fact, by avoiding interaction between his gf and mother, the TS is going to pave the way for MORE misunderstanding between both females. What would the mother think when she realises the girl isn't as friendly anymore? Won't she feel hurt and perhaps be more demanding? Human beings are not very predictable unless you make the environment change in such a way to make their behaviour predictable. Don't you agree that it is more logical to lay one's cards out on the table to see what one is dealing with rather than play a hit and miss guessing game of tactics?</p>
              <p>Sometimes the simplest answer is the best answer.</p>

              <p>It is always tough to strike a balance between both women. It is true that she is going to marry you and not your mum. But that doesn't mean that she doesn't try to understand your mum's situation and get to know her better and how she ticks right?</p>
              <p>All in all, I believe that a talk is required with both your mum and girlfriend separately. Talk to your gf about understanding, mutual respect, tolerance, compromise and adapting. Talk to your mum about you going to be independent as a husband, trying to make an effort to understand your wife-to-be and having her give her blessings to you. And eventually, the 3 of you have to sit down for tea together as you can't avoid this all the way, unmarried or married right? But of course, how you phrase your words is very important too. Don't try to escalate the situation into an all-out warfare and have both women hold grudges against each other eventually by saying "She said ... about you, she said ... about you". You will definitely be torn in between and will suffer big time.</p>
              <p>I do believe in this 1 line though. "Your partner can always dump you, divorce you, separate from you. But your family will never ever leave you in a lurch."</p>
              <p>And I hope you don't mind me asking this question. Can you get along with your girlfriend's parents? How are they like? Better yet, how is your girlfriend's family background like? With these questions answered, we may be able to help you better with your plight.</p>

              <p>How can my suggestion possibly lead to any form of animosity
                  between the both of them? By not telling someone what the problem
                  is, the problem is not going to get solved. In fact, by avoiding
                  interaction between his gf and mother, the TS is going to pave the
                  way for MORE misunderstanding between both females. What would the
                  mother think when she realises the girl isn't as friendly anymore?
                  Won't she feel hurt and perhaps be more demanding? Human beings are
                  not very predictable unless you make the environment change in such
                  a way to make their behaviour predictable. Don't you agree that it
                  is more logical to lay one's cards out on the table to see what one
                  is dealing with rather than play a hit and miss guessing game of
                  tactics?</p>
              <p>Sometimes the simplest answer is the best answer.</p>

              <p><br>I agree with you on what you said, your article and all. Women are really delicate and sometimes rather difficult to understand from a man's perspective when all they want is something really simple at times. Misinterpretation of good intentions can lead to misunderstandings and eventual destruction of relationships. So TS must tread lightly on this minefield and not to step on any live mines.</p>
              <p>What I do not agree with you is that you said his mother is overbearing. Do you even know how is she like personally? Do you even know if it is a fact that TS is a mummy's boy? And how can you be so sure that TS's girlfriend is not the overbearing one instead? Unless you tell me that you know all 3 parties personally then I would understand. But I believe we should just offer whatever advice we can offer, show TS a glimpse of the various scenarios that may occur and reserve our comments, good or bad to ourselves as they are made based on secondary evidence. All I can say is that in the end, all mothers mean well for their children. No matter what the circumstance.</p>

              <p>My mom had to go for counseling because of the same fear of "losing her son" to another female.</p>
              <p>At one point, my sister in law got so frustrated she left and went back to her own family for a brief period of time.</p>
              <p>It took my brother a while to realised what had happened and what he had "unknowingly" done. He thought he was "mediating" the problem by asking the two women to "get along", instead he made things worst.</p>
              <p>The relationship between my mother and my sister in law became more "civil", after my brother went for a few session with a family psychologist.</p>

              <p>I know because my mom is an overbearing mother in law. And my brother used to be the same mommy's boy.</p>
              <p>What is happening in TS's life now.. is as what had happened in my brother's before they had kids.</p>
              <p>My mom had to go for counseling because of the same fear of "losing her son" to another female.</p>
              <p>At one point, my sister in law got so frustrated she left and went back to her own family for a brief period of time.</p>
              <p>It took my brother a while to realised what had happened and what he had "unknowingly" done. He thought he was "mediating" the problem by asking the two women to "get along", instead he made things worst.</p>
              <p>The relationship between my mother and my sister in law became more "civil", after my brother went for a few session with a family psychologist.</p>
              <p>For the guys, it's not an easy task finding a gal with the kind of connection that can lead to a life time commitment.</p>
              <p>Your mother will always be your mother.</p>
              <p>But will you find someone like the gal ever again ?</p>

              <p>This is a good personal experience that you have shared with us. I never doubted that such situations are possible. But you are forgetting that your mum isn't TS's mum, TS ain't your brother and TS's gf isn't your sis-in-law. That aside, you gave a very personal insight on how things can escalate to a very drastic status. I hope TS can foresee all possible scenarios beforehand and think through on how to tackle this problem of his. If not, he may risk losing either his gf or mum or worse still, both.</p>

              <p>This is a very common issue among couples with intrusive parents.</p>
              <p>As a woman myself, it is easy for me to spot what his mom  ( a woman ) is trying to do. I am surprised nobody tells that woman to keep her nose out.</p>
              <p>If TS's mom is my friend, I'd tell her this " Butt out woman, so that your son can have a happy marriage, that's what you'd want for your son too RIGHT ?"</p>
              <p>Sadly, many women gauge their personal success based on how much CONTROL
                           she has over her children or children in-laws. Loosely termed "filial" children.</p>
              <p>Today, she makes the couple come to dinner.</p>
              <p>Tomorrow, she tells you she's getting old and wish for them to have children earlier.</p>
              <p>Next day, she decides how the wedding must be organized and what outfits the brides wear.</p>
              <p>When the babies come along, the mom will be competing with the "other" grandmother for the affection and standings within the three families.</p>
              <p>Next time, she wants the wife to go get a job so she can "take care" of the grandchildren because the wife is not doing it right.</p>
              <p>The marriage no longer belongs to TS and his wife. His mother is the one in the driver's seat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To TS, step up or suffer the same fate. When you let your mother mow over your gf/wife, your gf/wife will not be a happy woman.</p>
              <p>When your gf/wife is not a happy woman, you'll no longer be a happy man.</p>
              <p> Thread carefully bro. OK ? Good.</p>

              <p>Which is why it is so difficult to manage 2 people who are so
              stubborn and won't budge when it is in my nature to be a mediator
              and to please both of them equally, i do agree that i am not good
              in conflict management because i don't want to hurt one at the
              expense of the other.</p>
              <p>My mum is a mix of both, she is both friendly (sometimes TOO
              friendly) but she can be demanding and naggy as well. Basically my
              gf wants us to have a 2 person haven together indefinitely without
              any outside interference and interaction. In her future life, she
              doesn't even take into account her family, let alone mine.</p>

              <p>Let me ask you . Set aside your mother/family for now.</p>
              <p>Are you happy with your gf ?</p>
              <p>Are you confident that your gf will bring you marital bliss?</p>
              <p>Are you certain she will make a good mother ?</p>
              <p>Do you and your gf share the same life goals ?</p>
              <p>Do you forsee dying in her arms and buried beside her ?</p>
              <p>Can you rely on her if your life depends on it ?</p>
              <p>If all the above is "YES".</p>
              <p>As long as she does not demand you disown your family. Go ahead and oblige the personal space she so desires.</p>
