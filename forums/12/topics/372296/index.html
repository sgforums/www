              <p>I feel so sad, feel like crying, feel so messed up with my life.?<br> I still remembered that in the past around 3 months ago, I enjoyed
              fame, happiness, acknowledgment of my professional IT skill by my
              classmate. But after falling with 2 main guy who enjoy a high amount of
              friends, fame, reputation, my world seems to turn upside down, the
              whole class starts to avoid me, even for a group project, I find it
              extremely hard to get a group in class, the group which I used to be in
              'kick' me out of it.<br> <br> I soon come to realize that without any friends, no matter how talented
              I am, I am still a loner. This make it even worse when some my
              classmate started to make fun of me when I make a post on facebook, I
              felt so hurt that I couldn't describe it. I dread going to school
              everyday.<br> <br> Worse still, tomorrow is the presentation where my ex-group will be
              presenting. All the presentation was done by me, one and only person. I
              wonder, should I claim all the credits in the last slides that the
              presentation was done by me? If I do that, chances are I will get high
              score while the other groups members will get a much lower score or
              even fail.<br> <br> I know right from the start, my ex-group members was making use of me
              but at that point of time, I didn't really bother cause to me, I don't
              mind going extra further for happiness and satisfaction.<br> <br> I am honestly lost for what to do. I am very depressed, lost, hurt. I
              have to say, I do have the urge to end my life cause I find it
              meaningless, totally no happiness.<br> <br> Please advice on what should I really do.<br> <br> Thank you</p>

              <p>you're relying too much on your friends and you're treating this seemingly temporary event as a long term one.</p>
              <p>What you can do is to seek other classmates rather than rely on your clique of friends. As for taking credits, I think what you should do is to tell your teacher what happened after your presentation, rather than risk compromising everything in front of everyone. </p>
              <p>You can backstab people, there's no harm in it, as long as it does not compromise your principles. </p>

              <p>There should be reasons why others choose to avoid you besides the 2 guys.</p>
              <p>Totally none of them close or friendly with you? Try to find one of them and ask why they are treating you so differently. Is it something you done or someone spreading bad things about you etc?</p>
              <p>Regarding the work, as mentioned, tell your teacher privately about it and see what he/she says. Don't make it public in front of the whole class or that will make more people dislike you.</p>

              <p>Being good in MS office is good. You would be surprised how many 1st yr uni students from JC do not know how to use MS excel to plot graphs etc and use most of the functions of MS excel and other functions of MS word besides writing a document.</p>
              <p>However, do not ever showoff in front of your classmates etc. Most would rather have someone that is less well skilled than someone who is skilled but behaves like a smartass 'parading' his knowledge.</p>

              <p>Go find out from those girls why everyone else hates you so much. There should be a reason for it besides just you falling out with the 2 popular guys. What exactly happened between you and those 2 guys anyway? Did the cause of the fall out made people dislike you and not just because you fall out with the 2 of them?</p>

              <p>One word of suggestion for you - SCHEME.</p>
              <p>I too was a kid once, and know what's it like if you are left out, not because you are no good, but because some idiotic prideful petty son of a bitch took a dislike to you. Guess what? It WILL happen at every stage in your life too - school, NS, work, old age home, etc.</p>
              <p>Sad to say that you have to grow up fast now, made more with what I have to teach you. It will make you lose your innocence and naivety, but the truth is that you have to understand group dynamics, how it works and operates, and how to MANIPULATE it to your advantage so that you can get ahead in life.</p>
              <p>There is a right bright side and the dark side to scheming. If you can control it, and have no intentions to hurt or harm anyone, it would benefit many. But should you lean towards the dark side - to cheat, to lie, to harm - you will be hated, for sometimes, if you are not careful, scheming can be discovered and run out of control, causing only more misery.</p>
              <p>So do be careful in your application of manipulation of others.</p>
              <p>'know your enemy and know yourself - a thousand battles fought, a thousand won.' The popular guys must be jealous of your knowledge and feel you as a threat. Therefore, you must never bang your head against the wall - go against them. Rather, go around them.</p>
              <p>If you are as smart as you think yourself are, you will be able to run rings around them. Example- they spread half truth against you - counter them by building allies with others. Learn to make others trust you and know you are reliable - by being responsible, helpful and more caring. Build up your base - close friends of both guys and girls.</p>
              <p>There is no need to treat the popular guys with contempt, nor have a servitude attitude to them. You are a Singaporean and an equal to anyone else, no need to bow or kneel. Always keep cool and have a smile on your face. Listen with attention to what they say, if right, do what they say, if wrong, just smile, dont argue, but once their backs on turn, do what you think is right and prove these petty clowns wrong.</p>
              <p>There is much more to learn, but too much that I cannot teach you here. It takes experience, but as you are still young, the opportunities are boundless on what you can do, watching reactions, learning, correcting your mistakes and adapting to your environment like a chameleon.</p>
              <p>Just dont be seduced by the darkside once you gain success. It will only bring you more misery.</p>
              <p>May the Force be with you.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I feel so sad, feel like crying, feel so messed up with my
              life.?<br> I still remembered that in the past around 3 months ago, I enjoyed
              fame, happiness, acknowledgment of my professional IT skill by my
              classmate. But after falling with 2 main guy who enjoy a high
              amount of friends, fame, reputation, my world seems to turn upside
              down, the whole class starts to avoid me, even for a group project,
              I find it extremely hard to get a group in class, the group which I
              used to be in 'kick' me out of it.<br> <br> I soon come to realize that without any friends, no matter how
              talented I am, I am still a loner. This make it even worse when
              some my classmate started to make fun of me when I make a post on
              facebook, I felt so hurt that I couldn't describe it. I dread going
              to school everyday.<br> <br> Worse still, tomorrow is the presentation where my ex-group will be
              presenting. All the presentation was done by me, one and only
              person. I wonder, should I claim all the credits in the last slides
              that the presentation was done by me? If I do that, chances are I
              will get high score while the other groups members will get a much
              lower score or even fail.<br> <br> I know right from the start, my ex-group members was making use of
              me but at that point of time, I didn't really bother cause to me, I
              don't mind going extra further for happiness and
              satisfaction.<br> <br> I am honestly lost for what to do. I am very depressed, lost, hurt.
              I have to say, I do have the urge to end my life cause I find it
              meaningless, totally no happiness.<br> <br> Please advice on what should I really do.<br> <br> Thank you</p>
