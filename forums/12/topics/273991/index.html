At that moment I was seriously OMGWTFBBQ.<br><br>This morning<br>I was looking at her Friendster profile and saw that the butch posted 8 meaningless comments in 2 days. I mean, seriously nobody needs to know what you are doing on your TV. and she actually replied twice!!<br>Jeez man, I feel like telling that butch to shut the F*** up<br><br>I really don't know what to do, but my absolute is that I won't lose to that thing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br>I don't know what I'll do if she turns twisted.</div></blockquote>Yo, u jealous ya, maybe you not up to the mark as the butch, his performance outclass you lah.<br><br>That is life, if you choose a pretty gal, you prepare to have competition, but if you choose a normal one like me, less competition or even no competition, if you choose an ugly one, u tend to competite with yourself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if that girl really liked you i dun think she would say that to you (unless you did something really bad to deserve it!)... at least she would say it more kindly and affectionately maybe...<br><br>even IF u two are together after her O's, it doesnt sound like a very stable relationship, you know.<br><br>i agree with those who say move on... don't worry about losing to the other girl..sometimes u just gotta cut your losses, before they get worse.<br><br></div>
