How old is your bf?<br><br>Personally speaking, it's actually nothing much to just talk and joke with someone... But of course, if you really don't like someone you naturally won't feel too good about it if the person can really talk and get along with your bf... Perhaps it's also a sense of insecurity...<br><br>It's not really wise to interfere too much of the friend-making of your bf unless something is really not right... Doing so might only tense up your relationship a bit if it's gonna happen... Perhaps you can just gives a gentle remind again to your bf that you're not quite comfortable with the idea... On the other hand, do give your bf that little space and confidence that he deserves... It'll probably go a long way if your relationship is meant to be a meaningful one...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Well, wat can u do...?<br><br>1) Give him a stern warning and it's the last time u giving him chance as there is no way for u too even torture your bf and your enemy casual chit chatting/interaction/flirt etc.<br><br>2) Dump him, go find someone who also hate the girl.<br><br>3) Dump him and concentrate on studies, u will know wat is life all actually abt and will understand more of yourself in the later part of your life. Meaning u will know which type of guy suit u the most...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
