            <div class='col-md body'>Recently, my gf has food poisoning. On the first night, she said that she is vommitted a few times and feel very weak. I asked her to take a rest and to see a doctor tomorrow if she is still unwell tomorrow morning since there is no doctor at night unless it is an emergency. She did not have a fever then.<br><br>The next morning, I sms her to see if she is feeling better. She say it is still the same. Then, I ask her to go see a doctor. She say she is too weak to go and see a doctor, so I advice her to rest at home first and I will come and visit her after work. After that there was no more communication.<br><br>Then when I went to visit her after my work, she told me that she has went to see a doctor alone in the afternoon. Maybe due to her sickness, she say that I did not care for her when she is ill and she has to go and see doctor alone. Her condition is pretty bad as she also got a fever and the doctor have to give her a antibacterial injection.<br><br>I felt bad after that. But at that time, I did not know she has a fever and how serious is her condition that I need to take immediate leave to take her to a doctor because the other time when  I have food poisoning, I am ok after some time of vommiting and diarrhoea without a need to see a doctor.<br><br>Do you think I did not do enough as her bf?</div>

Somehow I feel there's really not too big a 'wrong' with your assumptions... I mean... You've got your points too... Sometimes things jsut don't work out or happen the way we expect or thought it would be... Cheer up and don't be too hard on yourself....<br><br>I feel it'll be nice if you were around... Then again you'll need to balance between your work and personal life...?</div>

On the first night, she said that she is vommitted a few times and feel very weak. I asked her to take a rest and to see a doctor tomorrow if she is still unwell tomorrow morning since there is no doctor at night unless it is an emergency. She did not have a fever then.<br><br>The next morning, I sms her to see if she is feeling better. She say it is still the same. Then, I ask her to go see a doctor. She say she is too weak to go and see a doctor, so I advice her to rest at home first and I will come and visit her after work. After that there was no more communication.<br><br>Then when I went to visit her after my work, she told me that she has went to see a doctor alone in the afternoon. Maybe due to her sickness, she say that I did not care for her when she is ill and she has to go and see doctor alone. Her condition is pretty bad as she also got a fever and the doctor have to give her a antibacterial injection.<br><br>I felt bad after that. But at that time, I did not know she has a fever and how serious is her condition that I need to take immediate leave to take her to a doctor because the other time when  I have food poisoning, I am ok after some time of vommiting and diarrhoea without a need to see a doctor.<br><br>Do you think I did not do enough as her bf?</div></blockquote>poor bro we have been working hard day and nite for our jobs in order to by food and gifts for our gfs..<br><br>as good guys we try our best for gf but is always never enough.<br><br>wonder why do girls always have to order the good guys around.<br><br>Have you ever seen the bad guys?<br>they need not do anything but the girls treat them as kings....<br><br>So sick and tired of this dumb treatment...</div>
