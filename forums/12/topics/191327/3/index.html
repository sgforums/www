            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding to the first reply on this thread, personally I find that you have not done any wrong. You have already asked and shown your concern. In short you have not failed a boyfriend. However i find that it is the girl who have not communicated enough... if she really feel bad, she should have tell you about it straight. If she don't say, don't complain about it. You got to work and have your own life. You can't just keep thinking about her every minute of your life, thinking too deeply into watever actions she done and said and waste company time calling her up. Even if you call back to her more regularly, you have actually did damage to her in the sense that you are disturbing her rest. (she may be sleeping) If she is really okay, she may find that you are naggy and thinks you are a wishy washy kind of guy. In short in certain situation such as this one, doing any actions is meaningless and you will still get a scolding anyway. So don't treat being scolded too hard.<br><br>Sometimes I really can't understand woman... if things happen the other way round, I will just quietly go to the hospital and not complain about it at all.</div>

On the first night, she said that she is vommitted a few times and feel very weak. I asked her to take a rest and to see a doctor tomorrow if she is still unwell tomorrow morning since there is no doctor at night unless it is an emergency. She did not have a fever then.</div></blockquote>Actually the emergency in hospitals admits non-emergency cases also.<br><br><blockquote>The next morning, I sms her to see if she is feeling better. She say it is still the same. Then, I ask her to go see a doctor. She say she is too weak to go and see a doctor, so I advice her to rest at home first and I will come and visit her after work. After that there was no more communication.</blockquote>No one at home? Maybe her mum is a housewife who can bring her to the doctor.<br><br>You can always take a gamble at this point. Ask her whether she wants you to accompany her. If she cares about you and not too wilful, high chance she say dun need.<br><br><blockquote>Then when I went to visit her after my work, she told me that she has went to see a doctor alone in the afternoon. Maybe due to her sickness, she say that I did not care for her when she is ill and she has to go and see doctor alone. Her condition is pretty bad as she also got a fever and the doctor have to give her a antibacterial injection.</blockquote>I suspect she just want you to pop the question.
