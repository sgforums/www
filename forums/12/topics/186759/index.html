It's nonverbal: I need love. I need the thing that happens when your brain shuts off and your heart turns on. And I know it's around me somewhere, but I just can't feel it."<br>oh well, msg me if you feel like it.</div></blockquote>you are right...i have used to much of brains...i need to switch off and turn my heart on...</div>
