You could kill her, if her husband can't control himself, I think he will slap her, beat her, whack her, and treat her like shit. And she will need to face all this by herself alone. You put her into hell.<br><br>I think from the day you let her husband know about your affairs, she will hate you deep into her heart, she will hate you forever. Redeem your sins? If I were her, I think I will pray hard you go to hell. Because what you have done are really unforgivable.<br><br>Wow...you really done a good job, letting some body know you have an affair with his wife, cool, you are super-man, super-hero.

I am confused...If you love her, how could you put her into hell.... hmmm.... I can't imagine how is her life now, she must be live like shit. Will her husband divorce her? Well, anyway, she has to face all this by herself.<br><br>Well, Mr. Animal, your sins will never be able to redeem. I curse you for her.<br><br>Edit: Did her husband whack you on the spot when you tell him you and his wife are having affairs? Did he slap his wife, and did you saw that? If yes, how did you feel?
