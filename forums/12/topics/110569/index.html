You are really an idiot.<br><br>OK, now I teach u how to fix the mess....<br><br>Say to her....heart to heart....that u were drunk and couldnt think straight. U have to play up this drunkeness thing very well and make her believe u. Other people, please dont think this is lame. In courts, if u commit a crime under the influence of alcohol, or u have mental illness, ur punishment is lighter. Why? Coz people really behave differently under alcohol and under mental illness. People in otherwise normal circumstances wouldnt do those things. So remember ahris, use this alcohol thing as good as u can.<br><br>Next, tell her how much u regret it, and u seek her forgiveness. Three items must be there: regret, apologies, and seek forgiveness.<br><br>Next, apologize to her friend, with the same things: 3 items and alcohol excuse.<br><br>Next, tell her that u feel bad towards her friend too and had apologized to her friend. Tell her u hope the 2 of them will remain as friends.<br><br>Next, tell her how much u love her, want to be together with her, and this incident make u realize u love her alot, and u want to make her ur official gf.<br><br>Stop being a wishy-washy and make a decisive action to get her.<br><br>Hopefully, she will be touched by these sincere gestures of yours.<br><br>OK good luck....Dont say I neber teach u......<br><br></div>

Like many says.. be drunk is not an excuse to run away from what you have done..<br><br>You are close yet so far.. You ruined your very one chance... If you are really true to her.. will you even flirt with her friend?? Yes.. partying is partying.. but there's a extend to it.. If you are only there to party with friends without her.. then you can go and flirt all you want! Noone cares.. But she's there.. She cares..<br><br>Right now.. is to let her cool down first.. You have to <strong>admit</strong> what you have done.. She lost trust in you already.. There's a probability that you have to start from scratch if you still wanna court her! There's no need to put blame on yourself.. Don't do things that will make you regret for life.. Think before you do.. Sometimes there's only one chance for you.. and if you let it slipped away.. You  lose it..<br><br>CHeers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
