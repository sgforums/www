It was a great outing... talk alot on our sec school antics and past relationships.<br><br>Anyways, there was this classmate of mine, (God forbid she browses thru these forums), who i've liked....or love rather since sec 2 but never had the guts nor balls to actually confessed to her.<br><br>After O levels i didnt contact her at all until that day itself. Its funny how after 3 years most of my classmates have changed so little and it was no exception for her. Still as lovely, beautiful and charismatic since i last saw her (its turning out to be some mushy love novel...i apologise)<br><br>Well after dinner me n her being the only smokers went out for a smoke(big surprise) and just talked.. and talked. Somehow between lighting up my 1st ciggarette and the moment i threw my 2nd cigg bud into the rubbish bin i felt like there was this connection between us.<br><br>Maybe its just me, or maybe its the breeze that night. But somehow, i feel like i'm still in love with her.  Truth be told shes attached to someone for 2 years already...and she did say they're quite stable. I guess maybe those 10 minutes alone with her was a form of closure for me...or it might just be my fantasy reliving the days when i crushed on her like mad.<br><br>I still think of her...

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi , I totally understand how you feel , I think you feeling is just that you have just saw her and the feeling is like when you are in , 3 years ago ... I used to have similar problems , but thinking back it is just an excitement that re-lighted your "feel" for her ...<br><br>Anyway , if you choose to pursue her , GOOD LUCK</div>
