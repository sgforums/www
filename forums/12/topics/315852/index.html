              <p>I'm so confused over what I should do now.. Me is 19 and my ex is 17..

              <p>However, I've found out that there are other reasons that she wanted to let go. First she cannot stand my attitude of dealing with problems and the habit of didn't really plan ahead. She prefer someone that will plan ahead of things. However, I've promised my best buddy whom i've known for 6 years and her that I would change and prove them wrong that I can infact change, which i'm trying now..</p>
              <p>And one more reason is that she had realised that a guy left a very good impression on her and can take care of her better than me and can plan ahead.. she intents to go steady with him soon and i believe it's somewhere this week..</p>
              <p>I tried to show that I've change by showing her care and concern and asking her is there any problems to share but what i'm getting is just cold responses from her.</p>
              <p>I intend to ask her how is she going to plan ahead to deal with her parents if she going to get a bf again and how is she going to plan for their responses since she said that her parents had consistently nagged at her that she shouldn't get a bf.</p>
              <p>I feel that the reason she gave me on her stressful parents is contradicting on what she's doing now.. like as if finding some excuses to hush me up for the time being..</p>

              <p>but i do suggest you try to improve on your bad habits.. i use to have and still having this habit of not planning ahead and handling problems.. this might jeopardise your future not only in your love life but also in other aspect.</p>
              <p>wish you well bro, concentrate in your fyp and leave some memories in your poly life before you start stepping into the working world.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">There are two parts to this:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I) You are right in saying that her reason
              for break up is merely a reason to diss you off. And if you haven't realize by
              now - any reason will suffice actually. After all, words are just words - the
              content isn't as important as the intention. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In the other side of this context: if a
              person genuinely wants to remain in a relationship, even for the wrong reason,
              she will stay. Nothing can make her leave if she is bends on remaining. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You cannot force Love upon another just because
              you desire it so - much more than the willingness for a person to be with you. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">II) If you are determined to change your
              flaws, it must be a revolution from within and not some feeble method to 'win
              her back'. The latter is often a short term measure to rebrand your identity,
              but since the core hardly changes, you will probably revert back once the
              'inflated initiative boost' wears off. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">People often talk, very superficially, about
              how they will change in name of Love, but I can tell you most merely end up
              diverting these negativities into other section of emotions or energy and not
              learning to resolve them through higher/spiritual understanding.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If your ability to evolve is largely depended
              on the existence of others and their approval, then you will lead a life where
              your growth is limited by the kind of people that live in your environment.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Sometimes in Love, one must learn to release before
              one can learn to walk forward. </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Cheers</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You cannot force Love upon
                  another just because you desire it so - much more than the
                  willingness for a person to be with you.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">II) If you are determined to
                  change your flaws, it must be a revolution from within and not some
                  feeble method to 'win her back'. The latter is often a short term
                  measure to rebrand your identity, but since the core hardly
                  changes, you will probably revert back once the 'inflated
                  initiative boost' wears off.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">People often talk, very
                  superficially, about how they will change in name of Love, but I
                  can tell you most merely end up diverting these negativities into
                  other section of emotions or energy and not learning to resolve
                  them through higher/spiritual understanding.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If your ability to evolve is
                  largely depended on the existence of others and their approval,
                  then you will lead a life where your growth is limited by the kind
                  of people that live in your environment.  </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Sometimes in Love, one must learn
                  to release before one can learn to walk forward.</span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
