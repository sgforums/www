              <p>Hi everyone, i'm new here. Been browsing this forum and i find that it a great place to have your problems heard, so well here's mine:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm 22 this year doing my ns and ORDing in Dec. I'm feeling really lost in regards to further education and i hope someone here can help me out.</p>
              <p>You see when i was in SEC 3 i got retained for a year, when i was in SEC 5 doing O lvls i was already 18. My result weren't bad i got 17 points for L1R4 but the thing is i fail my maths, got a D7 for it. Tried to get in to poly was a nearly impossible task as almost all of the courses required a pass in maths. So i was forced to retake that subject.</p>
              <p>On my 2nd attempt i got a C6, was quite happy until i got called up for ns, tried to get a deferment but they said i was to old and since i already defered once to retake my o lvl i could not defer again.</p>
              <p>I applied for poly while in NS and i got a place reserved in SP. But the thing is i will be 23 when i go into poly. My ultimate goal is to get a degree and if i go by the poly route then go NUS/NUT/SMU/SIM i will be like 29-30 by the time i graduate. Imagine starting an entry level job when you are nearing 30. And Bachelor degress are a dime a dozen this days, coupled with my age i will be at a disadvantage.</p>
              <p>So i did some surfing around and i found that SIM actually offer degree programmes to O level holders. Since i like computers and i have some experience in programming, i was thinking was taking the Bachelor in Com. Science by the University of Wollangong (Australia). And if eveything goes well i will only be 26 when i graduate, and can even maybe do a Masters programme at one of the local Uni.</p>
              <p>So my question is which is better Poly to Uni or just SIM straight-away, and have anyone heard of University of Wollangong? Will the degree be reconise in the private sector? Will any of the local Universities accept candidates for their Master degree programmes from SIM? Anyone from or have studied in SIM care to comment on the what life is like there?</p>
              <p>Thanks a Million in advance. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>i read in the papers regarding undergrad programmes just before CNY that employers may not want to hire candidates who obtained their degrees from programmes that are shorter or those that are of "express" programmes because of the lack of amount of knowledge and skills in the programme being taught to the student.</p>
              <p>like what Wai Leng mentioned, can you cope with the syllabus? In the end you may end up more time wasted in (touch wood) re-sitting for exams just like your "o" levels.</p>
              <p>My brother started his poly life after NS because he was an ITE student. He also went thru 5 years to "o" but did not do well and in the end he took the longer route. He attended poly class when he was 22/23.</p>
              <p>Instead of being slow in his studies now, he is taking a more positive attitude towards life and school because he learnt the hard way. Studying in the poly after NS is normal for guys and these people are actually top of the few in terms of grades because they are matured and they understand things better. With good grades in your diploma, there is also a better chance of getting into a better Uni, especially local Uni.</p>
              <p>Think about what you really want. A fast-track studies to no confidence in whether the degree is useful and a risk of repeating OR a steady course of studies that will take a longer time but at least you know at the end, you have a chance of pursuing a better course?</p>
