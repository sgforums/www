            <div class='col-md body'>hi all,<br><br>Its my first post and i'm sorry if i'm a trouble to anyone of you guyz and galz here...<br><br>Been together with my gal for about a year and a half now... had our share of laughter and quarrels... but its always the humouring her part that she always deem me a failure in... why is it that other guys know how to humour their gf and yet you don't know? why is it that after your previous relationships and yet you don't know what humouring a gal is all about?<br><br>Seriously i believe i do try too... but i feel its just not in my nature or genes... imo i always feel that sweet talking guyz are a$$ hxlez in my eyes... i dont mind talking with gentleness but when it comes to nice words, my brain is totally dry... for eg, during an outing, she was venting her frustrations at work at me, she nagged at me when i parked my car slightly further away from the lift area when plenty of nice empty slots are present, she slammed my door and waited outside, when i am done i tried to offer to take her stuff for her but she ignored me and simply walked off, i know it was raining outside the building and i rushed back to get the umbrella for her but when i returned she got angry with me instead that i didnt bother to humour her even though i know she's angry???? OMG it was only a few minutes and seriously in my mind i was trying to conceive my humour plan... do all gals think that humour plans comes like oxygen in the air??<br><br>other times when she's angry, i try to pick up a light topic, she seem to completely ignore me and reply in short words... yes... no... not sure... i do admit at times on phone conversation i tend to keep quiet especially when we quarrel... and i know she dont like it... but its not that i find it fun to do that... she just get flared up so easily... when we quarrel i prefer to keep my own cool and let she do all the verbal screaming she wants... imo when two quarrels, one side should always stay cool to allow true problem solving...<br><br>i really don't know... can anyone in this world tell me what is humouring a gal? how do i get the wu lin mi ji to learn this technique? why cant she understand that? is it a must for guys to know this? if you ask me if i had similar problems with my past relationships in this i will say no... simply because imo my ex gfs' so called expectations of a guy humouring a gal is a simple sorry, gentle, warm and teasing her with some cuddlings... is there really more to this?<br><br>at this very moment she's telling not to talk to her until i learn how to humour a gal... i feel i can do well in all exams as i used to but this is one paper i seriously have no confidence in...<br><br>Sorry if i took too much of your tme reading this, i really need some opening to talk it out...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear JustMy2Cents,<br><br>Sure, Nobody's perfect in this world.  That, I'm the 1st to agree...<br><br>However, there're limits to the above-mentioned.  And here, your gf appears to have overstepped beyond those limits.  Her behaviour is unreasonable, &amp; unless she knows about it, I'm afraid she'll continue to treat you the way she treats you.<br><br>Granted, you love her.  But if she loves you, she wouldn't be treating you like this, &amp; it seems she's treating you like this frequently.  You're displaying concern for her, yet she hasn't got her priorities right.  What in the world is going on?!<br><br>If she loves you, she would take care of your feelings.  And I'd know that, because I'm a woman.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by JuzMy2Cts:</div><div class="quote_body">in others' eyes she could be spoilt,<br><br>she aint perfect but who is perfect in this world...<br><br>since i chose her and i love her, and i waited for her for almost 2 years before we got together... i will love her for her good and bad no matter what...<br><br>i really want to learn assuming that i am really doing a bad job in terms of humouring her... thats why i'm here... as i believe you guyz will have experience and knowledge that i dont possess...<br><br>thanks for reading<br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are not wrong, and neither is your gf. It's just that you are not meeting her emotional needs. When she's angry, keeping your cool is good, but your keeping quiet is not the solution. She needs some words of support from you, although she's not necessarily asking you for a solution (so don't have to offer one all the time). That's why gfs are very good at this. Read 'Men are from Mars and Women are from Venus' - it's a good introduction to the different emotional needs of both.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

As you have learnt, this strategy is not good in a situation when you have an angry gf.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  I found this out by asking him (after a quarrel) - this communication helped to clear many hurdles! I learned that if I want more responses from my hubby, I may need to probe him more. He also learned to respond more, bec just keeping quiet is not acceptable or may make me feel as if he had not listened to what I'd said.<br><br>I think you need to explain to you gf about your difficulty, and that you didn't keep quiet on purpose, and say sorry - the magic word  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> . Again, communication is important, not just during courtship, but after marriage. I think it's great that you are sticking to your gf to work things out. Shows you really love her and treasure her to want to improve yourself. Cheers to you! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

As you have learnt, this strategy is not good in a situation when you have an angry gf.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  I found this out by asking him (after a quarrel) - this communication helped to clear many hurdles! I learned that if I want more responses from my hubby, I may need to probe him more. He also learned to respond more, bec just keeping quiet is not acceptable or may make me feel as if he had not listened to what I'd said.<br><br>I think you need to explain to you gf about your difficulty, and that you didn't keep quiet on purpose, and say sorry - the magic word  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> . Again, communication is important, not just during courtship, but after marriage. I think it's great that you are sticking to your gf to work things out. Shows you really love her and treasure her to want to improve yourself.

            <div class='col-md body'>smudgey,<br><br>sorry to hear you having similar probz...<br><br>well i guess we are standing on the opposite sides of the same river...<br><br>your guy may simply just be waiting for you to ask him... whereas your thinking is why can't you say it out yourself? For you, you will feel that if he doesnt say how would you know... but at times have you ever wonder that its really that your bf doesnt want to add on to any problems or frustrations already present? Its always two side of a mirror...<br><br>having said that perhaps its something that i need to realise too... i guess for a start i have to put myself in her shoes and think in her position... but still the biggest hurdle is getting myself confident of speaking the right, nice, warm, sweet words that she wants to hear... its something i cant learn overnight...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by JuzMy2Cts:</div><div class="quote_body">thanks wanda again,<br><br>just as what you said about your hubby... what would you actually want him to do at that time when you guys were quarrelling? at times when i try to humour my gf (i felt i was doing that but she may not see it so), her cold response seems like a big bucket of cold water splashed onto me and it makes me feel i am not doing it right and i stopped talking and doing the humouring all together.<br><br>Although we can say different peoples react differently, but on general what would you want your hubby to do then? if it happened on the line and not right besides you? i guess your hubby is a good model for me... because in your eyes he succeeded... </div></blockquote>Actually, we quarrelled only bec he did not respond to me when I asked him something that needed both our concurrence and which will affect our lifestyle. He kept quiet, bec he was afraid his answer would anger me, so dare not say it. On my part, I didn't understand why, as I needed to hear his views on this important issue, so I felt as if he didn't listened or consider my question important (ie. not meeting my emotional needs).<br><br>After that, I definitely didn't feel like talking to him anymore, and we went home in silence (so you must understand your gf's 'cold behaviour' during such situations). The other thing to understand is that - you may think you are humouring her, but in fact, it may not be what she is looking for or wants to hear, if the underlying issue (whatever it was that made her angry) is not resolved. So you get the cold water treatment from her, bec she cannot feel loving towards you at that moment (bec she's angry or feels you're not really listening, or don't understand her).<br><br>I can't generalise an appropriate response to your gf without knowing much, but my view is: if you have your reason or difficulty for not speaking up or for disagreeing with your gf, whatever it is, it's advisable to share with her your reasons and your thinking. Like what smudgey said, gals want to know what their bfs are feeling/thinking too. If you don't tell her, she doesn't understand your behaviour, and may start to think negative things about you and the r/s, and such negative feelings will build up in time if not resolved - not very healthy. So, what the experts say about the importance of communication is very true.<br><br>I can't say my husband has succeeded 100% coz he can still do things that make me go bersek, and I will complain or scold him, but he knows that after a while, I'll be ok (boh pian, have to forgive and forget  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ).  It really takes 2 hands to clap and I hope your gf, after hearing your side of the story, will learn to understand and accept you better.</div>
