If its short term, yeah anyone can give in to any kind of bad tempers and idiosycncracies. But do have some dignity and don't bend over backwards so much you snap which you would be even worse off before you had her.<br>I don't know if it can be termed love ... I suppose different people different strokes. As long as you're happy giving in to her and feel she is worth it. She should learn more grace. BTW, not all girls are like her.  In my opinion, you had humour her enough.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i admire you for your sentiments. and i envy your gf cos she has such an accomodating guy...<br><br>in my opinion, you dun have to learn sweet words or anything.. sometimes, a hug may do the trick.. if she's angry and ignoring your attempts to warm things up, just give her a hug. tell her sincerely that you are trying to make things right for her but you're needing her help to tell you how you can make her feel better...<br><br>and of cos, when she's in the loving mood again, you can now ask her for love in return. you cannot always be the one giving in. a r/s like that will only stretch patience and bitterness... when she's in a loving mood, then you can communicate to her, tell her you need to be humoured sometimes also... you need her to show she cares about your feelings also...<br><br>work things out. good luck.</div>

OMG it was only a few minutes and seriously in my mind i was trying to conceive my humour plan... do all gals think that humour plans comes like oxygen in the air??<br><br>other times when she's angry, i try to pick up a light topic, she seem to completely ignore me and reply in short words... yes... no... not sure... i do admit at times on phone conversation i tend to keep quiet especially when we quarrel... and i know she dont like it... but its not that i find it fun to do that... she just get flared up so easily... when we quarrel i prefer to keep my own cool and let she do all the verbal screaming she wants... imo when two quarrels, one side should always stay cool to allow true problem solving...<br><br>i really don't know... can anyone in this world tell me what is humouring a gal? how do i get the wu lin mi ji to learn this technique? why cant she understand that? is it a must for guys to know this? if you ask me if i had similar problems with my past relationships in this i will say no... simply because imo my ex gfs' so called expectations of a guy humouring a gal is a simple sorry, gentle, warm and teasing her with some cuddlings... is there really more to this?<br><br>at this very moment she's telling not to talk to her until i learn how to humour a gal... i feel i can do well in all exams as i used to but this is one paper i seriously have no confidence in...<br><br>Sorry if i took too much of your tme reading this, i really need some opening to talk it out...</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> To me, it's not so much about humouring your gf when she is in a bad mood; It's more about her attitude and her expectation of you. When she entered into a relationship with you, the kind of character she has readily accepted to be her boyfriend (I presumed there was a decent amount of time spent together before a BGR was born between you two), is something that she already knew. By requesting strongly something that is so unlike you, she is beginning to evolve you from different angles. This is a natural process of couple-ship for we subconsciously influence each other.<br>Somehow, her attempt is done based on self centric effect. All about 'I, Me and Myself.'<br><br>It's good to know how to handle your gf when she isn't particularly in a good mood, but there is a difference between bad mood and bad attitude. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Having a bad mood doesn't automatically produce bad attitude - such personality is innate.</strong></span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bro, this relationship of yours, aint gonna last too long, cos if it does, i'll eat my PC. The crucial element in all successful relationships is 1) Mutual respect 2) Trust 3) Retaining factors.... Allow me to explain, 1) Mutual respect is paramount in a relationship, cos it allows each other to have the latitude to live as unique individuals. In your situation, your gf wants things done her way all the time. She doesnt even have the scantiest respect for you. Put things simply, she doesnt love u, she loves herself, and she is trying to sculpt you into a reflection of herself, so she can get things done easily and faster. Still dont get me??? Basically, you're a fu*king maid, driver, Personal assistant, washing machine, whatever possible assistance you could render her. 2) Trust. If there's no trust, there will always be lingering suspicions of each other, always being cynical, being sceptical of his or her motives, intentions, even if they may be genuine. If thats the way things are going, do you think that relationship can withstand all future tribulations ? 3) Retaining factors.. One crucial and often underestimated factor of all successful relationship is RETAINING FACTORS. By that, i mean, WHATs in you, that he or she cannot get easily from others. For a guy, if he is earning a good salary, bless with a athletic body and great looks, then the gf will think twice about jeapordising the relationship. Ask yourself, do you have any or many retaining factors that puts you way and above most guys or potential competitors?? If not, then i guess she's just taking you as a temp..<br>Think over and good luck. Just remember, all that glitter aint gold</div>
