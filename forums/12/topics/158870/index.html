            <div class='col-md body'>lol, not that i need any advice, just want to ask opinions on how dreams can be so real n painful. i just woke up, from a dream. a dream that i wouldn't call a nightmare, but it was painful and weird in it's own way...<br><br>okie i will elaborate more on what i can rmb. mysteriously, i could not remember some key parts because when i recall the "story" doesn't seem to fit together. i feel like im teleported from places to places, scene to scene.<br><br>ok the first thing i rmb was i was in the car wif my dad. den halfway (if im not wrong, its the road of SG), he ask mi whether i wanted to know how to drive. so weirdly, i said yes. so in my dream (somehow), he managed to get the wheel to my side. i only controlled the wheel i think, den the pedal all these was still at his side. okie, this is a dream, it's not real. i mean, it's not possible in a car in reality. but lemme continue.<br><br>i remember the process of it quite well. my dad did not realli teach me anything. but more of, i remember times where i almost crashed into other cars, objects etc..i was feelign REALLI scared.<br><br>that wasn't the main point. somehow i was warped into another scene. this time i was in the same car with a girl. im not sure if im grown up. but i think i have not learnt how to drive yet in the car. so somehow we took turns to drive. i dun even remember what was the girls name. but i just rmb we had fun talking and feeling scared when the car was about to crash. the previous scene i was with my father on a road with im familair with, if im not wrong, it was the junction at bukit timah plaza. around there. but this time, im not sure if i rmb wrongly, but i rmb seeing farms...crops...and not much buildings around. then it started to rain..<br><br>im not sure about the rain, but i rmb things became gloomy from my perspective as the dream continue<br><br>okie then here comes the part of the dream which i could not remember.<br><br>i remember it was still raining, den i seperated from that girl and this time i was on a bicycle. in some condo lobby or something. i rmbed that i was searching for the girl or something. actualli i don't know, because this precious part of my dream was ripped off from my memory when i woke up. i felt cheated. then i remember i was cycling cyling. up and down stairs. (wah i became pro in my dream i din even noe). den i fell down due to the slippery rain but did not feel any pain (it's a dream mah..). i rmb clearly the watery steps, being flooded. and i lay there, with my bruises. and i desperately took out my handphone. even in my dream my hp is the same as in real life, dats strange. coz i rmb my hp being damaged and the bottom part became abit dislocated. cant describe here.<br><br>then i "woke up" again. this time i was in my house. yes, my actual house. den my first reaction was to find my hp and call that girl. somehow i had her number. i called, then i was frantically trying to rmb her name when the person asked me who i was looking for. i tried very hard  to rmb (but the actual fact is, i din even know in the first place). so i asked something like, " does this household haf a daughter " or something like that....<br><br>den i rmb my aunt telling me, " i think there was someone who keep calling you while you were asleep the past 2 yrs ".....i wasn't shocked. den suddenly the fone rung in my dream and all of a sudden, the dream ended and i woke up.<br><br>i woke up, in tears. i dun know why. i felt like ive been part of a drama. but the sad fact is i don't remember how i seperated with the girl. i don't even know what happened. right now im itching to know what happened..., and worst still, despite not remembering her face, her name and everything. right now, i the person i miss the most is the person i don't even know.....and i cant believe it's someone from my dream. im 100% sure it's not someone i know in real life, it's a person introduced in my dream.<br><br>i don't even know why im typing this. it's still early and i just woke up. i felt so sorrowful that i had to type this out. does continuation of dreams exist? if so i wud like to go bac into this dream again tonight. but any1 experienced that b4? sry if this topic was kinda lame</div>

(wah i became pro in my dream i din even noe). den i fell down due to the slippery rain but did not feel any pain (it's a dream mah..). i rmb clearly the watery steps, being flooded. and i lay there, with my bruises. and i desperately took out my handphone. even in my dream my hp is the same as in real life, dats strange. coz i rmb my hp being damaged and the bottom part became abit dislocated. cant describe here.<br><br>then i "woke up" again. this time i was in my house. yes, my actual house. den my first reaction was to find my hp and call that girl. somehow i had her number. i called, then i was frantically trying to rmb her name when the person asked me who i was looking for. i tried very hard  to rmb (but the actual fact is, i din even know in the first place). so i asked something like, " does this household haf a daughter " or something like that....<br><br>den i rmb my aunt telling me, " i think there was someone who keep calling you while you were asleep the past 2 yrs ".....i wasn't shocked. den suddenly the fone rung in my dream and all of a sudden, the dream ended and i woke up.<br><br>i woke up, in tears. i dun know why. i felt like ive been part of a drama. but the sad fact is i don't remember how i seperated with the girl. i don't even know what happened. right now im itching to know what happened..., and worst still, despite not remembering her face, her name and everything. right now, i the person i miss the most is the person i don't even know.....and i cant believe it's someone from my dream. im 100% sure it's not someone i know in real life, it's a person introduced in my dream.<br><br>i don't even know why im typing this. it's still early and i just woke up. i felt so sorrowful that i had to type this out. does continuation of dreams exist? if so i wud like to go bac into this dream again tonight. but any1 experienced that b4? sry if this topic was kinda lame</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Dreams are divided into three possibilities:<br><br>I) Predictive<br><br>II) Ri you suo si, ye you suo mong (Your dream is actually a weird story plot made from what you saw, thoughts that came and feelings that flow that day)<br><br>III) Your subconscious mind is trying to tell your conscious mind something.<br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If it belongs to (III) and have anything to do with Love:<br><br>You may not have any relationship before or if have, probably one bad past experience that causes you to (1) learn lots, (2) left bitter/regretful memories?<br><br>The scene with your dad speaks about a certain past you have went through or experience. Your dad represented the past. The car represented a relationship (may not be BGR, may be a crush, friendship, whatever). Driving represented a certain time frame during that relationship/phrase. The fear while driving represented a bad experience that time. It was an hidden fear, not projected out, but likely to be felt inside.<br><br>The scene with the unknown girl represented a love interest that you are likely not in a relationship with her or she belong to the category of regrets. The crash represented some kind of catalysis or climax that took place and changes the relationship/situation between you and her. Chances are, it is something that had happened to you in the past OR it is due to a kind of personality/inexperience nature in you that existed all along - something that you know you are lacking in.<br><br>You see torrent of rain in your dreams. It represented emotions. Your attempt to find her and cycling the stairs represented a certain challenge/difficult faced. Apparantly, the difficulty overwhelmed you and you seemed helpless. (Represented by a spoilt mobile). You felt no pain physically because this wound is likely to be emotional in nature. Emotional wounds have no marking and would not claim your life, but because you are lying on the ground, you know that you are injured somehow and needed some form of rescue.<br><br>When you have woken up, your phone represented Enlightenment. You have the girl's number because she is part of your enlightenment. Your inability to recall the girl's name represented Uncertainty. The woman that picked your call represented your current situation and Uncertainty hinders your way to the future. When your aunt told you that someone has been calling youÂ… it is knowledge of something new, something that you never knew... but now you do. That's why when the phone ring, your dream stopped - having all this new found information, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>what are you going to do?</strong></span><br><br>If I hit the nail, I think this may resemble closely to what had happened in reality. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
