              <p>Are u sayin that if she don't go, your relationship will be guarantee success? Both of you will have a happily ever after and tons of offsprings IF she forgo overseas stint?</p>
              <p>Are you sayin , you cannot settle down if she goes for 2 years ? Have you proposed to her already?  </p>
              <p>You haven't even given her shitz reason to stay.. yet you are expecting her to give up her future for you? </p>
              <p>If one day your company want to promote you and make you CEO but post you overseas for 1-2 years .. you'd ask to end your relationship? </p>

              <p>Lets be brutally honest here mr.</p>
              <p>I doubt it's the timing, but rather you didn't like the idea she's given better opportunity than you.</p>
              <p>Your male ego is making it hard for you to deal with the fact that she may become more successful than you'll ever be.</p>
              <p>If you are so pessimistic about this relationship, why don't you just quit your job and follow her oversea ? But... your male ego ain't gonna allow that , no ?</p>
              <p>There are many relationships/marriages that survived overseas postings. People who knows who their loyalty lies and are accountable for their own actions, typically will not end up with a broken relationship.</p>
              <p>If you have no confidence anyway.. it wouldn't matter where she goes.. rather its a matter of time .</p>

              <p>I recommend that instead of you letting your male ego think for you.</p>
              <p>It's better for yourself and your relationship to be SUPPORTIVE of your girlfriend.</p>
              <p>Everyone is attracted to positive minds. Such person are the ones you want to weather life's up and downs with.</p>
              <p>A wet blanket is a downer.. negativity will suck the life juice out of anyone living too close to a pessimistic person.</p>
              <p>You can choose to be her sunshine or the black hole.</p>
              <p>Either you give her the support she needs , find ways and means to keep the relationship strong...</p>
              <p>Or you can keep making her feel guilty about taking that oversea posting.. so you can feel like a man when she cave under pressure... just so she can prove her undying love for you.</p>

              <p>hey jojo, thanks for the input.</p>
              <p>it's rather long, so i'm not sure where to start to reply to you but there are some that makes sense and some that don't.</p>
              <p>I defintiely dnt have any male ego involved in this, it's really just being unsettled knowing that there are so many relationships that failed cause of this (apart from what you said tht there are many which did work out), maybe I'm just too afraid to let go.</p>
              <p>maybe i'm just thinking too far, at the end of the day, it's the part of us not getting any younger that brings it down. We would want a healthy baby if we end up together but aft 2 yrs, she'll be at risk due to her age.</p>
              <p>if only we are much younger, then i got no problems at all :(</p>

              Ah I see......yeah there are international schools overthere for early childhood and above. My niece study in an international school in Thailand. Well, she may look at it as a place to gain experience and using it for her career advancement later....ah nothing to worry bro...she will see Singapore still as her home. I thought she was going to be posted to Australia, the U.S. or Canada....if that should be the case...she might migrate there perhaps...with you that is.
