            <div class='col-md body'>Wat will be will be...things can get beta later or sooner...separation maybe a good breathing air for both to do some soul searching. If someone meant to be beta for her..then there is nothing you can do.. i can only say that if the love is strong, no matter wat distance or time, both will be eventually together. Meanwhile, enrich yourself to be a beta person n live happily while u still have the privilege of being single. hehe Let fate decide all.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
