              <p>Don't waste your time over anyone who makes you feel that they still likes you but didn't make the choice to be together with you.</p>
              <p>When we like a guy, we really like a guy enough to go through all odds to be together with him.</p>
              <p>When we do something like this to you, it means we're showing kindness to you and don't want to hurt your feelings.</p>
              <p>3 years together and yet you are unable to keep her by your side, that's really very useless of you ok?</p>
              <p>Remember this statement above, cos that's me showing kindness to you ok?</p>

              <p>Since she has chose another guy, it is time for you to move on as well.</p>
              <p>There is no point in lingering over the past - It is possible that she may return back to you in time to come, but you will never be able to know for sure. Thus, rather than wasting your own time waiting, try to get over her, and put your focus on other stuffs in your life. </p>
              <p>As a side note, if she really feels that you are not spending enough time with her, she could have voice it out, but she didn't. That makes one wonder if this is really a valid reason, or rather, the true reason, for her to leave you.</p>

              <p>For the past couple of years, you have had your chances. But you blew it.</p>
              <p>Now you regret because you realised you are not the only dick around that can satisfy her.</p>
              <p>Move on dude.</p>
              <p>This is a difficult lesson to learn.</p>

              <p><br>my opinion will be to give your last shot, no harm. apologise wholehartedly to her that you have negleted her n u actually still luv her. she might be going out with another guy to spite u s u have not showered her enough attention.</p>
              <p>if she says that she has no longer any feelings for you, then u should juz forget about this relationship and move on with life.</p>
              <p>p/s: sumtimes it juz takes for a breakup to realise how important the special one is to you and how you might have neglected her/him </p>

              <p>You dont miss her = what you miss is her appreciation and what she says about u. It that is what it is all about - then know this lah - it is not love and it was never love.</p>
              <p>Beggarly love has nothing to offer excepting exploiting each other (trading is more apt)  to no end till one or the other feels stifled and the one who knows may reconcile and communicate; the one that is ignorant to what is happening within oneself - would escape and find ways and means to escape the bondage of relationship!</p>
