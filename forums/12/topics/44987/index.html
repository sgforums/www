Dun self mutilate yourself! Its the worst thing u can ever do at times like this.<br><br>Sometimes when you have depression and you turn to your friends and family to help you, you may not always get the results you want. I think that your boyfriend does care about you but there are things that are preventing him from comforting you in your time of need. For one, since he does care for you so much, he probably is very concerned for you and may not really know what the best thing he can do to help you out is. Therefore, instead of trying to help you and making the problem worse, he is trying to ignore the situation and run from it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>People tend to run from situations that scare them or that they feel they have no control over. Try not to be so hard on your boyfriend but  don't feel so bad because you do. Being frustrated with him and feeling as if he doesn't care is a way for you to express your feelings. While it may not be the best way to go about releasing your anger, I think when you do that, you're thinking about what is going in your life. I think it's important to continue opening up to your boyfriend but if he doesn't give you the answers you want, you need to count on other people to help you, like your parents, friends or other relatives.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I suggest you approach your parents and tell them that you want to try going to a counselor so you can discover what is causing you to be so depressed. The main thing I want you to realize is that people care about you so don't think that because they don't tell you exactly what you want to hear, they don't care. Take care of yourself and take one day at a time, you can get through this. You are in my prayers dear... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Cheers and Take Care<br></div>

People inflicting pain and wound on themselves during certain painful or extreme periods ain't really an uncommon thing (though it's not really a normal right thing to do)...<br><br>One of the prelimenary way of handling it is to learn to LOVE YOURSELF and YOUR BODY. People often take for granted the things they have around them, and that doesn't exclude their own body. What you're doing is probably an indirect 'control balance' act. Just like some people like to go for runs/ jogs or play computer games to vend their anger or frustrations, there're others who like to inflict pain or physical damage on themselves or others.<br><br>1st of all, you've got to understand that it ain't gonna help anything if you inflict injury on yourself. Things won't change for the better. In fact, chances are they might even get worse to complicate things... You might also realise that your act is almost like a sunconscious one. You might be inflicting pain (you probably might not even feel the pain) like it's the 'only right thing to do'.... What you can do in the future when such occasions are to occur (or about to occur) is to AVOID and stay away from any objects or ideas that can be used to harm yourself. Do NOT focus on those thoughts. Prepare beforehand some activities which you can perform beforehand and save them to be done ONLY at those moments. You can try shopping, swimming or running etc.. Whatever works for you... If your 'control' does not permits you to have an ORGANISED ACTIVITY carried out, you can always resort to yelling out like (try not to do this in the public?), you can bang things or twist &amp; tear paper... If you can't feel the 'release', try tearing thicker layers of paper or damaging more robust objects (unimportant ones...)....<br><br>Meanwhile, I think you should still go for the PROFESSIONAL ADVICE.... Can always come back to us when you feel a need to? I'll gladly help you...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Oh yeah... Try talking to more people about your people... Though they might not be able to provide you with the proper solutions (you might not even wanna ask for advices..?), it'll probably still help...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>~Good luck <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"></div>

Stay close with pple who can make you happy, not neccessarily frenz, it can be a stranger, like an old ah-ma whom you see daily picking up cans for livelihood but she can still maintain her smile everyday in her life though life has been harsh on her. Learn to see that there are far more pple in this world who have BETTER reasons to go into depression but they did not.<br><br>Keep talking to pple to divert your attention on your stuffs. Example, visit Aunt Agony often (Devil, remember to pay me advertisment fee <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> ), try to help these pple solve their problems by lending a hand.
