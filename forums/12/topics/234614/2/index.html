I just feel sad that she, is behavin that way. A gal like her could have better days ahead if only she forget him.<br><br>and yea.. i admit i got feelings for her. However, i'm not gonna anything till she forget about this but it just feel so painful lookin at her behaving like that. Being depress all that.<br><br>To make things worse, we are undergoing our attachment and our exams are coming in 2 weeks time so got some exams stress here.<br><br>So any suggestion on how i can help?</div></blockquote>My suggestion do not waste your time on this gal.<br>I know is tough but is for the best, studies is more important.<br><br>Studies = better result  = better work = more $$.<br><br>Is a phase that all of us had gone through.<br><br>I was like you, hope and wish that the things I do will touch the girl I like,<br>but in the end is just a total waste of time.<br><br>Sadly to say the girl will just find another guy and fall in love with him instead.<br>So why bother to put in so much effort? If she loves you she will not treat you this way.. no point hoping that she could laugh or smile cos you will nv be able to make her feel that. I learn it the hard way, so is up to you learn it now.</div>
