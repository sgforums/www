              <p>If you hit your late 20s you will realise that friendship serve very little purpose.</p>
              <p>Here is one case: I have a friend who I know for 20 years. We grew up together go to same school and went study overseas together. 7 years ago when he wanted to commit suicide because his ex left him, I was there for him to be a friend. Now he found a new gf and remarried. But he never invited me to his wedding. Worse still, last week was his birthday, I text him happy birthday, but he never reply nor acknowledge my reply. One day I saw him, I ask him why he didn't reply me, he say he was "lazy". Rude and arrogant of him isn't it? So what is value of friendship?</p>
              <p>After that incident and many others, I learn to be more self centred and don't care anymore about other people.</p>

              <p>All i can say is your friend is a bastard and also self-centered like you but he was self-centered earlier than you perhaps. Maybe he did not treat you like a close friend but to you he was a close friend? I think to me girlfriend better ba. Family and friends when they busy with Ns, school, work, then they also heck care you de. At least girlfriend even though busy with this still will find you when she is free. Can depend on her presence more than other ba. For me i think is like that la. I mean everyone has different friends, family, g/bf.</p>

              <p>Money and friends is 2 different things. How can you compare? If you had all the money in the world and no friends. You will be sian also what. Don't tell me money can make friends or what. Those are not true friends lor. It hard to believe that so many people have lousy friends. Frankly i'm not sure what defines a good friend too. </p>

              <p>All i can say is your friend is a bastard and also self-centered like you but he was self-centered earlier than you perhaps. Maybe he did not treat you like a close friend but to you he was a close friend? I think to me girlfriend better ba. Family and friends when they busy with Ns, school, work, then they also heck care you de. At least girlfriend even though busy with this still will find you when she is free. Can depend on her presence more than other ba. For me i think is like that la. I mean everyone has different friends, family, g/bf.</p>

              <p><br>Selfish person I am - Yes, But Bastard, I am definitely not. I care more about my family that is why blood is thicker than water. This so-called friend of mine, he also got his own family problems, he not get along with his elder brother. He also hate his father but he only love his mother.</p>
              <p>Nowadays got all sort of people but most common is the selfish bastard like the fren i mention. He was a close friend (we used to go bintan island and malaysia for jungle adventure together) until his wife change him. His wife is a loner and she is very protective of him. She even force him to move out the home he share with his mother to move in with her. He don't keep in touch nevermind - he never invite me for his wedding not good, I feel insulted. We fren for 20 years, I know his whole family.</p>

              <p>haha i didn't call you a bastard, don't be mistaken. I say your friend is a bastard (fullstop) and also self-centered like you. The bastard part for your friend only, and the self-centered is you and your friend. Sorry i didn't type properly lol. </p>
              <p>Look. I have problems with my brother also. We don't talk at home. He is so called in a rebellious state since he is like 17. I have no father cuz divorced le. So i can only love my mother. My gf is very sticky and clings to me when she is free. I go out with her and my friends. So there is similarities with him and me but i don't behave like that. Guys who behave like your friend is those that let the gf or wife tell him what to do. My gf don't do that and i definitely will ask her to stfu if she ever try. Friends for 20 years. Yeah your friend is a fucker. If i were you i will straight up tell him that. Friends for 20 years and give you this shit because of your wife. Wife important la but doesn't mean friend not important ma. Never mind la this kind of friend don't want also better.</p>
