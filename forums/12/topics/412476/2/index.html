              <p><br>I hate MLM buggers. So many time. I get call out to meet them for drink. Thot they want to chit chat. Suddenly after 10 min of "how r you", start promoting their product. I surely not interested, after that you see whether they bother to call you.</p>
              <p>There this fren I say la. He last time sell financial product. He quit his great job at oil co MNC to sell financial product. When I don't buy, he treat me like this. He very angry at frens like me because after he quit for 3 year his financial planning business never got off ground. Then recently he force to find employment. He got back same job with oil co MNC and then he oso got married. Now he so arrogant never invite me for his wedding. I ask him why, he say lazy.</p>
              <p>But nevermind, I now life better life than him. I try to live honest and treat people as I treat myself, I not like him one. I move on. I believe life got karma, treat people rudely and badly bad karma will kena the person. But I wish him all the best and I carry on me own life.  </p>

              <p>Ultimate motivation for frenship is $$$$$$. You no $$$$ nobody want to be fren.</p>
              <p>Important thing in life is enjoy life don't bother other people. Find life partner, get married-start family, excel at work and take care of old parents. Find allies you can ally with. Nobody want to fren, unless you hv politic power and influence. True fren is a Myth. Mythbuster proof Myth of true fren is busted.</p>

              <p>i'm closer to my grandparents even though i dont tell them much cos of language barrier. cos they don't demand and demand things.</p>

              <p>sometimes not true. i duno i like my family anot, cos they always duno how to read me...den pester me, make me mad, or say bad things about me. i'm not the only one in my family tree tht feels this way, so it's not a 'me' problem but a 'they' problem. sometimes make me wonder if can trust anybody in this world if i cannot trust my family. and when i say 'family', i mean the extended family tree like my parents' siblings and their families...idk. olden times humans easier to handle. they more simple, and dn't have that i-wanna-win-and-you-go-die attitude.</p>
              <p>i'm closer to my grandparents even though i dont tell them much cos of language barrier. cos they don't demand and demand things.</p>
              <p>friends...i long learned not to trust too much...or put too much heart into it...but..when they leave...i still hurt...very bad.</p>

              <p>true. see those 'foreign talents' on the arms of ugly fat white men, and yet they have families back home. to think that they get money off these men to send back home to their families when they are betraying their families....it makes me disgusted!</p>
