            <div class='col-md body'>I never thought I would be posting here again. Anyway, I just needed an outlet to talk about my current quandary.<br><br>I knew X for about a year or so since she came to Uni, but we haven't really talked until about 6 months ago. She just broke up then and went through a load of crap as her ex cheated her and subjected her to some kind psychological abuse that resulted in her depression. She got it treated already and so she's better now.<br><br>So yea, we began talking and apparently yeah, for some reason unknown to me, we can click. Btw, she's apparently the belle of her faculty. Thus so, she has plenty of admirers who went after her after learning of her newly single status.<br><br>Anyway, fast forward abit. We continued talking and hanging out occasionally. Just about 2 months back before the exams, I became her study buddy and we studied together till the wee hours of the morning. And during the study breaks, we began talking about ourselves and you know the usual clinche crap about guys and girls. So things went like that for a while and we conduct our 3 hour phone conversation when she's not in hall.<br><br>Right now, I realised that all this while, I love her, I truly do. And when she said that night I deserve a better girl. I just told her that it's not for her to decide who's better. I miss her, she's in Korea now.<br><br>I asked if she likes me and she said she has good feelings for me. Could someone tell me what exactly this means?</div>

Anyway, I just needed an outlet to talk about my current quandary.<br><br>I knew X for about a year or so since she came to Uni, but we haven't really talked until about 6 months ago. She just broke up then and went through a load of crap as her ex cheated her and subjected her to some kind psychological abuse that resulted in her depression. She got it treated already and so she's better now.<br><br>So yea, we began talking and apparently yeah, for some reason unknown to me, we can click. Btw, she's apparently the belle of her faculty. Thus so, she has plenty of admirers who went after her after learning of her newly single status.<br><br>Anyway, fast forward abit. We continued talking and hanging out occasionally. Just about 2 months back before the exams, I became her study buddy and we studied together till the wee hours of the morning. And during the study breaks, we began talking about ourselves and you know the usual clinche crap about guys and girls. So things went like that for a while and we conduct our 3 hour phone conversation when she's not in hall.<br><br>Right now, I realised that all this while, I love her, I truly do. And when she said that night I deserve a better girl. I just told her that it's not for her to decide who's better. I miss her, she's in Korea now.<br><br>I asked if she likes me and she said she has good feelings for me. Could someone tell me what exactly this means?</div></blockquote>Hi Miso,<br><br>Just dun act rash....take things slowly. To me, a good gf is someone who's also a buddy/chummy, and someone both of you can confide in, enjoy the course of life together.<br><br>Do not say stupid things that do not have the chance to clear up or cause misunderstanding, like "you deserve better" type of bullcrap. 'Better' or not, it's up to you to make it happen, ok.<br><br>Ask yourself these qns:<br><br>1. If she's still with her bf, will you still be her friend? If the answer is 'Yes', then be her friend and support her all the way. No other motives. From there, see how you can develop the relationship further. Since you claim that you two can click, you know she's receptive of you as her FRIEND. Do not try to tarnish this short 6 mth relationship until both of you are ready. Guys always ready one la, but is she?<br><br>2. Are you gallant enough to give her the freedom to meet other people if you two were together? Both of you are at the peak of the social circle game and i s she ready to commit into a relationship. Will it be an open relationship or exclusive? Are you possessive? Do you feel jealous if you see her talking with another guy/s?<br><br>I dunno you but as a generic statement, be mature and show that you are mature to be a good friend, to her and her friends.<br><br>3. Will you be another a**hole like her ex? reference to point 2, both of you are young and she just got out of a crappy relationship, what makes you so special that would allow her to jump straight into another relationship with you?<br><br>Since you said she's the belle of the class, I think her ex probably felt threaten the same way. What about you? Do you feel threaten as a friend/ bf when she has so many admirers?<br><br>Gals are not guys and even some guys take forever to mentally remove the ex from their radar...<br><br>I think at this time, it's better to be non-committal until you are sure of yourself and her of herself. Meanwhile, just enjoy the company and offer her your support generously without other agenda. Meet more people too. Enlarge your social circles and bring her along.<br><br>Possession is bitter...allegiance is sweet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TS,<br><br>Put yourself in her shoes. If you were her, there's a chance you might be thinking like this:<br><br>I have just gotten out of a relationship, which I have invested love and energy in, and have gained nothing but lots of hurt.<br><br>There's this guy (you of course!) who is nice, caring and is a great friend, and I feel very comfortable with him. In comparison, all the other guys seem pretentious, snobbish, and know-it-all.<br><br>I like him, but I am currently afraid to get into a relationship again, with all the bad memories, with lots to to lose. Status quo is great, we're great friends, and I don't want to lose him as a friend, it would be one of my regrets if I did.<br><br>He likes me too, and I am grateful for it, but I am really not ready. In fact, I am afraid he's going to push me, and our great friendship would be ruined. I need more time, to let my feelings stabilise.<br><br>Perhaps I am being selfish, because he seem to want a girlfriend, with all that intimate stuff, and he's waiting for me, but since I am not ready, maybe I shouldn't keep him waiting, however much I like him.<br>Therefore I told him weeks ago he deserved a better girl...<br><br>But I hope he can give me more time, but is it selfish to ask him to wait, at my convenience and at his expense?<br><br>Time will tell.<br><br>Hey, pal, hope that helps in clarifying your thinking.<br><br></div>
