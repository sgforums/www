            <div class='col-md body'>lol, i hate this kinda neither here nor there situation like hell la. she's some sorta scared of a r/s i think, that's why she said you deserve better. she probably just wants you as a good buddy to stay by her when she's hurt. girls need that most of the time cause they very vulnerable at that time. getting close and seeing, hearing her may mean so much to you, cause you like her.but it probably just appears to her that you're an ultimate good buddy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

She say she got good feeling for you may meant to FU YAn ni ma. Only ask you to test where u stand in her heart also dun want to try. Then u go ahead and invest all ur time in her lo. If u fail then dun cry.</div></blockquote>This idiot dumb? or are you retarded cloud?<br><br>Dont give advice please phuck off.<br><br>Anyway, well i feel that you should tell her that you really love her. Then tell her that you will give her 1 week to think through. During the one week dont see her at all. If she really miss you or something means she likes you lor. Yeah</div>

And when a man has special feelings for someone, he gets jealous when the girl gets too close to another man."<br><br>Any girl who is intelligent enough will understand this loud and clear.<br>If she gets angry, it's a red flag. She might just want to have the cake and eat it too.<br><br>I suggest you get a overseas calling card and dial to a land line.<br>Or you can research Voice Over Internet options.<br>Or you can use computer to computer voice chats which is free.<br><br></div>
