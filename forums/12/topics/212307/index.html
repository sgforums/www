Otherwise you won't be with her all these while.<br><br>I don't know what caused you or lead you to think about the negative things about yourself - perhaps you are insecure about something ?<br><br>Start from simple things eg: placing orders.  Offer to place orders and she will appreciate it, anyway its expected of guys to order.  Nothing to worry about, just say what you want and thats it....even if you take a while to say what you actually want, its alright cos you are the customer mah.

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe your real problem lies with a lower level of self-esteem. You tend to focus on your shortcomings than appreciate your own strengths. This inevitably causes a corresponding lower level of confidence. Try not to compare yourself with others. Create achievable goals in your mind and learn to appreciate and reward yourself everytime you succeed in acieving your goals. With time, you could hopefully see yourself and the world in a different light...........  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> If all else fails, go see a youth counsellor or psychiatrist.........  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Everytime I'm with my GF, my friend would tell me that I act more like the girl while my GF is the guy.<br><br>She is normally the one who place our orders when we eat out. I am also not confidence when it comes to speaking. For example, when a stranger asks me for direction, she would be the one answering for me. I think the main reason is because I'm afraid I might say the wrong things everytime.<br><br>Also, sometimes when we are shopping and we pass by a mirror, I would sometimes try not to look into it as I'm afraid that I'll see myself to be ugly.
