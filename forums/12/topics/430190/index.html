              <p>So.. I'm 17. i met this guy about 3months back. He's 19. We initially started off as friends but as time passed we starting growing closer. (Like super close, everyday will talk no matter what, goodnight smses etcetc) I went out with him afew times(as a friend la) and he hugged me and gave me those fuzzy feeling. So naturally i started to like him la. He isn't as financially stable as me and you could say that his education is ok lor. So afew days back, i finally mustered some courage and asked him. What i got was, ''I have this special feeling, but somehow i feel a barrier.'' and '' Even if you're not my gf, we will still be best friends.''</p>
              <p>I know, normally when a guy isnt financially stable or has better education then a girl, they develop some kind of inferiority complex(of some sort). But you know, if i went for looks or money i wouldnt even be here asking this question liao. So.. What should i do?</p>
              <p>*edit*</p>
              <p>He has told me he liked me before, so i dont think its one sided ba.</p>

              <p>Let me give some more info.. He mentioned that a week back he started to think alot about us, and given his situation(financial/education/no future blahblah), felt that its the best to stay as friends. He's been hanging out with me alot, be it online or offline, so i dont think he has another girl in mind ba..</p>
              <p>For now, i just want to know what to do. Should i move away? Should i stay and wait? We have so much in common and i really do not want to lose him. I think he might think that he isnt good enough for me, but honestly, i dont care about stuff like this. He might sound bad by the way i phrase my words, but he really isnt.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">i have this special feeling - this is good. Special feeling, in other words, he does not have this kind of feeling with anyone else before. He only feels this way when he's with you. If you are just plainly his friend, the feeling aint going to be special right?</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">somehow i feel a barrier - i suppose this barrier is referring to his financial status, education as opposed to yours. Barriers as such only exist when a party feels inferior/superior to another party. In this case, you can make it clear to him that it does not matter to you. However, you will have to be careful not to hurt his ego in the process of doing that. Tell him, seriously, you don't give a damn about this. That is if his 'barrier' is referring to financial status, education etc..</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Even if you're not my gf, we will still be best friends - I don't like this sentence. Don't we find this familiar? It is like another way of saying you are just not my type, let's not cross over the best friend's line. Well i might be wrong..</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">My advice to you is to open your eyes bigger and observe. You might just be on his hook. Yea, wait for him to open up a little, perhaps he is still deciding, don't want to commit, yet don't want to end it.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Personally i don't feel very positive about this one.</p>

              <p>So.. I'm 17. i met this guy about 3months back. He's 19. We initially started off as friends but as time passed we starting growing closer. (Like super close, everyday will talk no matter what, goodnight smses etcetc) I went out with him afew times(as a friend la) and he hugged me and gave me those fuzzy feeling. So naturally i started to like him la. He isn't as financially stable as me and you could say that his education is ok lor. So afew days back, i finally mustered some courage and asked him. What i got was, ''I have this special feeling, but somehow i feel a barrier.'' and '' Even if you're not my gf, we will still be best friends.''</p>
              <p>I know, normally when a guy isnt financially stable or has better education then a girl, they develop some kind of inferiority complex(of some sort). But you know, if i went for looks or money i wouldnt even be here asking this question liao. So.. What should i do?</p>

              <p>He has told me he liked me before, so i dont think its one sided ba.</p>

              <p>You asked, so he answered. As best he could. A bit unsure, a bit trying to impress you.</p>
              <p>Don't mind that too much, its just at the begining stages. With time the bonding will develop or falter.</p>
              <p>Just wait and see.</p>
              <p>If you think negatively, then you will look out for such proof, and the relationship will surely fail. Just don't think about it anymore.</p>
              <p>Go on as if you never asked.</p>
