You are content with the options already laid out for you definitely of the "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." frame of mind. You tend to be a follower rather than a leader, but that's fine because all good leaders must first be good followers. You tend to follow the crowds living life the tried and true way, often letting others make the decisions. Just don't forget you have a mind too. Never be afraid to voice your ideas or opinions, no matter how ridiculous others may think they are. This beaten path is your comfort zone, you want and deserve company on your travels trough life as you are probably a very friendly and kind individual, always putting the needs of others before your own. That's an excellent and all too rare quality. Never lose it. But being surrounded isn't always the best. People tend to try and take charge and advantage of the fact and if you aren't careful, it'll be your life that's been taken over. Venture away from your well-traveled road and find your own away. Head down that road less-traveled and see what's there because though the path you're on may have been done before, that doesn't necessarily make it the right one for you. Step out of your comfort zone and take some risks you wouldn't normally take, make mistakes, and make some time for just you. Indulge and be a little selfish. You'll come out all the better for it.<br></div>

You are a go-with-flow sort of person and little gets to you. Why? Because it's all good, right? They say the path of least resistance is a straight line and that's where you go, ever forward and never looking back. It's good to keep the past behind you, a quality far too little people have these days. You know the past is the past, but don't let yourself forget it. You can't learn from your mistakes if you don't remember them. You're probably loved for your laid-back frame of mind and easy-going qualities , but you tend take the easy way out in life and verge on lazy. Great character is found through great challenges. You most likely have the abilities in you to succeed and over-come what life throws at you. You just got get up and face that challenge. You tend to lose your head in bad situations because you aren't used to them. And by the time you've found the easiest way to master a problem, you could've already taken care of it. Bad things happen, difficult situations come up, that's life. What matters is that you rise to face those challenges and you can do it. Never lose your laid-back qualities as they will help you greatly. Just step onto that hard road every once in awhile and you'll discover that with each stretch it becomes easier and easier to over-come life's hurdles.<br></div>
