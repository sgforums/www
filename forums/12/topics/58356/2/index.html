I know what you mean cos I went through it once. But somewat like Red Ruby said, there must be one you have a stronger feeling for. I knew one of them for almost 8 years and another for 6 years, went through ups &amp; downs. It's hard to say who you love more, but who can you picture living the rest of your life with. Also once a choice is made, u've to gear up your willpower to let go of the other one.  </div></blockquote>Picturing the one that can spend the rest of the life with.... Hmmm... was kinda good.... until the point came when both fit as much.  I admit, such comparitive equilibrium is so rare, i dun think many can visualize it.  It is a very strong feeling that you'd like to spend the rest of your life with BOTH, and not just either one, for without any one of them, you'd feel something is missing, cuz they are so very different... yet only with both then feel complete.  And feel truly happy with both of them, complete honesty and trust.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

He asked a question on why he always chose a woman who can't make a committment in a relationship. Later he told me that what he really wanted was a harem of woman and that he couldn't seemed to get the woman he knew to participate in his harem experience.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So I begin to ask him why he has difficulty in making committment in love and what it is about being committed to one person that is so scary for him. His own feelings told him that he had a great fear of betrayal and that whenever he got too close to a woman, he got even more afraid of being hurt or abandon. He will pull away and want some space, inadvertently creating the very situation he was afraid of, being separate from loved one. His other ploy was to try and keep multiple relationship, so that he wouldn't have to worry if one of them hurt or left him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>There are so many female out there dating married men. And these pattern has become so familiar to me that I just have to smile every time I hear about it. Anyone with common sense can figure out that a person who is having affair with someone who is unavailable is also unavailable themselves. Aside from dishonesty that usually accompanies these kinds of affair, these relationship are usually very painful and unfulfilling. Alot of pain could be avoided if these folks could just admit to themselves that they are not interested in a committed relationship and choose someone who was unmarried and side step all these dishonesty and hiding that accompanied these affairs.'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>- Love Cards<br><br>We reflect who we attract; therefore the simple phrase of 'you ought to love yourself before you can extend this love to others.' is so damn important. People whom suffer from abuse relationship are people suffering from inferior complex, low self esteem, negative outlook in life and basically poor relationship experience and handling. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: 32% of woman two-time now comparing to 27% of men. Woman are getting more self-sufficient in terms of finance and the position standing between men and women are closing up the gap between one another.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> So two timing is no longer a man's doing - woman are enjoying as well as man.<br><br>Cheers</div>
