I belong to the big sized and plumpie category of gals. And i know own limits.

Well, coz i know i won't stand any chance.<br>Thru'out all these years... my clique with guys had always been good. I can be their great pals... their kakiz, their matchmakers, their aunt agony, their problems solver... listener.. bla bla bla except their lover. Well, i kinda noe that if i'm not fat.... i'd long be sought after by alot of guys. Or maybe it's jus becoz of my Destiny's Child's Characteristics.. too much of female ego.<br>in fact, due to all the bad comments and awful remarks by some immature imbeciles (Guys) when young, I became very unconfident of my looks. Although how much i'm reassureed by my present mates that i look perfectly alright, i still cannot accept their assurances. If got ppl say i pretty.. i take it as insult.. Coz i know i'm not.<br>So.. fat ppl are desirable.. in many aspects.. coz we have inner beauty bla bla bla... but we never pass the 1st impression looks category. So we always stand a higher chance to flunk the steads' category...</div></blockquote>well, sometimes why do you have to pass the PSLE when the govt never state that you have to do that to take the O'levels??

I'm something like a feminist.. and i believe a gal can do almost all things that a guy can do.

He said that she was an independent girl even when she had nothing when she arrive in Singapore. Whenever they go out they would meet in some simple coffeeshops, and she would pay for her own, because she said something like this to him, "Your parents gave you your allowance for your own use only." It sort of meant that his allowance is for his own use and not his parents never considered her share when they gave it to him. There are people out there who appreciate independent girls. We have an example here with our late former President and the late former First Lady. =)<br><br>Anyway, just to tell you.. sometimes, people send girls home is not only because of their safety. It's also because they want to spend more time with this girl... =) been missing out on some opportunities?? hehhe~ and they do it because they care about you. You reject is kind of turning them off, and turning down a chance for them to know you better too.. if you cannot stand it.. do the on-and-off thingy lorz.. Anyway like I say, it's just a personal view... You have your way and will be respected, it's just to tell you something about guys that's all.<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)

            <div class='col-md body'>Not to throw cold water to fat people.. (just my views.. that's all)<br>Fat.. looks.. I believe they are about the same thing.. which is appearence.<br>People might say, inner charms, inner beauty prevail in the end. I strongly agree. Without inner beauty, that person will just be a flower pot with rotten roots. Which will eventually start to stink.<br>However looks is important too, not as important as inner beauty. But without 'pleasent' looks (not necessary beautiful.. just average looks).. would you even consider getting to know the other half?<br><br>If you ask me, looks is like another characteristic. I won't like to be with a stunner who's inside is replusive. On the other hand I wouldn't like to be with an Angel heart who is replusive in the outside.<br><br>my 2 coppers<br></div>
