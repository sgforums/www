And since, you taking undergrad lessons, most prob. Point 3 will be EVERYday affair, and not 2-3 times a week as in post-grad course?<br>5).

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm.. in my opinion, you should just take up a study loan from banks. Study full-time, concentrate on it. Perhaps if you can cope with your studies, you might wanna consider earning from $$ by giving tuition after school.<br><br>Location-wise, it can be in the West (NUS + NTU) area, or.. anywhere near you stay. Simple as that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>If you think it's going to be tough on you, maybe you can try applying for some bursaries or study grants.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  *shrugs* I'm gonna take a bank loan, I think. Anyway, 0% interest mah. Haha..<br><br>But I think it's only for the 1st 2 years. Hmmm</div>
