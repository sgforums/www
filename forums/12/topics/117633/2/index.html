            <div class='col-md body'>Btw, just to warn those who are interested in taking up Information Systems Management (ISM) in SMU, ive an insider news abt this faculty.<br><br>My good friend, a 2nd year ISM student ( 1st batch) told me she really regretted her choice. The profs in the ISM dept are not v experienced in teaching, and worse still, being a new faculty in SMU, their syllabus are subjected to changes, and she says that the profs are stimes pretty unsure of what approach they are taking in this 4 yr course. Many of her profs are v poor teachers, most from overseas, have poor command of the english language, ( but i wld say that isnt UNCOMMON in NUS/NTU too).<br>Recently, i heard her faculty has to take up a compulsory 2nd major, which she said was probably due to that the faculty thinks the ISM degree may not be marketable and thus need a 2nd major to buck it up...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>aye looks like maybe the solution now is like what nightzip mentioned... get a loan from a bank, which can be paid off in monthly instalments after you complete the course.<br><br>have you looked around for more details on the various options u can use to finance your studies? ... bank loans, bonds.... everything...<br><br>the choice will be easier to make when you have all the information you need at hand.</div>
