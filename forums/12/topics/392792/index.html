              <p>Simple, you have wasted her 5 years already.</p>
              <p>It's time you let her go. Let someone else who can love and appreciate her,take good care of her.</p>
              <p>You can go and find that perfect dream girl of yours.</p>
              <p>5 years is better than 10-20 years or a life time, wasted.</p>
              <p>I'm very sure she can also find someone else better than you.</p>

              huh?</p>
              <p>Truth be told, you just don't love her that much anymore. You have wasted 5 years, and now you are doubting whether this relationship is the perfect one you are looking for. Please don't give yourself excuses; you are just plainly sick of her already.</p>
              <p>You've mentioned the many things she'd done for you, but what have you done for her? Maybe you can elaborate on that. I think that if you really love her, you wouldn't be thinking so much on this. Maybe it's time to let her go to find a better man. Meanwhile, you can "explore your other options" to look for the perfect girl you seek, or rather seeking for new challenges to satisfy your thirst.</p>
              <p>And what do you mean by diploma holders been unable to hold intelligent conversations? That's stereotyping. Degree holders so what? Big deal?</p>

              <p>Love never dies, the love within one never flowered. something else was pretending lar</p>
              <p> the ethical thing is to be honest and whatever u feel - express to her and that is what a person would do if he/she purports to love or the least accord the respect for having spent time with you.</p>
              <p>However, your stance seems more like wanting to escape, u may escape but u are doomed to repeat what you are - she is an excuse, expectations is an excuse. so being honest to yourself and risking wrath/??? face it.</p>
              <p>As for finding someone better - it is a chase, an  illusion - it is delusional and frankly being neurotic. <strong><em>Being</em></strong>'' rite'' is far more wiser than looking for Mr/Miss ''Right'' !</p>
              <p>PS - Considering your age and the folly of youth - it is alright, one needs to take tumbles and of course, what matters is one being gracious and evolving. Otherwise, it is utter folly excepting the youth lar</p>

              <p>The time frame is confusing, but you are in a relationship and are staying together, and now you have grown apart.</p>
              <p>You are right these thing do happen.</p>
              <p>There are mental  and emotional  blocks to action.</p>
              <p>Firstly, the confession, how to tell her.</p>
              <p>Tell her you must. Think and explore on how to bring up the matter. There is a possibility that she sensed it and is waiting for you to bring it up. Anyway expect it to be emotional, think it through, and do not avoid it. The idea should be to talk, discuss and decide.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the alternative accomodation, looking for another place to stay.</p>
              <p>This is another big influence on maintaining the status quo. It takes courage to strike out on your own and look for your own accomodation, or ever return to your family. Talk about the arrangements to be made.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, have you made any romantically inspired declaration to her? Did you tell her that you will never part come hell fire or what not, and you will be together till your dying breath etc etc. Well for this, read Fugazzi's post. Just be honest.</p>
              <p>Remember you talked together into this, well now talk together again.</p>

              <p>You better evaluate your stance properly. Is it the sex part? Relationship is not all about sex. You should be lucky to find yourself in a relationship of 5 years. Are you thinking of marriage? Or dumping her to find other relationship?</p>
              <p>Think carefully. Good relationships are not easy to find. Some are lucky but some are unlucky, some men and women are now in their 30s, still single, they find their friends around them have married and have their own kids. To make matters worse, people in their 30s who don't marry and to be more independent and spend more time at work then friendship. Is this what you want? You can dump her but you may risk the chance of not getting another gf as good as her.</p>

              <p>So you are sick of your girlfriend already?</p>
              <p>But of course, after 5 years even if you had Miss Universe as your girlfriend, you would also be sick of her.</p>
              <p>So you have found another girl you would like to get close with?</p>
              <p>Please don't be so selfish and think you are the only person in your relationship who HAD a choice to find someone better and move out of with your current relationship.</p>
              <p>Be more responsible towards your girlfriend because you had wasted 5 good years of her youth!</p>
              <p>Why bother to call off the relationship only after 5 years? Why not do it within 5 weeks or 5 days if she isn't the one for you?</p>
              <p>The fact is clear, you did not have a change of heart which is why you are pondering and holding onto this relationship. You are just sick of her physical appearance and you no longer lusted after her body and you are coughing out all sorts of excuses to exit this relationship as gallantly and righteously as you could.</p>
              <p>Guess what? This kind of behaviour has no honour at all in our current society and if you really want to exit out of this relationship, you need to do it in an ugly manner and tainted your reputation forever and live with it on your conscience for eternity.</p>
              <p>Don't come and tell me it's not fair to you, unless you can tell me how fair is it towards your girlfriend when you are the one enjoying her inside out and she's taking care and pleasing you on the outside in.</p>
              <p>Wasting 5 years of our time? I do not forgive that kind of behaviour.</p>
