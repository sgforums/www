You are tasteless, but I'm not as tasteless as you!"....this bast!@# was shouting and attracted many onlookers.<br><br>This gal was on the verge of crying. The guy ignored everyone and proceeded to the changing room. This gal...teary-eyed and embarassed...followed him like a 'slave' and waited for that bast!@# outside the changing room..... I was really furious. Somemore...frankly speaking...this gal (in terms of outlook etc) was too good for him (who was rather fat....and aggressive..no intention of criticising overwt people as I'm overwt too..) but this guy is realli worse than beast...nw I really know love is blind........sigh.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </div></blockquote>Give tt guy a tight slap and walk off.

Or if your gf cannot control her emotions in public, its perfectly all right for her to shout at you?<br><br>No one's saying there aren't cases whereby similar scenarios have occured, with guys as the victims. Its just normal for onlookers to feel unjust for people who get shouted at in public, be it a victimised girl or guy. And my onlookers in this sense refers to both sexes too.<br><br>Emotions over logic. I think its fine to let emotions take over here. The initial response of the poster was that he was angry..angry for witnessing such a scene. You said emotions over logic. Well, fine i agree..BUT, where's the logic in this case? Nobody knows who this couple is..nobody knows the character of these 2 people. You put logic into the equation when its possible. This was a very simple case of a bf shouting at a gf in public, the general initial response has to be anger isn't it. But obviously, there are people out there who "have seen a lot", take great pains to conjure impressively unique answers to such a  simple case.<br><br></div>

Tell me, how should the onlookers feel?<br><br>There are things which we should ponder beyond the surface, but<br>there are also situations where it just isn't possible. You said.."THE LOGIC HERE IS TO KEEP YOUR EMOTIONS IN CHECK." Well this is because you already have the assumption that THERE IS A STORY BEHIND THE WHOLE THING (point out any part of your post which you suggest there might not be any), and so without knowing the story, we shouldn't make any conclusions. All these, based on your assumptions (if the 6 areas which i highlighted is sufficient) that there IS a story behind.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Devil1976:<br><strong><br>IMAGINE ANY of the other RESPONSES? Go SLAP him lah... KICK him lah.... </strong><br></blockquote>You keep suggesting you are constantly thinking, you have seen<br>a lot and you think more than the others..then don't tell me it has never occured to you that more often than not, forumites post things in a casual joking manner? "Go SLAP him lah..KICK him lah.." are just replies to a post. You think one will really do that? Or simply, you just aren't who you seem to suggest?<br><br>Ah ma's example was apt in the singaporean context, unlike a "bashing up the gf wallet snatcher based on emotions" example which has no hint of reality in it at all.<br><br>Lastly, let me bring you back to the point where you asked me not to jump into conclusions..that because i do not know the story behind doesn't mean there isn't, which i'm sure i didn't. On the other hand, how many fatal assumptions have you made to suggest that there is a story behind?<br><br></div>
