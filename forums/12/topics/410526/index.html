              <p>What does it mean when ur gf is more closer to her sis de bf (lets name him A) rather than u? And when u try to mention the topic up to her asking why is she so close with A she will keep denying and gets very angry eventually. There was once I asked her to assure me that she will keep a distance away from A, she said ok but whenever we all go out she will still talk and laugh tgt with A. And whatever A do for his gf , she would want me to do it for her too. Everytime hearing my gf mention about A, saying how much she envy her sis all that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another issue is everytime when i am talking to her, i realise she is not really listening to wat i am saying.</p>
              <p> wat does it mean? wat can i do? how do i solve this problem in a proper manner?</p>

              <p>Is TS sure the girl is his GF? Seems like that so-called GF is only treating him like a friend only. Seems like a one-way street here or at best, TS' GF's merely treating him like a "shelter"....... </p>
              <p>It's clear that TS' GF is more fond of A.</p>

              <p>If your girlfriend is doing something like this to you, and you find it rude or terribly affected by it, then you should ignore it for your own good.</p>
              <p>Although she may be your girlfriend, but bear in mind that both of you are still basically just friends because you have no legal rights over her and she's not legally binded to you like a wife.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, do you want her NOT to get along well with her sister's boyfriend on your behalf and creates tension between she and her sister? Either way, you request reveals you as an immature and self-centered and possessive and insecure person.</p>
              <p>Last but not least, why do you think you have the rights and power over her choice of friends that she can choose to befriend? Do you need to realise what an idiot you have been only after when she have decided to leave you to exercise her rights for GREATER FREEDOM?</p>
              <p>I really despise guys like you, and you should ask yourself what kind of value have you brought into this relationship as her boyfriend?</p>
              <p>If you do not have a unique value to contribute to this relationship, then it's only a matter of time before you loses her.</p>
              <p>If you only have the same common values (care for her, love her...and the usual lies), then it is inevitable that you WILL lose her when she finds someone else who can offer her a much better deal in a relationship.</p>

              <p>TS, it would be good if you inform your gf of your problem. Each and everyone has an expectations in a relationship. That is why they are called our partner.

              <p>The result shows that she is just jealous of your sis bf lar who got more more to spend on her sis.</p>
              <p>"Everytime hearing my gf mention about A, saying how much she envy her sis all that."</p>
              <p>"eg. A buy a expensive bag/clothes/shoes for his gf, den she wants it too."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Suggestion:</p>
              <p>You cannot stop your gf from talking to A but you talk to A more often and understand him better. Your gf may or may not be interested in A but as long as A is not interested in your gf, you are safe.</p>

              <p><br> Do you mean you've never admired another girl when you're attached
              to your girlfriend?</p>
              <p>Check against your own conscience then come and tell me you've
              lied.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There's no difference with not displaying physical
              interest, withholding your interest towards another girl, than with
              expressing interest for another girl while you're attached to your
              girlfriend.</p>
              <p>Both are still considered infidelity in moral terms.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Of course you can insist and deny what I have mentioned and
              retain your high and noble status.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself, who are you really trying to lie and convince in
              here?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I admit that I am wrong only when people do not have the courage
              to own up to their own sins. Because I can only tell you the truth,
              I cannot help you to face the truth if you do not have the right
              amount of morals and righteousness in you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I don't have any high noble status to speak off. I only know love do indeed exist. I'm not going to go into personal attacks though im pretty inclined to do so. If you consider a capable girl such as her ability to talk, to play the piano and some other skills, yes I did admire before. But not overboard till I will coo over her and attempt to get her attention. Simply because it is just pure admiration for her skills and not any romantic love.</p>
              <p>Maturity and priority needs to be exercised in this scenario. I have not withold any interest for any other girl, but I know quite a number of people do due to loyalty to their partner. Its my personality that it gets very hard for me to show interest for others, or to be able to get my attention. </p>
              <p>What I'm trying to say is, there are people out there who are extremely loyal to their partner, not everyone is thinking of somebody else hoping to be with him while hugging their current partner. </p>
              <p>So my advice for TS is to let his gf know what his thoughts are. And seek for a mutual understanding. It could be like an idol-kind-of-like which is harmless. But the gf must know where her priorities lies. Always seek a balance, or else TS would suffer in the r/s of being very insecure. Don't you think this is very unfair to him? </p>
              <p>Another thing is that TS girl might be the very friendly sort whom is able to warm up to everyone. If that is the case, then TS you got to accept your girl as who is she. And place your trust in her that she won't do you wrong. There is a very fine line between personality and being playful on purpose. </p>
