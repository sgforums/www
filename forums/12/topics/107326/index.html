But sometimes, guys r not tat sensitive enuff to realise ur change.<br><br>4)Sharing the same interest and hobby can be so fun and brings ur r/s to a higher lvl tat u will nv imagine. Even thou u might be of no interest or find them boring, y not give it a try? It doesn't hurt to learn new things rite? But its painful to let ur r/s fade off juz lidat.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Sometimes guys juz tend to forget to tell their gfs abt some things tat had happened, juz take it as he had 4gotten to tell u. u have to think +vely.<br><br></div>

One of you will ultimately get burnt out.<br><br>Hmm.. my suggestions, like all the above.. it's time to renew the sparkles.<br>1. Make him a little jealous..<br>2. Reassure him and talk about the future.<br>3. Talk about him and not so much about your encounter.<br>4.  Look out for some different places and activities to do.  E.g. Start getting yourself a new hobby.. and also, pay attention of his hobby.  Most guys like their GF to share their hobby interest, so they can always show off their expertise and also won't few so bore about their girlfriend.  It's an ego thingie.<br><br></div></blockquote>we did tok abt our near future like getting married and stuff.. but both of us are still studying.. i tried to tok about him but most of the time when i try to tok to him on the phone he'll always be doing something else or sound quite sian.. so end up i'm doing most of the toking.. he'll only be most engaged in the conversation when he's on his bed trying to get to sleep soon.. so sometimes we dun get to tok much..<br><br>besides he dun like to tok much abt himself... if i ask him more questions, it'll gif him the idea like i'm questioning him and not trying to engage a conversation.. and dat will piss him off.. bu thte thing is i'm trying my best to understand more of him and to make the conversation more engaging..<br><br>as for sharing their hobby interest, i'm fine wif all the things he like to do.. i make an effort to learn more abt it.. even things like fishing for crabs, prawns, watching soccer etc(many are the no no for gals).. partly becos i like this kind of activities too.. but it's juz dun seem to work.. he prefer very much doing all these wif his frens.. when it comes to me, he'll most prob be sleeping or playing wif his com.. even if we go out, mostly it'll end up wif his frens joining us.. i dun mind but throughout the outing he'll be more engaged wif his frens.. so i felt like i turn out to be a burden to him..</div>

My bf suddenly felt very sian. we always quarreled over trivial things. got irritated by my slightest action or words. Then he asked for a cooling down period. It was very bad then. I felt helpless and desperate cos there were a lot of considerations. We got a car and house together. So breaking up also meant a lot of financial problems. Of cos, the relationship was very important too.<br><br>My friends asked me to read 'men are from Mars, women are from Venus'. There is a chapter there that talked abt men are like rubberbands. u cannot stretch it too far, or it will snap. But if u allow it to stretch far enuf, it will come back to original place.<br><br>true enuf, he became better after a mth. It was a painful 1 mth for me, cos i heard all sorts of stories of him with other girls. But he was willing to salvage the relationship when i threatened to break up for good.  I realised that it was a depression, a low period when he felt suffocated by me, a phase he got to get over. some guys have it, some guys dun.<br><br>he felt that i was too dependent on him. he had no room to breathe. he felt that he could not go out with his friends cos i will be angry/sad/lonely. he felt that he needed sometime alone to think our r'ship thru. and at the end of it, he felt that he still loves me. so all ends well. we tried to patch back bit by bit after 1 mth, it was awkward at 1st. but bit by bit, we are back to normal. we picked up a sport together, and become closer to each other. after 6 mths, we are stronger than ever. 2 mths ago, we got married.<br><br>i dunno how true that is for ur bf, bcos it may well be a 3rd party. but u shld sit down and talk. If it wasnt a 3rd party, i dare say he will be alright after a while. and if it is a 3rd party, then wats the point of holding on? feelings have changed. he has betrayed u. he had moved on, so shld u.<br><br></div>
