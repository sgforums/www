            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fairlady04:</div><div class="quote_body">hi, i encountered something like this last year. My bf suddenly felt very sian. we always quarreled over trivial things. got irritated by my slightest action or words. Then he asked for a cooling down period. It was very bad then. I felt helpless and desperate cos there were a lot of considerations. We got a car and house together. So breaking up also meant a lot of financial problems. Of cos, the relationship was very important too.<br><br>My friends asked me to read 'men are from Mars, women are from Venus'. There is a chapter there that talked abt men are like rubberbands. u cannot stretch it too far, or it will snap. But if u allow it to stretch far enuf, it will come back to original place.<br><br>true enuf, he became better after a mth. It was a painful 1 mth for me, cos i heard all sorts of stories of him with other girls. But he was willing to salvage the relationship when i threatened to break up for good.  I realised that it was a depression, a low period when he felt suffocated by me, a phase he got to get over. some guys have it, some guys dun.<br><br>he felt that i was too dependent on him. he had no room to breathe. he felt that he could not go out with his friends cos i will be angry/sad/lonely. he felt that he needed sometime alone to think our r'ship thru. and at the end of it, he felt that he still loves me. so all ends well. we tried to patch back bit by bit after 1 mth, it was awkward at 1st. but bit by bit, we are back to normal. we picked up a sport together, and become closer to each other. after 6 mths, we are stronger than ever. 2 mths ago, we got married.<br><br>i dunno how true that is for ur bf, bcos it may well be a 3rd party. but u shld sit down and talk. If it wasnt a 3rd party, i dare say he will be alright after a while. and if it is a 3rd party, then wats the point of holding on? feelings have changed. he has betrayed u. he had moved on, so shld u.<br><br></div></blockquote>Thanks for the advice.. i dun think it's third party involved maybe he needed some room to breathe.. now the thing is to get him more motivated to be involved in activities.. any suggestions?</div>

People tends to take the ones that are always there for them for granted.  This is because, you are always there.<br><br>U see.. a courtship is like tango, he takes a step towards you.. you take a step back.. and when you take a step forward, he will take a step back.  But if you are in a relationship where both of you or just one of you is standing while the other is trying hard to tango.. I seriously doubt you can enjoy the dance.<br><br>Well.. please proceed to retreat slowlyand PLEASE.. stop being weak.  Telling yourself that you can't loose him cause you love him too much won't help either.  Take a step back and stop worrying. Start changing some aspect of your live, your prespectives and take it easy.<br><br>If you do retreat slowly, and later found out that the situation is out of your expectation, ie. there's a 3rd party.. or that he initiate a break up, you will at least not feel that bad.   Go and get yourself more friends.. and more activities AND STOP REVOLVING your world around him.  If he doesn't like you revolving around him, you will somehow appears to be an irritating fly pestering him.<br><br>You may like to ask him if he notices that you are feeling sad lately.  If no, well, you can just proceed to distance yourself a step at a time till he notices and wants to get you back.  If yes, ask him if he knows why.  If he ekpt insisting you to tell him why you ask this question and doesn't know why.. well, just tell him you are feeling miserable about your relationship.. if and only if when you and him are ready to discuss this issue.. calmly. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Good luck<br></div>

Is he good at any sports? it will be easier if he is the sporty type, and u two can pick up the same sport and play on a regular basis. but i must stress that: he must be willing and proactive in this too. There is no happiness if u sort of push him and he is not willing. this may even aggravate the situation.<br><br>it may also be better if u let him cool off for a short period of 2-4 weeks first. When i meant cool-off, it is like meetups only once fortnightly, plus one call or few smses per day.  let him reassess his life, wat he wants to do and how well he copes w/o u.<br><br>absence does make the heart fonder.</div>

At least he is trying. What u need to do now is to encourage him to open to u, and try not to show too many negative emotions when he did that even if its news that really saddens u. Though I am asking u to hide ur true feelings, but its only for the moment and there will be time to address ur own emotions with him later. Important thing is to encourage him to open up to u. A single frown will lead him to think "See, I said u will be sad..." and he may stop opening from u. What he needs is someone who can understand how he feel when the things he say happened to him. Empathy. Its always good to reply him that u can understand how he feel after listening to his stories.<br><br>Another ingredient will be TIME. Do not expect everything to happen at whatever rate u want it to. Everything takes time. Especially things you do for the first time. Especially after u have grown up, u will tend to avoid pain. Things which u do not have confidence that it will not bring pain, u will hesitate in excecuting them. Unlike children, they just simply explore everything. So give him time.<br><br>I understand that u may be afraid that there may not be enough time for u to get him to totally open up to u before anythign drastic happen. However, if u were to rush, i guess things will get even worse. I cannot generalize ur bf with me, but i am one that needs to see a point by myself before i can understand it and apply. Likewise, I think like many common man till i see the point that i shldnt be afraid of making my gf sad or worried by telling her my problems. However all these enlightenment came too late...<br><br>Good luck.</div>
