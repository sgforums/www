            <div class='col-md body'>i understand your plight as well as thoisand of people with suicidal thoughts.<br><br>First thing to do is to tackle your brain. Human brain , though ingenious in some way, is actually also a very stupid device because it is not able to analyse things properly with all kinds of emotions, random thoughts running here and there.<br><br>the solution?<br><br>treat your brain, your mind and body like a rubbish bin. After so many years of living in this planet, you probably have learn many things. But at the same time, you have also learn many many wrong things. so you have a lot of rubbish in you now.<br><br>so what?<br><br>with all this rubbish inside you. there is no way you can stragihten your thoughts and convince yourself to lremove suicidal thoguts.<br><br>remedy.<br><br>like computer game, restart your brain and emotion to 0. the essence is to unlearn all the things. how to unlearn? you have to revisit all your beliefs and question its validilty.<br><br>the above is a tedious and daunting tasks. but the rewards are great so you have to do it. but lets talk about what you can do in the short run to salvage yourself.<br><br>quick and easy method.<br><br>this is my theory and i hope it is applicable in your case.<br><br>you need to remeber only 2 things. you can forget anything and everything but not this 2. i call it BC. you can rename it as you like.<br><br>B stands for your body status. a lot of time, people translate their body unconfort like stomach ache, headache, into the situation they are in, thinking that the problem is very frustrating. the next morning, they wake up, as their body recovers, the problem that was bothering them yesterday also dissapper but they have no idea why it seems like a problem yesterday.<br><br>so always check your body stauts periodically and if there is any uncomfort, go and cure it. if you cannot solve it  at that point of time. you need to at least be aware of it.<br><br>i am tired more of C next time meanwhile tkae care.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm still alive but still plague wif money,money,money problems. i saw the news abt the commit suicide of the father n son in hong kong due to unemployment. according to the news, there r more n more suicides due to unemployment n money matters. i was thinking i am not the only one wanting the easiest way out afterall. my brother-in-law did it 6 yrs ago. he left behind his insurance money n mountains of loansharks debts. we didn't pay the loansharks as it was not borrowed by us. he is such a nice n honest man. no smoking, gambling n was a perfect family man. i always envy my sis for having such a perfect husband. so when he jumped fr the highest flr, we were so shock! til today, we still can't believe he ended his life this way n why? i guessed it all boiled down to money. though my sis was very depressed but after abt 8 yrs, now she is planning for her new wedding. so see it was not bad afterall.... she had a better life.<br>i've called sos for help dat day. and guess wat? i was sobbing n telling my problem to a guy. after abt 20 mins, i can sense his impatient. we ended our conversation without any solutions. when i looked at the time i realised it's lunch time! no wonder he is impatient! i've also called the family care centre, they r unable to help unless i meet them personally. but i can't travel how to go there?<br>so what is my next help? any other new ideas?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>anyone saw the frontline programme last nite. it's abt a divorcee seeking for help. the difficulties she faced n how many so-call 'social organisation' can't help her! this is exactly wat happened to me! she was on TV crying n gaining sympathies..... y must we poor folks hv to swoop so low to hv a decent living? we may be poor but we also hv pride. our children also hv their pride. wat r they thinking when they hv to expose their life to  the whole s'pore? this is worst then begging!!! at least only few ppl know u r a begger n u can keep your life private!<br>every time s'porean donated generously to poor ppl in other countries, i felt sad. i supposed charity begins at home doesn't hold true now. we donated to others where else our own citizen r begging n hungry!<br>i hv borrowed fr a relative abt 2k some mths back. he promised us he will only wants his money back when we r more settled. but after 2 mths, he wants his money back. he chased us like loansharks! the reasons? his child is going to a poor country to help the poor ppl. that really sucks!!!!!!! s'pore no poor ppl meh? we r so poor then y didn't help us first instead force us to pay when we didn't hv three meals a day?<br></div>

But then you need<br>A mile of mud sliced through with ditches,<br>Not to mention black boots, bomb craters,<br>More mud, a plague of rats, a dozen songs<br>And some round hats made of steel.<br><br>In an age of aeroplanes, you may fly<br>Miles above your victim and dispose of him by<br>Pressing one small switch. All you then<br>Require is an ocean to separate you, two<br><br>Systems of government, a nation's scientists,<br>Several factories, a psychopath and<br>Land that no one needs for several years.<br><br>These are, as I began, cumbersome ways<br>To kill a man. Simpler, direct, and much more neat<br>Is to see that he lives somewhere in the middle<br>Of the twentieth century, and leave him there.<br><br>-- Edwin Brock</div>
