To kill yourself will only make things worse, you will bring untold suffering to the people around you and ultimately it may not necessary mean you can escape for suffering. Pull yourself together and write down what is troubling you. After that tackle that one by one. As for your child who is becoming naughty, get the help of your family. Spend more time with him. Live each day as your last. Strive to accomplish something. You have the choice.</div>
