            <div class='col-md body'>how do you expect others to try their best to help when you yourself don't even try. you are giving me the impression that you are giving it all up when you still have a child to take care of.<br>if your husband is a hard-core gambler. and you do not want to continue living.. what's gonna happen to your child?<br>you need to be strong.<br>you and your husband need to sit down and talk about this.<br><br>Your Husband:<br>he's a gambler. he's an ex-convict. he couldn't find a job for several years.<br>where does he get the money for his gambling capital? i really wondered.<br>But anyway, he needs to kick the bad habit first. With debts, there's no way to have spare cash on hand.<br>Then he has to find a job. If he still cares about the family, he ought to take up some courses and pick up some skills.<br>SCORE (Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises) does provide some assistance on this.<br>They have this Employment Assistance Unit (EAU) that helps to provide employment assistance to offenders and ex-offenders. EAU will help them to secure jobs.<br>You may visit this website for more details : http://www.mha.gov.sg/score/vocational_training.html<br><br>Your child :<br>I dunno what you mean by your child is turning bad. I do not know even how old is your child. But there must be reasons why this is happening. Is it that the child does not get enough care and attention?<br><br>Education help is available from CDAC. The "Project Start" is to assist academically weak students from low-income families. You can contact CDAC Student Service Centre Department at 68435588.<br><br>If your child is between 7-14 yrs old, there's assistance for student care. This assistance is given to eligible parents who place their children in Student Care Centres (SCC). This is to ensure that SCCs are within the reach of parents who need to provide their children with an alternative form of day-care arrangement before and after school hours but are unable to afford the fees. But to apply, one of the parent needs to be working full-time or part-time regularly.<br><br>For you..<br>If you are not disabled, i think you still could find a job placement. You can contact government job placement centres, like CDAC career link or NTUC career link etc. to look for a job.<br>You mentioned that CDC did assist you but it was only enough for your husband's meals and transport expenses?<br>At this point of time, everyone in your family have to work together to cut expenses. Why does he even need transport expenses when he is not even working?<br>CDC scheme is to provide financial aid. That's for just buying the necessities. From what i understand, they do provide a few hundred dollars aid every month for short periods. CDC also provides assistance for payment of utilities and S&amp;C charges for short periods too. Did you apply for that?<br>Besides CDC, CDAC also have similar schemes. You can contact CDAC for more details on this. I do know it's a monthly aid of $250 if you do qualify.<br><br>There are some other organisations which can render help to you :<br><br>AMP (adopt-a-family scheme)<br>Adult will be provided with computer skills and worker training courses for free. Children be given tuition assistance.<br>Holiday programmes and other enrichment programmes either for free or at a heavily subsidised rate.<br>Families are also given free PC for those who do not have one<br>Counselling assistance is also available here.<br>Tel : 64163960 / 64163963<br><br>Sree Narayana Mission Home (Home Food Relief Programme)<br>Monthly food rations provided to needy people.<br><br>MCDS (Sponsor a need scheme)<br>Helps individuals and families from low income with their specific needs. Includes developmental needs which are out of their reach due to lack of financial resources.<br>Tel : 6354 8293<br><br>Family Service Centres (FSC) Tel : 1800-8380100<br><br>1) School Pocket Money Fund Scheme<br>Helps children from low-income families to pay for basic daily school-related expenses.<br><br>2) Casework &amp; Counselling<br>Counselling services available includes : marital counselling, behavioral problems, child management, domestic violence, financial difficulties etc.<br><br>CDAC (NEU PC Programme)<br>Provides opportunity for low income families to own either new PCs or refurbished PCs.<br>Tel :  68435588<br><br>Lastly, are you doing enough to cut the expenditure? How long can you go on when expenditure is more than income. Especially now when there's no income at all. Your child needs to attend school.. fees, books etc. cost money. Please seek the assistance from the organisations, I am sure they are able to help.<br>And yes cut off those that are not necessary. If internet connection is not necessary, then cut it off. You'll have one expense lesser to worry about.<br>I do think that you need the support from family to go through this.<br>Financial assistance can only tide you and your family for a short period. Think of the long run, you and your husband need to find a job fast. That will solve most problems.<br><br>Please stay strong. It's not easy but it's not impossible too.</div>
