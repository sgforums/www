              <p>Hi guys, I've posted my little problem here before, and this is the topic.</p>

              <p>Well, here is a little continuation from that topic..</p>
              <p>After our outing(old topic), things between us were rather good. There were some ups and downs, but things weren't really serious. After a long period of hesitation (yes I was a pussy back then), I've decided to pop the question to her, which is to be my girlfriend. I asked her on the 22nd of March and she said that she wanted 3 days to think it through. Well it had been more than 3 days, a week actually, and I haven't got a reply yet. I did ask her beforehand (3 days after the 22nd) about her answer, but she told me that she needed more time.</p>
              <p>Heres the thing. She had been hinting me before, and being a pussy and blockhead that I was, I didn't catch her hints. She was kinda waiting for me to ask, but I just didn't. But well, I finally did, and I popped the question. While I was "confessing", she gave that smile, like she was expecting it or something.<br>(I had my own faults for not asking in the past, but that isn't important now)</p>
              <p>Well, now that I've said it, I haven't got a reply yet. Not that I'm impatient, its just that, if her answer is a "No", I would prefer if she told me earlier, and not make me wait.<br>(<em>I'm alittle bit drowsy, so pardon me if I've contradicted myself..</em>)</p>
              <p>So what should I do now? Carry on waiting, or bring in the towel?</p>

              <p>I can wait, but the thing is, does she really need that long to decide?</p>

              <p><br>Maybe she just want to find out if she will miss you or not...or maybe she's not ready yet.</p>
              <p>I don't see the reason why you cannot wait.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Usually if you need to wait, then answer is already an unspoken "NO". Because if she also likes you, then she would've tell you "YES" before the Sun goes down so you can do your James Bond action after the Sun went down. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Ok, as we all know, yesterday was April fools' day, and I had the biggest shock ever LOL.</p>
              <p>She had given me the answer and fortunately for me, it was a "Yes". Since it was april fools', you would have gussed what kind of joke she played on me. Well, I was kinda taken in at first..</p>
              <p>After a long wait, we are finally together! This is a hard to come relationship, and I'll cherish it.</p>
              <p>Thanks to the people that had given their suggestions in my old and current topics!</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
