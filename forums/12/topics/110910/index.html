            <div class='col-md body'>I had been with my bf for 1 yr and 4 mth. But recently, he broke off with me on the 14th month saying there is too many problems in our relationship and he needed a cooling period. During that 1 month cooling period, we met up thrice, but still does everything what a couple is doing. In the end, we patched after that 1 month. We still loves each other a lot.<br><br>But, a few days before we patched up, I received a call from his colleague. His intention is to call and send his regards and reassure me that my bf will come back to me. But when i sound him out further, i discovered that my bf has been going out with gals during this cooling period. I was very sad when i heard that because when i asked him about it, he denied it firmly.<br><br>In the end, after i cooled down, i told myself i really need him. So, i decided to forgive him. Then, his buddy's gf came to tell me too that he had brought a gal with him during their outing. I was really disappointed already. Nevertheless, I still keep quiet about it and never reveal to him that I had knew the truth.<br><br>On new yr's day, another of my friend came to know about our patchup and asked me why. I told her I love him alot. She then revealed that she had saw him holding a gal's hand in madam wong but he never saw her. I was devastated when i heard that. My heart shattered.<br><br>Unable to hold my anger anymore, i confronted him. He got no choice but to admit it. I just simply felt so betrayed. He wanted me to stay at home, show my perseverance in waiting for him and assured me that no gals will enter his life. And yet, I'm actually a fool. I kept crying and asked him why. He said he lied to me because he didn't want me to be sad. And he just needed company, that's why he was with gals. I flew into a rage and scolded him. Does a company needs to hold hands? He then put the blame on me saying: "If you make mistake, I wouldn't have needed the cooling period. If there wasn't any cooling period, I wouldn't have needed a company. But eventually, I came back to you because you were the most important gal. I've set my priorities right. And moreover, you are not my gf at that time already."<br><br>I broke off with him eventually. I just felt so cheated. I've only knew 3 gals, how many other gals i didn't know? This incident happened on Sun. But I have been thinking of him and i really can't let go. Am I being petty or unreasonable?</div>

You don't need this kind of people in your life, who doesn't show u respect, lies to you and then tries to put the blame on you.<br><br>He is only trying to make u feel guilty by saying that what u did made him leave you..if that is the case, then leave lar!!! Why couldn't he tell you earlier that he couldn't stand you, or he had problems with you? It's so damn obvious he's just giving an excuse.<br><br>PLEASE don't give him another chance. If you were my friend I would have locked you up at home so you won't go and see him again.  He went out with 3 girls and told u to wait at home...it's as if he's just trying to pick and see which is the best.  Obviously he didn't think you were already the best for him.<br><br>But you could the best for someone else..so please don't go back to him.</div>

Look at your situation objectively, and see if you have a future with him. See how you will be in 5 years time, with him, without him.<br><br>Remember to be objective..~</div>

But recently, he broke off with me on the 14th month saying there is too many problems in our relationship and he needed a cooling period. During that 1 month cooling period, we met up thrice, but still does everything what a couple is doing. In the end, we patched after that 1 month. We still loves each other a lot.<br><br>But, a few days before we patched up, I received a call from his colleague. His intention is to call and send his regards and reassure me that my bf will come back to me. But when i sound him out further, i discovered that my bf has been going out with gals during this cooling period. I was very sad when i heard that because when i asked him about it, he denied it firmly.<br><br>In the end, after i cooled down, i told myself i really need him. So, i decided to forgive him. Then, his buddy's gf came to tell me too that he had brought a gal with him during their outing. I was really disappointed already. Nevertheless, I still keep quiet about it and never reveal to him that I had knew the truth.<br><br>On new yr's day, another of my friend came to know about our patchup and asked me why. I told her I love him alot. She then revealed that she had saw him holding a gal's hand in madam wong but he never saw her. I was devastated when i heard that. My heart shattered.<br><br>Unable to hold my anger anymore, i confronted him. He got no choice but to admit it. I just simply felt so betrayed. He wanted me to stay at home, show my perseverance in waiting for him and assured me that no gals will enter his life. And yet, I'm actually a fool. I kept crying and asked him why. He said he lied to me because he didn't want me to be sad. And he just needed company, that's why he was with gals. I flew into a rage and scolded him. Does a company needs to hold hands? He then put the blame on me saying: "If you make mistake, I wouldn't have needed the cooling period. If there wasn't any cooling period, I wouldn't have needed a company. But eventually, I came back to you because you were the most important gal. I've set my priorities right. And moreover, you are not my gf at that time already."<br><br>I broke off with him eventually. I just felt so cheated. I've only knew 3 gals, how many other gals i didn't know? This incident happened on Sun. But I have been thinking of him and i really can't let go. Am I being petty or unreasonable?</div></blockquote>If you wan to get on with life.. then stop what you are doing.. You can forget him if you want to.. Don't get too soft-hearted.. When he calls or sms.. don't pick up don't reply.. Make sure yourself get out of his life totally.. If not you are living in misery.. YOu making yourself pathetic.. Where he still can go out enjoy his life with other girls..<br><br>Pick yourself up from the fall.. There are more people out there that are worse than your case.. in the end.. they still live on.. life still goes on.. world still revolving.. He's not worth for you to do such things.. if in any case or any way.. you both got back to together.. but are you sure that you are confident that he won't or never commit such things again?? Even if getting together back.. will you still doubt him.. There's no use to think about him.. or getting him back..<br><br>You jus have to learn.. and stand up.. GO out and meet more friends.. indulge in some activities.. soon he'll be a past in your life..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
