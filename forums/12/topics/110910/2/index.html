But recently, he broke off with me on the 14th month saying there is too many problems in our relationship and he needed a cooling period. During that 1 month cooling period, we met up thrice, but still does everything what a couple is doing. In the end, we patched after that 1 month. We still loves each other a lot.<br><br>But, a few days before we patched up, I received a call from his colleague. His intention is to call and send his regards and reassure me that my bf will come back to me. But when i sound him out further, i discovered that my bf has been going out with gals during this cooling period. I was very sad when i heard that because when i asked him about it, he denied it firmly.<br><br>In the end, after i cooled down, i told myself i really need him. So, i decided to forgive him. Then, his buddy's gf came to tell me too that he had brought a gal with him during their outing. I was really disappointed already. Nevertheless, I still keep quiet about it and never reveal to him that I had knew the truth.<br><br>On new yr's day, another of my friend came to know about our patchup and asked me why. I told her I love him alot. She then revealed that she had saw him holding a gal's hand in madam wong but he never saw her. I was devastated when i heard that. My heart shattered.<br><br>Unable to hold my anger anymore, i confronted him. He got no choice but to admit it. I just simply felt so betrayed. He wanted me to stay at home, show my perseverance in waiting for him and assured me that no gals will enter his life. And yet, I'm actually a fool. I kept crying and asked him why. He said he lied to me because he didn't want me to be sad. And he just needed company, that's why he was with gals. I flew into a rage and scolded him. Does a company needs to hold hands? He then put the blame on me saying: "If you make mistake, I wouldn't have needed the cooling period. If there wasn't any cooling period, I wouldn't have needed a company. But eventually, I came back to you because you were the most important gal. I've set my priorities right. And moreover, you are not my gf at that time already."<br><br>I broke off with him eventually. I just felt so cheated. I've only knew 3 gals, how many other gals i didn't know? This incident happened on Sun. But I have been thinking of him and i really can't let go. Am I being petty or unreasonable?</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Have you ever thought that the 'breaking up' or so called cooling period is actually a pass for him to mingle with other girls legally in a way where it is easily for his conscience to absorb?<br><br>Cooling period is drastically a wrong move for at least 75% scenarios in a relationship, because it promotes avoidance, in which is quite harmful for your relationship and usually creates irrevocable damage.<br><br>P.S: Do take care? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
