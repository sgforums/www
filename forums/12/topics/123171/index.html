            <div class='col-md body'>It was my happiest day, We spent Valentine's day together as my best friend was having guard duty on that night. She made chocolates for me, we went for a movie, dinner and I bought her flowers. I felt we were like a real couple. How i wish! I am so touched that she's willing to spend with me although it seems like I am a "spare" tyre. that night I sent her home, she slept on my shoulder in the bus and also during the movie show. I even lent her my hands as she complained it was cold in the cinema. Am I wrong ? I try to treat her as a normal friend celebrating Valentine's day together. My best friend knew about it but he react normal and thanked me for accompany his girl.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't be stupid. She sounds like a little b*tch(sorry, i jus feel that she is) who's trying to break your friendship with your friend. If she likes you, she wouldn't accepted your friend in the first place. Some woman are lidat, very fond of breaking ppl's relationship. Your best friend is someone who went thru thicks and thins with you for 4 yrs. Don't let her ruin this. In fact, you should tell your friend to dump her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Peng you qi bu ke xi..<br>i suggest you keep this to yourself.. though she likes you.. but still she's your best friend's gf.. Try to think about this.. if be cos of one girl.. your 4 years friendship with your best friend goes to waste.. is it worth?? Unless your best friend is treating her bad.. then i got nothing much to say.. But if they are good.. and goin strong.. you shouldn't try to break them up..<br><br>If this girl falls so easily with someone.. she will do the same thing back to you if you were to be together.. the cycle goes on and on..<br><br>Yes you will feel terrible and pain.. but this pain will slowly fade off if you put your concentration onto something else and not on her only!!<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

And I congratulate her for succeeding. I mean, 70% success. Haha.. the remaining 30% will have to depend on your best friend.<br><br>And you think your best friend was really cool about the whole thing? Try it if someone spent V Day with your girlfriend when you're not around! Even though the other party might be your best friend, I believe you won't feel good too. So IF you really *think* your best friend's "thank you" was <strong>heart-felt</strong>, I really pity you.<br><br>I mean, I won't thank someone who spent V day with <strong>MY</strong> girl, when I'm not around. And even if I do, it won't be from the bottom of my heart. Period.<br><br>So I think you shouldn't live in self-delusion.</div>
