Like I've mentioned earlier. Choice.<br><br><strong><br>2. at this moment in time, there is no financial security</strong><br><br>Ok. That's why you're saving up for years to come?<br><br>Though financial can be a problem for married couples, it's less likely to be of a major one (depending on your backgrounds) because it can be quite relative.<br><br>In your case for example, I would rather advise you to be more caution of other aspects of 'security'.<br><br><strong><br>3. it seems that we got a long way to go, at least 5 years.<br>No body can predict what will happen in 5 years time. </strong><br><br>You are right. Nobody can exactly predict what would happen in 5 years to come. Do you have the confidence?<br><br>Then again, I would like to bring you back to your subject of concern.

For a starter, I would be quite interested to know... Why are the both of you together in the 1st place? Love? Or just companionship?<br><br>If there is at all a factor of love in this relationship (which I think is pretty obvious), does it matter if you love him as a bf or a future husband?<br><br>I know for many, marriage would be a BIG thing. For some it spells the 'grave of love' or even 'start of a serious commitment'. No doubt, the relationship would evolve with time and marriage is often a hallmark.<br><br>But just like saying when you've become an adult you can no longer play and enjoy life... Or you can only be 'all serious'? That's how people changes... Often a killer in a marriage.<br><br>And as much as you wanna recognise the importance of a marriage. Don't let the mentality of a marriage kill a love. For some, don't belittle it too. It's just a growing stage. Be it be your 1st day at school.. Or sitting for an important exams... The main difference here is that this one probably involves the rest of your life...<br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As of now, nothing is really for certain. As you have pointed out, even those who make plans split up. Even years down the road, even those that marry, some will divorce. Its a cold hard fact that we have to accept. Its ok to have a vision of a future as a couple, it provides a certain comfort level and also a sense of security to know that at least, both of you are willing to think along that path to marriage. But still, don't place too much hope on that cos if you are disappointed, you'd wish you had nv made such eternal promises back then.<br><br>And since he is your first bf, its quite natural that it takes a significant place in your heart. I wont say its good or bad to marry the first one you meet. There are pros and cons. But somehow i feel the cons outweigh the pros. Cos you nv really meet other guys, and as you say there are no comparison. WHAT IF, one fine day someone better comes along.<br><br>Human relationship is very dynamic, never will it be a constant, feelings for people even the one you loved most now will change for better or maybe for worse. It will just take some combination of events, moods and chance meetings and then you have a different situation altogether.<br><br>So.. love each other as much as you can now, make promises that you can keep NOW, dun make them for the future.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

There are a significiant number of couples out there who can't even maintain a BGR for 5 months - I truely doubt your friends are truely ready. Why rush marriage if you plan to spend the rest of your life as husband and wife - it doesn't matter if you both spend a little more time as bf/gf right?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Ok, regarding your concern, its normal. Woman, after their romance-filled-dream teenage age, would look for qualities more than just simple I-love-you, you-love-me. In fact, many come to realise that to make a relationship function well, other important elements has to be fulfilled as well.<br><br>You loved him no doubt, and you are right about the part where there is no comparison and you begin to wonder if he is truely the right guy for you. There could be better guys out there ya? My advice is that: drop this thought. <strong>Love is mutually exclusive</strong>. In simple - when you truely love someone, others don't matter because they are magically programmed to be smaller than your current partner. Don't look at the dyamanic environment around you - look at what you want. Is he the guy you want? Or rather, the qualities he display? If yes - that's enough for this aspect. You love him - you don't love what he could offer (although this affects the kind of relationship you will be in, but like all other things in life: we embark the ship, we stay until the ship sinks and we have no choice but to leap) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>There is no financial security? Fair enough - throw yourself a decent amount of years to gain whatever financial security you both need. 5 years? 10 years? All that doesn't matter - what you ought to do is not to look at your relationship in figures and sums. Lead a each new day as it is, while working towards your objective for each other. <strong>TREAT HIM ACCORDING TO WHAT HIS STATUS IS TO YOU</strong> - a boyfriend.<br><br>P.S: You are worrying over nothing my dear angel. There are times when we have to keep things simple, and perform what we have to do each day and so be it. This would be the time to do that, first. Until when your vision of your relationship is clearer, probably you can move your consideration to the next level. Enjoy your relationship and work hard in it - the rewards will befall if fate grants them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ask yourself this:-<br>Is he the one you can grow old with?<br>Do you see yourself loving this person 40-50 years down the road?<br>Do you see him as the father of your child?<br>Can he be a good father, provider and lover?<br><br>He should ask himself the same question about you too.<br>A marriage is a match when both party have their life goals aligned.<br>It is about 2 people from different background living and sharing their lives together as a team.<br><br>Note: Marriage is not like baking a cake. You must not base your decision upon the length of your b/g relationship.<br><br>About Financial Security:-<br>What kind of financial security are you expecting?<br>Will you love him less if he is poor?<br>If financial security is what you base your marriage decision on. I can assure you, you will be dissapointed.<br>In a marriage, it takes 2 to acheive financial security. A rich man can be broke (financially) if he marries the wrong woman( a big spender).<br>Remember if you base your marriage on financial condition, financial reason will most likely also be the basis of your divorce.<br><br>Your last question:-<br>Future husband vs boyfriend. what is so different about the 2?<br>Treat your boyfriend like how you would treat your husband.<br>Ask yourself this :-<br>Do you want your boyfriend to treat you differently after you get married ?<br>Are you going to change into another person after you get married ?<br><br>Reason: If your boyfriend cannot treat you good now, he will not treat you any better after you are married to him. Same goes to you.<br><br>Lead a happy life. Don't start taking each other for granted. Once you do, it's not worth it anymore.<br><br></div>
