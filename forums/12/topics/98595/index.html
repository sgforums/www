            <div class='col-md body'>Dear nice guys and nice gals of AA forum,<br><br>Its been a long time since I posted advices or things of my own up here. Here, I shall post an incident that I encountered recently.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">A little background of the incident:</span><br><br>I am studying in a tertiary institution in Singapore. I have known this group of friends for almost a year. Some of the days, my lessons start late in the afternoon but this group of friends has early lessons in the morning.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Incident:</span><br><br>2 months ago, I started to go to sch early to join this group of friends in doing sch work and for lunch, then we would go for lectures together after that. I was really happy in joining this group of friends as I enjoyed my time with them. At the same time, I could do my work and if theres anything I duno, I can ask them. It was wonderful to be with them.<br><br>However, things changed. Thru one of the group members, I got to know that my presence in the group made some of the other members felt uncomfortable. Upon hearing the news, I was really sad, hurt and disappointed. I was trying my best to mix with the group and ended up in this state. I have no idea of what happened and it would be not appropriate for me to ask ppl directly.<br><br>I do not wish to cause awkwardness between the group of friends. Thus the only thing I could do now is to back off a little, not to go to sch early, not to cause any of the people in the group to feel uncomfortable. That will also mean I lost a sense of enjoyment and gained sadness, disappointment.<br><br>Some people may say that y not find another group to join in? I will reply them "Its not easy to mix into a group and not easy to find a group u can fit comfortably into it, much less to say njoy the time with the group. Once U find comfort in the group, it wont be easy to just say go and then go. "<br><br>Any idea or advices on how to handle such a situation? Hope to hear advices from all the nice ppl in AA forum. Thnx in advance!<br><br>NB: Pardon me for the long passage. Hope its not too confusing. If u all need more background info, I willgladly provide it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In such a grouping, there usually are bound to be a few who don't feel easy at your presence when the group is large enough or sort...?<br><br>Besides, you're sort of like an 'outsider'... It'll probably take time... Even then, there's no guarantee that things would always turn for the better... I'm pretty sure such things can happen too even if you initially started off joining them as their initial grouping.. So don't worry yourself too much about it unless things get too 'rough'...?<br><br>If you feel that there're much 'tension' within the group.. You can try either of the 2 strategies...<br><br>1.

Over a certain period of time...<br><br>2. Delayed Time Interaction - Instead of going to school SO EARLY... Just go a 'little' earlier... You may wanna increase the 'earlier' time frame when things get better...? So that interaction time with them is not so long and hence some of them could be more comfortable with it...?<br><br>Above all, you can still stick to your original routine.. Just monitor that things don't get too out of hand...?<br><br>Since I'm here, tell you a story? My interaction with my buddy's friends... A basketball group... They're relative closer to each other compared to with me... Cause they even often hang out together... I don't really hang out with them except basketball sessions.. Is that gonna make an alien..? Well... I figured out.. No... Surely some of them are indeed not that comfortable with my presence at 1st... But I thought at least I'm an average Joe... So despite all the unhappy happenings, I just tagged along... When things became too unpleasant, I skipped a few meetings with them to ease out the tensions a little...

This group including me consists of 2 guys and 4 gals.<br><br>I really cant sort out the reason that I am being taken to be an 'outsider'. Things are more obvious lately. Recently, this group of frens decided to give a surprise trip for a makeover to one of the birthday gals of the same group. I was totally excluded and only got to know they planned the surprise thru some casual chatting. I mean the bday gal was also my fren so I was thinking how come I was left out of the surprise thing. Well, I was given the reason the bday gal might feel awkward. I was like totally puzzled as to why will she feel awkward when we are all frens?<br><br>Well since they decided, there was nth i could do but to accept it. Last week, they decided to go and collect the makeover phtographs. Again I was not informed till the last min when I heard from another fren. So after class that day, I tagged along with them. Its was pretty obvious that I was like not welcomed cos everyone was toking their own stuff and I was totally left out in the blue.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>After the trip, I went home, and thru one of the gals in the same grp, I realised my presence made some ppl felt uncomfortable. Mayb I went without being invited so that makes me so irritating. But I really duno as frens, y is it that I did to deserve that???? Its not as if I am a pestering bug or some irritating bugger.<br><br>I was totally hurt by it as I mentioned before.<br><br>The only reason I could think of was some of them felt I was pestering one of the girls as I have some feelings for her.<br><br>To me, that is not true as I went to sch early so I could do my work and spend time with my frens. Y must or shld they link the 2 things up together??? Now It makes me feel so lost and I stil have to face them almost daily.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> Haiz, now got to like wear mask to face them.<br><br>Pardon me for the long and naggy story.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well you got 2 choices:<br><br>The Evil way: (for chaotic evil aligned characters only or those that wanna be chaotically evil aligned)<br><br>THe chaotic evil character is the bane of all that is good and noble, such a character inspires a clique or at least keeps it together around him by bullying the other weaker members into submission. The chaotic evil character does not hesitate to smite or strike a member of the group who insults him or questions him. THe chaotic evil character does not appear weak nor will he ever allow his companions in the gang to be weak, the chaotic evil character will destroy or wipe out those in his clique that do not follow him or are not loyal to him.<br><br>Examples of chaotically evil characters: Stalin, Hitler, men_@_arms (when he is in a bad mood), Devil, most sg forum moderators, sec4 batch of SAS NCC 2001, my ex-gf etc etc<br><br>But since u appear not to be evil..<br><br>alternatively:<br><br>Be yourself, do what u normally do, socialise more, find new cliques and perhaps try not to appear to be TOTALLY concentrated on this so called "group that shuns you" so much.<br><br>But i know its hard if ur rejected in one group and if u look around elsewhere, the other groups feel ur a reject, and the cycle goes on until u end up with the "REJECTED OUTCASTISH" group that plays mahjong on the PC every day for fun..<br><br>So you can hire me and my other outcasts to hang around with u to give the IMPRESSIOn that you are COOL AND HIP AND HJAVE A CLIQUE of your OWN!! I can pass off as cool coz of my ethnicity and cool HEELY shoes that i can do stunts in <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  me mates skateboard and do rap <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Haha but seriously.

Like I've said, rejection among a minority of a group is only normal... Don't expect yourself to be 'Mr Popular' yeah?<br><br>Meanwhile just carry on with whatever activities and interactions you deem fit with them... Don't expect to be 'accepted' so soon... REMEMBER!

I used to hang out with one group and then got "kicked out" because I told them off regarding dumping all the project work on me  (happened several times). They just ditched me like your group ditched you.<br><br>After that , I didn't care. I found some new friends by luck , they were the quiet bunch that no one ever notices or cares about them but they turned out to be  good friends til today. Go mix with other people is my advice . Quiet ones , the nerdy ones , the wallpaper type - some of them may make good friends because they are not "groupy ". Don't bother about the other group - groups pick and chose who they want .</div>
