            <div class='col-md body'><p>I have some bgr problems with my gf.. We are in our 8mth relationship. Recently we have been in unhappy moments when we go out with friends in a group.. It seems to be happening everytime and is just comes suddenly without any reasons.. One example is my frenz came my hse overnight. In the middle of the night, as my friends are hungry and they wanted to have supper, we went down to the nearby coffeeshop. Upon reaching, i ask my gf if she wanna eat.. Coz i knew i not hungry and c if she wanna eat.. Then she said in a sacastic manner "if i dun wan to eat y come down?" I was quite pissed by her sentence but went on to help her order what she wanted. We did not tok since then. When we went back hm, i felt she was quite pissed with mi. I did not went to ask her why as i felt quite unreasonable y she was pissed with mi as i did nothing. She is those anti social kind but all these kind of outings is mainly what she requested and it seems like she is unhappy at times. Sometimes i really dun feel like goin for such outings but i knew she like it so i went along. But it seems time n time again we ended up been unhappy with one another. It was also the same issue when we play online game tgt with some friends. She will keep say mi nvr go save her and stuff and which i really hate it. I felt i am not super pro and tried my best and is just game why need to take so seriously. The purpose of gaming is to have fun but ended up in quarrel and stuff. I was thinking of telling her all that but i knew solution will not be found as she will ended up telling is all her fault and etc. I seriously dunno what to do then.  I can say when times when we have cold war, i will just keep quiet which makes her even angrier. I think that is something i should change. hope i can get some advice from u all guys. Anyway we are 20s, not small kids. </p></div>

              <p>Your gf needs attention. The novelty of the attention she received in the early stages of the relationship has worn off. Familiarity breeds contempt.</p>
              <p>She is now feeling resentful at the slightest lapse. This is a cultivated habit. People are usually unforgiving to their family members for the slightest mistake, than they are to their friends. e.g. a plate is broken by the brother, she screams at him. A plate is broken by a visiting friend, never mind.  The same principle here.</p>
              <p>Ignore the sarcastic remarks, and try to figure out what her problem. And try to humour her, by joking, being a clown, making her laugh. Your smiling face can cool her down too. And say words of appreciation to her. Good of her to come down and accompany you, thank you for yesterday whatever, so treating her etc.</p>
              <p>She wants attention.</p>
