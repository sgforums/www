            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tek_koh:</div><div class="quote_body">precisely, that is the big dilema perhaps since Hp and email were invented?<br><br>what made the Ts check in the 1st place?<br><br>is it a fling?</div></blockquote>Actually that's a very big question regarding this dilema.<br><br>In the past, I had a gf who probably 2 3 4 timed me. Many of my friends who saw her outside told me of the matters but I thought since I love her, I should trust her. But when too many pple told me the same matter, I asked her and she denied very innocently and even got worked up. I felt so bad for suspecting her. But in the end she still dumped me for another guy. Actually she went steady with that guy before she broke up with me. The irony was that so called 3rd party didn't even know I was her bf after seeing me. The mentality I took was to trust and never check her HP.<br><br>I also had another gf who I suspected something wrong and I checked her phone and found that she and her ex actually re-ignited old flames while we were preparing for ROM. Really broke my heart. Of course we broke up.<br><br>When people are prepared to go into a relationship especially after so many failed due to infidelity, we must be prepared to have the other party checking up on us. I also understand that the both sides could be checking on each other frequently. This is because of a natural reaction to desire to know more about each other. There can be many empty talk about trusting means shouldn't check. Or even a barrier of privacy. But in terms of a committed relationship, the barrier is non-existance. The only thing you can keep from your other half are the confidential work related matters. The only way to reduce the frequency of such checkings on emails, hp is to build up the trust. Talk is cheap, it is via your daily actions that you let your other half know you deserve that blind trust. Let your other half check all he/she wants. Because if you got nothing to hide means you have nothing dirty to be found out. After some time as the suspicion grows weary as more trust is instilled, there will be a day when the checkings will stop.<br><br>But the trust is easy to smash and hard to build. When the trust has been built up yet smashed down, the next time to rebuild it will be harder or even impossible. Think thrice before doing anything to jeopardise the trust.<br><br>Therefore the best way is never to endanger yourself (esp. girls) into situations whereby you can be victimised by people with an integrity problem. In the first place when you already have a relationship, why would you want to go out alone with an opposite gender. If the person is someone you're not familiar with is even worse. It will not hurt, in fact be better if the outing is a group outing. Creates a healthier bonding as friends. My wife does that and so do I. Catch a movie or go track riding, we have our own circle of friends.<br><br>After talking so much. The main idea to get across is about building trust. And recognise each other's need for a reason to trust the other half. Then win that trust via your actions regardless how long it will take. Also do not endanger yourself into situations whereby you can potentially lose the trust of your other half.<br><br>I'm not some pro counsellor, but had my fair share of ups and downs in life. Also learnt things the hard way like many of you go through. But hopefully I manage to share some insights regarding relationships from a married man.</div>
