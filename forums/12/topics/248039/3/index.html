He has done the wrong thing by seeing another woman behind your back but it doesn't make it right for you to do nasty thing back to him (his car whatever).<br><br>I am not sure what kind of person he is, you might make him angry enough (for damaging his car) to hurt you physically.<br><br>Think about the consequences first.  I know you're angry with him but do not let your anger lead you into doing the wrong things.  Try to move on with your own life.<br><br>I am sure you'll find someone better somewhere down the track soon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
