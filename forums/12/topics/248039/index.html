            <div class='col-md body'>Hi TS,<br><br>Even if you burn his car, he can always buy another one. But you have to eat black bean rice for doing that like some of advises earlier. It's not worthwhile.<br><br>I'd advise you to confront your bf and find out the truth. Trash things out. If you cannot stand the truth that your bf did such a thing, break off with him. I must remind you. That if he can do this once, are you sure he never did it before your Australia friend? And after your Australia friend will he do it with another person? If what you typed is exactly what happened. I don't think your bf is trustworthy. A very dangerous person to be with.<br><br>Many years ago, I've had such 'friend' before. We were motorbike rider friends and always like to roam around on our bikes in the night. One night he asked me to go out with him to settle somethings. He went to 3 different places and had to settle his problems with 3 different girls regarding their abortion. I was probably asked to go along in case he would be beaten up. And also none of those 3 were the gf he had that I knew. This same guy went to hospital to visit me one night and stole another patient's Nokia8210 (it was the latest phone at that time) and then he refused to admit. I suspected he was the one who did it when being confronted. The patient sleeping next to the victim pointed at me and said "That guy lah! his friend stole it!" Making me look like is accomplice. A lot of nonsense went on until this 'friend' ended up kneeling down in front of the victim to beg him not to call the police. Anyway I've broken off all contacts with this guy.<br><br>According to what you typed, your bf can easily fall into this category of people. Guys or girls will just want to stay out of reach from this person. Continue this relationship or not is your choice.<br><br>But I hope you will make the best decision for your future. Good luck!</div>
