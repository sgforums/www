            <div class='col-md body'>The worst kind of 'advise' is to take revenge upon relationship betrayal.<br><br>By executing revenge on the person who betrayed you, ultimately drops your integrity to the same league to the 'traitor of the relationship'.<br><br>It not only keeps imprisons the person inside the fallacy of getting justifications, it also prolongs the pain of the person by postponing the time for the person to start anew and receive a new relationship.<br><br>Also when one indulges in the idea of revenge, that person jeopardises his/her livery by contemplating illegal moves which can be costly to both the person who betrays and the betrayed. And sometimes innocent 3rd parties.<br><br>Lastly, if the person thinks that revenge is compulsory to balance the loss and gain, it speaks how much of the integrity of that person. Probably that person deserves to be betrayed in the first place.<br><br>TS, Please re-consider. Keep your pride and integrity for you will not stoop to the same league of a 'traitor'.<br><br>All the best.</div>

It's a good way to relief your hurt.<br>But after bawling it all out.<br>Do not look back. Do not cry anymore.<br>Your precious tears should not be shed for that as*ho**.<br>Take care and wish you all the best babe. ^^</div>
