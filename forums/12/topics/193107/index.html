I would also bring my wife for a ride during the night, speeding across the highway in Singapore. If my wife wants something within my limits, I will definitely get it for her. heh.

The thoughts came out when I'm thinking of my future...<br><br>Firstly, I would like to have a career that I can support myself as well as my family. Before that, I would like to marry a girl who isn't too pretty nor ugly and start a small family with her.<br><br><span style="color: red;">That's nice, we all need family love.</span><br><br>I hope that we can own a 5 room flat (and a sports car? xD). Back to my career, I would like to earn an annual salary of around 60k.<br><br><span style="color: red;">In Singapore, annual of $60k is only enough for a single! (my opinion). And if u wana buy a HDB of $200k or $300k, better think harder! U r renting the flat for 99 years and ur descendants get nothing after that. Sports car? Can! Hyundai Tuscani counts?</span><br><br>After having my career established, I can have some time with my wife and children travelling around the world, perhaps to Japan or America. I would also bring my wife for a ride during the night, speeding across the highway in Singapore. If my wife wants something within my limits, I will definitely get it for her. heh. Spending my rest of my life with my wife till our hairs turn white.<br><br><span style="color: red;">That would be wonderful, really.</span><br><br>Perhaps this is the life for a Singaporean like me?</div></blockquote></div>

You are right to let the descendants to work their way thru..Unfortunately, in real world and singapore aspect, many childrens will ask their parent for financial supports when they really desperate..You will tell them to die, your wife won't. Utimately you got the fun, your wife bear the fruit of your fun..(No hard feeling)<br><br>Many good officers are no good investors, hence I wouldn't ask you to invest. Keep the saving for rainy day as I mentioned..else make your life easier will be good.<br><br>100K...is actually no much too when you had exceeded that..<br><br></div>
