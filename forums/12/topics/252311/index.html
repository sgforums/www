            <div class='col-md body'>This gonna be long...<br><br>I admit I am an introvert, or perphaps I was... I don't know, haven't met any new people to confirm that.<br><br>Anyway, I remember when I as in secondary school, there was this guy, he asked me to lent him my Pokemon Yellow Cartridge, I lend it to him, and well, I told him he might as well keep it, since it was a bootleg copy anyway. A few months later he said he wanted to catch all the Pokemon, so he asked me to lent him my Red version, my Red version was original, so I told him to remember to return it to me.<br><br>A few months later, it was my birthday, there was some event for my school going on and I didn't know how to go to that place, so the same guy offered to bring me there, he came to my house in the morning that day. I showed him my Gameboy Color and Pokemon Gold Version, I remember him saying he wanted to buy a Gameboy Color too. And after that day, my Gameboy Color and Pokemon Gold Cartridge went missing...<br><br>A few months later, it was Christmas and my uncle bought me a Gameboy Color and Pokemon Sliver version, I brought it to school and battled with that same friend who had a Gameboy Color now. CRAP, IT WAS EXACTLY THE SAME COLOR AS THE ONE I LOST! But, I didn't like confrontations and I didn't care anymore.<br><br>A few months later, I bought Pokemon Gold version again, some senior wanted to borrow it so he could copy the game, apparently he had some game copying device, so I though it was okay, and brought it to school. He tried to copy the game but he was out of memory, so I lent the cartridge to him. He never did return it, and my friend never did return my Red version either...<br><br>Sometimes, when my friends were in need of money for urgent matters most of the time, I would lent it to them if I could, $30, $40... yep, I lent it to them. But they never did return the money to me. I didn't mind at all, I didn't want to confront them either, I though it was okay. But soon, I realized people started saying, you need money lent from him lah, no need return one... I felt really hurt, especially since people can actually say that infront of me...<br><br>I always treated people drinks and snacks regularly, I always thought friends wat, so gei gao for what, but soon they begun taking advantage of me, asking me to buy snacks for them, again I didn't mind at all. But there was once, I needed the $ to buy something I like, and I really felt hurt that people kept using me, so I pushed a guy to the floor. Well, he didn't felt angry, the second day we were friends again.<br><br>So there was once an outing, okay, this was quite a joke, but anyway, 1 girl said she wanted to eat ice cream, den my friend commented, here got no ice cream, oni got "lolipop" u wan? Then pointed to the few guys there, but didn't point at him... It was like I didn't existed...<br><br>Sometimes, my friends would go out for basketball/gyms, but they didn't call me to join them, but I guess its understandable since I don't like these stuff, but recently, we had an MSN chat about an outing. I was included in the chat, but as one of my friends were counting who was going, he actually left my name out, even though I was in the conversation itself...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>After I graduated from Secondary School, I told myself, I was be stronger, better and be the best everything I do, so people won't look down on me again. Well, I did, my Poly friends seem to treat me better, but I don't know if that because my grades were good or because I was really a true friend. But I always tacked along whenever I could to my Poly friends outings, even though I don't play LAN, I followed them to the LAN show sit at the corner. I feel my friend with them. I don't know if I have become more sociable or not.<br><br>But towards my Secondary friends, my main grp of friends, I remain the same quiet old me...<br><br>What have I done wrong? People seem to treat me as non - existant...</div>

If you are rich, give urself a treat once in awhile with those love to eat guys! You pay for yourself, not pay for others. If those were real friends, never will they ask for return and instead, if you give in, they will give you back too!<br><br>Furthermore, you don't like sports and you don't like Lan gaming? Then what do you like? What you do during your past time? Hmm. If can, try to pick up playing Lan Gaming. It will widen your social life and of course it kills time! =) BTW, you just entered Poly?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey man, I'm facing the same problem, take a look at my thread here in AA.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>For me... most of the times it's like I'm invisible. Example, there's this guy I was quite close to last time, so I'll ask him "hey, let's go for lunch, tell me when you're going". Then, he just reply "Mmm" and continue to do his work. Then the next thing I know, he left without me. This isn't the first time, many outings I wasn't informed of.<br><br>I do make efforts to try and chat and make friends, but this is very slow and I don't seem to be making progress. I'm still being treated like non existant. Being rejected from project grouping even though the group is not full. the excuse? "Ask him", "ask her" (ask other members) and it'll just go one huge circle over and over again. Or they'll say "next time see how lorr" on MSN when I talked to one of them.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
