              <p>Hello Everyone. i would like to hear your opinions and advice on this issue. I have been with my gf for around 4 mths before i have to embark on a overseas work attachment trip to China for 6 months. Even in singapore i feel that i cannot fully trust my gf due to the fact that she likes to club and she cannot control her drinking properly. She is naturally a friendly person and i know many guys will like to take advantage of that such as a few cases where guys such as her friends or her juniors will invite her to go to their rooms to "share" aircon or just hang out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally i have never been this suspicious of my past gfs but somehow i feel that i cannot fully trust my gf right now. I was quite ok until the first time she went clubbing after being with me and she got seriously drunk and i had to go down to bring her back because her friends called me to go down instead of bringing her back themselves. They went back clubbing while i waited with her until she could semi stand and i helped her back. That was a pretty terrible trust breaker for me when i saw how badly she could get drunk as she can't control. Anyone could have taken advantage of her then.</p>

              <p>Friends who are girls are called girl friends. Among all the girl friends that you known, the one whom you like the most would most likely end up as the closest friend among all your girl friends, and you would term her as girlfriend. Note that this term is singular and the word girl and friend formed a single word. It represents that she is the closest girl to your life at that moment in time.</p>
              <p>Remember, closest doesn't means you own or possess her. Girlfriend is still a FRIEND, so do treat her and take care of her better than any of your other girl friends. </p>
              <p>You should not placed restrictions on her, hold grudges against her, doubted her, intrude/invade her privacy, and even instructed her. You do not have any rights to her whatsoever, so do bear that in mind at all times if you want to be a better boyfriend to your girlfriend.</p>
              <p>Despite feeling insecure and being possessive towards your girlfriend, please understand, accept and acknowledge your girlfriend for having a different lifestyle than you. If you are not able to agree to this, then you are not worthy of her. And you don't love her at all, it's just pure lust that you are feeling towards her.</p>
              <p>You should be proud that she have her own lifestyle despite it's not the kind that you may find yourself suitable for.</p>
              <p>She has obviously sacrificed alot for you, even to the extend of putting up with all your unreasonable requests in this relationship. She doesn't deserved to be treated like this.</p>
              <p>Treasure her better and cherish her more if you still love her and want this relationship to grow.</p>
              <p>Every guys and girls will go through what you are going through at the moment, but it's up to you to break out and overcome your own fears, insecurities and grow in character.</p>
              <p>You will find that not everybody is able to overcome this, but I believe you will overcome it after you have understood what I've shared with you.</p>
              <p>Both of you deserves to have a better relationship together, and you just need to believe in her and yourself.</p>
              <p>Good Luck.</p>

              <p><br>Look. There's no reason to lie on a forum right? i'm not looking for sympathy votes. I have had sex with her on many occassions but i don't really feel the urge to do it. Honestly, physically she's not really the type that would turn me on plus the fact that i'm not that huge down there and she ain't that tight either. Anyway, the point being i think i can tell if i am with her for lust or love at this point because if it was for lust..... i wouldn't even bother posting a damn thread. Why the hell would i even care about a sex toy?</p>

              <p>You miss the point of sex. Sex is an act of intimacy arising from deep love for someone. If you see sex only as physical pleasure then maybe thats why this relationship is heading towards a dead-end.</p>
              <p>Also, you have no idea how painful it is when someone is tight. All that bullsh1t about tightness being good u see in pr0n is overrated.</p>

              <p><br> i  have sex with her and i want to EVEN if she doesn't turn me on in a sexual way. I'm basically stating i don't have the LUST to have sex with her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And how would you know i have no idea how it feels for someone to be tight? You tried and know all the females i've had sex with in my life? Tight for me doesn't mean tight until u have to spend ages and tons of lubricant to get it going right? As long as it's tight enough for me to cum. When i say loose i mean loose to me andi really don't feel any grip at all.. i find it much harder to cum. Nothing to do with my little brother because tested before no problem and i don't blame her also.  </p>

              <p>Ohhh men. It's all about the cumming. Don't you know sex can be satisfying without an orgasm? Ah well.</p>
              <p>Anyways your defensiveness and frustration is evident from your posts. Maybe you really have to just consider the ugly possiblity that your relationship is not what you think it is? Worrying like you do while overseas for a long period surely can't do your mental wellbeing any good.</p>

              <p>Try and voice out to her. If not, try helping her and find solutions. If seriously, nothing can be done, you can either just accept the way she is (anyway, she isn't even cheating on you, it's just you fearing that would happen, if not, just called off this relationship...since you think she's isn't the one for you</p>

              <p>Friends who are girls are called girl friends. Among all the girl friends that you known, the one whom you like the most would most likely end up as the closest friend among all your girl friends, and you would term her as girlfriend. Note that this term is singular and the word girl and friend formed a single word. It represents that she is the closest girl to your life at that moment in time.</p>
              <p>Remember, closest doesn't means you own or possess her. Girlfriend is still a FRIEND, so do treat her and take care of her better than any of your other girl friends. </p>
              <p>You should not placed restrictions on her, hold grudges against her, doubted her, intrude/invade her privacy, and even instructed her. You do not have any rights to her whatsoever, so do bear that in mind at all times if you want to be a better boyfriend to your girlfriend.</p>
              <p>Despite feeling insecure and being possessive towards your girlfriend, please understand, accept and acknowledge your girlfriend for having a different lifestyle than you. If you are not able to agree to this, then you are not worthy of her. And you don't love her at all, it's just pure lust that you are feeling towards her.</p>
              <p>You should be proud that she have her own lifestyle despite it's not the kind that you may find yourself suitable for.</p>
              <p>She has obviously sacrificed alot for you, even to the extend of putting up with all your unreasonable requests in this relationship. She doesn't deserved to be treated like this.</p>
              <p>Treasure her better and cherish her more if you still love her and want this relationship to grow.</p>
              <p>Every guys and girls will go through what you are going through at the moment, but it's up to you to break out and overcome your own fears, insecurities and grow in character.</p>
              <p>You will find that not everybody is able to overcome this, but I believe you will overcome it after you have understood what I've shared with you.</p>
              <p>Both of you deserves to have a better relationship together, and you just need to believe in her and yourself.</p>

              <p><br>I have to disagree on this part, a relationship is also talking abt to change to suit one another, I understand as a gal, u will tell the guy that it is unfair that the gal need to change her lifestyle.  But let say someday, u boyfriend have some lifestyle that u cannot agree with, will u wish he will make changes for u.  I have heard number of gals that expect the guys to change, reason as what u "If he love me, he will change for me".  So why make this statement that "If you are not able to agree to this, then you are not worthy of her. And you don't love her at all."  Can I make the same claim for gals who expect the guy to change for them?</p>
              <p>"She has obviously sacrificed alot for you, even to the extend of putting up with all your unreasonable requests in this relationship. She doesn't deserved to be treated like this."</p>
              <p>I believe in a relationship both party had make the same sacrificed, for one who think that only the gal/guy is the one making it only.  I can only say that they dun deserved to be love becos they dun know the love.</p>
