But, where does you stand in his heart - I can't conclude from looking at your words alone. You HAVE to speak and talk to him about.<br><br>Don't start pointing fingers and trash things; speak in cool voice and handle this matter rationally. When talking to him, appear emotionless, neither anger nor worried, just be yourself like a normal average day. He will be shocked and stunned when you talk to him - do it in a way right, probably he will seek for your forgiveness. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Remember your way of handling cannot be offensive in nature. Communication is the key - Well, benefit of the doubt is given for first time offender.<br><br>Then whats next? (Think Starhub  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> )<br><br>You could try two ways; after the communication, the proper talk, life continues and be happy with it - he would treat you better in a way, at first.<br><br>OR, during the communication, ask him IF there is still anything he is keeping away from you. If he were to say now, forgiveness will be there. Warn him if one day, he were to be caught red-handed on something - that's the end since it is multiple sins; Lying, breach of trust, disloyal, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Everyone should have a chance, but after the first one given, its gone forever.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers<br></div>
