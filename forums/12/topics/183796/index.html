            <div class='col-md body'>Let's see it from this angle:<br><span style="color: red;"></span>First, he cheated on you. Then he said sorry and that he was a fool to leave you. Then he, again, cheated on you. Who is to blame in the FIRST place? HIM. Who is to blame in the SECOND place? YOU. Who is to blame in the THIRD place? BOTH of you.<br>Why? Ok.<br>First, he cheated on you and left you heart-broken. His fault.<br>Second, he said sorry to you but you doubt him but you still say sorry to him. Your fault because he is probably thinking this. "I can cheat on her again cause' she feels lost without me."<br>Thirdly, he cheated on you yet again and you STILL sent him a SMS. Both fault. He cheated on you again, and you still sent him a SMS which will make him think that you LOVE him TOO much. Even if the SMS says something bad about him or whatever.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"></span>He is just the rotten apple in your "Love basket". See? You picked up the WRONG apple to stay with. So now he is thrown out of the basket. Sooner or later, another apple will come. Get it? It continues. And continues till' your fated person comes along. =)</div>
