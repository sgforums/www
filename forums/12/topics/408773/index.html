              <p>we were together for 4 years, but were never really happy because of one problem.</p>
              <p>he is unacceptably (to me) sticky with his twin brother. they sleep on the same bed at home, share all clothes and boxers, share laptop. same school throughout (but school put them in different classes). applied to all the same overseas unis and went to one of them together. chose each other as roommates. all their friends are common friends (they have different classmates, but some classmates got to know the other twin, and they dont really talk to people not friends with their twin.</p>
              <p>they were never separated, except for couple of months during summer when they did different internships. they got so lonely and depressed that they said sometimes they cry.</p>
              <p>last christmas i made my boyfriend fly back to sg during his break. his twin wanted to stay in US, but i managed to persuade my boyfriend to fly home (we are in an LDR and only get to be in the same country 2 months a year). so they both flew home. he wanted to spend christmas with his brother and friends (all guys). they were having dinner in town, so i said we could have desert together after his dinner. so he left them after dinner and met me. an hour later his brother called saying he has reached home and wants him back. so he left, and i almost cried on the mrt home.</p>
              <p>they are now working in the same state in US (but not same company cos they both didnt get into any company together) and they got a car so they can see each other all the time. i am in and have been in singapore all along.</p>
              <p>i have no other problems with my boyfriend. he is nice to me, listens to me gripe about work, watches "girly" movies with me... well he doesnt give me any valentine's present or birthday present, nor does he send me home, but i dont mind. what i mind is that he is saving money for his brother. he buys expensive shoes and watches and clothes (and shares these with his brother), but he cant afford a card for me on valentine's day.</p>
              <p>he asked me to marry him, and said the 4 of us can live in a big house with big tv. i dont want. i want to be the one he calls when he needs help, i want to be the one he discusses stuff with and share things with, but i'm not. i said i'll leave the relationship if he doesnt not behave like an independent man his age (ie cannot call and talk on phone every day with his bro, try to make new friends without asking his brother along). but he said why should he, it's his brother. he also said all their friends called me a monster for trying to split them up.</p>

              <p>actually, it's an good idea to have both fall in love with
              TS...if they fall out over TS, her problem could be solved.</p>
              <p>if they never fall out and instead wanna share TS among
              themselves....i dunno how TS may wanna view this

              <p>we were together for 4 years, but were never really happy because of one problem.</p>
              <p>he is unacceptably (to me) sticky with his twin brother. they sleep on the same bed at home, share all clothes and boxers, share laptop. same school throughout (but school put them in different classes). applied to all the same overseas unis and went to one of them together. chose each other as roommates. all their friends are common friends (they have different classmates, but some classmates got to know the other twin, and they dont really talk to people not friends with their twin.</p>
              <p>they were never separated, except for couple of months during summer when they did different internships. they got so lonely and depressed that they said sometimes they cry.</p>
              <p>last christmas i made my boyfriend fly back to sg during his break. his twin wanted to stay in US, but i managed to persuade my boyfriend to fly home (we are in an LDR and only get to be in the same country 2 months a year). so they both flew home. he wanted to spend christmas with his brother and friends (all guys). they were having dinner in town, so i said we could have desert together after his dinner. so he left them after dinner and met me. an hour later his brother called saying he has reached home and wants him back. so he left, and i almost cried on the mrt home.</p>
              <p>they are now working in the same state in US (but not same company cos they both didnt get into any company together) and they got a car so they can see each other all the time. i am in and have been in singapore all along.</p>
              <p>i have no other problems with my boyfriend. he is nice to me, listens to me gripe about work, watches "girly" movies with me... well he doesnt give me any valentine's present or birthday present, nor does he send me home, but i dont mind. what i mind is that he is saving money for his brother. he buys expensive shoes and watches and clothes (and shares these with his brother), but he cant afford a card for me on valentine's day.</p>
              <p>he asked me to marry him, and said the 4 of us can live in a big house with big tv. i dont want. i want to be the one he calls when he needs help, i want to be the one he discusses stuff with and share things with, but i'm not. i said i'll leave the relationship if he doesnt not behave like an independent man his age (ie cannot call and talk on phone every day with his bro, try to make new friends without asking his brother along). but he said why should he, it's his brother. he also said all their friends called me a monster for trying to split them up.</p>
              <p>am i a monster?</p>

              <p><br>Maybe the twin bro, exchange place. When your bf turns up, he is more intimate, but when his twin bro turns up, he suddenly appears to be unfriendly and unopen. Maybe your bf and his bro are playing musical chairs with you. So you could be dating two guys. 2 for the price of one, you are lucky.</p>
