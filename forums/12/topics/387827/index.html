              I got myself confused after I had returned from Perth. Ever since my son was born, I'm leading a very good life with my friends around just like before. Whenever I'm in singapore reminds me of my ex-bf. We started contact recently and now i broke every chances that will bring us like before. I hate him. I felt that he had not done enough for my son. But to him, he felt that he had already done alot. He always wants me to think in his shoes but never once he will think in mine. He had not seen his son from the day till now which already been coming 4mths old. He told me his family will be his piority. He always claimed that he want to do this and he want to do that but in the end i didn't see anything. He told me his automotive company is not doing well and always use time as an excuse.
              
              Yesterday I had received a call from family center and this lady claimed that william had asked them to talk to me as in between us were misunderstandings. I were so pissed that i called him and he avoid my calls. So i called his company and his wife answered. I asked for him and she claimed that he is not around. Then i asked her which law firm will be represnting them as i need to inform my side. His wife DL replied that she will get their lawyer to call me but i waited till now.
              
              This i went to my friend's law firm and sat there for the whole morning with my mind empty. My friend told me to sit in the concerence room and told me the proceedures but i realised am not listening. What do i really want? I asked myself and i can't find the answer.
              
              In my mind is only i want to let the world know who is this man and who is in his family and who is my boy related to this man. I hate him hate him hate him.

              <p>Pardon me,sound like you are talking to one side of your story.</p>
              <p>I am not trying to be crude mind me asking are you having affair with him since he already got a wife?If so,i am sad to hear that.If William is cheating on you without revealing that he is a married man then i feel kinda madness for a lady to get laid even without knowing the man background in details.Now kinda pointless to cry over split milk.</p>
              <p>It is reductant to force a man who just wanna have fun with you and claim your child to be father.Trust my word,he will not take you for serious even though you may force him to claim for child flesh and blood father.</p>
              <p>I will like to hear from you through phone and talk to you in person if you are keen.Deep in my heart and i know you really need a listening ear to hear your cries and agony.I am not perfect but i will do whatsoever to comfort you in your distress and help you to pull through it.Remember you are not there alone.</p>

              <p><strong>If a man care for you and why will he wanna avoid you and did nothing
              for you.Think about it.What will you get from him since he does not
              even bother about you?For a man,he dealt with the bussiness thing becos he is bread winner to feed his family as a head of the family.</strong></p>

                                      much for this man.</p>
              <p><strong>That's only your personal judgement which does not mean he will not do well.If you think you have done far too much for this married man,then let him go.</strong></p>
              <p>Unfortunately, he had been avoiding and hide
                                      under his wife dawn’s skirt. I will never never let him off</p>
              <p><strong>Do you think he is hiding under his wife dawn's skirt?No, the fact is he love his wife.He may just out of his foolish and unfaithful act to result you to get pregnant.He just wanna have fun with your body once he has enough and it is game over.You are only putting yourself in agony and his family as well.Trust my word you will never get him becos he does not love you at all.Just let him go and start your life afresh.A lesson to learn and a price to pay so start to plan for your child.</strong></p>
