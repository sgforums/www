I feel like this has to be said out loud at this point in time simply because well, I love Singapore. Increasingly, there is an atmosphere of unhappiness and anomie among Singaporeans and so I asked myself, is this how we all feel as a people? While I cannot give an answer to that question as I would simply be generalising, I can give an answer for myself – that is, no, I love that I am Singaporean. If I actually feel happy about being a Singaporean, then why is it that I get the sense that Singaporeans are really unhappy these days?</span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19.5px; color: #333333; font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19.5px; color: #333333; font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">I believe the issue lies with social media. Constantly, my newsfeed is filled with well-articulated articles and comments with topics ranging from critiques of our governance, critiques of our policies, to linking any issue under the sun with politics. These are actual, well-founded arguments and criticisms that need to be taken note of in order for us to improve as a nation. The problem is, as a people, we will always be able to locate areas to critique about any aspect of our nation. It is perhaps human nature that propels us to be more expressive in our unhappiness rather than happiness. For instance, in my everyday life, I feel happy and satisfied but I hardly feel the need to voice this satisfaction. However, the moment I meet with grievances, I feel the need to articulate it. What happens is that the same phenomenon appears on the social media platform. Many of us who feel happy with the current status quo will not feel the need to voice our satisfaction and what we end up reading everyday are voices of unhappiness – hence creating such an anomic atmosphere.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19.5px; color: #333333; font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19.5px; color: #333333; font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">When I say that I am happy about being a Singaporean, I do not mean that our nation is flawless. I am not saying that 6.9 million is a perfect number that we can all be happy about. I am not saying that train faults are natural and should be accepted like sun and rain. I am not saying that I love every part of National Service so much, just like every other policy in Singapore. What I am saying is that amidst the flaws and problems which we need to deal with as a nation, I am happy with Singapore and I love every moment of being Singaporean.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19.5px; color: #333333; font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">I love that I do not have to be overly conscious about security when I walk on the streets. I love that when I walk on the streets, they are generally clean. Wait, this is a point I have to emphasise because I have been told by my girlfriend how brilliant our waste management system is in the form of Pulau Semakau – the fact that our streets can be this clean is a bigger achievement than we can appreciate on a day to day basis. I love how I can sit down for a cup of kopi before an important interview, each cup tasting almost the same regardless of the coffee shop, even though it isn’t a franchise and doesn’t cost as much as Starbucks. I love how I can take a bus to walk along the streets of Ang Mo Kio where I grew up and visit the shops that I am familiar with. I can write all day and the list will go on.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19.5px; color: #333333; font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0px; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19.5px; color: #333333; font-family: 'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;">The main point of me writing all these is that I believe deep down, we love this nation and all want the best for it. We may criticise and criticise but as much as there are things flawed in this nation, there are twice as much that is right. I worry that if we do not spend time articulating our love for this little nation, we may truly submerge ourselves in this growing atmosphere of unhappiness. So rather than sit back and continue thinking about what is wrong and what can potentially be wrong, I ask all of you my friends, to take a moment and think about what is right and what can be right. Reflect on what you love about this country that you grew up in and take the effort to articulate it. For just one day, for a change, I would so much rather see my newsfeed flooded with updates of why we love Singapore. I have taken the first step. I love Singapore.</p>

              <p>Jay,</p>
              <p>i think you are mixing up love for country with love for government.</p>
              <p>keep the two separate.</p>
              <p>singaporeans do not hate our country, we just don't like the way our govt is running the place. </p>
              <p>When you defend the country, you are defending your love ones, you are defending the land you call home.  You are not defending your government. The government will likely be the first group to run for their lives because they can.</p>
              <p>Do understand that a self serving government does not love you. </p>
              <p>Our government is paid to take care of the people. Are they failing ?</p>
              <p>When unhappiness is expressed, it does not mean we do not appreciate the good. </p>
              <p>If we keep focusing on the good and ignore the bad, we will never improve, we will not progress, we will stagnate as a nation.</p>
              <p>Fixating on the good makes you feel great, it's a fantastic ego booster. That's all.</p>
              <p>but looking at negative reviews and thinking about a solution to turn a negative into a positive will make you a better person. </p>
              <p>Stop comparing yourself to your crappy neighbor.</p>
              <p>think about how we can out do the better nations. When we get there, everyone in our nation benefit from our hard work. Just as how our forefathers had done for us.</p>
              <p>If you love your country, you give her your best.</p>
              <p>If "not bad" is good enough, it just means you don't love your country enough.</p>

              <p>knn, that is why the ah dou is so damn bloody super low class yaya.    without the father he will not be the PM , this is open secret everyone in sg knows.</p>
              <p>I believe ah dou will be made to pay for every negative and evil deed he did and is doing to us when the time is right. the heaven is so kind and compassionate to him to allow him to be cured of the cancer but he is not repentent by doing good to the people he is accountable to.   </p>
