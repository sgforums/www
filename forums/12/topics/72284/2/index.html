            <div class='col-md body'>i'm sorry to hear tt lyn, gosh... but just curious, when he asked to wait for a yr, gotta settle something, did he tell u what thing was tt? if not, i'm afraid tt could just be an excuse, coz maybe he didn't wanna break up directly w u; trying to run away and hide, hoping things would turn out alrite by themselves...after all, u've had good times together, just tt he didn't realize by doing this he hurt u more. u're doing the rite thing alrite, moving on and wishing the best...dun worry, there're still lotsa gd and faithful guys out there... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
