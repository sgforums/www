            <div class='col-md body'>you are not stupid and you are not alone. I am like you. I love my gf. although I am not sure if she had left me for another guy, but I cried almost everytime I think abt the happy time we had together. frankly, I will not want to hide. I had sex with her almost every nite we wanted to. although I tell myself it not just for sex I want to be with her. but I really enjoyed being with her. with all the quarrels, unhappiness, I miss them. I miss the hugs her nagging and her kiss. and also, although I am not like you had waited for 7 months, I left my 1 month was the longest time of my life. I went drinking whenever I really can't take it. cried after every drink. but what can I do to win her back? I really want her back... I want to get married and grow old with her. all that is what she wanted, but now she say her heart is die and don't want all that anymore. I don't believe she don't love me anymore. during the process of breaking up, I hurt my arm and she was so concern. she still have me in her heart, I can feel it. but just is what made her having the decision to break up with me, I really don't know. who can tell me. I have posted something abt this matter here b4 as 'break up sorrows'. can search and ready abt it and you will understand further how I feel. I still love her.</div>

I miss the hugs her nagging and her kiss. and also, although I am not like you had waited for 7 months, I left my 1 month was the longest time of my life. I went drinking whenever I really can't take it. cried after every drink. but what can I do to win her back? I really want her back... I want to get married and grow old with her. all that is what she wanted, but now she say her heart is die and don't want all that anymore. I don't believe she don't love me anymore. during the process of breaking up, I hurt my arm and she was so concern. she still have me in her heart, I can feel it. but just is what made her having the decision to break up with me, I really don't know. who can tell me. I have posted something abt this matter here b4 as 'break up sorrows'. can search and ready abt it and you will understand further how I feel. I still love her.</div></blockquote>Actually, 1 month is quite short... realistically, the time you spent with the person/or how long the relationship lasted, divide by 2 sometimes by 3 or 4 if the relationship lasted over a year+. That is the amount of time, it will take you to put that person behind you.<br><br>You never really forget about the experiences you had with that person, but you should always remember the happy ones and leave behind the sad memories. At the end of the day, be it when you're old, you can reflect on a colorful past you have had, and realize its the people you meet, you befriend, you cherish and to hold that is important and made a significant impact on your life.<br><br>Be merry.<br><br>*Warning* Please do not do anything silly like hurting or killing yourself. You will only regret it.</div>

I only realize it yesterday after my bike lessons. initially, I wanted to get a bike licence and if one day I am not careful get knock down and die. but after getting through the stages during the lessons, I feel so happy to move up to different stages of that practical. then when I got through, I was so happy. so I agree with you on concentrate on other things. don't think abt bad times. enjoy good times. then you will not feel bad. I am planning to pass my bike and get a small cc one and ride and enjoy my life instead of the idea to ride and get knock down. that is all rubbish</div>
