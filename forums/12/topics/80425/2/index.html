I can understand if she finds it difficult to say, but the bottom line then is that there is communication problem. this is something we have to get over with lah.....and the 3 day "cool off" period is really needed to do some quiet thinking, so that we can be calm about it, and not get so agitated abt it. Agitated people always say stupid things, and that is not constructive.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

We will meet every other day. But as time past, he will not call. I request him to sms me in the morning and call me when he reached home. As time past, he finds it troublesome. He said i don't trust him but that is not my point. I wish to know how is he? So finally now we compromise to call/sms me every night. But he gave me a feeling that he don't like it as well. I didnt stop him from meeting his friends nor restrict his freedom but he still say that i am possessive. I am lost.</div>

It is not so much that u stop him from meeting his friends or what, but the fact that u want to know everything about him that is driving him nuts.
