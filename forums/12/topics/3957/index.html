You can't expect her to ditch her bf and go to you right ?<br>Admire her from far might be the option (suggested above) for now, but you'll just marvel at her and wish and wish that she'll be yours.<br>Treat her as a good friend, and IF She breaks up with her boyfriend, you might be her next choice.

I can only say, even no matter how stable u think a relationship can be there is definitely ups and downs. The thing is not to take her away when she is down. Is to help when she needs help when ever she needs support. Even to the extent u r going to give her away to another guy... Then she will know that the true u is to make her happy. I'm sure if that's wat u think that means u really love this person. Becoz it's a feeling based on her happiness and not ur own.<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>
