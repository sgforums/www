              <p>Do take care of yourself when attempting to slim down. Don't be too harsh on yourself and starve yourself as they may have unthinkable consequences.</p>
              <p>Use exercises to cut down your weight.</p>
              <p>Watching your diet will help too. Avoid eating fried food too often.</p>

              <p>It's good to lose some weight, but i think we shouldn't overdo it...Just slim down slowly and healthily. Try to eat more meals and in small portions...It's quite effective!</p>
              <p>I used  1.5yrs to clear away 14kgs... haha... Exercising does helps! For me i always choose to walk a longer route, e.g if there's a short cut and a long route, walk the long route as a form of exercise if u have the time, increase ur activity by probably climbing stairs/overhead bridge... and also swimming once a week... And then control ur diet, drink more plain water, eat more fruits, never eat supper... Do some sit ups and crunches... Hmmm.. with that i believe u'll be able to lose weight!</p>

              <p>Hi, I'm roughly your height and weight, too. I have low confidence in myself, but I feel that it has lessened over the past years. Being confident is your choice, but the people around, mainly your friends, play a major role in this. Because I am a person who would lose confidence if someone calls me 'fat', or similar names. Being beside a pretty girl, a handsome guy, makes me feel very out of place, too.</p>
              <p>But, thanks to your thread and the replies I have seen, it has made me feel more encouraged too. I hate running, and I love eating. See, that's my problem. I try to cut down on snacks, and eat proper meals. It has helped a little, but I eat when I feel bored. I hope to be able to find a sport that I enjoy, and motivate myself from there.</p>
              <p>Good luck to you. :)</p>

              <p>Don't worry, eventually you'll find your true love.</p>
              <p>you know, many guys (including me) are actually looking for girls with bigger build or frames, reason being the girls of such properties seem to have better health and would produce taller children.. (some might disagree with me)</p>
              <p>Of course guys would nt prefer their mates to be taller than themselves, but, I would say your height would definitely be an advantage to you as a girl. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>hi. i am a girl who has been visiting this forum regularly. decided to come and post about my troubles..</p>
              <p>i am a bigger build girl and i am below average looks. from young, i have always been bullied and called names such as 'ugly' etc.</p>
              <p>from then on, i have never ever had confidence in myself. especially when talking to attractive girls or guys as i feel inferior to them. no idea how to improve myself..</p>
              <p>whenever i see them, i feel that i don't belong to this world, and like the world is cut out for smaller build people..</p>
              <p>can someone tell me how to gain confidence in myself?</p>

              <p>hi hi.. =)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>hm.. dont be too hard on yourself ok. People may call you names like ugly etc. But then beauty is rather subjective. They may find you ugly but to some others, you maybe a really attractive girl. Anyway physical beauty is not everything.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dont have to feel inferior etc. Hey just tell yourself that you have some unique talent or abilities that not many others have.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess the important thing is to be positive. In a way, I am kinda like in your situation. But I am trying to reflect and change for the better.</p>
              <p>You know I feel that jogging is a good way to keep fit and lose some weight. You might want to try that ya.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for confidence, why dont you try talking to more people? Be it online or in real life. You can talk to me too yup. Just pm me for my private contact details like msn address etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>take care =)</p>
