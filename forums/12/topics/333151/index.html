              <p>hi hopeless,</p>
              <p>if you're dissatisfied with the way you look, then change it. we're not living in medieval times. there are plenty of plain looking women who carry themselves well and with confidence with the right grooming.</p>
              <p>you're big in build, then slim down. diet. buy uZap. exercise. liposuction. surgery whatever. when you look around you, there are many attractive people out there, men, women, tall short slim toned etc, plenty of them. one will surpass the other. eventually all are the same. looks will fade. what separates one from the other is what really matters. chin up girlie, and get cracking.</p>

              <h1 class="subject">Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder.</h1>
              <p>It's not that you're "ugly", it's just that people have not learnt to appreciate you. Do you know that women that're generally bigger in size are preferred over petite women in ancient China? The Chinese believed that having a bigger body (hence a bigger set of hips) is vital for childbirth.</p>
              <p>Apparently, beauty deviated so much that it has become a norm for one to be stick-like in order to be classified as a 'beauty'.</p>

                  try to dress up a little sometimes. those glamour girls you meet, you wont believe the amt of time they spend on dressing up.

              <p>hi hopeless,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no ugly girl but lazy girl.</p>
              <p>First of all you need to know where is your problem. Like what you said is your big in build..</p>
              <p>so what i can suggest to you maintain a low protein diet with high fibers meals. Less carbonhydrates. No tibits and soft drink only plain water and fruits. Tone up your body..Look lean but not big.</p>
              <p>And before you start out with any program weight yourself, measure the area where you want to burn to keep lean.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And set how much to reduce. example 10kg and set a target of duration example 5 kg =&gt; 1 month, 10kg =&gt; 2months.</p>
              <p>Control yourself to keep to your diet and excerise prog.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you are more confident, go shopping for sexy top.. like singlet and bare shoulder top which can show off your nice tone shoulder.</p>
              <p>Get some skirt and sandals.. will make you simple and pretty.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>U obviously are mixing ard with wrong bunch of pple.  Change ur grp of frenz who appreciate u bcos of ur virtues w/o magnifyin ur flaws.  The right grp of pple will encourage u &amp; help u to build up ur confidence levels (by improvin wat u think tat makes u low confidence).</p>
              <p>Of cos, u r the key person.  If u are not determined to improve urself, even the right grp of frens cannot help u much.</p>

              <p>Why now so many of them need to gain confidence? I thought that only happens when a guy wants to propose to his loved gal????</p>
              <p>From ur post, u give me an impression that "ni bu ai zi ji"......When looks concern, someone can say"ni bu mei" but you must not say that 2 urself!!! Even at time when i hit 68kg mark, i also feel "wo shi mei de". </p>
              <p>As long as u hav 1 pair of eyes, 1 nose, 1 mouth. U are a normal gal / person. Bigger build girl? How big build is big? How small is small? 50kg 165cm is small? 70kg 165cm is big?</p>
              <p>If u think u are big? fat? blah blah..... Go n do something. Run, breeze walk, swim, join big walk, great eastern run, shape run etc...</p>
              <p>Rich enough, go to nutritionist, plan ur diet well.</p>
              <p>Dun be a loner, go n join group outing, meet for people from diff class of society.</p>
