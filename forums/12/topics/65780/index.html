They never even say a thank u..i have to pack the hse too...when they lose their things or can't find, they pushes the blame to me...worst still, they dun allow me go out...wad is this man...juz dun get it...even if go out, onli can go tm...the rest of the place..forget it...real sad...always cope up at home..now..lonliess has becum a frenz of mine...i live in a world of my own...</div></blockquote>Wow... can feel yr hatred... U r now entering teenage life rite...? Coz very seldom parents will "confine" their kid when da kids r "old" enuf...<br><br>I have my own fair share of "problems" wif my family... I only see them once a week or a forthnite. &amp; I dun speak to my pops more than a sentence unless he asked me smth.<br><br>As for my mum, wat she asked of me... I do. My brother? Wat he ask me to do, I oso do... But later disturb him lah (body splash him while he on my bed)<br><br>I do not noe wat WILL happen if I was in yr shoes at dat age. All I do noe is: when some1 grows up, they mature slowly bit by bit. They start to learn &amp; be aware of da things happening ard them. For now U may hate them... but in da near future, U may tink otherwise.<br><br>Juz take dis as a learning experience... so dat when U have a family of yr own, u sure dun wan yr children to hate u, rite?<br><br>FUMO!!!</div>
