Your Qing Mei thingy? or just a friendship or kinship type of feeling? I have to agree on one point and that is Blood related cousins cannot be together. Or is it SHOULD not be? Well i wont know since we actually had people who eloped twice with their own cousins respond to your topic. Lets say its really true emotional love. Well I believe you are mature enough to be able to distinguish between what is true love and what is not. But does she? Think of yourself during her age...were u able to? But i suggest u spend more time with her though, and the only reason i advice you to do this is to find a lamp that lights up your path, walk it with compassion, walk it with love, end your journey, hopefully, only to realise that you do not necessarily need crushes to get on with life happily.
