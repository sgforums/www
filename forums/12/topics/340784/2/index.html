              <p>what i am saying is - if you need him to talk (say in words) to understand what is bothering him - then mebbe also u don't understand him enough or observe him enough.</p>
              <p>communication isn't just about words/talking.</p>
              <p>Some people find it harder to express in words. and yeah u are right, people like that always find it harder to get along with others. We all have failings ba - and  i always find it most touching when someone understands me without me saiyng a word.</p>

              <p>i got a serious topic here...and i need comments, and suggestions &gt;.&lt;</p>
              <p>so i was with this guy for 2.5 years when we broke up. we quarreled a lot then and after one major quarrel, we eventually broke up. it was an unpleasant break up and we didnt remain in contact after that at all.</p>
              <p>10 months after we broke up, he contacted me again. we talked for awhile and eventually patched after realising that we were still very much in love with each other.</p>
              <p>although it seemed awkward at the beginning, we soon got over it. during this period of time, i would say that it was the happiest period of my life. it seemed to me that both of us have grown up and handle things more maturely now. i would say we have become more understanding towards each other's feelings. this was one problem we used to have in the past.</p>
              <p>we lasted for another 5 months together without any major quarrels. we were like any other happy couple out there, i was happy, i knew he was too. he once mentioned that he feels we are very stable now and i thought so too, until he left me again.</p>
              <p>the thing is, he usually doesnt tell me what he is not happy with me. and out of the blue, he mentioned a break up telling me that he "cannot stand a lot of stuffs".</p>
              <p>all i know is that it is accumulated anger all let out at once.</p>
              <p>what irks me a lot is, that i dont even know whats the reason why we broke up.</p>
              <p>why cant he tell me what is it that he is not happy with? why does he tell his friend but not me? why does he like to accumulate anger in him and not tell me about it and choose to left it unsolved by leaving me at the end?</p>
              <p>we met up today, and i tried to talk to him. he seems to still be angry over some hurtful stuffs i said last week (even though i said sorry) and was still persistent with his decision of a break up. he was rushing off to somewhere else so i didnt really have the chance to persuade him any further.</p>
              <p>should i wait for a while before i talk to him again?</p>
              <p>or should i just move on without this guy in my life?</p>

              <p><br>I don't think it's fair for us to tell you what you should do with this guy.</p>
              <p>But if you want to find out the answer for yourself, you can try to imagine getting married to him.</p>
              <p>Will he walk out on you one day out of the blue?</p>
              <p>Will he become a better person after he's married?</p>

              <p>if u do get a chance to talk to him abt this... i suggest u dun use words like "stubborn" and then try to suggest that he change himself. since he's already broken up with u, we can safely say tt ur previous methods of making him solve problems rather than run away are not working... if u really wan to get back together, do change the way u approach the problem.</p>
              <p>if u really love him, and treasure the relationship, pls try to think more positively of him... focus on his good points rather than his bad habits... and also, really consider what went wrong in ur first and second try at the relationship. were his complaints justified? if yes, change the way u talk to him.</p>
              <p>i can't tell whether he still feels the same way for u, since this is just fr ur pov. jus curious... u didn't even realise tt he was unhappy in the rs. what makes u so confident tt he still loves u? :/</p>
              <p>it is likely tt he confided in his fren cos he felt tt he cldn't talk to u... sometimes, it's nt abt the actual ctrl... sometimes it cld be the tone of ur voice tt bothers him, or the way u offer him suggestions... dun do it in the "teacher" way... most guys have their pride when it comes to money issues... he may feel slighted if u offer ur suggestions in a "i know better than you" kind of voice... have u ever complained at one pt or another abt him being broke? if u have, i suggest u don't do it again...</p>
              <p>after all, u're only his gf... u dun need to help him so much with his everyday life... trust tt he knows what to do with his own money. and if he doesn't... i tink he will prefer learning abt it himself rather than being taught by his gf. u jus have to be there to support him when he's broke...</p>
              <p>having said all tt, if u feel tt u actually haven't been ctrlling him at all... then u do need to face up to the possibility tt all the probs btw u may be cos u guys are too different in personality and nt compatible for a long term rs. both of u may actually be happier with other pple.</p>
              <p>it takes two hands to clap. u can't change him if he doesn't want to change himself.</p>
              <p>it's better if u think carefully abt ur compatibility before u guys even make contact again. </p>
              <p>give him some space too, to think over what happened. and make sure u two agree on a solution for the lack of communication (it seems to me) that caused the breakup... otherwise... no point getting back tog.. u will jus break up again cos of the same prob.</p>

              <p>i got a serious topic here...and i need comments, and
              suggestions &gt;.&lt;</p>
              <p>so i was with this guy for 2.5 years when we broke up. we
              quarreled a lot then and after one major quarrel, we eventually
              broke up. it was an unpleasant break up and we didnt remain in

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Often, people conclude that the reason to patch is because 'they
              still love each other', but the conundrum is actually having to
              differentiate habitual reasoning against that of love. And I can tell
              you that the feeling derived from the latter can be equally formidable.
              Unless one possesses incredibly heightened self awareness, we are
              likely to be suck into a previous misery with excuses provided as
              above.</p>
              <p>Your man displayed periodically disruptive burst-fire in his
              relationship - suggesting strong Uranus influence. Also, his behavioral
              stance towards his relationship reeked streaks of avoidance-styled
              personality and this creates a fertile ground to breed enmity and
              contention because the day when he finds you is the day of judgement. </p>
              <p>For
              Love, like dough, needs to remake and remodel constantly, to settle
              into a good shape - a relationship devoid of proper communication stays
              static and is vulnerable to destruction because it lose the elasticity
              to survive.</p>
              <p>Your man is probably subjected, typically, to
              the belief that 'you ought to know what is wrong, yet you don't work
              towards changing it'. This is probably a classic narcissistic
              perception that exist only in the psychological framework of the
              individual and this have ruined even the best of relationships.</p>
              <p>It's
              almost like you walking around with your friends, doing some xmas
              shopping, while you are about to perish (literally) from hunger. Even
              as you look listless and weary, they continued their journey.
              Eventually, you suffered this acute gastric pain and blew up, blaming
              them for causing you this plight.</p>
              <p>So does the fault lies with the person or his/her friends?</p>
              <p>Neither.</p>
              <p>Because the root of problem is about non-communication.</p>
              <p>Your
              man probably has another set of problem - his inability to communicate
              kinda fueled his tendency to resort to initiating breakup to ease his
              emotional tension. He might probably regret and comes back (however
              sincere) to sell you the 'belief' stated in my first paragraph. But
              seriously, that's not the point because the cyclical routine of such
              meaningless 'break-patch' pattern will shrink and become shorter to
              achieve one full circle, with every break-up experience.</p>
              <p>Life is finite - seriously, you don't have to stop your pace
              completely just because you reckon that you might want to give him
              another chance. It is possible to saunter forward, while deciding if
              you were to place another blind bet on leading a paranoid relationship
              that could, any time, transformed itself into a sudden episode of
              departure, without adequate reasoning. If you could still afford to
              weather such possible cataclysm, then he definitely still has a
              fighting chance in your heart.</p>
              <p>P.S: Love is very much 51% decision and 49% superfluous factors. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>on thursday afternoon, he asked me out, telling me that he misses me a lot but i was occupied with my school work so i couldnt meet him.</p>
              <p>on thursday night, we argued.</p>
              <p>on friday, we broke up.</p>
              <p>hmm, do you think he still loves me?</p>
              <p>i like to think that he still does.</p>
              <p>i thought we could sort things out slowly while we were still together but things happened too quickly in such a short span of time that i cant even keep up with it.</p>
