              <p>i got a serious topic here...and i need comments, and suggestions &gt;.&lt;</p>
              <p>so i was with this guy for 2.5 years when we broke up. we quarreled a lot then and after one major quarrel, we eventually broke up. it was an unpleasant break up and we didnt remain in contact after that at all.</p>
              <p>10 months after we broke up, he contacted me again. we talked for awhile and eventually patched after realising that we were still very much in love with each other.</p>
              <p>although it seemed awkward at the beginning, we soon got over it. during this period of time, i would say that it was the happiest period of my life. it seemed to me that both of us have grown up and handle things more maturely now. i would say we have become more understanding towards each other's feelings. this was one problem we used to have in the past.</p>
              <p>we lasted for another 5 months together without any major quarrels. we were like any other happy couple out there, i was happy, i knew he was too. he once mentioned that he feels we are very stable now and i thought so too, until he left me again.</p>
              <p>the thing is, he usually doesnt tell me what he is not happy with me. and out of the blue, he mentioned a break up telling me that he "cannot stand a lot of stuffs".</p>
              <p>all i know is that it is accumulated anger all let out at once.</p>
              <p>what irks me a lot is, that i dont even know whats the reason why we broke up.</p>
              <p>why cant he tell me what is it that he is not happy with? why does he tell his friend but not me? why does he like to accumulate anger in him and not tell me about it and choose to left it unsolved by leaving me at the end?</p>
              <p>we met up today, and i tried to talk to him. he seems to still be angry over some hurtful stuffs i said last week (even though i said sorry) and was still persistent with his decision of a break up. he was rushing off to somewhere else so i didnt really have the chance to persuade him any further.</p>
              <p>should i wait for a while before i talk to him again?</p>
              <p>or should i just move on without this guy in my life?</p>

              <p>Ask his friend ?  So what hurtful stuffs did u say ?</p>
              <p>Maybe the reason he broke up was the hurtful stuffs u said ? I am sure u asked him what stuffs u cannot stand and if u already showed that u are willing to change n he still doesnt care..</p>
              <p>move on without this guy in your life then. Unless he is giving u some self examining time.. which i think is fudged up if he doenst tell u what is it that he doesnt stand. But got 2.5 yrs + 5 months u should know some of his habits , what he likes or not , unless he hides it so well there is no way u know what he is thinking at all.but then , it seems like u know what he is thinking...</p>
              <p>All i feel is that the feelings n emotions are very inconsistent the way u decribe it. mmmm.....</p>
              <p>Well, wait maybe a few days, but atm u can text or call him. But dun need to go into long talks. Just hi , bla bla bla.. then say u gotta go just wanna see what he doing n bye. Then maybe few days or a week u call him, n the usual but then ask him what seems to be the problem in a nice concerned way. Tell him that its unfair to you not knowing the reasons and that hopefully by him telling you, you can change or be a better person with or without him. And that if he still cares for u , he will tell you. N if he still persists , u know the answer liaw lo.</p>

              <p>haha.</p>
              <p>i tried to tell him that as long as we are together, we can always iron out any difficulties together a couple of times already. he tells me he understands, but it doesnt seem to go into hid head.</p>
              <p>then out of the blue, he will just bomb with with a break up -.-</p>
              <p>i love him too much to let go off this relationship too easily. i know he still loves me. i guess as long as he is willing to speak up and tell me whatever he is not happy with, we will definitely be the happiest couple in the whole wide world.</p>
