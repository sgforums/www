              <p>Poor Henshin...so much well-meaning advice!! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/oh.png" alt="oh.png"> </p>
              <p>Go out with her as normal, but do try &amp; flirt with her a little to show your interest. I agree with wat some forumers said here: if u don't show (yr interest), she'll never know!! &amp; in the meantime she might hook up with other guys who <em>do </em>show their interest..</p>
              <p>This has happened to me a few times; eg. guy A told me he wanted to get to know me. He  acted  platonic &amp; 'normal'. No signs, signals or hints that he wanted more. Fine. So I treated him as friend lor..Didn't have any ideas about him. I responded to another guy B who quite clearly showed he was keen.</p>
              <p>Imagine my surprise when A later told me he liked me??! I said, 'huh?? I'm with someone else..'</p>
              <p>Actually, I was attracted to A, only since he acted strictly platonic..</p>
              <p>If u r interested in someone, show it!! We ladies not psychic u know..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              oh dear, do tread lightly. I can speak from experience. Once, a friend of mine told me he had feelings for me and well, suffice to say, I kinda handled it badly and it took a toll on our friendship. Nowadays, it is still awkward, even though it has been so many years. 
              
              So try to put it in a way that you have a exit strategy... that you may still be friends even if she doesnt like you. It's hard, but you gotta try love.

              <p>It could be due to an increase in workload for her, that is why she is spending lesser time talking to you.</p>
              <p>Of course, if you look at it negatively, it could be because she has noticed something from you already and is trying to stay slightly further away from you, or that she has someone else in her life already.</p>
              <p>If you are really keen on knowing why, ask her directly yourself. But please do not pose a direct question like, "Why are you ignoring me?".</p>
              <p>You should ask her something like, "You seem to chat less recently, is it due to an increase in workload?"</p>

              <p>If not, then please work harder to become at least one of them.</p>

              <p>Does she know your intentions yet?<br>What do you like about her?<br>What do you think she might like about you??<br><br>Have you tried sending her flowers on random days(get someone to deliver it to her office/home)<br><br>It's always the guys putting in more effort in the beginning.. once she's yours.. more likely she'll be more focus on trying to maintain the relationship that you're.<br><br>Don't just drop hints.. be frank, plan a night romantic night out or sumthing.. then tell her ur intentions. A friend of mine once told me that.. it's boring for girls to go out with a guy that's always giving in to their needs.. they'll just get bored and things will get shaky.<br><br>Gd luck</p>

              <p>That means she does not want the relationship to go on any further than being just friends with you.</p>
              <p>You have two options now :</p>
              <p>1) Give up.</p>
              <p>2) Try to work on areas of yourself which you know you can improve on so as to impress her and make her change her mind. It will not be easy though.</p>

              <p>That will depend on what kind of girl your friend is again.</p>
              <p>But odds are sincerity will not work since she is already hinting you to keep your distance.</p>

              <p><br>Let her know that you like her WHEN she is enjoying a conversation and focus on you.</p>
              <p>She may not say YES to you on the spot, but she will also find it difficult to say NO to you.</p>
              <p>At least she will be aware of your deep interest in her, and you don't really need to win her over in one round.</p>
              <p>If you can survive her first round of NO, then you will do better in your next round.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since you have admitted that you have none of the qualities to pull off a one round confession, then don't worry if you do not succeed in your first attempt. It's not the last round of your confession and make sure you don't give up and treat your first attempt as your last attempt. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
