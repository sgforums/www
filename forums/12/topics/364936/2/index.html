              <p>Some of us have given you the answer.</p>
              <p>Do not ask directly first. Get someone who you can trust and is a friend of both of you ( preferably a girl ) to ask her if she has any interest in you.</p>
              <p>If yes, you can get ready a flower or some present for her, then ask her to be your gf and go out with you.</p>
              <p>If no, at least you will still have your friendship with her.</p>
              <p>The reason why this friend must be trustable is because she MUST NOT leak out that you are the one who want to know whether the girl is interested in you, and she must be thick-skinned enough to lie while keeping a blank face.</p>

              <p>although i've no gfs or frens, i've read plenty of good dating books which says that the chances of getting rejected is very high if you just ask the gal outright (e.g "u love me?", "do u want to be my gf"?</p>
              <p>reason being:</p>
              <p>1) if u ask this kind of question, how is the gal supposed to answer you? gal's mentality not same as guys; for this kind of question, you can't expect them to say "Yes!!!!" like a man.</p>
              <p>2) by asking the gal for "permission" to be her bf, you're degrading yourself in her eyes and lower your own self-worth.</p>
              <p>3) lastly, don't go down the wrong route, where u like the gal but end up as her "girl-friend", if u know what i mean. Meaning, she tells u all her problems but has no romantic interest / sexual arousal with you. That means, the longer you know her and it drags on, the more it is to your disadvantage.</p>
              <p>of course got people marry their best friend, but for a lot of others i see everywhere, when the guy ask his female friend if she interested in relationship, mostly fail.</p>

              <p><br>how to get her start liking you? firstly, don't be a wimp and do everything for her, or be available at her every beck and call. this is the way of the Wimp. U wanna be one?</p>
              <p>instead, start teasing her and flirting with her.</p>
              <p>she'll get attracted to you in a romantic-type of love, not those friend-friend type.</p>
              <p>start flirting and teasing her for 3 weeks and come back here and tell daddy how it works.</p>
              <p>of course, i'm assuming u know how to tease and flirt with chicks.</p>
              <p>and buying presents for her is a no-no, because 1) you're telling her on a sub-conscious level that you're buying her with $$$, which is bad and 2) you're telling her mentally that she's on a higher-level than you and that's why u need to pay "tribute" to her.</p>
              <p>be a farking man, and by August 09, i want to see vids of you trashing her in bed.</p>

              <p>It is worth a try, but you will have to come up with a good reason ( or excuse ) for cooking something special and bringing it to her workplace.</p>
              <p>The average guy will not cook something and bring it to someone else workplace, and thus she would be able to put 2 and 2 together if you don't come up with some good reason which you can make her believe. </p>

              <p>U wait too long - the girl get hooked up to someone else. Or she puts you in the 'fren' category already - her reasoning is, if you really like her, you would have made yr move, right? Y must wait long long?</p>
              <p>Of course there r exceptions - as can b seen from the posts above. But in general, most ladies I know say you shouldn't drag things!!</p>

              <p>It is up to you, but you must weigh the pros and cons.</p>
              <p>It is good that you want to wait until the two of you have more time before you start dating her out and stuffs, but on the otherhand, if you wait too long, you never know who might just take her away from you.</p>
              <p>I am sure she has her own personal life, and not to mention that she also has her own co-workers, so are you prepared to take the risk?</p>
              <p>As the saying goes, chen re da tie ( striking the metal while it is still hot ), if you wait too long, you might just end up regretting it.</p>

              <p>That is why we ask you to get someone to ask her... otherwise how would you know what are her feelings for you?</p>
