              <p>I've gotten to a point in my life where i don't care about money. Yes, i do hold a good job in a good company, but i don't see the need to keep accumulating wealth by working hard to strive for promotions which means more money.</p>
              <p>Granted, i do not have any financial obligations. I am not married, i do not have to worry about big financial worries like housing, and my parents are well off enough to take care of themselves financially.I am financially independent because my job pays for my expenses.</p>
              <p>I guess this is the way i behave because i have always gotten whatever i want without any questions. (My father bought a me new car 3 months after i secured my first real job)</p>

              <p>Everyone have different wants in their life. To some as long as they are happy with their lives, they do not need to live in luxury to be happy. You might not have a high need for achievement nor power like some people which motivates them to aim higher in the career ladder.</p>
              <p>However, you might be starting a family in future so is your current income enough to support a family? You might not be attached nor have a girlfriend at the moment but somethings such things just happen.</p>
              <p>You should stop relying on ur family and live off your own salary and income. Avoid letting your parents be paying or buying things for you anymore to ensure you are financially independent to support yourself and your needs.</p>

              <p>Money , advatage. If u feel happy at what u got, and pretty sure it wont run out for the next.. say.. 1 to 2 generation, got no future plans about maybe say.. ur kids,ur wife. U can go pursue what u really want.. maybe ur happiness away from the confines of this money making machine ur parents, or parent's parents have pioneered.Money will run out. Just whether its in your time, the next...or who knows.</p>
              <p>But like they say, never taste the hardlife, never know how hard it is to earn the moolah, and will NEVER appreciate the simple things in life, n take pretty much everything for granted.</p>
              <p>Or .. once u know Jesus.. the worldly possessions are nothing but trinkets on this earth. Why not share some of that wealth. </p>
              <p>mmm... i wonder if there is KFC in heaven. Or somthing better. Damn.. i am still hanging on to my material needs !! ooowww !! Weak !</p>
