              <p>I make a very good salary to sustain myself. Which is what i am happy with. In fact, i love my job, i would do my job for the next ten years with slight increments each time if i could and not want to advance to a managerial level due to added responsibilities.</p>

              <p>SIngaporeans are not obsessed with money. its due to the hard life, trying to survive in singapore, not everyone has a good life like you, they have alot of bills to pay, they do not hv a good job and pay, their parents are not well off.</p>
              <p>you think us, singaporeans dun wan to slow down and enjoy the world meh? the problem is we cant. the moment we do that, foreigners frm china or other countries will get most of the jobs as they are and can be more hardworking.   </p>
              <p>if you think you dun see the need to accumulate wealth then might as well share the money with those in need; do some charity. it will do you good.</p>

              <p>there is no balance in the world,if one can enjoy , the other have to work hard to enjoy like the first person can but at the same time another person have to work hard to achieve wat the first n second person enjoy thats life cycle</p>
