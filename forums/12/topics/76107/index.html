            <div class='col-md body'>With reference to my posting, well I'm studying computing and logic and thus enthralled about how to make a decision given such ambigiuous situation and scenario.<br><br>Like in many examples I already stated, there are so many possible outcomes and possible decision to pick. How do a guy know when is a gal's want is a "want" and not a "don't want" and vice versa.<br><br>By stating "if u know...", that is assuming that a guy knows some information but this information is an unknown variable or parameter since the gal never says anything about this. Then we're back to the chicken and egg problem -- problem is bcos a guy doesn't know he has to guess and not bcos a guy knows something (gal's preference or thinking or opinion or mentality), then he can make a good guess and decision.<br><br>That's the assumption that guys already know certain information or mathematically speaking called premises which are known to be true. Which enables them to make a decision.<br><br>For example, if we say "if you know she likes you, then make a move..." The problem is a guy doesn't even know if she likes him (and she'll never say it), so how to decide if a move is appropriate? The condition is that "if you know she likes you" and this is transitivity in mathematics and logic.<br><br>Think this may serve well to be a Masters/Phd Thesis and we can spend 2 years writing 50 A4 pages discussing and philosophising over this Woman Psychology theory. Something to digest... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok, i truly have something to say on this cos this has always bothered me too.. the apparent, no means yes that all guys are so familiar with.. (i emphasize apparently) i feel that it has to do with wanting the idea of something, (i emphasize idea) but when the idea becomes real, u sort of realise that ur ideals are not going to make it n u're scared its not going to survive reality n suddenly u realised maybe u rather live with the perfection of the ideal than to face the harshness of the reality... what i'm trying to say is that these women REALLY want the IDEA of something, dun want the REAL something... (ok, i risk being humtum but women everywhere...but of cos, not all women do that lah.. alot are more aware than that..) crap? actually... i dun really know.. what do others think?</div>
