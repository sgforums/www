            <div class='col-md body'>It happens to people, just not that much if u happen to be someone who they like. Do not get down by such feelings. Most of the time, it only meant that u never found people of same interest to you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with what some had adviced you....find your own gp of frens...dun join in a clique just because u felt ostracised. Find some 1, or a few whom you can relate to, talk to, and hang out with. No pt trying to "stick" to them and get to know what they are talking abt....<br><br>However, if you think they are a gp of interesting pp whom u will like to blend in, then talk more often to them. You can learn something from their conversation and starts to ask qn..slowly integrate into their circle...<br><br>good luck! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by LazerLordz:</div><div class="quote_body">Find friends with similar interests.</div></blockquote>Yes, try to find friends with the same interests.<br><br>To the threadstarter:<br><br>Friends are plentiful, many come &amp; go, but some will be there to stay a long time.  That's when the word TRUE gets added to friends making them TRUE FRIENDS aka BUDDIES.<br><br>You will find that as you move along, no need to stress urself in trying to keep up with ur current friends.  It happends naturally, just like in a relationship.  You need no planning on what kinda programmes other than if its a special occasion.  Its SPONTANEOUS.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

So it is kinda hard to talk to you, because they would have to struggle to find a topic that all of you can agree on and can talk about.<br><br>Why not join a club or association based on your interest? There would be people there, and by mixing with them, you might be able to gain a few friends while enjoying yourself doing something that you like <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
