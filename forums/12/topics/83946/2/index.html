            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, u gotta make sure u can hold a very good conversation with her. It's important. Cause unless u have loads of cash, u are already one down in a department. U gotta rely alot on ur zest, ur spiritness, ur young feeling energy which she doesn't have to attract her. N ur conversation ability withher is very important.<br><br>I would think that simply approaching her n wanting to get to know her is a huge initial scoring pt cause u make her feel sexy n desirable such that younger men still find her attractive. But it's ur initial scoring point. I would think simply giving her your name card or write down ur no. or name on a paper n pass to her n juz tell her you would like to ask her out, if she's interested, call u back. So the ball is in her court n whether she feels good, she'll call back.<br><br>U c, when u ask for a girl's no... it's even harder cause they will think whether u are a psycho, or nutty person, or stalker or what. N they may think u may start going crazy n keep smsing her or calling her no. That's what she is worried about. So I would say, a better chance is giving ur no. to her, it eases the pressure on her. But u also run the risk that she nvr calls u... then juz dun go back to that saloon liao loh...<br><br>When u pass your no. to her, juz dun beat around the bush, go straight to the pt. Tell her u kinda like her, n would like to take her out for coffee. Juz go straight to the pt, be suave, be cool n put a dash of daringness n masculinity in it. It surely makes them feel honored... This initial feeling u give them will be a huge scoring pt n she'll see why not if she has no bf... If she says she has a bf... simply smile n laugh it off 'he is a very lucky man! It's been wonderful knowing u!' then retreat...<br><br>I strongly agree with the thing about dating older women. I prefer them too. But the thing working against us is the size of our wallets.. haha. They are much more mature, more sensual, they are in their sexual peak too. They are more in tuned with their emotions n thoughts n they dun get less crazy n siao. Mainly cause they have been working n have been more mellowed knowing that they can't juz throw tantrums n go nuts as n when they want. Older women? Anytime...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
