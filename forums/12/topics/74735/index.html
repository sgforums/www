Truth hurts but we need to know and face the truth.<br><br>Every people know themself some how or rather. Happiness comes from yourself. We all support your decision and listen to you. Yes, you will be sad and hurt when you think of him at times. Wondering why or maybe even put all the blame onto yourself. That's common.<br><br>What is the meaning of letting go? It's up to person to person. Fate lets 2 parallel lines meet for a reason. That's true. Be it good or bad. We learnt from it.<br><br>What you have said most people have experience it. You will not be the first and won't be the last. Lost and gain comes in a pair. Like what newton has come out with : With every force, there will be an equal and opposite force.<br><br>I too have lost someone. I cherish her now but she don't want to be with me anymore. I've lost but i've gain how to love. We don't know the future. But we know the present. Whatever is your decision, be it keep on waiting, letting go or whatever. Be happy about what you choose. It's terrible hurtful and sad to think about that someone at times. Even worse when you know he/she is happily with another person. But... Live through it. Jia you...<br><br>I'm learning and living through it too...<br></div>
