            <div class='col-md body'>dun trust u to take care of yourself or dun have faith in you?<br><br>hmm..perhaps he is the possessive kind..and also insecure..<br><br>last time my buddy used to have a bf like that..on and off, broke up many times..dragged on a few years..of course she also got other bfs in between.  My buddy is very pretty..she always has suitors.<br><br>Then this guy became very violent and abusive (verbally)..even scolded her and threatened to take his own life.  To a certain extent that he also harrassed me at the wee hours..saying he wanted to commit suicide etc etc..saying he is not a gd guy, did not take care of my buddy and so he felt sorry etc..<br><br>Due to the fact that my buddy's mum dun like him, my buddy broke off with him eventually and she said her love for him has died..no matter what, can never bring the feelings back anymore.<br><br>I think we need to build up trust lor.  How long have you known him and be with him?  was there anything you did that made him lose his trust before this?  If you still love him, perhaps you would like to give him a chance.  But if he ever repeat the mistake again, then perhaps you would really want to consider to break up with him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why was she out late?<br><br>Does this happen often - her staying out late, while the guy usually is home early / doesn't like late nights ?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by retrolover80:</div><div class="quote_body">A few nights ago, he wanted to send her home. It was dark and she wants him to go home first because he got work tomorrow. He did not trust her that she can take care of herself. Than he say something which annoyed her. And that is the start of it. He apologised to her. She told him not to call her but he still called because he was really desperate and dunno what else to do and he was the "kang cheong" type person. Few days later, he went to her house and try apologising to her. Than she said that he did not trust her.( Which its true; he does not completely trust her). And she now suggest a break-up.<br>Does this guy deserved to be forgiven?</div></blockquote></div>
