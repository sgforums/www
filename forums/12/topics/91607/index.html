You are <strong>indecisive</strong> of what you want.. even for short-term or long-term.. Too conscious and too much attention put in yourself.. that you neglected ppl around you.. You think you are plump.. and ugly.. but then again.. if you are.. no guys will date you out also.. Give yourself more confidence and faith.. However if oyu really think they had their eyes stamped.. then is it a good thing also.. at least you know these guys ain't out to look for pretty-faces or good figure girls..<br><br>Dun treat it as if is a date! Take it as a normal gathering.. Get yourself more comfortable.. Going out 1 v 1 doesn't mean you have to start a relationship from there or straight away... is jus to let you know each other better.. Dun feel inferior.. All you need is to <strong>build up your confidence</strong>, and your security! Get to know wat you want first!! Relationship this kind of thing.. take it easy.. there;s no rush.. you're still young!! If you still weird on goin out dates with guys alone.. call a few friends along if he dun mind.. or go out as a group.. maybe slowly you feel much better.. then go for a 1v1 date!<br><br>Cheer..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

And because of this psychological hinders, it is difficult for you to maintain close intimate distance with any other guys around you. Such informations must have fed from you since young and now when reality is changing, you still stick to this old thought.<br><br>Dump it aside and learn a new way of preception. You practice caution, for an unseen fear circled around your mind. Until the day when you can be at ease with yourself, can you be able to related to another's interest better. You think you are not right for them? However, they think they are right for you - if not, they wouldn't want to know you better in the first place right? Strengthen yourself - for <strong>an inferior person tends to attract partners that abuse them</strong>.<br><br>Do not ALWAYS presume that by accepting private dates, advancement by another - is a must for you to enter into a relationship. Nobody force - you make the choice. Keep an open mind - there is NO obligation.<br><br>P.S: Are you a Taurus, Virgo or Capricorn? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Because of that, you are not ready for any relationship. Not that there's any other inherent problem within you. In fact, your joyful personality is a beauty itself. Not everyone has it!!
