            <div class='col-md body'>In all fairness it is your parents who are sponsoring you and have the right to know whether you can indeed be proficient in the language in time to come. Its not unheard of that Singapore do send scholars to germany or japan (and these chaps can't speak a single native word then) to do a graduate degree. The scholars will spend a year to learn the language and familiarise themselves. I know a few of them doing rather well after that.</div>

Suppose you are to do a similar design course in your second language...do you feel confident enough to handle it? If you are not, what chance do you have of doing it in Swedish?<br><br>If you are, you must factor in a year of language classes. It also depends on the nature of your studies. It is one thing to study a technical subject such as mathematics or engineering in a foreign language, but if your course requires you to make oral presentations in Swedish, that's a different matter.<br><br>Guess you need to convince your parents you have considered all the implications and yet certain that you can do it.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Are you the only son?<br><br>If so, I can understand why they dun want u to go.<br><br>How long is the whole course?<br><br>Well, if I were you, of course I would want to get more exposure and study overseas.  However, I will spare a thought for my family first.<br><br>If the course offered here and over there do not have much difference, then maybe u might want to consider again?<br><br>Sometimes in life, we have to give up something that we really want.. but dun look at it as a 'missed opportunity'.  Look at it at the postive light, it's not a bad thing to stay here, you still have your family and friends here with you.<br><br>I know of people who study overseas and really miss home a lot.  After you come back, you might find that most of your friends have disappeared or lost touch with you.  It's not going to be easy at a new environment.  You know u have to pick up a new language, and adapt to the new environment.<br><br>I feel like telling you to 'follow your heart' so that you will not have regrets in future.  However, I think we always have to spare a thought for our parents also, especially if they are already old..and children are not with them, they will be constantly thinking of that child in another part of the world.  Can you leave with a peaceful mind like that? </span></div>
