              <p>You think back in those days when matchmaking was the tradition. Money has no part at all ? How foolish can you be ?</p>
              <p>Parents marry their prettiest daughters to the rich. And gave away the ugly ones to the peasants.</p>
              <p>Back in THOSE days.. rich men owns  HAREM filled with beauties of the land. Poor men would be LUCKY to even have a decent looking wife.</p>
              <p>NOW, one man one woman. You sure you wanna go back to the old ways ? Do you even have a brain ?</p>
              <p>OFCORS there is a big difference in maintaining a wife vs paying for a prostitute.</p>
              <p>Your wife only fark with you. Prostitutes fark with <strong>anyone</strong> who can pay the price.</p>
              <p>No wonder you couldn't find a mate.</p>
              <p>FYI, women would rather be left on the shelf than to marry losers  dude.</p>
              <p>From the way you conveyed these lustful thoughts , I am pretty sure you must be a young virgin boy, yes ? Women are just a bunch of vaginas , no ?</p>

              <p>you need to have a knack for what gals look for. you have to approach and target the right gals. improve and widen your topics, you must be able to joke and show sense of responsibility and honesty too. money or no money is not the sole factors when a gal accept you.  i suggest you look at yourself and rethink.</p>

              </p><p>Well TS I have a different view from you, I believe that Singapore is well
              developed which resulted our Singapore ladies to be more educated. Educated
              personnel might be more demanding when comes to selecting their spouse that may
              explain why you think that they are looking for wealthy spouse. I find that
              quite reasonable, if you are an educated women that held a stable income job -
              would you wish to married a man who might not have a stable income, job and a
              happy go lucky guy? Someone that incapable to support you? Someone that could
              be hard to communicate with?</p>
              <p>However somehow i find that young couples are getting married without proper
              planning. Many couples married due to various reason such as age is catching
              up, long years of relationship that has no nowhere further progress.</p>
              <p>Instead for looking at the flaws of women, why don't men improve our value
              by improving ourselves through various ways of upgrading.</p>
