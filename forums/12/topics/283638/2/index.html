Life is silly!<br><br>That is why I think sometimes its not good to always have friends who take you TOO seriously. Everytime you talk to them, they suddenly switch to 'counsellor' role and scared to 'hurt' you or offend you.<br><br>it is also good to have friends who is able to point out the funny part of the situation for you, laugh with you and say HEY its ok to feel a little bad, but let it go after tt cos that's much more to life then this.<br><br>Else, go watch some silly youtube videos or watch a comedy.

There is a difference. It only drains your mental and emotional energy, It does not help in your problem! Stay awared and yet not be affected, stay cool-headed, think out of the box and focus your energy positively on methods to solve the problems are the constructive ways . What will happen will happen.. since you try your best as u can.. u can't do nothing more.<br><br>It is good to practice to be relax and stay clear-minded. It will definitely help to control your blood pressure and any anxiety attacks that you will have in the future. Can try to google for de-stress-method online. One way is to tell your tight muscle to relax relax or visualize something soothing.<br><br>Exercise also will make you feel better about yourself. It makes you feel healthier and you can condition yourself to feel better by a healthy activity ( but don't get addicted to it for another problem to be created. )<br></div></blockquote>one has to note that different pple are created differently....it is easy to say think positively, dun worry too much, why even worry when it hasn't happened yet.<br>the mind is a dangerous object, TS u may try these positive thinking method 1st but if it doesn't help...my suggestion is to seek medical treatment....the pills that TTSH gave me was awesome....sets u in the most serene of moods...nothing will bother u <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>treat it before its too late &amp; becomes depression, my advice &amp; 2 cents worth <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

There are some side-effects such as getting too energetic, headache etc. It depends on individual's choice and suitability in taking the pills.<br><br>If you feel better taking the pills, good for u.<br><br>However, i still do not advocate taking pills.<br><br>It could be better to look for a counselor to talk about the problem so as to find the particular medicine for your particular problem.
