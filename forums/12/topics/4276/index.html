She has also invited  me out for a talk organised by her.<br><br>The bad news is: she got a boyfriend now. What's the most appropriate thing to do now?<br>* Tell her I like her?<br>* Hide my feeling for her and be her casual friend?<br>* Stop all contact as I probably don't stand a chance at all.<br><br>Pls advise.<br><br>[This message has been edited by m.c.king (edited 20 December 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by m.c.king (edited 20 December 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The night after the talk by her, I walked her home and she told me that she has patched up with her boyfriend (she told me they were having a tiff 2 days ago) and from that moment on, I knew she and her boyfriend are very much in love with each other.<br><br>I'm feeling very depressed and sad right now because my heart and my head are pulling me apart. My heart is saying: you must seize the opportunity to at least let her know you like her or you risk losing her forever. On the other side, my head is telling me: she and her boyfriend are very happy together and I should suppress my feeling and look for another girl because nothing is going to come out of it.<br><br>Confusion and disappointment nows fills my heart. After she has reached home, I left for a park near her house and did a lot of thinking. Somehow, she still feels very precious to me; I've never had such feeling for a girl throughout 21 years of my life and I felt totally devastated if I've to give her up -- I'm afraid of losing her. Will I meet another girl who will touch my heart ever in my life again? It's simply hard to just suppress my feeling for her even though my head is telling me to stop it.<br><br>I'm contemplating telling everything, by<br>(1) letting her know I like her,<br>(2) but I also understand that she has a great loving relationship with her boyfriend (3) and I'm not asking for any more advances in our relationship and I'm just hoping to remain as casual friend.<br><br>Any comments?</div>
