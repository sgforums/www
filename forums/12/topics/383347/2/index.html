              <p>Hi Detached,</p>
              <p>Since you are having part-time studies, perhaps you will like to get a part-time job instead. It is understandable that employers are worried that your studies will affect your job performance if you are to work full time.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p><br>True and false.</p>
              <p>Having attended many interviews the past month, I'd say that employers look for qualities that befit the job position - and that range from personality, experience and technical and soft skills. Obviously, an employer wouldn't hire an introvert to do sales or a business graduate to do software engineering.</p>
              <p>It'd be good to know what kind of personality would suit the position and you can 'play down' to that personality type. No one is 100% honest in an interview... if you're an introvert, say you're perfectionist; if you're careless, say you look at the big picture and if you're sociable, then you're a teamplayer <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Your flaws should be presented the way it appears to be virtues which aren't too positive.</p>
              <p>The first few interviews I had, I was being too frank and it killed a lot of opportunities. Always remember to exude enthusiasm, confidence and maturity - just think of it as trying to sell yourself. I find building a rapport with the interviewers a priority, the first 30 seconds can and will determine how the interview will go.</p>
              <p>Things like being dressed properly, arriving at least 15 minutes earlier, be mindful of your body language... Sit straight with your back firmly against the back rest of the chair, don't touch your face shouldn't even need to be mentioned. I mean.. hey... that's the most basic of etiquette, if you don't have it... You really don't deserve the job <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>TS, can try sending an email to thank the interviewers at the end of it too. That will get you some brownie points at least.</p>

              <p>Detached. You need to learn to grow up. I have been to interviews for 15 years. from serious looking for jobs and for fun only when i had a job. i did crazy things and rude stuff during interviews and in the end i still got offer for that job. you need to know what the position is for and the real reason why the interviewer want to hire you, in long terms. most of the time they do not want performers.</p>

              <p>Detached. You need to learn to grow up. I have been to interviews for 15 years. from serious looking for jobs and for fun only when i had a job. i did crazy things and rude stuff during interviews and in the end i still got offer for that job. you need to know what the position is for and the real reason why the interviewer want to hire you, in long terms. most of the time they do not want performers.</p>
