              <p>Don't get too affected.</p>
              <p>I've been trapped in this job hunt phase for over a month now, sent more than 100 resume, went for more than 10 interviews across stat boards and private corporations. Like you, I felt a lot of disappointment when it didn't look good.</p>
              <p>Day by day, the disappointment got bigger and it just got too disheartening to even try. Eventually, I learned to put things aside - go for an interview with an open heart, take it as a practice and give it your best. And just let it go after the interview, and continue with the hunt.</p>
              <p>It's end-of-year and recruitment isn't too active, just keep trying and you'll get it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>If I know the interviewer is not impressed with me and I have no chance of securing the job, then I would heck care and let my guard down and stop pretending that I have a chance of getting the job. my demeanour will obviously tell the interviewers not to waste each other's time to continue. just walk out and adios.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once I went for an interview many years ago, once I know I dun have a chance, at the end of the interview, I took down my tie in front of the interviewer and walk out.

              <p>Maybe things will get better by the first quarter of next year, assuming no more shocks like the recent Dubai default. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I say count your blessings if you have loved ones who care enough to show you kindness and lend you the emotional support you need even when the whole world is trying to screw you over. </p>
              <p>Keep applying and take up mediocre jobs in the mean time to keep your mind active. Never give up.</p>
              <p>When interviewers don't get back to you with their decision, drop them a thank you note or make a friendly call to their HR department. Until you're in the position to be headhunted, show some sincerity and be more pro active.</p>
              <p>After all, no one owes anybody a living. </p>

              <p>To top it all up, it doesn't help when you have unscrupulous employers exploiting the current situation. I've met employers who were seeking diploma grads, and yet only offered them 1.2k - 1.3k....</p>
