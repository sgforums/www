            <div class='col-md body'>Hi rainee<br><br>A "friend" who backstab is not a friend.  And if he/she is not a friend there is no friendship in the beginning.  My define of friendship: trust one another, honest to one another and no intention of hurting one another.  I fcould then help one another.  If there is no friendship in the first place, what is there to think about. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Regards<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by rainee:</div><div class="quote_body">hi varatare, thanks for your reply. It is currently very hard for me to forget what they have done to me. Yet, I keep thinking about the friendship we used to have, and I cried.</div></blockquote></div>
