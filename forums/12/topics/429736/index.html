              <p>Those not sure of my story, check it out here: http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/422964</p>
              <p>I managed to crack the addiction. I stopped watching porn every day or week, the most I do is once a month or two months. It was like a chain reaction thing. After I stop porn, I stopped playing games, I start to be more alive. I started trying out different things for kicks.</p>
              <p>Like the reverse bungee over at Clark Quay. $30 per pop, but worth EVERY SINGLE CENT. HAHA.</p>
              <p>Like Wakeboarding over Marina Country Club. $110 per hour, but worth it after you managed to actually float on the water HAHA.</p>
              <p>Next up I might either be trying Skydiving or Rock climbing haha.</p>
              <p>But there's a problem that came up.</p>
              <p>I craved for sex.</p>
              <p>I admitted that to my current girlfriend, but she's the conservative type, the kind to wait till marriage. So that's O.U.T. </p>
              <p>I tried learning from my friend who was really natural with girls, always seemingly getting girls into bed. But I felt that it was not me, so that's O.U.T.</p>
              <p>I tried sourcing from a Famous Local Sex Forum ;) But my morals are holding me back from trying it out.</p>
              <p>I listened to uncles talking about how much fun they had in pubs and clubs. But I don't drink. I don't smoke. I don't really like to Karaoke. so that's O.U.T.</p>
              <p>I feel very frustrated nowadays. Hmm... Any suggestions? </p>

              <p><br>Dun agreed with u. What develop mental strength. It is natural for a man cock to stand when he see the girl he like or want to have sex. Why go against the nature of flow? No wonder so many gay and lesbians appear.</p>
              <p>This is also not a addiction, it is satisfaction. Girl also need it if not there wun be sex toy selling at so many places in singapore. Mostly is for girl also.</p>
              <p>One permanet method, go to NUH or SGH to sterlize yourself and later go to thai temple to be a monk. That is what i call Liu Gen Qing Jin ( 6 Senses clear)</p>

              <p>If her gf is really care of him going out to have sex and dun let him to touch other girl.<br>To be professional, alternative method like help him to Blowjob or Masturbate for him. <br>Is it too much???</p>

              <p>It <em>is </em>not fair for him to cheat on her. If he is single, I've got nothing to say.</p>
              <p>So you yourself do not mind if your SO has sex with someone else if you can't satisfy him/her? Bearing in mind he/she could pass on diseases to you?</p>
              <p>You are, of course, entitled to your own point of view.</p>
              <p>He himself has enough respect for her dignity NOT to force her.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, he has to decide what is more important to him and what type of person he wants to be.</p>

              <p><br>Dun agreed with u. What develop mental strength. It is natural for a man cock to stand when he see the girl he like or want to have sex. Why go against the nature of flow? No wonder so many gay and lesbians appear.</p>
              <p>This is also not a addiction, it is satisfaction. Girl also need it if not there wun be sex toy selling at so many places in singapore. Mostly is for girl also.</p>

              <p>It is natural, of course. I never said it's wrong of him to be horny. But it's what you do with it. That's what I meant by 'developing mental strength'.</p>
              <p>For humans, unlike animaIs, can actually THINK of the pros and cons before acting.</p>
              <p>I don't think anyone has actually died from not getting satisfied.</p>
              <p>I was referring to his 'porn addiction' as he had stated.</p>
              <p>And there are sex addicts. David Duchovny is one good example.</p>

              <p>To the family next door, Armin Meiwes seemed the perfect neighbour. He mowed their lawn, repaired their car and even invited them round for dinner.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding: 0px;">Other residents in the small German town of Rotenburg also believed there was nothing odd about the 42-year-old computer expert, whose light burned late into the night inside his creaking mansion. Yesterday, however, Meiwes appeared in court charged with killing - and then frying and eating - another man.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding: 0px;">In one of the most extraordinary trials in German criminal history, the self-confessed cannibal admitted that he had met a 43-year-old Berlin engineer, Bernd Brandes, after advertising on the internet, and had chopped him up and eaten him.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding: 0px;">It was, he said, something he had wanted to do for a long time. "I always had the fantasy and in the end I fulfilled it," Meiwes told the court on the first day of his trial for murder in the nearby city of Kassel.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding: 0px;">Yesterday German prosecutors described how Meiwes had fantasised about killing and devouring someone, including his classmates, from the age of eight.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding: 0px;">The desire grew stronger after the death of his mother in 1999, prosecutor Marcus Köhler said.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding: 0px;">In March 2001 Meiwes advertised on the internet for a "young well-built man, who wanted to be eaten". Brandes replied.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding: 0px;">On the evening of March 9, the two men went up to the bedroom in Meiwes' rambling timbered farmhouse. Mr Brandes swallowed 20 sleeping tablets and half a bottle of schnapps before <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Meiwes cut off Brandes' penis, with his agreement, and fried it for both of them to eat...</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; border-collapse: collapse; font-family: arial, sans-serif; background-repeat: no-repeat no-repeat; padding: 0px;"> </p>
