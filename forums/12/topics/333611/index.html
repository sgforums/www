              <p>New here,but i got a few questions that i need to ask.</p>
              <p>Recently got together with a girl,well,kind of stole her from another guy
              la,but she loves me too,that's why i decided to ask her to be my Gf. To some of
              the ppl out there,she only agreed to be my gf after she broke up with her ex,we
              were together maybe a few days after she broke up with him.so that's why i said
              (kind of stole). I didn't really steal her.I went the "legal" way...</p>
              <p><br> Her (ex)bf and her were having communication problems and she decided that he
              cudn't give her enough freedom in her life,she's in uni,(i'm her classmate now.)so we're quite young,he's working(he's much older than her) but he wants to meet her almost everyday, they have been
              together for less than a year but should have gone through a lot of things
              together more than any of her previous ones,she was really devoted to him even though they had people objecting them to be together. So for now basically she thinks
              that he's a bit controlling her although he loves her a lot plus always shower her with gifts and romantic surprises that she likes.And so they had a big quarrel and split up. That was
              when me and her started.By that time we had known each other for maybe 3plus weeks
              only and i did express my thoughts about her to her.But i feel that i like
              her a lot and that she likes me too.So i asked her to be my gf after she broke
              up with him and she accepted,so,we've been together for maybe one month?</p>
              <p>We've been quite happy together going out after classes or weekends,other than the fact the ex keeps on msging
              her ,still calling her by her very intimate names and sending her
              gifts,flowers.Infront of me she never or hardly replies him la,i dun question
              her,but i know she sometimes,sometimes only ah,does reply him when we are not
              together.</p>
              <p>There was one time maybe a couple of weeks after we were togther,that she
              went to meet him to have a talk,they spoke for a while.The ex didn't scold her
              or anything,instead did the unexpected and treated her like very well.Bought
              her even more things and doing heart touching things only the two of them
              understand,somethings that involved only their memories,so i didn't really
              probe.Sigh~~I think she even cried...Don't ask me how i knew what happened la,i
              know it happened.Just like how i know things about them that happened before,my sources are kept private.</p>
              <p>After that day,things slightly went back to normal for us,lotsa lotsa
              classes and projects.I was happy.She was happy,i think. Cause her ex still msg
              her everyday,wanting to meet.She ignored him whenever possible and told him she
              was too busy to meet.She also told him she loves me a lot and just want to be
              friends with him for now.However,i can't help having a nagging feeling that she feels she owes him and that she is or will be regretting what happened between them one day.</p>
              <p>Then recently days back,they met up to go out for dinner.She did tell me she was meeting
              him,and i was pretty ok with it la.I was not really upset or anything.I don't really know what they did,but i'm
              pretty sure her ex still treats her like as if they were still together.I trust
              her but i don't know about the other guy.He might still try to get touchy feely
              with her.And i think he has no intention of letting her go.My friends all tell
              me that the way me and her started wasn't a normal way to start a relationship
              and that i should really be wary of them going out.Especially when they always
              only go out alone.Although i know they won't do anything everytime they
              meet.Maybe hugs at the most,like goodbye hugs,he holding her waist ,then try to hold her hand like that. Like normally how us guys  try to take advantage of girls.=)Confirm nothing more
              physical though.</p>
              <p>So i got a few questions.</p>
              <p>1)Was the way we started considered not normal?</p>
              <p>2)Should i be upset and wary when she goes out with her ex so soon after she
              just broke up with him this way? Leaving him for me?Although she said that she just wants to be
              friends with him.</p>
              <p>3)She says i give her the freedom that her ex couldn't give,is it a really
              valid reason for her to be with me (we know each other not long) or she just
              wants a way to escape from her boyfriend and i just happen to be there?</p>
              <p>4)Should i let them go out again?And if she does go out with him again,how?</p>
              <p>5)My friend she warned me that she could leave me very soon if the other guy
              refuses to give up.She said if my gf could leave him so quickly after knowing me
              for only such a short period of time,it could be just that she found something
              in me that she wants for now.But will go back to him once she's tired of me.Is
              it true?What comes fast goes even faster?She will regret breaking with him?Or she already regret?We're still quite happy together now.</p>
              <p>6)Anyone got any similar stories or experiences to share?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I got a friend like you, went with another person's GF, then end up the girl very confused and stop contacting BOTH guys, another guy came in and comforted her, he didn't jio her, he just talk to her and listen to her... end up the girl fell in love with the one who came in, but the guy say needs time and need to slowly develop their R/S.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I feel this is what you should do... instead of going in and exploiting the fact that they just quarreled and R/S is abit unstable, you should be there for her, talk to her and be there for her.. girls don't love people when they're in such situation, they're just looking for someone to hold on to.</p>

              <p>Actually,right now i feel we are quite stable already,she has already said she just wants to be friends with him for now. Although she had agreed to meet him every now and then, I don't see her really bothering herself with him anymore. So i don't think ("She will go back to her ex" type
              situation.") will happen right? She does not look like those type.</p>

              <p>New here,but i got a few questions that i need to ask.</p>
              <p>Recently got together with a girl,well,kind of stole her from another guy la,but she loves me too,that's why i decided to ask her to be my Gf. To some of the ppl out there,she only agreed to be my gf after she broke up with her ex,we were together maybe a few days after she broke up with him.so that's why i said (kind of stole). I didn't really steal her.I went the "legal" way...</p>
              <p><br>Her (ex)bf and her were having communication problems and she decided that he cudn't give her enough freedom in her life,she's in uni,(i'm her classmate now.)so we're quite young,he's working(he's much older than her) but he wants to meet her almost everyday, they have been together for less than a year but should have gone through a lot of things together more than any of her previous ones,she was really devoted to him even though they had people objecting them to be together. So for now basically she thinks that he's a bit controlling her although he loves her a lot plus always shower her with gifts and romantic surprises that she likes.And so they had a big quarrel and split up. That was when me and her started.By that time we had known each other for maybe 3plus weeks only and i did express my thoughts about her to her.But i feel that i like her a lot and that she likes me too.So i asked her to be my gf after she broke up with him and she accepted,so,we've been together for maybe one month?</p>
              <p>We've been quite happy together going out after classes or weekends,other than the fact the ex keeps on msging her ,still calling her by her very intimate names and sending her gifts,flowers.Infront of me she never or hardly replies him la,i dun question her,but i know she sometimes,sometimes only ah,does reply him when we are not together.</p>
              <p>There was one time maybe a couple of weeks after we were togther,that she went to meet him to have a talk,they spoke for a while.The ex didn't scold her or anything,instead did the unexpected and treated her like very well.Bought her even more things and doing heart touching things only the two of them understand,somethings that involved only their memories,so i didn't really probe.Sigh~~I think she even cried...Don't ask me how i knew what happened la,i know it happened.Just like how i know things about them that happened before,my sources are kept private.</p>
              <p>After that day,things slightly went back to normal for us,lotsa lotsa classes and projects.I was happy.She was happy,i think. Cause her ex still msg her everyday,wanting to meet.She ignored him whenever possible and told him she was too busy to meet.She also told him she loves me a lot and just want to be friends with him for now.However,i can't help having a nagging feeling that she feels she owes him and that she is or will be regretting what happened between them one day.</p>
              <p>Then recently days back,they met up to go out for dinner.She did tell me she was meeting him,and i was pretty ok with it la.I was not really upset or anything.I don't really know what they did,but i'm pretty sure her ex still treats her like as if they were still together.I trust her but i don't know about the other guy.He might still try to get touchy feely with her.And i think he has no intention of letting her go.My friends all tell me that the way me and her started wasn't a normal way to start a relationship and that i should really be wary of them going out.Especially when they always only go out alone.Although i know they won't do anything everytime they meet.Maybe hugs at the most,like goodbye hugs,he holding her waist ,then try to hold her hand like that. Like normally how us guys  try to take advantage of girls.=)Confirm nothing more physical though.</p>
              <p>So i got a few questions.</p>
              <p>1)Was the way we started considered not normal?</p>
              <p>2)Should i be upset and wary when she goes out with her ex so soon after she just broke up with him this way? Leaving him for me?Although she said that she just wants to be friends with him.</p>
              <p>3)She says i give her the freedom that her ex couldn't give,is it a really valid reason for her to be with me (we know each other not long) or she just wants a way to escape from her boyfriend and i just happen to be there?</p>
              <p>4)Should i let them go out again?And if she does go out with him again,how?</p>
              <p>5)My friend she warned me that she could leave me very soon if the other guy refuses to give up.She said if my gf could leave him so quickly after knowing me for only such a short period of time,it could be just that she found something in me that she wants for now.But will go back to him once she's tired of me.Is it true?What comes fast goes even faster?She will regret breaking with him?Or she already regret?We're still quite happy together now.</p>
              <p>6)Anyone got any similar stories or experiences to share?</p>

              <p><br>My 1st relationship was like urs. I got him from another gal when the gal controlled him too much. We broke up for other reasons la.</p>
              <p>I feel that ur girl knows what she wants. But sometimes things can be out of control. I remembered once the gal threathened to cut wrist if he wants to be with me n make a big fuss at our BBQ gathering.</p>
              <p>The 1st u need to ask urself , do u trust her?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1)Was the way we started considered not normal?</p>
              <p>   <span style="color: #ff9900;">U are normal.</span></p>
              <p>2)Should i be upset and wary when she goes out with her ex so soon after she just broke up with him this way? Leaving him for me?Although she said that she just wants to be friends with him.</p>
              <p>   <span style="color: #ff9900;">No need to worry. bu shi ni de jiu bu shi ni de. shi ni de jiu pao bu diao.</span></p>
              <p>3)She says i give her the freedom that her ex couldn't give,is it a really valid reason for her to be with me (we know each other not long) or she just wants a way to escape from her boyfriend and i just happen to be there?</p>
              <p>  <span style="color: #ff9900;">This is a valid reason in all relationship! Trust n Respect. Dun give freedom due to no trust.</span></p>
              <p>4)Should i let them go out again?And if she does go out with him again,how?</p>
              <p>   <span style="color: #ff9900;">View out our concern <strong>nicely</strong> to her, u dun mind her to meet him but u also will get jealous. Let her know your thoughts. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff9900;">Can she also take it if u go out alone with ur gals' friend?</span></p>
              <p>5)My friend she warned me that she could leave me very soon if the other guy refuses to give up.She said if my gf could leave him so quickly after knowing me for only such a short period of time,it could be just that she found something in me that she wants for now.But will go back to him once she's tired of me.Is it true?What comes fast goes even faster?She will regret breaking with him?Or she already regret?We're still quite happy together now.</p>
              <p> <span style="color: #ff9900;">That depends on how well u know her. There will be a reason behind if she leaves u soon, right? </span></p>
              <p>6)Anyone got any similar stories or experiences to share?</p>

              <p>Its very hard to judge from your 1sided story.</p>
              <p>Be it whatever, you dont have a good position or good stand from what you mention.</p>
              <p>1st, your relationship with her is not really stable, the way it started all this. The love you all built it's not strong at all, compared to your gf and her EX. They still go out equals to she had not got over him. That's what i think from the actions she did.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you still want to continue on? I believe the answer is yes, if i were in your shoes, i will try to walk down the path i guess. Even though its so dark..</p>
              <p>Try talking to her, ask her to make a decisions. Tell her you dont see a need that she meet her ex so often, or go with her to meet her ex.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Same thing, i thought it was 'legal' too. But apparently, she couldn't let go of her ex.</span></p>
              <p><br>Her (ex)bf and her were having communication problems and she decided that he cudn't give her enough freedom in her life,she's in uni,(i'm her classmate now.)so we're quite young,he's working(he's much older than her) but he wants to meet her almost everyday, they have been together for less than a year but should have gone through a lot of things together more than any of her previous ones,she was really devoted to him even though they had people objecting them to be together.

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yeah, this situation was the same as mine. She replies him, but refuses to tell me.</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Oh yea, this sounds familiar.. For me, after she met up and cried, I gave up totally. There's no point continuing anymore, she couldn't be happy.</span></p>
              <p>After that day,things slightly went back to normal for us,lotsa lotsa classes and projects.I was happy.She was happy,i think.

              <p>Then recently days back,they met up to go out for dinner.She did tell me she was meeting him,and i was pretty ok with it la.I was not really upset or anything.I don't really know what they did,but i'm pretty sure her ex still treats her like as if they were still together.I trust her but i don't know about the other guy.He might still try to get touchy feely with her.And i think he has no intention of letting her go.My friends all tell me that the way me and her started wasn't a normal way to start a relationship and that i should really be wary of them going out.Especially when they always only go out alone.Although i know they won't do anything everytime they meet.Maybe hugs at the most,like goodbye hugs,he holding her waist ,then try to hold her hand like that. Like normally how us guys  try to take advantage of girls.=)Confirm nothing more physical though.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Gone le, you know if you still have feelings for someone, the more you see that person, the more you can't let go?</span></p>
              <p>So i got a few questions.</p>
              <p>1)Was the way we started considered not normal?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yeah, it's not normal. How could someone go into a relationship so fast after she broke?</span></p>
              <p>2)Should i be upset and wary when she goes out with her ex so soon after she just broke up with him this way? Leaving him for me?Although she said that she just wants to be friends with him.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Be wary, being upset is normal and a sure thing.</span></p>
              <p>3)She says i give her the freedom that her ex couldn't give,is it a really valid reason for her to be with me (we know each other not long) or she just wants a way to escape from her boyfriend and i just happen to be there?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I guess she had felt that she couldn't continue with her ex anymore (maybe cos of the communication problem?) , then it just happens you were there.This happened to me too. I had the same thought as you too.</span></p>
              <p>4)Should i let them go out again?And if she does go out with him again,how?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">There's no choice, you're stuck. Even if you don't let her go out with her ex, she has her own freedom to choose, and if you don't let them go out, she will feel that you aren't giving her enough freedom. That'll be a good reason for you two to quarrel over, if she treats you as the rebound guy.</span></p>
              <p>5)My friend she warned me that she could leave me very soon if the other guy refuses to give up.She said if my gf could leave him so quickly after knowing me for only such a short period of time,it could be just that she found something in me that she wants for now.But will go back to him once she's tired of me.Is it true?What comes fast goes even faster?She will regret breaking with him?Or she already regret?We're still quite happy together now.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">This, i'm not sure. But for me, i left her. I couldn't continue with it, she just couldn't be happy in the relationship anymore. A person is supposed to be happy in a relationship isn't it? If she's happy with her ex, then let her be. I left her, and she went back to her ex.</span></p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I had an experience like yours
              too.</span></p>
              <p>New here,but i got a few questions that i need to ask.</p>
              <p>Recently got together with a girl,well,kind of stole her from
              another guy la,but she loves me too,that's why i decided to ask her
              to be my Gf. To some of the ppl out there,she only agreed to be my
              gf after she broke up with her ex,we were together maybe a few days
              after she broke up with him.so that's why i said (kind of stole). I
              didn't really steal her.I went the "legal" way...</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Same thing, i thought it was
              'legal' too. But apparently, she couldn't let go of her
              ex.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">She told me she had let go already,that's why she agreed to be with me.</span></p>
              <p><br> Her (ex)bf and her were having communication problems and she
              decided that he cudn't give her enough freedom in her life,she's in
              uni,(i'm her classmate now.)so we're quite young,he's working(he's
              much older than her) but he wants to meet her almost everyday, they
              have been together for less than a year but should have gone
              through a lot of things together more than any of her previous
              ones,she was really devoted to him even though they had people
              objecting them to be together. So for now basically she thinks that
              he's a bit controlling her although he loves her a lot plus always
              shower her with gifts and romantic surprises that she likes.And so
              they had a big quarrel and split up. That was when me and her
              started.By that time we had known each other for maybe 3plus weeks
              only and i did express my thoughts about her to her.But i feel that
              i like her a lot and that she likes me too.So i asked her to be my
              gf after she broke up with him and she accepted,so,we've been
              together for maybe one month?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Same, she wanna meet up with her
              ex almost everyday too.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Nope,different here.It was him who wants to meet everyday not her.</span></p>
              <p>We've been quite happy together going out after classes or
              weekends,other than the fact the ex keeps on msging her ,still
              calling her by her very intimate names and sending her
              gifts,flowers.Infront of me she never or hardly replies him la,i
              dun question her,but i know she sometimes,sometimes only ah,does
              reply him when we are not together.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yeah, this situation was the same
              as mine. She replies him, but refuses to tell me.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">She did tell me that he does still sms her a lot but even if she does reply,the messages that she replies are short and innoculus.What he wants to send,she cannot control,but she can decide what she wants to send.</span></p>
              <p>There was one time maybe a couple of weeks after we were
              togther,that she went to meet him to have a talk,they spoke for a
              while.The ex didn't scold her or anything,instead did the
              unexpected and treated her like very well.Bought her even more
              things and doing heart touching things only the two of them
              understand,somethings that involved only their memories,so i didn't
              really probe.Sigh~~I think she even cried...Don't ask me how i knew
              what happened la,i know it happened.Just like how i know things
              about them that happened before,my sources are kept private.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Oh yea, this sounds familiar.. For
              me, after she met up and cried, I gave up totally. There's no point
              continuing anymore, she couldn't be happy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Girls have sensitive characters,correct?Especially when she expected him to fly into a rage.He ended up doing something opposite,of course she will feel bad and cry at how she had treated him,right?</span></p>
              <p>After that day,things slightly went back to normal for us,lotsa
              lotsa classes and projects.I was happy.She was happy,i think. Cause
              her ex still msg her everyday,wanting to meet.She ignored him
              whenever possible and told him she was too busy to meet.She also
              told him she loves me a lot and just want to be friends with him
              for now.However,i can't help having a nagging feeling that she
              feels she owes him and that she is or will be regretting what
              happened between them one day.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lies, lies, lies. She can't let
              go. I feel that she probably treats you as a rebound
              guy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Like i said,she had made it very clear that she really only loves me now,to me and to him.But what i wonder is,if someone thinks that they may regret any of their decisions in the future,does it mean the actually have started regretting it already?</span></p>
              <p>Then recently days back,they met up to go out for dinner.She did
              tell me she was meeting him,and i was pretty ok with it la.I was
              not really upset or anything.I don't really know what they did,but
              i'm pretty sure her ex still treats her like as if they were still
              together.I trust her but i don't know about the other guy.He might
              still try to get touchy feely with her.And i think he has no
              intention of letting her go.My friends all tell me that the way me
              and her started wasn't a normal way to start a relationship and
              that i should really be wary of them going out.Especially when they
              always only go out alone.Although i know they won't do anything
              everytime they meet.Maybe hugs at the most,like goodbye hugs,he
              holding her waist ,then try to hold her hand like that. Like
              normally how us guys  try to take advantage of girls.=)Confirm
              nothing more physical though.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Gone le, you know if you still
              have feelings for someone, the more you see that person, the more
              you can't let go?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Well,they have only met up for a talk once and gone out for dinner another time once also only.So not much he can do to affect her right?</span></p>
              <p>So i got a few questions.</p>
              <p>1)Was the way we started considered not normal?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yeah, it's not normal. How could
              someone go into a relationship so fast after she broke?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Maybe i wud like to ask the girls out there,any opinions on this? End a previous serious relationship and get into another one so quickly? Not those infatuation types,serious relationships.</span></p>
              <p>2)Should i be upset and wary when she goes out with her ex so
              soon after she just broke up with him this way? Leaving him for
              me?Although she said that she just wants to be friends with
              him.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Be wary, being upset is normal and
              a sure thing.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Another question i need the girls out there to help me on.Sigh~~If you had broken up with your previous boyfriend in this way,would you dare or want to see or agree to go out with him again so soon (one month)?</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3)She says i give her the freedom that her ex couldn't give,is
              it a really valid reason for her to be with me (we know each other
              not long) or she just wants a way to escape from her boyfriend and
              i just happen to be there?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I guess she had felt that she
              couldn't continue with her ex anymore (maybe cos of the
              communication problem?) , then it just happens you were there.This
              happened to me too. I had the same thought as you too.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">So are you trying to say she fell in love with freedom and not me? That anyone who gave her that,could also be her boyfriend?</span></p>
              <p>4)Should i let them go out again?And if she does go out with him
              again,how?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">There's no choice, you're stuck.
              Even if you don't let her go out with her ex, she has her own
              freedom to choose, and if you don't let them go out, she will feel
              that you aren't giving her enough freedom. That'll be a good reason
              for you two to quarrel over, if she treats you as the rebound
              guy.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Well,for this part,i asked,it seems that she had agreed to meet him every now and then.They already arranged their next meeting,but to be confirmed by her due to her busy schedule.As in not everyday or what,but maybe once every one or two weeks.It's ok right,i feel,what harm could come out of one day in 1 or 2 weeks,when i sit beside her almost everyday in school and after school.I have more time with her,so advantage to me?</span></p>
              <p>5)My friend she warned me that she could leave me very soon if
              the other guy refuses to give up.She said if my gf could leave him
              so quickly after knowing me for only such a short period of time,it
              could be just that she found something in me that she wants for
              now.But will go back to him once she's tired of me.Is it true?What
              comes fast goes even faster?She will regret breaking with him?Or
              she already regret?We're still quite happy together now.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">This, i'm not sure. But for me, i
              left her. I couldn't continue with it, she just couldn't be happy
              in the relationship anymore. A person is supposed to be happy
              in a relationship isn't it? If she's happy with her ex, then let
              her be. I left her, and she went back to her ex.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">This part,i cannot be sure also,because,i have many surrounding friends telling me different stories and experiences.Some say,she cannot let him go that's why she still agrees to meet him,but i feel that when she's with me,she's happy.She enjoys being with me.I just worry what will happen if the guy continues to stay around.I also wonder why she does not just tell him not to disturb her anymore and to let her be.Sometimes i wonder,under this type of circumstances,is it even wise for them to stay as friends?Won't it be a faster and easier way to cut him off?Any help here?</span></p>
              <p>6)Anyone got any similar stories or experiences to share?</p>

However,i do feel that i am worried not about her intentions but the other guy's motive for still asking her out,i mean if you girlfriend broke up with you this way,you won't want to see her so soon also right?Likewise the girl too,would you dare/want to or even agree to meet up so soon after this type of breakup?So i do feel cutting totally off any contact might be better,but it seems like this never crossed her mind,she wants him to still stay as a friend.Why? I really don't know.</p>
              <p>As for the pamper part,the guy is already working,this i might not be able to match him pound for pound now.What he can do,send flowers,expensive gifts and all even after they broke up,i quite unable to do now and as for the way he treats her,it seems that he is very doting on her.</p>

              <p>If your wife sleeps with your every night on the same bed.. is it ok for her to go dating with another man ?</p>
              <p>How about you stop behaving like a wussy and start behaving like a real man ?</p>
              <p>If you don't like the guy to keep contacting her.. just tell her straight.</p>
              <p>If she really loves you.. she will give up the useless "friendship" with her ex.</p>
              <p>No wonder you're only qualified to be a "rebound guy".</p>

              <p>jojobeach,It's not about being a wussy or not behaving like a real man.</p>
              <p>Of course i would have expressed my thoughs that i don't really like the idea of them meeting,but if i were to control her now,wouldn't it make me like him? I would be restricting her freedom,which i don't want to and like TalkToTheScreen has said,if i do,it would be giving the other guy a chance,right?</p>
