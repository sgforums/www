            <div class='col-md body'>Hey people, im kind of new here but i sincerly hope i can get some advice from u people over here... Im in a serious confusion as im unsure what to do with some sort of a relationship problem.. It all starts like this... Well, im kind of attracted to a gal i just know and im starting to have feelings for her... But, she is having lots of problems now and she wants to borrow money from me.. My mind tells me im a fool if i lend her the money but my heart wants to... I knoe for sure if i lend her the money, the chances of getting the money back are slim...The amount is not very large but neither is it a small amount. But im not very stable myself and im really at a lost.. I sort of admitted to her that i like her and she says we need time for love to grow.. I fully understand that but now.. im really confused over this money issue... I know for sure that if i dont lend her the money, i dont think i will have the heart to face her anymore...But if i lend her the money, she can just turn the tables around and pretend that nothing has happened.  She has no one to turn to accept me n i really feel bad if i dont help her... But if i help her... am i a fool?? im really confused guys and i really hope u guys will help me with some advice...

Honestly, i really cant bear to let her down.. And im kind of soft hearted, but i also cant let my emotions control my mind.. What im afraid off is that she will continue to borrow from me and i have 2 end it one day rite?? Haizzz.. isnt it better to end it before it starts....</div>

WHether i should risk it or not... I can say i like her 50% but for the other 50 percent, i cant be to sure yet.. Cos she seems like a very very complicated girl.. Im not attracted to her because of her looks(She's not pretty) but there is just something about her character and her style that i like.... I dont want to slap myself in the future for not trying</div>
