Just be wary of warning signs; you can't keep making excuses forever.   HAVE PERSONAL STANDARDS AND LIMITS, you deserve to be treated well.   Don't be taken for a ride when he's just using you for affectionate company and a girl friday.<br><br>Cool-gal is right too.   Treat him like a king too early in a relationship and he will expect it all the time, some nasty guys may take you for granted.

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree with both Cool gal and Choco B, he ought to be more appreciative of you.  U did all the household chores for him and thats what he says to you?  If it were me, i'll ask the guy go fly kite.<br><br>You cant treat some men too well even before you go into a relationship, otherwise that will be what the relationship would be in future.  Some men, if you dun treat them so well, they would come running after you.  Some men like unassuming cool gals too, though they would rather not admit it.<br><br>End of the day, be yourself.  You deserve a guy who appreciates you as who you are.</div>

During my trip there, I was doing all the house works for him when he was working, cleaned his apartment, washed his clothes.... (I never do so much house works within one day in my life b4)<br><br>Before i left there, I've asked him how he felt when i'm around... Then he said houseworks wise is pretty good, but just that i'm not "ti tie" to him.. He said it's not that i dun want to, it's just i dunno how to.... I need to be told wat to do... He said maybe i still quite young, so dunno how to.. compare to his other  gals, they knew how to ti tie him well... In fact, i always a very blur gal.. like i always said my nerves are very "thick".. and i consider myself as a bit slow and insentitive to things.. the good point is i'm not that easy to get angry or agitated, the bad point will be not so sensitive to things around me..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>When he said i'm not "ti tie" to him, it's really bother me..

Wear urself out to the bones, yet he jus sit around &amp; refuse to give a hand? Guys cannot be spoiled arh..<br><br>U mention tat u used to treat ur ex very well too, but end up he became too pampered.. So.. Try not to make the same mistake twice..<br><br>A guy i feel.. Will treasure u more, if they were the one who makes the effort to woo u, rather than if u were the one who take the initative..<br><br>Let mi share.. With my ex.. I was the one hittin on him first.. Same as you, we were more than friends, not yet an item.. I treated him very well.. Give in to him in almost everything.. Wat i gotten in the end was.. He took advantage of it.. &amp; Doesn treat nor dote on mi as much..<br><br>Now we both live our seperate life.. Readin his testimonials send by his GF.. I realise tat i was so silly.. He treated her so well.. Sheltered her with his bag when it was raining.. Sending her home.. Okie.. It may seems all very basic things out of courtship..<br><br>However.. In the 4 yrs we were tog.. I could count the no of times he send mi home.. Mayb 5 times (+/-) In the beginnin.. I told him is okie not to send mi home.. Coz though we live in the same area.. I dun wan him tak a long bus ride home.. ERm.. Long as in half hour - 40 mins bah..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>It was to the extend tat he even refuse to send mi to the bus stop whenver i went to his house..

He took a year+ b4 he finally won her hand, &amp; heart..<br><br>I can say.. He reali puts in his all to tis r/s.. Every occassion, he puts in alot of effort to get her something reali special..<br><br>Be it a string of tatty bears alphabets.. To a big box full of her fav choco layers by layers with a surprise shirt she like, etc..<br><br>See the vast difference?<br><br>Haha.. I learnt my lesson.. &amp; decided tat..
