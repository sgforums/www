During my trip there, I was doing all the house works for him when he was working, cleaned his apartment, washed his clothes.... (I never do so much house works within one day in my life b4)<br><br>Before i left there, I've asked him how he felt when i'm around... Then he said houseworks wise is pretty good, but just that i'm not "ti tie" to him.. He said it's not that i dun want to, it's just i dunno how to.... I need to be told wat to do... He said maybe i still quite young, so dunno how to.. compare to his other  gals, they knew how to ti tie him well... In fact, i always a very blur gal.. like i always said my nerves are very "thick".. and i consider myself as a bit slow and insentitive to things.. the good point is i'm not that easy to get angry or agitated, the bad point will be not so sensitive to things around me..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>When he said i'm not "ti tie" to him, it's really bother me.. I kept thinking how to become better... Any suggestions that can help?? Thanks a lot..</div>

Wish to have more comments coming in..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Recently, I'm seeing with this guy.. both of us are interested  in each other.. but we are just more than friend, not yet an item...<br><br>Once of the weekend, I went to visit him while he was working oversea... During my trip there, I was doing all the house works for him when he was working, cleaned his apartment, washed his clothes.... (I never do so much house works within one day in my life b4)<br><br>Before i left there, I've asked him how he felt when i'm around... Then he said houseworks wise is pretty good, but just that i'm not "ti tie" to him.. He said it's not that i dun want to, it's just i dunno how to.... I need to be told wat to do... He said maybe i still quite young, so dunno how to.. compare to his other  gals, they knew how to ti tie him well... In fact, i always a very blur gal.. like i always said my nerves are very "thick".. and i consider myself as a bit slow and insentitive to things.. the good point is i'm not that easy to get angry or agitated, the bad point will be not so sensitive to things around me..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>When he said i'm not "ti tie" to him, it's really bother me.. I kept thinking how to become better... Any suggestions that can help?? Thanks a lot..</div></blockquote>How 'ti tie' he want u to be? U flew all the way ter to help him with the chores and he stil doesnt reli appreciate it? Did he pay for the trip ter???</div>
