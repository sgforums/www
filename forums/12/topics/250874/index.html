Im feeling happy for her, since she found someone whom she really love and its very obvious to me that the guy loves her alot too . I really happy for her.<br><br>However , whenever i see her happy being with her BF together , i cant stop myself from thinking about what i had done in the past that hurt her . I felt angry and upset about what i had done to her in the past. I just simply cant forgive myself about what i had done . I keep forcing myself to think that its all in the past and now that she has a nicer BF than me , i should just feel happy for her .

There might be a little anguish residing in your emotions, as you probably deemed that you are also capable of treating your woman right and shower her with a little bit more love.<br><br>But the fact is that more often than not, we won't know what's wrong until we witness dire consequences and regret. Or at times, it's not just some things which you may not have done well.<br><br>Perhaps your fate with her has ended and what's left of this seeming 'glorious civilization' is a 'book' inscribed with of all its 'history'. The 'city' is gone no doubt, but what you could do is to study its 'downfall' and see if you could create a bigger and stronger 'civilization' in the future.<br><br>Understand what you may not have done well and work to improve upon it the next time round. No point crying out spilled milk as it stagnant our growth. Muster a little courage and strike out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

I'm not saying you're bad or anything, it's just normal to make such comparison.<br><br>Nevertheless, when you meet a better gf, one who is more suited to you and who loves you dearly and whom you love, you will see this break-up as a blessing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I've been feeling like this for quite a few days already . Here is what i felt.<br><br>My ex GF has a new BF now. Im feeling happy for her, since she found someone whom she really love and its very obvious to me that the guy loves her alot too . I really happy for her.<br><br>However , whenever i see her happy being with her BF together , i cant stop myself from thinking about what i had done in the past that hurt her . I felt angry and upset about what i had done to her in the past. I just simply cant forgive myself about what i had done . I keep forcing myself to think that its all in the past and now that she has a nicer BF than me , i should just feel happy for her . But i got really upset whenever i sees her and the memory and images of what i had done just came back all of a sudden . I just keep bugging me.<br><br>Why am i feeling this way?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote><span style="color: darkblue;">because you are only human?<br><br>the first thing you must do is to accept yourself for what you are...<br><br>the second thing to do is to find ways to cope, like posting your "issue" in AA<br><br>the last thing you must do is find a new gf to hug whenever you are feeling down...<br><br>and BTW whenever you are feeling down, eat something and go to sleep... it helps.</span></div>
