            <div class='col-md body'>ok i read the post liow.. nbz.. eyes getting crossed, very sleepy.<br><br>now.. let's just throw A out of the answer. he's not in contention anymore rite? ok that makes it much simpler.<br><br>it's so simple i'm not sure there's a problem! unless u think having a wonderful relationship with a really cool guy is bad?<br><br>u're worried that u will lose the friendship with him if u confess, right? but if u don't u will always have this deep longing in ur heart that waill keep gnawing at u. both ways also sian rite?<br><br>u need to make certain steps to a decision. u have to decide to "chase" him, or forget all romantic inclinations towards him and continue being the real good friends u both already are, in other words, get rid of the gnawing feeling.<br><br>now the chase. no one said u needed to confess. there are certainly ways to SHOW him that u are interested. and he will get the hint and will hint back perhaps. i'm making it pretty simplistic, but if u want, it's a game of tennis. u serve the ball, u see if he hits back. if he doesn't no worries, just sit down at the club house and chit chat with him over an iced tea (the friends part). if he plays ball then that's there the fun begins!<br><br>the chase can be very exciting for those who are up for it, but very stressful for pple who think too much. that is why in general girls don't play this game well. becos girls in general introspect more. they think about "wat if" too much. just do wat is natural, u wanna care for him in a certain way, just go ahead and see his reaction. u obviously know him enuff to extend this kind of emotion to him, without fear that he might hurt u in the end. oh and that's another story too, many girls are afraid to step forward becos they fear getting hurt. see wat i mean by thinking too much? they want the guy, but they scared this scared that. then how?<br><br>life is full of decisions. the worst thing to do isn't to make wrong decision. it is to choose NOT to make a decision that i feel is a very pathetic situation to be in. it's like escaping. u can't escape life, u're in it, like it or not. suicide isn't a suitable option in my list either!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>and like i said above, no this isn't love, it's infatuation. but that doesn't mean it can't grow to love. good luck.</div>
