This guy is persistant even after the broke up. She tried hard to resist at first, but because of the time spent and communication, she gave in. Whats more he was her ex<br><br>Because of all these factors, feelings gradually are developed over time. They have become closer and start going out together. The irony is just as she goes out with him, she also goes out with me. Every night we will still keep in contact with each other even though we are in different school<br><br>When i decide to confront her, she broke down and said that 'i know it is wrong but everyday in school we see and talk. I juz hope my Uni will end as soon as possible because i really do not know how to handle my feelings, i tried my best to keep a line at first but really its so difficult. Sometimes when i think of u, i will feel guilty and blamed everything on myself'<br><br>I know clearly that she likes me, at the same time because her ex is one that she sees everyday. She find it hard to keep her feelings true to me. This cannot go on and although i understand, i once a while have the feeling of being cheated.<br><br>Please help.<br><br>i hate guys like u seriously , why must u go for attached girls? u think breaking up ppl relationship is very fun? my ex also like that , when she attach to me another guy jioing her and in the end she wif that guy. whats wrong wif u man. there are more single gal outside lah pls , dun spoilt other ppl relationship i cant help but say this , you are a jerk.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

Be the decisive one.<br><br>If you opt to keep her, you must be mentally prepared that cheating incidents are going to come your way in the future, if she doesn't know how to control her feelings and wants to have a little of every dish in the buffet. Can you stand the feeling of being a spare tyre or being second best, if someday it does happen? And even now, can you stand feeling insecure all the time?<br><br>I guess your decision will also hinge on your 'investment' horizon. Do you look long-term, or you just want to be dating her?<br><br>Whatever your decision, be prepared for the consequences.

That should be the type of gal you  should go after ya.<br><br>As a gal myself, let me advise you, it better you let it go, it's a blessing for you, many of my gal mates here also hv a few bfs at a go, they even asked me to be like this so that i can have the love from both world and they like it, cos it make them wanted as though they are very beautiful and nice one with all the chasers, that is a gal pride and honor ok. But I will never take their way of love life by cheating guys.<br><br>SO wake up! finish yr study, go work, save money, take MBA, then PhD ya.<br><br>PS, but if WangLEEHong come after me, sori, I give up all other guys.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You waited too long.<br><br>She was taken.<br><br>You don't interfere in another relationship. What you did was a mistake.<br><br>If she was more mature she would have immediately turned you down gently.<br><br>You are the cause of your problems, what's worse is that you dragged 2 other innocent people into it.<br><br>You should tell her sorry you messed things up. She'll say some nice things. Tell the boyfriend you're sorry you messed things up. He'll probably be quite unfriendly.  Then you move on.<br><br>Be a man, fix your mistake.</div>

I am in SMU while she is in NTU.<br><br>Always thought that she was single, until one day my friend caught her with another guy.<br><br>I was sad and wanted to move on, so before that told her my feelings.<br><br>She was moved and to my surprise broke up with that guy and go steady with me.<br><br>The main problem is that guy is her schoolmate, and they always see each other everyday.<br><br>After months, she said that it is very diff not to have feelings for this guy as he was previously her ex and her closest friend in class. This guy is persistant even after the broke up. She tried hard to resist at first, but because of the time spent and communication, she gave in. Whats more he was her ex<br><br>Because of all these factors, feelings gradually are developed over time. They have become closer and start going out together. The irony is just as she goes out with him, she also goes out with me. Every night we will still keep in contact with each other even though we are in different school<br><br>When i decide to confront her, she broke down and said that 'i know it is wrong but everyday in school we see and talk. I juz hope my Uni will end as soon as possible because i really do not know how to handle my feelings, i tried my best to keep a line at first but really its so difficult. Sometimes when i think of u, i will feel guilty and blamed everything on myself'<br><br>I know clearly that she likes me, at the same time because her ex is one that she sees everyday. She find it hard to keep her feelings true to me. This cannot go on and although i understand, i once a while have the feeling of being cheated.<br><br>Please help.<br><br></div></blockquote>Well, this is most unfortunate to hear. Frankly, yesh you lack the tactical advantage of not being in the same uni as her. This is aggravated by the fact that you got a really persistent love rival.<br><br>I say give her up. You deserve a better lady. NTU girls are rather bad choices as gf because they are more villager like, more gulliable and more soft-hearted. Thats why she can be easily manipulated by your love rival. So this is something you must consider carefully.<br><br></div>
