              <p>I am 17 years old.. currently in polytechnic foundation programme(new)</p>
              <p>which was meant for top 10% of n level candidates , it means i've got really good n level results</p>
              <p>So yeah.. just like most people recommended i went for PFP to avoid O levels since everyone said o levels would be tough.</p>
              <p>But i had no clue what i wanted to study in polytechnic , i had to choose something right?</p>
              <p>So i went ahead with Business Information Technology(BIT) , got accepted and was cool with most of the things until i started thinking about my future , what i really want to be and what does the course really offer.</p>
              <p>I found out i do not want to study business at all , not to mention the information technology was to complement business ,solve business problems and about e-business. It wasn't what i was expecting , it wasn't really IT.</p>
              <p>Additionally , i went to looked over many things , did deep thinking and i've realised my passion or what i really want to do is on the creative side , its more about music and design.</p>
              <p>I am in a dilemma right now , what i could potentially do is to drop off the PFP and study O levels as a private candidate , i know it will be tough , but i have the discipline and determination.I would be studying English , Math , Combined Science , Combined Humatnities and Design and Technology. There are two subjects that i might have trouble with is combined science which requires practical how am i suppose to study it without a school? Another is Design and Technology(DnT) . I have an O level Chinese A2 already. Do i have to go to a private school? My parents would kill me but would support me in the end i think..( we are not rich )</p>
              <p>More insights about my interest and possibly passion , i have a big dream , to be a composer/singer/song writer , i also likes to write articles about games(gamer). </p>
              <p>I need help ! I am facing stress from parents because i skipped two days of school already.     Feeling really depressed and down , like i am going nowhere , going to spend the rest of my life doing nothing at all ,wasting it. Even thought of dying but im not going there because im scared of pain and my parents care for me.</p>
              <p>Is there anyone out here that could possibly help me and not give comments such as just do your course for the money or something like that.</p>

              <p>I'm sorry, but I will tell you that you should just finish your course and then explore options beyond that.</p>
              <p>To pursue something you need willingness and ability. You lack the latter, so you should forgo your passion for the moment as penance for your "wrong choice" earlier.</p>

              <p>physix, your parents will be angry with you.. not because you fervently pursued your dreams.</p>
              <p>But because you wasted their money and your precious time, putting in  half ass efforts , then dropping out half way with nothing to show for but disappointments.</p>
              <p>If you can honestly convince them you are indeed , truly resolved to complete the desired path.. they will be less likely to get angry again.</p>
              <p>Your parents wants to support you.. but you need to give them some confidence.</p>
              <p>So far your track record had not been good. So you need to put in more effort to ensure you will not drop out again.</p>
              <p>Think it through properly... is this new path truly what you want.. and explain to them how you plan on achieving your goals.</p>
              <p>If you have a weak subject.. what or how do you plan to overcome it ? <br>What are your future paths for this route you have chosen.</p>
              <p>sell them your dreams.. your hope.. and mean what you say !</p>

              <p>Poly is a cool place to study. And there are many job opportunities for a Business and IT graduate. You should consider it a good backup plan for steady income in case your bid to become a famous singer / song writer takes too long to materialize.</p>
              <p>There is probably a music club in your school or maybe even a band. You can join them to pursue your passion concurrently while studying. Business-IT guy by day, Rocker by night. Sounds complementary.</p>
              <p>O-Levels is no fun, I've been there done that and later still joined Poly, then degree and so on. What I mean to say is that O-Levels is not the only way up....</p>
              <p>The surest way to securing a good job is to work backwards by starting with the job search portals. Look through the portal to find your dream job, then see what qualifications are required, then go study that.</p>
              <p>Remember your passion is a precious gift you must treasure. Delicately kindle the fire. But also remember that there are many ways for you to express your passion, just because you are not studying it does not mean you cannot pursue it.</p>
              <p>I wish I could give you the clarity of insight you seek...</p>
              <p>But only you can do it for yourself. But here is how I can help... with my book written to teach you the techniques to gain this insight for yourself. Its free to download. Consider it a gift. </p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>I was also a N level student just like you. I did very well too and made it to O levels. Back in my time, there was no polytechnic foundation programme. So I took O levels, English, E math, A math, combined humanities, combined science, Chinese and Food &amp; N. So I also did pretty well and I could go to any course in poly. The point here is, why did you take up BIT in the first place? Couldnt you have at least chosen a better course? Is it possible for you to go back to ur secondary school to take O levels? Because seriously, later , most companies u work outside would require at least an O level. </p>
              <p>Alternatively, you can try Laselle or some arts school in Singapore? But again I think they need O levels too. Please take ur O levels, without it, your options are limited. However, if u are musically brilliant, some schools will close one eye to accept you even though you dont have O levels. </p>
