She may just seem like that but she is actually secretly interested in you.<br><br>Go ahead and let her know you are interested in her...but I do suggest you be a bit subtle. Don't go an say "I love you" straight in her face. There are many ways to show you are interested.</div>

I know you cannot resist gravity and you really feel like you want to experience it at least once. Don't be attracted to failure because it is the easiest event to experience. Instead, see how you will fail and work out the solution to success. If not, you will never grow or evolve until the day you die.<br><br>I'm telling you, there is flat absolute 100% chance she will definitely reject you. So go and know more about her first, be her frd, be her good frd, be her close frd before you even try to be her bf. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, I have never wanted you to die. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
