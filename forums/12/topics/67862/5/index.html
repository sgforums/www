Its really damn sad that girls don't appreciate devoted guys.... perhaps it's true that some guys are meant to be bf, others as husband....which is totally unfair.....nothing is fair in the world..... For what the girls look for, it's totally near impossible, goodlooking and rich guys in the world only got how many only..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  hope that those devoted, nice guys would be cherished <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> All i know i am no longer one..........</div>
