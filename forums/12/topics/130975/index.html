            <div class='col-md body'>yo pal... i've read few of ur post b4, think i even replied to one b4. i cld understd how it feels. Think having a fulfilled life --- means family, good frens &amp; some healthy self-esteem--- is a good buffer when ur relationships fail.<br>But unfortunately, not everyone has the above conditions--- like myself. Hence, a failed romance, whilst it's jus sad for others, its crushing for person like myself.<br><br>Anyone dun giv up hope... lotsa of famous ppl went thru great obstacles. Reading their stories inspires me, u can try too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>And if u dun mind a fren, can pm me. Maybe we can help each other thru future probs too..<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, me too. But oh well, maybe do something really addictive or things that can make you think very hard until you forget about the person. Difficult, but nonetheless, give it a try. Anyway, if you want to think abt it, just go ahead...dun force yourself to forget what you can't. This will only seep into your subconscious further and further.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Malcolm,<br><br>Perhaps it was easier for me, since I was the 1 who broke up with my ex, &amp; by that time, I'd already given up hope on the relationship.  My grieving was during the hurtful process of trying &amp; trying, &amp; realising that things wouldn't improve.<br><br>To him, however, the breakup seemed sudden because he didn't take me seriously before when I told him that I wanted to split.  He hadn't a clue that I meant what I'd said.  He felt hurt, betrayed, etc, when all along, the betrayed party was me.<br><br>I too, felt depressed over the split, but it was only for awhile, maybe a month or 2?  It helped that my friends took me out, &amp; I had people I could confide in.  When I decided to let go &amp; start afresh, they were there to support me &amp; encourage me.<br><br>It really helps to have friends there to help you.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mal_colm1979:</div><div class="quote_body">Its really an agony when you are finding it so hard to let go of the person whom you once love so much...<br><br>Eating, drinking, watching TV even working... suddenly they can creep into your mind and that's it....<br><br>Really its a mental torturing thing to go through this ordeal to have to forget them.<br><br>Don't you guys find it so?

But remember, letting go wasn't an option in the first place...it was the only choice. And you certainly felt that some part of your soul is missing...that's inevitable if you are really in love.<br><br>Instead of dwelling sadly on your lost love, hold on to your past happy memories and continue to love that person in your heart. Love that person even though he/she is not physically with you cos love brings hopes and if that love is what will keep you going on and happy sometimes, then that love is definitely worth keeping. Love that person as an image, a mirage, a memories within your heart and love it as what you would have loved that person right now.<br><br>Treat it as a love simulation therapy and you will learnt to love the next person that comes along in your heart and be a better lover. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Malcolm,<br>There isnt much choices left once she has decided to end the relationship. Take me for example, my ex has engaged with someone else and in your last email to me, she mentioned that I am a trustable and reliable guy but she has no feeling for me cos her heart has gone to another guy. I kept raising questions after questions as to why must she dump me in such ways but think abt it, she has no feelings for me and for what I have done for her meant nothing. Does it matter to her how things end?<br><br>Will she ever care aabt how I feel and how muchI suffer? If yes, how coud she just get herself engage with her new bf so fast? For all the tough period that I have gone through with her. I have learnt to face the fact that she has gone. All sweet memories is just memories after all. Really wish her all the best. Hope that I will  be blessed with a girl who really treasure me.<br><br>Maybe for her, she may treat me as an enemy cos she blame me for accusing her for betraying me and our relationship just end up causing misery and injustice for me to bear.<br><br>What can I do? Just kept telling myself to move on. move on with my life.</div>
