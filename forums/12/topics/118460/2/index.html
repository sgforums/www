But i know that vegs have starch too rite? and milk that i'm drinking. So i thought my carbo intake should be okie? I make sure i have 1200 calories per day, cause i know that's the minimal requirement. I eat fruits for my vitamins, milk for calcium and protein and some minerals... so it shouldn't be a problem?<br><br></div></blockquote>I'm not a nutritionist, but I'm pretty sure that while milk does have protein in it, it's still no substitute for meat. I think that the only good alternate source of protein is beans.<br><br>Also, while 1200 calories of carbs may be the minimum requirement, that is in the case of a sedentary lifestyle. You know, a couch potato lifestyle where the most strenuous thing you're doing is stretching across the sofa for the remote control.<br><br>Okay, that was partly in jest, but you get the idea. From what I've been able to gather, your lifestyle is far more active than that. Which means.... you need more energy. Carbs provide energy. So you need more carbs.<br><br>Anyway, what's ur height/weight?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i know for one how frikin siong canoeing training is.<br><br>with all that running, weight lifting and sea training, let me tell you you are going to need AT LEAST 2500 calories a day. that's on training days of course, to replenish the massive amount of calories u burn.<br><br>u can cut back to maybe 1800 on non-training days, but u must still eat a good 3 meals. and include some lean meat (fish or chicken br3ast) in your diet. this is because your body is still recovering from the workout you've had over the week and needs calories and protein to repair and regrow.<br><br>pls pls pls don't go thinking you are fat. anyone who has basic knowledge of nutrition will tell u that having 1200 calories/day when having canoeing traning 5 times a week WILL make u a skeleton. it will make anyone and everyone a skeleton. you are simply burning much, much more energy than u eat!!<br><br>it'll also be good if u calorie intake consists of complex carbohydrates. ie things like pasta, wholemeal bread, oatmeal bars etc. these contain fibre, protein and vitamins that simple carbs like rice, beehoon and white bread dont have.<br><br>so lady, pls be sensible. if u go on like this u will only kill yourself. start eating properly!!<br><br>PS: u must be from NJC rite? only NJ canoeing trains 5 times a week. haha its crazy</div>

I'm not a canoeist, but I know for a fact that canoeing really burns up a lot of energy. To be brutally honest with you, I'm pretty surprised that you haven't collapsed of hypoglycaemia...... yet.<br><br>And if you want to know, most guys can't stand girls who are over-obsessed with their weight. While it's important to have a healthy body, over-obsession with weight and appearance is not one of the characteristics of a healthy mind. If anything, guys prefer girls with a slight bit of flab to reed-thin girls who look on the verge of collapse.</div>

Apparently, it is better for you to do that because your body doesn't need to work as hard to digest because there's less food.<br></div></blockquote>That's what I do. I eat a lot of small, regular meals instead of three big ones. My metabolism is such that I get full pretty quickly and get hungry quite quickly at the same time.<br><br>One thing, bedroom. I think I can sum up all the advice that everyone has been telling you in this thread within two words:<br><br>EAT MORE.<br><br>You yourself said that you've been more lethargic than usual. For all we know, that may be the starting symptoms of hypoglycaemia, i.e. low blood glucose levels. That's not just restricted to diabetics.... a really active person who does not take in enough energy can have it as well.<br><br>Refer to this website: <a href="http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/diseases/facts/bloodsugarlow.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/diseases/facts/bloodsugarlow.htm</a><br><br>They list out the symptoms of hypoglycaemia there.<br><br>They even talked about how to treat symptoms of hypoglycaemia caused by diet and exercise - eat MORE carbs.<br><br>Note that one of the possible symptoms of hypoglycaemia is loss of consciousness.<br><br>You had better start eating more.... The last thing I want to see in the newspapers is a report of some 17 year old canoeist who lost consciousness and fell into the water.<br><br>And no, I did not make that statement in jest.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by bedroom:<br><strong>Hey, i am an active 17 year old female, currently studying. Recently, i followed a diet which requires me to eat a fruit in the morning, a proper meal for lunch (but normally i will eat yong tao fu without any noodles or rice. And yes, lots of veg with soup cause i don't really like meat.) For dinner, i had 500ml of soya milk [b]or</strong> 200ml of HL milk along with a fruit. In between if i feel like muching anything, i will grab a fruit or the wang zai xiao man tou. (i love it!)<br><br>I have been following this diet for about 2 weeks before finding myself getting more tired than usual as i am actively involved in my sport (train 5 days a week). But one good thing about this diet is that it solved my constipation problems. Usual i went to the toilet perhaps twice a week. But now it's every 2 days.<br><br>Is my tiredness due to my lack of food? But i hardly feel hungry. oh ya, i've been eating lot of beans too. (soya bean, beancurd) i heard that eating too much beans will affect your limps. Is it true? =( Anyone with the knowledge please help!<br><br>Another thing is, as my carbo intake was very low, will it affect my muscle growth? I don't wanna be big but i wanna be strong..any advice?<br><br>thanks in advance.[/b]</blockquote>Your main problem is that you are not taking in enough carbohydrates, which is the main source of energy in your body. Without a sufficient amount of carbohydrates in your meals, your body will not have enough energy, especially when you consider the fact that you exercise/train 5 days a week.<br><br>The reason you don't feel hungry is because your body has a substantial amount of dietary fibre. Dietary fibre fills you up.<br><br>Your diet also consists of a high amount of protein. Protein in a diet fills you up more quickly than carbohydrates or fats.<br><br>Soya Beans are high in protein, hence you feel full more quickly and often after a meal.<br><br>If you want your muscle growth to be high, you will need to take in MORE carbohydrates, as if you don't, your body will burn its protein supplies for energy, and that is not what you want. Good sources of carbohydrates would be rice, bread, potatoes, noodles, et cetera.<br><br>Hope this helps.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Do more also of other exercises that can burn yourself away... But while doing all these... Be careful of exercises which might give you a bigger skeleton bone structure and also building up of muscles at certain areas... You'll really need to devote quite alot of your time into these..</div>
