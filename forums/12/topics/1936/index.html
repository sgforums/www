Also draw AN AGREEMENT between you two... (Perhaps even draw out schedule when he and his gf can use the room when you're NOT around...) If AN AGREEMENT CAN'T be met, BOIL down to SCHOOL and REGULATIONs that might provide him in his ways.... IF there ISN'T, TRY getting another room mate OR improving on your relationship with your room mate until he's willing to hear you out... The WORSE STEP?

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanx guys.. Well it's settled.. I left the room that day, and went to computer lab to pose you guys the question. Then I went to the dormitary lobby and slept on the sofa. what do you expect me to do?? burge in again arhz?? Wrote him my views, and later that night he said 'sorryz'. I believe that it will be pretty embarrassing if I were to address the problem verbally. Think he understands how I feel... Told him that if I were to be the one bring back a girl, doubt he will feel comfortable too... Thank goodness he understands.. If not, I'll piss him off by breaking the fire alarm and get them to go back to their rooms.. ehehhe~<br><br>Once again thanx guys..

Well some of you can say just sleep only mahz... no big deal right?? and probably some of you are doing it. hey, the thing is that I'm in that tiny little room too manz.. It's more or less like a square room with about 5m each wall. What they do and what they say, I can even hear each word so clearly manz.. She was asking him if I can see what they are doing... Felt like replying, yes very clearly, and can hear you guys very loudly too. *Pissed*...<br><br>It's not about what they are doing that really matters too.. I'm not really bothered if my friends get down to intimate stuff.. Between a B&amp;G who don't?? But just wondering if you guys like to do it with someone else in the room... It's not like in the public where you do PDA and there's like quite a number of people around you. This is just making out with another person around. Just pose this question to you. Do you like the idea when your friend invite you to stay over at his/her place and tells you that his/her partner will be there as well?? Will you still be going?? Doubt so right?? That's how I feel.. so awkward... so extra...<br><br>anyway, in the end I got up, pack my things and left the room.<br><br>What are your views?? and probably can suggest methods to avoid this.<br><br></div></blockquote>Which hall u stay ah?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
