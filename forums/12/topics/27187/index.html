            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>Hope someone here can hear me out. About 1 year ago, I met this girl, we went on good and she knew that I like her. But it all had to end when she broke to me the news that she actually has a BF. She asked me to move on and said the usual stuff like 'you can definitely find someone better'. So after weeks of heartbreak, I led my usual life again trying to be the happy-me once more.<br><br>It was then when I met this other girl, we went on good and I thought maybe she could make me happy. Til I liked her very much, she told me that she still hasn't got over her ex-BF. So I thought, why not wait on and show that I'm really sincere? Who knows, 2 weeks after, she called me to give up.<br><br>I was at that point of time, extremely disillusioned. I vowed to not get myself into something like this again. So I tried my best not to like anyone and avoid heartbreaks. So I had this rather close friend of mine, she was always there to talk to me and etc. After bout 3 months, we sorta grew to like each other. And like before, I fell for her but then outta the blue she just said that she has no feelings for me at all and that I can never have her.<br><br>At that point of time, it felt very "normal". So I went to try my luck with this other girl very recently but I didn't tell her that I liked her nor commit any liking for her. And just when I thought it's alright now, and I was gonna tell her I had some feelings for her, she tells me that this guy asked her and there's no way she's gonna reject him. I was like, dang it!<br><br>Now I feel extremely sad <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Am I cursed or is it just coincidence?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi H_Koala,<br><br>Don't feel sad, or dejected that you have not found the right girl. I nkow it's easier said that done.<br><br>Let me share my story with you.<br><br>From a rather tender age, things started out for me as puppy love. I see someone whom I think I like and I try to "chase" her. Well, I never really got together with anyone that way.<br><br>As the years went by, going through Sec Sch, I thought I really liked someone and made efforts to let her know that I liked her. It was still puppy love. The same happened in JC days. I think you're getting the picture.<br><br>Then in my NS days, I met a Malaysian girl. We hit it off quite well. I even called her occasionally over the phone to her place in KL (cost me a lot of NS pay). But that taught how to talk with a girl over the phone (with the short 5min we had each time coz I only could afford $5 phone cards).<br><br>That "relationship" (if you can even call it one) didn't last very long.<br><br>I then met a church girl in my NS days. I thought she was the one for me. In the end, found out she was only interested in getting me to go to her church (I was "abandoned" once we reached the destination).<br><br>Life went on and I was in my NUS days. I met some girls, not for anything but just friends. I liked some of them, but never asked any if we could go steady. Then in my 3rd year, I met a junior. I thought we really had something going. She was nice and all. We went out together sometimes after school. But when I asked her to be my girlfriend, she told me she had boyfriend already (but was going to breakup). So I waited with patience. One day after exams, she left me a note. It was to end our "relationship".<br><br>So you see, to that point, I've never really been in a real relationship. Before any could really take off, it already crashed and burned.<br><br>Later on, I met someone. We got along very well. We could share happy moments and sad moments together. But at the back of my mind was the preparation that we might not even last beyond this. I was preparing myself for rejection. That way, I wouldn't feel hurt if things didn't work out. I just played the normal guy and was myself all the time. No longer was I all out to impress the girl. I just decided to be myself.<br><br>And lo behold, over time, we grew closer and closer and finally now, we are a couple.<br><br>The point I'm trying to make is that you don't have to feel sad or miserable that a relationship does not take off. Trust that there will be someone out there for you eventually. You just haven't met her yet.<br><br>That was how I found my girlfriend.<br><br>I hope this helps.<br><br>Regards, Colin Teo</div>
