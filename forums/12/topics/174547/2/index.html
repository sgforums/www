My uncle committed suicide because he was lonely. He was probably a little autistic, had no friends he could relate to, and slowly as he grew older, he could not keep a job and he stayed at home more and more and eventually completely lost touch with society. Eventually he could see no purpose in living anymore. We missed all the signs because he complains a lot all the time. And then finally it was too late. Loneliness? Because he had a toy helicopter, and when he died, my grandma put it on the table, and the worn wheels was what struck a chill in my heart when suddenly I had an image of him sitting in the room looking at the helicopter go round and round, over and over again.<br><br>You, on the other hand are not autistic, and it isn't too late to make a difference to your own life. Stop complaining and give yourself and other people a chance. Take control of your life because you can. You really really can.</div>
