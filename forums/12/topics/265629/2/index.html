TS shld sit down with his gf n encourage her to air her feelings probs thoughts etc. by doing so perhaps can find out the cause of her nonsense n it shows that TS is taking a gentlemanly move by initiating such a move. by right he shld not be doing this. if his gf continues her own ways just refer to solution 1.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well though my advice was harsh but i encouraged ts to adopt a gentlemanly move to discuss the issues with his gf didnt i ? i did not condemn his gf str away by asking ts to tell her to get lost or such. by ts taking the 1st step it shows that he still values his gf n wish to clear whatever probs they might have. i mean if his gf still cant see it then i have nothing to say.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
