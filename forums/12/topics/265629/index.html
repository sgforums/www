            <div class='col-md body'>Well..... from what i see from your post, you are with her most of YOUR time and showing some CARE. Experienced or not, you have done your part as a BF and she is being unreasonable about it.<br><br>Think i have a few suggestions for u.<br><br>1) This time, you could really make her UNDERSTAND that you can't be with her ALL THE TIME. Mututal understanding between couples is important to make a healthy relationship. If that doesn't work, well... Move On i guess.<br><br>2) Ask her what she meant by "You are not caring enough" and if she compares you with others(especially her ex), then tell her that YOU is YOU and OTHERS is OTHERS. Ask her what she really wants of you as a BF and make clear to her that you are already doing what you can.<br><br>3) Sorry to say this but, i think a girl like this is not worth even though she is the most beautiful person in this world.<br><br>4) She needs to loosen that grip or else i guarantee you one day u will flare up.<br><br>5) Tolerate her till your death.<br><br>The first 4 are not SAFE suggestions which leads to breakup. For ways about making them stronger, eh i can't think of any based on what you have posted.<br><br>If you are choosing the 5th one, Good Luck!!!</div>
