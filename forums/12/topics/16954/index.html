            <div class='col-md body'>I'm back<br><br>I think being happy means being satisfied wif urself most of the time. I think I'm quite happy most of the time, unless something really bad crops up, else I wun feel sad.<br><br>Having lots of frens doesn't really help much if they can't humour u or sth. I mean, having a lot of frens depends on whether u are an extrovert or an introvert, whether u like company a not. It doesn't really mean that u wil really b happy if u dun like company. Some pple are juz better off alone.<br><br>For me, I think my GP prelims yesterday did badly. Wrote out of point for essay, and it is the PRELIMS. Of cuz I feel sad, but den, we muz learn to let things go. I mean, it is not good to haf something that keep bothering u.<br><br>So in the end, whether u are happy depends on how u view ur life.

            <div class='col-md body'>Think many of you may not know about this, but in life there are different kinds of happiness... There sure is...<br><br>For instance, when you have a quarrel with your partner, you turn to your dear friends, and you find happiness when you laugh at the jokes and the silly conversations that involve them... In Chinese it's kuai le.<br><br>However, when you are with your partner, it's no longer a feeling of just happiness that you are happy. It's no more laughing, but just sweet smilings, to yourself in your heart.. that's happiness too... in Chinese it's called xing fu.<br><br>Then there's the warmth that a family have.. that's call wen luan in Chinese... They all make a percentage of internal happiness...<br><br>Then there's the external happiness where by you could have won a lottery... A good example, but *touch wood* *touches ApPlE_PiE's head* heheh~ when your dear partner is to pass away, and you receive news that you won a lottery, you will be caught in between... No doubt you can say that it's heartless for someone to think of money when one is giving respects for the dead, but hey a different part of the brain gets stimulated all together... hence you will feeling both...<br><br>Then there's the other example. When last person in your family died, *touch wood* again, aren't you comforted that your loved one is there comforting you?? YOu will have a sense of happiness because you know that there's still someone who cares for you... and it's from a different source, which touches a different part of you.<br><br>Okiez.. that's what I believe... To me, I feel happiness when I'm being loved by my loved ones and friends... You may not know this, but in most cases your family is the one that loves you most, thus bring you much happiness... And it's usually not know to people, as it's never being mentioned openly, like you never hug you parents, when you know that they care for you, or prepare your breakfast...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ApPlE_PiE:</div><div class="quote_body">What exactly is a happy life?<br><br>Being with the person u love?

But personally working on my own 'theory of ultimate life'.... A way which life could be led with 'equal happiness', 'coexistency' and 'truth of existence(?)'....?<br>The main problem would be that we're all 'individuals'.... The ultimate power which would make us STRONG also at the same time falls us apart.... Everybody holds a different definition for 'happiness'... And what can YOU do to convince me that I SHOULD listen to your side of the story...? Hmm....<br>Perhaps when people get a better picture of the 'big picture', they just MIGHT...? Might be interested...? MIGHT care..? MIGHT bother... Hmm... But there're still some things which I can't really figure out...? And failure to understand these and explain them adequately NOT ONLY would not help me in getting the people to understand the 'big picture' BUT might even cause people to MISINTERPRET it...?<br>Hmm.... Need MORE TIME... Perhaps MORE HELP..? Hmm... Then again MAYBE NOT...? More INSPIRATIONs....? Hmm....<br>Oh yeah... OFFTRACK... Sorry!!  :p To me PERSONALLY, there're TWO ways to ACHIEVE that 'happy life'.... (1) GETTING NOTHING at all... (2) GETTING EVERYTHING YOU WANT.... Err..... The two above had already been mentioned by some other... Err... 'founders(?)'... They actually involves much more of a 'theory' NOT established (by myself lah...) yet.... But BASICALLY, I can tell you that (2) very often would 'CROSS FIRE' with paths or plans of others and IS itself a DEEP 'self-leading' hole.... In other words, no ESTABLISHED grounds for 'true fulfilment' have been found for now.... But its EXISTENCE of course hold PART of its own PROs.... But it would not discussed here however, until maybe its grounds can be MORE etablished...? But all in all, (1) IS the picture that would lead us to the 'ultimate life' mentioned earlier.... SUPPOSINGLY..?<br><br>------------------<br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....

There sure is...<br><br>For instance, when you have a quarrel with your partner, you turn to your dear friends, and you find happiness when you laugh at the jokes and the silly conversations that involve them... In Chinese it's kuai le.<br><br>However, when you are with your partner, it's no longer a feeling of just happiness that you are happy. It's no more laughing, but just sweet smilings, to yourself in your heart.. that's happiness too... in Chinese it's called xing fu.<br><br>Then there's the warmth that a family have.. that's call wen luan in Chinese... They all make a percentage of internal happiness...<br><br>Then there's the external happiness where by you could have won a lottery... A good example, but *touch wood* *touches ApPlE_PiE's head* heheh~ when your dear partner is to pass away, and you receive news that you won a lottery, you will be caught in between... No doubt you can say that it's heartless for someone to think of money when one is giving respects for the dead, but hey a different part of the brain gets stimulated all together... hence you will feeling both...<br><br>Then there's the other example. When last person in your family died, *touch wood* again, aren't you comforted that your loved one is there comforting you?? YOu will have a sense of happiness because you know that there's still someone who cares for you... and it's from a different source, which touches a different part of you.<br><br>Okiez.. that's what I believe... To me, I feel happiness when I'm being loved by my loved ones and friends... You may not know this, but in most cases your family is the one that loves you most, thus bring you much happiness... And it's usually not know to people, as it's never being mentioned openly, like you never hug you parents, when you know that they care for you, or prepare your breakfast...<br><br></div></blockquote>Bear...i'm an apple pie...not a woody pie! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>As LoNg As I SHaLL LiVe<br>I'LL HoLd U dEaR<br>AnD I wILL rEMiNiScE<br>Of OuR LoVe ALL ThRoUgH<br>ThE YeArS....</div>
