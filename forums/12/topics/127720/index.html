            <div class='col-md body'>Dear InsidiousGG,<br><br>The 1st thing that comes to mind is that there should be trust, &amp; that this is a trust issue.  However, human feelings come into play...<br><br>Your friend is understandably insecure, who wouldn't be when there used to be deep (?) feelings between his girl &amp; her ex.  Whilst he may trust her, he may also worry that her ex may try to woo her back.  This is supported by him giving her gifts, taking her out to movies, etc.  Your friend's anxiety may be even worsened because she hasn't offered to bring him along.<br><br>So, the suggestion is this, ask him to tell his girl about his feelings.  If she loves him enough, she'll know what to do.  He probably shouldn't insist that she stop being friends with her ex, but a reasonable request would be that she brings him along, so he can assess his competition.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by InSidiousGG:</div><div class="quote_body">Yesterday I had a chat with one of my long time friends and he told me this..<br><br>Here is the scene:<br><br>He has this girlfriend and both of them love each other very much..however his girlfriend has been seeing his Ex..as in not dating..erm like going for movie..chilling/hanging out..receiving gifts from Ex..ya sort of..now he's feeling insecure..worry that.. u know all that kind of stuff..

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Tuatau,<br><br>To some extent, I agree AND disagree with your 1st para.  Yes, I agree that when a guy wants to woo his ex-gf back, he wouldn't ask her to bring her current bf along.  In this situation, it appears he hasn't, &amp; is pretty happy with having the current bf outta the pic.  The 2nd sentence is what I disagree with.  The girlfriend may Not want to make things awkward, but she still needs to consider her current bf's feelings.  It may have contributed to her current bf's insecurity?<br><br>Notwithstanding the above, I do agree with your last para.  The current bf has to be mentally prepared that she's evaluating her options, whether or Not to stay with him.

Who knows? Perhaps she is just an open-minded free spirit that such thoughts are simply beneath her.</div>

A good bit depends on the circumstances under which they chose to break off the relationship. To me, trust is one thing, lollying about and receiving gifts from an EX is a totally different matter (unless it's a birthday or xmas gift). Seems to me she can't decide if she wants the current bf or go back to her Ex.<br><br>Agree with those who suggested your friend should have a serious talk with his gf. Based on her answers, he'll have a pretty good idea what's going on.  I'd be prepared for the worst, too, if he hasn't been doing anything with the opposite sex that's making his gf see red  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Being open or having one's own space and friends.....well, to me, this one has perhaps crossed the line.  I guess it's okay to remain friends and perhaps chat once in a while but hanging out with an ex?  If I value my current relationship, I wouldn't do that.  It's a form of respect for my current beau as well as taking his feelings into consideration.  I mean if the tables are turned, like if he is hanging out with his ex, can I take it?  Trust is one thing but if it happened frequent enough, the trust and security will also wane.  Natural reactions, you think?<br><br>Humans are such.  We get absorbed into environments (ambience).  We behave as the environment presents and then may regret later, whether be it our actions or our speech.  And with an Ex, there is that familiarity feeling or "ching mei liao" thing.  Maybe, I don't know.  But seriously, your friend should have a chat with her and let her know his feelings.  She may honestly thinks he is okay with it.  If she knows that he has certain uneasiness then I am sure she should know what to do.<br><br>Good luck to your friend.  Hope everything will turn out well.</div>
