              A little background:
              
              This has been ongoing for almost a few years. My family has shifted from hdb to condominiums (several in fact), one including a three-storey clustered house, and finally back to a HDB. The credit debt took a toll on my parents and we had to shift to a 4-room HDB flat. (Approx 1.5 years back). We're a family of 5, me including 2 brothers (1 in NS, the other unemployed.) 
              
              I thought life would be better now after we moved out from the 3storey apartment as the housing loan is out of the way. However, this was not the case. Worse in fact since my dad can't even afford to give my and my brother allowances. My parents, especially dad's, credit card debts ballooned, and I kept overhearing my parents arguing over such issues (i.e. dad wants to borrow a sum from mom to pay off some overdue debt repayments etc). I have no idea how it ballooned up, and my dad being a very egoistic man refuse to open up to my mom, let alone the children. He did borrowed a sum (few hundred to a thousand) from my brother even. 
              
              According to my mother, she herself has debts $60-70k. My dad's debt should probably hit over $100k. He has been going around borrowing from friends/family members as well. 
              
              Ever since I've started University (last August), I have came to realize the severity of my parents' credit debts as they were not able to pay my school fees, and hence taking up a bank loan for it. I thought things would improve, but obviously, things are getting rougher for the family. Now, my parents are even considering selling the 4 Room flat too and we would have to live in rental apartments possibly. I suppose this is the very last resort. 
              
              I believe this problem is caused mainly from my dad's careless spending habits and his mentality to not seek help or confide in others. I am at my wits now, I do not wish to see my parents living in abundant worries every other day. My twin brother and I have tried talking to my dad about it, but he always shun the matter. Even if we could talk about it, we are not in possess of any financial knowledge to advise on my dad.
              
              Is there any one who could advise on my situation? Should we look for a debt counsellor etc? Does anyone know the costs of seeking one? Should my dad even contemplate declaring bankrupt?

              <p>if the problem is you dad's spending and your mum still earns enough to support the rest of the family, the best way is to cut him off. pay only for the bills incurred  by the rest of the family, makeit clear to relatives you won't pay for your father's debt. </p>
              <p>This way the liability is only confined to your father and you can still live ok.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>A little background:</p>
              <p>This has been ongoing for almost a few years. My family has
              shifted from hdb to condominiums (several in fact), one including a
              three-storey clustered house, and finally back to a <span>HDB</span>. The credit debt took a toll on my parents and we had
              to shift to a 4-room <span>HDB</span> flat. (Approx 1.5
              years back). We’re a family of 5, me including 2 brothers (1 in NS,
              the other unemployed.)</p>
              <p>I thought life would be better now after we moved out from the
              3storey apartment as the housing loan is out of the way. However,
              this was not the case. Worse in fact since my dad can’t even afford
              to give my and my brother allowances. My parents, especially dad’s,
              credit card debts ballooned, and I kept overhearing my parents
              arguing over such issues (i.e. dad wants to borrow a sum from mom
              to pay off some overdue debt repayments etc). I have no idea how it
              ballooned up, and my dad being a very egoistic man refuse to open
              up to my mom, let alone the children. He did borrowed a sum (few
              hundred to a thousand) from my brother even.</p>
              <p>According to my mother, she herself has debts $60-70k. My dad’s
              debt should probably hit over $100k. He has been going around
              borrowing from friends/family members as well.</p>
              <p>Ever since I’ve started University (last August), I have came to
              realize the severity of my parents’ credit debts as they were not
              able to pay my school fees, and hence taking up a bank loan for it.
              I thought things would improve, but obviously, things are getting
              rougher for the family. Now, my parents are even considering
              selling the 4 Room flat too and we would have to live in rental
              apartments possibly. I suppose this is the very last resort.</p>
              <p>I believe this problem is caused mainly from my dad’s careless
              spending habits and his mentality to not seek help or confide in
              others. I am at my wits now, I do not wish to see my parents living
              in abundant worries every other day. My twin brother and I have
              tried talking to my dad about it, but he always shun the matter.
              Even if we could talk about it, we are not in possess of any
              financial knowledge to advise on my dad.</p>
              <p>Is there any one who could advise on my situation? Should we
              look for a debt counsellor etc? Does anyone know the costs of
              seeking one? Should my dad even contemplate declaring bankrupt?</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Just as the other forummers have kindly suggested, your main focus now should be on your studies, as there is nothing much you can do with regards to your parents' debts. If the worst scenario is to play out, with both your parents losing their jobs and becoming bankrupts, they will have to depend on you and your sibling.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">With both your parents having debts of over $60k each, it speaks a lot about their spending habits. Credit counselling is indubitably important, but you may wish to help out by keeping an eye out for your parents, especially when they attempt to splurge on what they want, not what they need.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Cheers.</p>

              hi all, thanks so much for the advises here. 
              
              IM sorry for this late reply! Busy from school!! thanks jojobeach for the contact, I will persuade my dad to go for credit counseling. I sure do hope something would worked out from there!
              
              For a good start, me and my twin brother have already spoken to dad, we worked out sums that he owed, and how much does he spent every month, and on what (frankly, it's mostly on lottery and drinking beer, and providing for my elder brother (as mentioned, he's unemployed, and is really another problem our family is facing) 
              
              Yes and I believe I should also change my mindset too. Sometimes, I feel kinda envious when peers of my age do not have to worry about their own school fees, let alone their parents' finance. But I guess this is my family's karma, something I can't run away from. I've accepted it, put my grudges down. All I hope now is for my Dad to work with the rest of us. Meanwhile, I'm trying to get tuition assignments to cope with my own allowance.
              
              side note: mom don't really have a stable income. property agent you see. she's been working really hard too. And for sure I wouldn't wanna cut off ties with my dad!! I'll try my best to make things work!!
              
              again, thanks everyone so much for the enthusiastic response!!!

              <p>May I kindly know the reason as to why your sibling is unemployed? I certainly hope that he is spending most of his time looking for a job right now. </p>
