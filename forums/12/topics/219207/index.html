Imagine a group outing when suddenly one guy emo and disappear for 1hr+ without telling the group.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Beat her up, cause her to be stressed or commit sucide or whatever. You see emotions are good to a certain extend, but some people let it run too wild and this is what you get.  These people cannot control themselves and do not realise the pain they cause others. Not all guys are like that. The ones I know are very suitable candidates for Hougang Chalet and strong medical assistance.<br>I had an ex-colleague who screamed in lifts at the 49th floor that he had not slept with his wife for 2-3 years. In fact they live apart. His is one emo case and his wife know that leaving him will cause him and her a lot or harm. Very Undesirable situation.</div>
