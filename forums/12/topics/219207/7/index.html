And it is a blog which is placed in a public space, so everyone can view and give comments about it. If you are scared of people giving you constructive criticisms and do not want to ever learn from those, might as well keep the whole blog to yourself and make it private. Problem solved.<br><br>From what I think is that, if you want to make something public, you must be able to accept criticisms graciously. Maybe this is just a lesson this person has to learn.</div>
