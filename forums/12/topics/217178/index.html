            <div class='col-md body'>I feeling very guilty now about being in a very deep crush with my female colleague. I've a girlfriend of 6 years and our relationahip has been wonderful, we've been travelling the world together many times and she's my best friend. Recently I had to work with this female colleague of mine on a project. Not sure how it happened but I just can't stop thinking about her.<br><br>During the project, we had drinks every night and we seem to get along extremely well. So well that I thought she was my girlfriend. I think she likes me as well, but I'm not sure. She would come to me to chat very often. As we drank, she would rest her head on my shoulder. I just feel so comfortable with her around.<br><br>Even in office today, we would chat like friends and make fun of each other. Nothing that hints that we are close. I can't help but look at her each time she walks past my desk. She would look at me and give me a sweet smile.<br><br>I'm feeling really in the pits right now. I know it's wrong. I don't want this to happen and I treasure my relationship with my girlfriend. I need the strength to break free of such feelings but can't seem to find it.<br><br>I'm ashamed to talk to anyone about this but to share it anonymously here.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Does your colleague know that you're already attached?<br><br>Make it clear to her that you're already attached and you love your girlfriend very much. And meanwhile, sort your feelings out and be clear once and for all to whom your heart really belongs to.<br><br>And may I suggest laying off the alcohol. As you can see, it helps removes the inhibitions between you and your colleague. She may lay her head on your shoulder one day, but it may go further the next.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yo dude, it's perfectly normal.<br><br>BUT u got to ask urself, "What are the consequences if i take the wrong step?" Just imagine how disastrous it would be if u break ur gf's trust. That would stoop your morals to a new low.<br><br>As u have said, ur gf is your best friend, is she replaceable? If she's not, then u must reconsider your feelings and set it right.<br><br>I have been in the same shoes as you before, so i hope that helps.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I've a girlfriend of 6 years and our relationahip has been wonderful, we've been travelling the world together many times and she's my best friend. Recently I had to work with this female colleague of mine on a project. Not sure how it happened but I just can't stop thinking about her.<br><br>During the project, we had drinks every night and we seem to get along extremely well. So well that I thought she was my girlfriend. I think she likes me as well, but I'm not sure. She would come to me to chat very often. As we drank, she would rest her head on my shoulder. I just feel so comfortable with her around.<br><br>Even in office today, we would chat like friends and make fun of each other. Nothing that hints that we are close. I can't help but look at her each time she walks past my desk. She would look at me and give me a sweet smile.<br><br>I'm feeling really in the pits right now. I know it's wrong. I don't want this to happen and I treasure my relationship with my girlfriend. I need the strength to break free of such feelings but can't seem to find it.<br><br>I'm ashamed to talk to anyone about this but to share it anonymously here. </div></blockquote>gnehp. you must sit yourself down and ask yourself who do you really want.<br><br>I know ppl who make me WISH i'm single.... but that's just superficial... I am attracted to them. that's all at the end of it all, i still love my boy!<br><br>tell you what, take a short trip with your gf, for that trip cut off all contact with the 'outside world'. my guess is that after a 6 yr relationship, the sparks have diminished.... so do something out of the ordinary to put the spark back into the relationship!<br><br>by the way I admire the fact you feel that she's your best friend! all the more you shoould treasure her. it's not everyday we can find a partner who are also our bestfriend!!!</div>
