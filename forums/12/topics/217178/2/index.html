BUT, u must think when the crush is over, what is left behind?<br><br>U hv a gf for 6yrs now, I beleived u both hv already reach the stage of being "get use" or "xi guan". This is the most vulnerable stage of a relationship whereby u both will take for granted.<br><br>If u hv a good relationship wif ur present gf now, y shld u go for a crush where u don't know the outcome? On top of that, u hv to build the relationship all over again. Unless u hv no more feeling for ur gf now, that is different ball game, but u said u 2 are perfect rite now.<br><br>I beleived ur female colleague is a attractive one, but trust me, when a man reach a certain age, u will find out that outlook is no more important, most important is what is inside a woman thats counts. I m not saying that ur female colleague is evil...... I think u shld know wat i mean....<br><br>Last but not least, be fair to ur gf, try to build a perfect relationship with her on top of a good one now, instead to choose a unknown relationship.<br><br>I hv fell down once b4, trust me, it is REAL painful, till now i still regret it, but life goes on.......... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>May Buddha bless u......<br><br></div>

I share a lot of things about myself with my dear. He does the same to me as well. Whenever any of us has a problem, we will let each other know and will try to help each other out.<br><br>Of course, we are more than frens as well, we do have our intimate moments etc that frens do not have, but that does not mean he is not my best fren. I define close frens as those who will stand by you in the moment of needs and someone I can trust and have faith in.<br><br>If I cant find a best friend in my dear, who else can I find it in? I don't think I am that close to anyone else and no one else is always so ready to help me when I am in some deep trouble. And this does not lead to me taking him for granted. In fact it has helped us to appreaciate each other more.<br><br>Don't tell me that you do not share your problems with your gf? Does that cause her to take you for granted? Helping her when she is in trouble will cause her to do that to you?<br><br>if yes, then I think your relationship might be the dysfunctional one instead.</div></blockquote>hmm...<br><br>I agree when you said best friends help you when there are times of need. But best friends cannot be intimate with each other unless when there's chemistry it may bring over to the line of lovers.<br><br>But when it comes to being your gf/bf, things are different. We place special priority over the best friends at times. There's a tendency that we will treat our lovers better than best friends. Also, when it comes to r/s stuff, we also expect our partners to treat us well. There's a form of expectation there from both partners.<br><br>Don't get me wrong and don't put words into my speech by saying that helping her when she is in trouble will cause her to be like that. I want partners to help one another when there is trouble in times of crisis.<strong> But I think it's not good for the r/s to keep treating your gf as someone who will constantly be your Aunt Agony.</strong><br><br>Trust me, it's not good for the r/s. Constantly treating your gf as Aunt Agony as in keep complaining to her your negativities will make her lose feelings because you are putting a lot of discomfort onto her, ie pressure. Try to stay positive as much as possible. Don't allow trivial stuff to cause your own self-esteem to be wrecked.<br><br><strong>The man is supposed to be a source of inspiration for the lady, not to drown her with sorrows.</strong> Lady, I don't know about you. Would you like it if your bf keeps telling you sad stuff everyday, day in day out? I believe you are a very nice person and will console your bf as much as possible. But if he keeps complaining every single little thing to you every single minute as compared to a guy who keeps being positive as much as possible even though he is facing obstacles, who will you prefer?<br><br>That's my role as a lover. I will keep talking positives as much as possible. I want my lady to be happy. It's not being deluded, it's you looking at the bright side of things despite facing setbacks. Life will always throw something at you and if you are always going to be worked up, you are not going to live for long. So, always stay positive, happy and encourage each other. Don't take yourself too seriously and learn to laugh out loud easily, then move on. I don't want to keep harping on problems after problems with my girl.<br><br>After saying so much, so what is the difference between a lover and a best friend? It's that, you can share your best friends with your problems but try to stay away talking too much about your problems. We do talk about problems but I will not want to keep talking about it. The main priority of the r/s is to be a happy and upbeat one all the way.<strong> It's how you see things. You can remain positive or choose to be negative. </strong><br><br>I know you may disagree but it's ok. It's how I see things should be.<br><br>doko<br><br><strong></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a lot of good advice here... but let me add on something <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>This is a "colleague". And be mindful of office romance if u value your career.<br><br>it is common to flirt even when attached. so I think you shouldn't read too much into this gal's action towards you.<br><br>Maybe all she wants is a flirt.... and nothing long term and u r just making yourself miserable by being so concern and worried...<br><br>as for flirting. it is quite common lah. just don't let it get out of hand.... i think you are basically pretty much at the threshold of flirting already... move along somemore and u r pretty like "cheating" on your gf.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I thank you all who have responded for your comments and advice. I know what I want in life, just that the part of getting rid of the feeling for my colleague is tough. We sit side by side, separated by a partition. I see her everyday and we communicate in office by popping our heads across the partition. Still joke a lot everyday in office. I'm sure the feeling will fade away soon. When I think back, I would laugh at my foolishness.</div>

I've a girlfriend of 6 years and our relationahip has been wonderful, we've been travelling the world together many times and she's my best friend. Recently I had to work with this female colleague of mine on a project. Not sure how it happened but I just can't stop thinking about her.<br><br>During the project, we had drinks every night and we seem to get along extremely well. So well that I thought she was my girlfriend. I think she likes me as well, but I'm not sure. She would come to me to chat very often. As we drank, she would rest her head on my shoulder. I just feel so comfortable with her around.<br><br>Even in office today, we would chat like friends and make fun of each other. Nothing that hints that we are close. I can't help but look at her each time she walks past my desk. She would look at me and give me a sweet smile.<br><br>I'm feeling really in the pits right now. I know it's wrong. I don't want this to happen and I treasure my relationship with my girlfriend. I need the strength to break free of such feelings but can't seem to find it.<br><br>I'm ashamed to talk to anyone about this but to share it anonymously here. </div></blockquote>Just wondering why you had drinks with her every night...

But best friends cannot be intimate with each other unless when there's chemistry it may bring over to the line of lovers.<br><br>But when it comes to being your gf/bf, things are different. We place special priority over the best friends at times. There's a tendency that we will treat our lovers better than best friends. Also, when it comes to r/s stuff, we also expect our partners to treat us well. There's a form of expectation there from both partners.<br><br>Don't get me wrong and don't put words into my speech by saying that helping her when she is in trouble will cause her to be like that. I want partners to help one another when there is trouble in times of crisis.[b] But I think it's not good for the r/s to keep treating your gf as someone who will constantly be your Aunt Agony.</strong><br><br>Trust me, it's not good for the r/s. Constantly treating your gf as Aunt Agony as in keep complaining to her your negativities will make her lose feelings because you are putting a lot of discomfort onto her, ie pressure. Try to stay positive as much as possible. Don't allow trivial stuff to cause your own self-esteem to be wrecked.<br><br><strong>The man is supposed to be a source of inspiration for the lady, not to drown her with sorrows.</strong> Lady, I don't know about you. Would you like it if your bf keeps telling you sad stuff everyday, day in day out? I believe you are a very nice person and will console your bf as much as possible. But if he keeps complaining every single little thing to you every single minute as compared to a guy who keeps being positive as much as possible even though he is facing obstacles, who will you prefer?<br><br>That's my role as a lover. I will keep talking positives as much as possible. I want my lady to be happy. It's not being deluded, it's you looking at the bright side of things despite facing setbacks. Life will always throw something at you and if you are always going to be worked up, you are not going to live for long. So, always stay positive, happy and encourage each other. Don't take yourself too seriously and learn to laugh out loud easily, then move on. I don't want to keep harping on problems after problems with my girl.<br><br>After saying so much, so what is the difference between a lover and a best friend? It's that, you can share your best friends with your problems but try to stay away talking too much about your problems. We do talk about problems but I will not want to keep talking about it. The main priority of the r/s is to be a happy and upbeat one all the way.<strong> It's how you see things. You can remain positive or choose to be negative. </strong><br><br>I know you may disagree but it's ok. It's how I see things should be.<br><br>doko<br><br><strong></strong>[/b]</blockquote>okie, I get your point about not talking too much about your problems with your gf. But I do not agree with you about "the main priority of a r/s is to be happy and upbeat all the way". The path to true love is not a smooth one. If you insist on bottling everything to yourself, then what's the point of having a r/s?<br><br>As the saying goes, a problem shared is a problem halved. Sharing problems do bring couples closer as well. Of course I do not mean you should rant and complain to your gf every single day. But there is no point in trying to keep yourself positive and upbeat every single time just because you want your gf to feel happy and bottle everything to yourself. if you keep everything to yourself just because you do not want to pressure her, then one day you might just explode yourself.<br><br>Even with my best fren, I do not keep ranting to him or her. But when I have a big problem which I am troubled with for a long time, I will kinda get it out of my chest by talking to them...but that does not mean I will do this to them everyday.<br><br>Maybe you have the wrong definition of best frens as well.</div>
