Guys should spend sometime to listen to their lady. It helps maintain the r/s. As for siding with you hopefully, it depends on the situation. Yes, guys do not need to provide a solution. They are not your psychiatrist either. Sometimes, girls already know what to do. They just want to release tension.<br><br>And yes, if possible, get your guy here.

I've a girlfriend of 6 years and our relationahip has been wonderful, we've been travelling the world together many times and she's my best friend. Recently I had to work with this female colleague of mine on a project. Not sure how it happened but I just can't stop thinking about her.<br><br>During the project, we had drinks every night and we seem to get along extremely well. So well that I thought she was my girlfriend. I think she likes me as well, but I'm not sure. She would come to me to chat very often. As we drank, she would rest her head on my shoulder. I just feel so comfortable with her around.<br><br>Even in office today, we would chat like friends and make fun of each other. Nothing that hints that we are close. I can't help but look at her each time she walks past my desk. She would look at me and give me a sweet smile.<br><br>I'm feeling really in the pits right now. I know it's wrong. I don't want this to happen and I treasure my relationship with my girlfriend. I need the strength to break free of such feelings but can't seem to find it.<br><br>I'm ashamed to talk to anyone about this but to share it anonymously here. </div></blockquote>u knwo u juz want to pound her</div>
