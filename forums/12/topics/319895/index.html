              <p>My girl is deeply troubled with her family problems.</p>
              <p>As with the usual family with kids, her family controls her alot in the past, but now she is back to normal, doesnt clubs and drinks, but still the bad impression in her family's mind is still there.</p>
              <p>Her parents are sarcastic with her, and sometimes, quarrels would ensure.</p>
              <p>Basically, her family dont trust her, and as her boyfriend, i believe i can help.</p>
              <p>I know i've to let her parents know that she is in good hands, and i am getting her "back on track".</p>
              <p>I've to gain her parents' trusts, and i've no problems with being transparent with them.</p>
              <p>But the thing is, i think there might be things which i can do to soften the tension between her and her family, but, how can i start? i really need advice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Her parents had seen me and chatted with me before.</p>

              <p>In that case, do what you feel is right.</p>
              <p>Just note that all that you have built up may be destroyed in an instant if your gf does one wrong move.</p>
              <p>Because her parents already have a perception, any bad incident will only reinforce that.</p>

              <p>I want to warn you guys about taking the family route to your ger's heart.</p>
              <p>Many times it will backfire.</p>
              <p>If you side with her.. her family will say you enabling/encouraging her behavior.</p>
              <p>If you don't side with her.. your gf will blame you for not supporting her.</p>
              <p>Either way, you lose.</p>
              <p>You cannot solve her family problem.. she must deal with it herself.</p>
              <p>Just be there for her when she needs someone to talk to.</p>
              <p>Let her know that come what may, you will always be there for her.</p>
              <p>What she needs to know is that she will not all alone should her family abandons her.</p>

              <p>Jojobeach has her points, imho it is not advisable to advise her.</p>
              <p>Keep in mind that trust is earned over time and to remedy the past - the bad impression she has left behind.</p>
              <p>Attend family gatherings and arrange meals with the family, the members might be sarcastic but I guess it's best if she sucks it up for now.</p>
              <p>I guess the best way to prove that 'she' is a changed person would be achieving something in life - say; a stable job, being financially secured and eventually contributing back to the family.</p>

              <p>Hey Alvin, I agree with the others. You should keep your cool, what you able to do for her is to stay by her side and watch over her. I know you love her but she not married to you yet. So on her family view, you're a outsider though you're her lover.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I been though a few times, I know the fault lie on the past of my ex-gf/ current gf. I told them "when ever you feel upset or hurt by your family remarks, call me no matter how late in the night or during my office working hour in the day. I'll be listening and company you though the hard time".</p>

              <p>my humble opinions..</p>
              <p>I agree with what jojo said because that's what I believed. Although u feel that you have to do something, but somehow, there's always a line to draw. Internal conflicts have their own implications.</p>
              <p>Your gf knows her family more than you do. So most likely other people's(including gf) family matter you can only provide a certain level of support.</p>
              <p>Poke nose into it and you might get the "it's our family business, what's your problem?" kind of response..</p>
              <p>You're just as helpless as her.. the best thing to do is work hard and marry her. Get her out of there.</p>

              <p>Everybody have family problems, it either major or minor, but no matter what, which parents dun love their childrens? And old folks can never get along with younger ones, generation gap mah, like me, i also quarrel with ah ma and dad often, but deep inside, there is love.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, let your gf be, u may thought you know the indept of the problem, but family problem lies within each family domain, dun be a hero. Just be good and love her dearly. From the look of it, you should be worry about her relation with your mother if you guys get married.</p>
