              <p>I didnt give up if you read up on my earlier post.</p>
              <p>i was with her after she just broke up with her ex. went thru hell ever since. she was damn stressed and said break up 16 times in 2 months and alot of other stuff but i held on.</p>
              <p>when she got over it, we are very loving... thats until recently....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She took my hp without asking. once she even read my new incoming sms when i was bathing and she told me wats the sms is about. quite stunned when she did that.</p>
              <p>When i took her hp, i asked/ told her i am taking her hp to have a look but she snatched it back and stared at me/gave me a black face.</p>
              <p>I mean there was once i said no to her when she tried to look at my smses but then she replied, "why? got something to hide huh?". Then the next time i said the same to her when i tried to look at her hp but got a hell of scolding and she accused me of checking up on her.</p>
              <p>Anyway i tried to talk to her about this issue and she was very defensive.</p>
