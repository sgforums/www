              <p>Thanks for the encouragement all this while.</p>
              <p>She asked me not to waste money to buy her flowers all the time.
              I told her I have not bought her flowers for very long but she
              still kept asking me to save up the money. So i asked, what she
              wants me to save up the money for?</p>
              <p>She later said to save up to go holiday(we plan to go Taiwan
              next year). I replied, is it to save up for our marriage. She
              hugged me tighter and didnt replied for a while. When she did say
              something later, she asked for more time.</p>
              <p>I nodded, saying yes i will wait...</p>

              <p>She don't want flowers is because she is a very "PRACTICAL" person.</p>

              <p>You save 10 bouquets of flowers , can get her a Chanel Bag. ( Depends on how much is the bouquets you bought her lah).</p>
              <p>Holiday is more worth it,  than flowers that withers , die and end up in landfills.</p>
              <p>Not that she don't appreciate your gifts, but you are spending your limited resource on the wrong things.</p>

              <p>If the both of you cannot even compromise over smth as small/minor as this...then u better reconsider, and think carefully about getting married to each other. Getting married in such a state will only add on to the complications. I'm sure you do not want your future kids to suffer with you all....</p>

              get married, she got very upset, saying i keep forcing her.</p>
              <p>Since we got together 7 months ago, she was the one who said to
              get married, look for house in Apr or Oct this yr. Then say wanna
              stay single, then say look for house, then say stay single.</p>
              <p>I was very confused but this so I asked in order to know the
              current stand of our relationship and she flared up.</p>
              <p>Before I left her house after dinner she said "frankly
              speaking I feel less pressure when I am single", I said ok n
              left...</p>
              <p>Just called her few mins ago to remind her to do her father's
              income tax. The moment she hear my voice, she said " wat do u
              want?". I replied "remind you to do the tax submission". She said "
              doing now." so I replied " ok bye bye", she just hang up...
