              <p>If your girl is an emotionally uptight person, then i guess no matter how much calming down sessions or what would work ba. Maybe you make up your mind whether you want to be with her or not? Accept her for her emotional flaws, and deal with it one by one. Don't know if im saying the right thing or not also. =X</p>

              <p><br>Well, I am not very sure about this. When I first knew her as a friend, she is very happy, outgoing, not like now quite emo and insecure. After the last relationship ended then she became like this.</p>
              <p>Been 7 months now. Though she is alot better, deep down inside she seems very hurt, scar is very deep. She knows how much I love her, pamper her, care for her. Yet it seems at times she says very negative and hurtful stuff which she doesnt seem to realise.</p>
              <p>Only when I am leaving her then her actions speak for her heart, which is not to let me go...</p>

              <p>Something similar to what is happening to my brother. He's currently 25 this yr and his gf is the same age as him.</p>
              <p>My brother was very nice to her. She feels hurt and sad about the previous relationship she had because her ex 2 timed her . BUT my brother have never been in a single relationship before. So this current gf , is the 1st. When my brother is free he will always make a trip down to her office to eat lunch with her. And will fetch her home every day without fail. I strongly believed that she is taking my brother for granted. I don't know why she has to meet my brother everyday. Its like she will die if she didn't meet my brother for only a day. So , its very normal for guys to bring gf out along for friend's birthday party and outing right ? The problems started. </p>
              <p>During one of his friend's birthday party , 1 of the girl whom he knew , said hello to her. Just a mere greeting and she reprimanded my brother by saying he is flirting with her. Ever since that day , he's not allowed to go any friend's birthday party.</p>
              <p>Friend's outing.. There's a day whereby my brother meet his best friend out for dinner. For a few hours.. Few days later , his best friend wanna meet him for a movie. And his gf disapprove of him meeting his best friend saying that the dinner meeting is enough and that he should spend time with her not him. And FYI , my brother don't have much friends.</p>
              <p>Then , when my brother started working , she started doing nonsense. Like she will check on my brother's hp. And what's the most horrible stuff she did was using her extra no. to sms to my brother acting as his colleague testing him. ( Ever since my brother was with her , he stopped contacting every single girl he knows and my bro usually don't talk much to girls also..) </p>
              <p>I don't understand why she always think that my brother is hiding something from her.. To the extend that she uses my brother phone to reply to his best friend's message to check whether there's something on that she doesn't know. HOW TERRIBLE ? she's 25 mind you. I don't even do such things to my boyfriend (i'm 19 fyi) !!! </p>
              <p>She don't allow my brother to go out with his colleagues also. It was my brother's 1st job.So his colleagues had a last min outing . My brother wanna be in good terms with them. And so , he went. He told his gf about this last min outing and she's throwing trantrum .. saying that she took leave that day just to spend the time with him. Correct , but you see , he can go out with her anytime but not the colleagues ah. she fails to understand. Now my brother starts to feel unbreathable. Thanks to her. Poor thing.</p>

              <p><br>I understand.</p>
              <p>Thats why she does not wanna commit now. She said 2, 3 years which is good enough for her to decide if I am the right one for her.</p>
              <p>Her mum told me she has had a talk with her. Her mum said that she dun dare commit as she is afraid. She is afraid I will not be as nice to her after marriage, we will change heart(å�˜å¿ƒ), etc etc...</p>
              <p>Her mum also said just give her more time as she tries to talk to her again over time...</p>

              <p>when i was just with my gf, she was very nice, giving me lots of attention.</p>
              <p>now we have been together for a few months (more than 6 months) and she said i am too sticky and she often takes me for granted.</p>
              <p>she also like to take my stuff (hp, wallet etc) to have a look but yet when i asked and take her hp to look, she is very angry and snatches it back and said that i am checking up on her.</p>
              <p>can anyone tell me whats wrong nowadays?</p>

              <p>she got used to you and as a result does not bother to keep up an image to impress anymore..... in a 1 liner.... honeymoon period is over.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Option 1 ...honeymoon period over le... dispose and find another one to go over the honeymoon period again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Option 2 ...try for a serious relationship and stand up for what you think is right (in this case i think u r right.... she is just possesive, intrudes on yer privacy fullfil her possesive need and still wants her privacy).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Option 2 has 2 results.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Result 1 ...every argument she always win even though u noe u r right. If u still want to continue the relationship b rdy to b luffed at by yer peers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Result 2 ...after a period of fights... for some ppl takes years .... some ppl faster.... u will reach plateau in which case she starts to resemble a guy friend... and if u enjoy that friendship go get married.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Result 2 is also the reason behind this saying...."beside every drop dead gorgeous woman is a very bored guy"</p>

              <p>she got used to you and as a result does not bother to keep up
              an image to impress anymore..... in a 1 liner.... honeymoon period
              is over.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Option 1 ...honeymoon period over le... dispose and find another
              one to go over the honeymoon period again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Option 2 ...try for a serious relationship and stand up for what
              you think is right (in this case i think u r right.... she is just
              possesive, intrudes on yer privacy fullfil her possesive need and
              still wants her privacy).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Option 2 has 2 results.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Result 1 ...every argument she always win even though u noe u r
              right. If u still want to continue the relationship b rdy to b
              luffed at by yer peers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Result 2 ...after a period of fights... for some ppl takes years
              .... some ppl faster.... u will reach plateau in which case she
              starts to resemble a guy friend... and if u enjoy that friendship
              go get married.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Result 2 is also the reason behind this saying...."beside every
              drop dead gorgeous woman is a very bored guy"</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>She's showing her true colours (this is her true self) and letting her guard down because she's gotten comfortable with you in the relationship. This is what happens to many girls. From what you say, she is clearly very desperate to get married, since she's always looking at the HDB website and wanting to apply for one.</p>
              <p>Get your power back and tell you in no uncertain terms that you will not marry her until she bucks up and wake up her idea.</p>

              <p>now we are having another problem.</p>
              <p>We used to make out quite often. Most of the time(up to 90%) she is the one who initiate it. Now she changed a job and is quite stressed so she dun have the needs anymore.</p>
              <p>She feels that I am pressurising her into doing it, thinks that I am with her for the sex, which is not true.If she is not in the mood, we will pass. Sometimes up to 3 weeks in a go. I have not pressurised her but I have told her that she needs to relax once she knocks off. She can get so stressed that she cant sleep every night. It is affecting her daily live as well.</p>
              <p>Cos of the frequency issue, we have been having arguements after it... In fact she is the one who gets worked up and start talking about this topic and start to quarrel.</p>

              <p>So many problems again, you not sian, i see liao also sian. Postive advice is calm her down, chat with her if she cant sleep in the night, sweet talk her more, make her feel at ease. Negative advice to you will be, get a new gf.</p>

              <p>I am also sianz...</p>
              <p>I tried alot le. Have been very patience with her also. Still think its her new job that makes her like that. She was in a horrible job also but its not stressful. Just that she got horrible colleagues.</p>
              <p>In this new job, she can easily work until 8 to 10 pm daily and yet cannot manage to clear half her work.</p>
              <p>I will not consider leaving her.</p>
