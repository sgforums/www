              <p>Ultimatums should not be used so frivolously.</p>
              <p>You need to make it very clear to her that the next time she
              issues another ultimatum again, she better mean what she
              says.Because you will no longer turn back. And make sure you stick
              by it.</p>
              <p>This is YOUR ultimatum to her.</p>
              <p>Some girls uses ultimatum to test their boyfriends. If they turn
              back.. it means they still have feelings for her. Unfotunately,
              this is a destructive behavior for any relationship.</p>
              <p>While a relationship, no matter how strong the bond,  is
              still very fragile when fought within.</p>
              <p>Your girlfriend is extremely insecure. You will be constantly
              trying to "prove" your love.. but sadly.. you will find that no
              matter what you do.. it'll never be enough.</p>
              <p>Some people will go through great lengths to make a relationship
              work.</p>

              <p>Its ok. If she wants me to go home, I will go home. If she wants to break up then we break up.</p>
              <p>I have spoken to her mum over dinner last night. She has spoken to her
              mum and her mum feels that since the last relationship ended, she has
              changed. She dun trust people anymore and I also felt this too. She finds it hard to accept that I will not have another gal outside cos my father has another family outside. She feels that I will follow my father footstep.</p>

              <p>I am sure she is my future wife.</p>
              <p>We are both trying to save up and look for flats for our marriage. In the meantime we try to find a better job (or a suitable/less stressed job in her case)</p>
              <p>And she has never said break up after i turned and walked away outside her friend's pub during that  quarrel. She has learnt to have some control in a way...</p>

              <p>i see you are so sure about her being your future wife, your life time partner, really love her to go all the way to turn ur r/s better. i see all what ure doing is worth it. u said she wasnt like that in the past. she might be like this due to her work. ask her to change a job?? sit down talk to her. if she feels insecure, show her, tell her - in any way that will ease the situation.</p>

              <p>Had a chat with her on Wednesday over dinner. Asked her if she wanna
                      get married or still wanna play. She said wanna play. Wanna play as in
                      stay single, not play as in go choinging/clubbing.</p>
              <p>I asked
                      further, why she dun wanna marry? She said we are having financial
                      difficulty and have alot of problems. Financial difficulty as in we are
                      unable to buy a house due to not having enough cash though we both have
                      a stable job. She kept quiet when I asked for more details about the
                      problems we have. She seems confused at this stage.</p>
              <p>She said that
                      she feels comfortable when we nap together during weekends but she is
                      confused at moments like this. I was quite taken aback...</p>
              <p>Later
                      that night, we went back to her house to chat more. She looked
                      confused. She later said that she does not know if I am the right one.
                      We went quiet... She broke the silence and asked, what will I do if she
                      later thinks I am not the right one? I said I will leave. We went quiet
                      again... She whispered thank you after a few quiet moments.</p>
              <p>She asked if I will feel bu gan xin (ä¸�ç”˜å¿ƒï¼‰. I said yes. She
                      stroked my thigh as if calming me down, making me feel better. She said
                      shortly, we can still be friends. I smiled back bitterly. I told her I
                      hope she can make a decision soon.</p>
              <p>Bought her a bouquet of roses on Sunday as she is feeling very
                      down on Sat. We had a quick chat again. She asked me to give her some
                      time and she hugged me very tightly. She seems very badly hurt from the
                      last relationship...</p>

              <p>Sometime girls need to be sweet talked. You can try to ask directly like, eh if one day i propose to you will you accept ? Dont ask for more details, i think she needs more confidence in love and herself. Just say something like, if i am not the right one, at least i accompany you through this period of time... Sounds corny but it works. Little words like that assure her and gives her confidence. Dont pressure her too much into marriage. Give her more attention and concern</p>
