              <p>Please be very clear about this.</p>
              <p>Your gf's current behavior is not suitable to be your life long partner.</p>
              <p>She is psychologically unstable and in emotional wreck.</p>
              <p>I suggest you give this relationship another one more year.. before you decide to go for the ROM or Housing application.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i used to date a girl who was emotionally unstable due to a past relationship and work stress.  before meeting her, i was a cool confident guy.  after being with her, i become depressed and sad.  i dunno if she has bipolar disorder ??  she never confessed to me.  anyway it was hell so you have to decide how best to handle it because you WILL get affected.  try to see if it's a medical condition or psychological issue.  when i was with her, i even attended silver ribbon talks on mental health to see if i could help her.  that's the extent to which i went, tho' i did it behind her back and she never knew how much i cared n suffered for her.  we still end up split cuz she is blur blur till today.  hope your gf recover soon.</p></div>

              <p>i used to date a girl who was emotionally unstable due to a past
                  relationship and work stress.  before meeting her, i was a
                  cool confident guy.  after being with her, i become depressed
                  and sad.  i dunno if she has bipolar disorder ??  she
                  never confessed to me.  anyway it was hell so you have to
                  decide how best to handle it because you WILL get affected. 
                  try to see if it's a medical condition or psychological
                  issue.  when i was with her, i even attended silver ribbon
                  talks on mental health to see if i could help her.  that's the
                  extent to which i went, tho' i did it behind her back and she never
                  knew how much i cared n suffered for her.  we still end up

              <p>You need to make it very clear to her that the next time she issues another ultimatum again, she better mean what she says.Because you will no longer turn back. And make sure you stick by it.</p>

              <p>Some girls uses ultimatum to test their boyfriends. If they turn back.. it means they still have feelings for her. Unfotunately, this is a destructive behavior for any relationship.</p>

              <p>I can tell that you are getting tired. Well now that things have come to this, it is the best chance now to tell her to seperate for some time, to sort out her feelings as well as yours. If your heart is soft again, the cycle will repeat again, never ending. And i agree to Fbghost 12, although he may sound harsh (dumping her) however it is best now to seperate for a while, while using this period for things to cool down, regain the fire etc.</p>
              <p>If you feel nothing has improved by then,  i guess, you can make the utimate choice yourself.</p>

              <p>I can tell that you are getting tired. Well now that things have
              come to this, it is the best chance now to tell her to seperate for
              some time, to sort out her feelings as well as yours. If your heart
              is soft again, the cycle will repeat again, never ending. And i
              agree to Fbghost 12, although he may sound harsh (dumping her)
              however it is best now to seperate for a while, while using this
              period for things to cool down, regain the fire etc.</p>
              <p>If you feel nothing has improved by then,  i guess, you can
              make the utimate choice yourself.</p>

              <p>I am abit tired but i am not giving up. I am still very happy with her and I can also sense that actually she loves me alot.</p>
              <p>Just that she likes to keep things and work stress to herself which me and her mum also feels that she is too overloaded and is starting to crack... Tried talking to her to talk to someone or see a counsellor but she refused. Now i can only leave it to her mum to try to talk to her and bring her to see a doc.</p>
