              <p>Try/ Make up a story: I think it would be very shiok if we can get a flat around seng kang area cos its small. I would like to have a small nice family, 2 kids can already. Blabber on, revolve around the topic of marriage life. </p>
              <p>But once you see her face start to react negatively, change topic! Say, want to watch movie? I always wanted to watch blah blah blah. </p>
              <p>As for her very "dao" attitude when you called to remind her, don't bother about it. You will come across as petty. And when you bring it up to her, she will get more irritated. </p>

              Hi goof,
              
              For both your age - your problems seems like a teenager one.
              
              And that is a real problem because how can you build a future with somebody whom you can't rely on? 
              
              Believe it or not, girls have certain expectations of guys which they won't say. As a MAN you have to stand firm and know what you want else this r/s will never work.
              
              The simplest example is I usually will ask my partner what's she wants for dinner, if she can't decide, I will decide and after that no complains allowed from her becos she was given a chance. After a few times, she knows my pattern liao. 
              
              So u must be consistant and firm of what u want and show her.
              
              If you hate her to check your phone then u don't ever let her. Once u soften, it only means u don't mind her doing that. I allow my gf to check anything she likes, but I warn her if she betray me [even once] that's the end for us. I demostrate to her I don't give second chances and in return i let her check my things if she wishes to earn her trust. In return, she reports to me 3 days in advance if she is going out with her friends or any gathering etc. Unless it's a S&amp;M r/s and u like to be abuse by woman, then u got to show her you are a man of your word and u say what u meant. So in hard times, she can be rest assured u will be strong for her.
              
              But I think your r/s has a wrong start.....i advice u find a new girl or patch back with her only when she knows what she wants.
              
              Let me warn u, divorce may cost u a bomb and buy BTO u pay downpayment later she change her mind your money is ALL GONE. 
              
              Those times u will really regret, if you are a teenager seriously I won't care but a man of your age.......shouldn't have to go through such.....childish crap.

              <p>If she say she wants to continue, do remember to lay down the rules. No more blowing hot and cold. It is not very healthy for a relationship. And that this sort of attitude would only make the both of you miserable. If she say no, she wants to quit. Exit her life gracefully. </p>

              <p>Went to her house in the afternoon since her mum invited me over for dinner. Bought her lunch on the way. She showed me black, dull face all the way.</p>
              <p>I got pissed off 2 hours later by her attitude and by all the negative things she said so I changed clothes to go home. As I walked to the door, she kept pulling me back, at the same time she kept saying sorry. I stopped at the main door and she said she prefers to be alone. I said, stop lying to yourself. If you really like to be alone, you wont have a bf at all.</p>
              <p>After a few more exchange she broke down and cried. Calmed her down, asked her not to put too much stress on herself and persuaded her to take a nap as she said she is very tired. I can sense that she is very emotionally and physically tired.</p>
              <p>She knocked out instantly when she is in bed. Few hours later, she woke up and a while later she is ok... Just like b4 the quarrel, maybe happier...</p>

              <p>If your girl is an emotionally uptight person, then i guess no matter how much calming down sessions or what would work ba. Maybe you make up your mind whether you want to be with her or not? Accept her for her emotional flaws, and deal with it one by one. Don't know if im saying the right thing or not also. =X</p>
