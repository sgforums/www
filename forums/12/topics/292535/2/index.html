During his stay there, he happened to meet his Thai business associate who invited him to his house. After being introduced to the family which included three daughters,the Singaporean was asked to stay for dinner.<br><br>It was a simple meal of vegetables and fish served with traditional white rice. The Singaporean man took his leave and continued the remainder of his tour.<br><br>Three months later, the man decided to divorce his wife of 10 years. His wife was shocked! After persistently asking for a reason, he disclosed that he was madly in love with his Thai associate's second daughter. He couldn't seem to stop thinking about her and the longing will only go away when he is with her. He insisted on the divorce and wants to marry the girl. The wife in her desperation decided to seek help from a "Si Fu" recommended by her relative.<br><br>It is through him that they discovered a shocking custom. In some parts of Thailand, when a girl first got her period, she is to rear a fish and feed it with the sanitary pads after using them. The fish is killed when she spots the man she wants to marry and the fish is cooked and served to this man. The man will be so mesmerised by her and will love her till the day she dies. The wife upon knowing this custom appealed to the "Si fu" for a solution.<br><br>The "Si Fu" says that only when the girl rejects the man in the face will he wake up from his trance. There is no other way out. The wife made a trip to Thailand to speak and plead with the family. They relented and the spell was lifted.<br><br>Moral of the story :<br><br>You men out there, don't be taken in by a simple meal. There is more to it. They have similar customs in Indonesia too. But they use pubic hairs instead.<br></div></blockquote>Ok.. Late I'm going to try  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
