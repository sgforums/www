Anyway, just to get back the money from your ex, rite? Meet your ex outside with your bf to reassure him.  If u really wanna meet your ex alone, u must explain and talk to your bf nicely, if he's a reasonable guy and loves u a lot, he will believe u 'cos he also dun wanna lose u.  If he is really those suspicious guy who dun trust u, carrying on this relationship will also result problems in future, do u agree with me? Mayb this is a test of your relationship loh..<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ASking ur bf to meet up wif ur ex seems like a good idea... but the problem is that, ur bf being the possessive sort, will be somehow aggitated by the situation.. So it will not turn out to be good.<br><br>Maybe get some mutual frens of urs and ur ex and go out together... treat it as a gathering also lorz.. Dun think ur bf will stop u for this rite?? Can bring ur bf along, but dun tell him the purpose lorz...<br><br>But if u and ur ex no mutual frens, then I think really bo bianz liaoz but to go to and meet him wif ur bf.. after that just leave wif ur bf lorz.. if not things happen, u haf a difficult time to coax ur bf also....<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>
