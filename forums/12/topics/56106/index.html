You mentioned 'what have to teach her, dunno this, dunno that.' every relationship you are in - basically you <strong>still</strong> on the learning cycle. What you truely meant is that your present gf, at that time, didn't behave/act the way it would have been if she was your first love.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Substitution - thats what I am talking about.<br><br>Younger than you by 4 years doesn't matter - cause if it does, you wouldn't have accepted her in the first place.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Its inevitable that your first love would have such huge influence on you because it has been 9 years - close to a decade. People don't change overnight, neither do feelings. What you lack is not love - you need some time to think and reflect upon what do you really want.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
