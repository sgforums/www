            <div class='col-md body'>As for me, I am doing a Part time IT degree but my line of work is not totally related to IT at all.<br><br>It started this way, when I left army I took up part time diploma course just to upgrade myself. Being lose after army do not now what to do? So took up  diploma in IT. After graduate, found a job from the paper. It says IT administrator. Not bad for a first job<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But when I went interview then I realised its not entirely IT job. And the boss told me that he put the wrong Ad on the paper.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I was desparate for a job and do not want to look no more so I decided to take this job. I was outsource to an BIG firm. Working there for a year and was converted to permament staff and of course benefit and pay increased when I moved over. But its been like 3 years now...I am sick and tired of what I am doing right now...hiaz...<br><br>Ok...I just want to get a degree thats all. As for what line I will be in the future I don't care as long as the $ is good.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all the replies...I guess I did learn about a lot of things while I am taking this course. One of them is being independent and being brave to try out your idea. I have a lot of ideas but I am not sure if they are feasible or not. Like in my writing class we were asked to write a business proposal, I easily came up with an idea that everyone in my group raved about and the instructor was pleased about it as well. But this kinda idea...it is not feasible in real life.
