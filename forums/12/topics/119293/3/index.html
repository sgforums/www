ITS ALRITE IF U DO NT HV ANI BEAUTIFUL MEMORIES, BUT ITS REALLI SAD IF U HV LOTSA REGRETS. I respect ur choice, but its realli nt easy 2 start 1's business. its like her life, or 2 say her husband or child. She realli hv 2 put in 150% or more effort. I hope u understand. Nobodi says doing business is easy, morever she jus started, n u knw hw bad travel market in s'pore is nw. Another question 2 ask urself is, do u luv her? if yes, n u find there still chance 2 b bk 2gather, i urge u 2 take e first step of rebuilding e bridge of luv. I realli tink n feel tat e person she needs most is u, n ur support n encouragement. It doesnt matter if she cant go on dates wif u or both of u cant spent time 2gather, wat matters most is she still luv u. No pt a gal eat, n spent time wif u, but her heart is nt wif u. Hope these tings i wrote will b able 2 help u a little. CHEERS</div>

Its alrite i tell her , i took a week to choose a gift for her , a card and a rose . I dont mind , its okie hun , no worries. She say she get something for me for chinese valentine , to make it up .<br><br>We had planned a previous month b4 going to koh samui today coz tommorrow is my birthday , she suggested and arrange for a trip for me.<br>For one month i was happy and excited for this trip.I even took 3 days leave.<br>I had my hair cut , my teeth clean at the dentist , bought a lot of beach wear . Pack everything early.<br><br>Till the day b4 yesterday , she disappeared again , sms me telling me she's busy , will call me back . never did.<br><br>And yesterday , the day we suppose to fly off to koh samui. She msg me in the morning she's also busy. I forgotten how many times i called and left msges and sms her. and i well knew she might not be able to make it..<br><br>I left home alone hoping last min she would call me , and i sat at the departure hall alone . waiting for some miracle to happen. i check the plane tix booking , it never showed our names . Somehow the internet booking never went tru , i have ask her to double check with airlines twice , guess she never did.<br><br>So i sat there waitin ...alone...hoping its a mistake  and she has a valid reason to be missing. While i m worried sick for 2 days ..<br><br>finally the sms came , 1 hour b4 departure. She's Stuck with work and cannot make it anymore , she's very upset n sorry.<br><br>I was dumb founded.....somehow in my heart i knew it was the last chance i would give to her. and she failed to make it.<br><br>I sms her , "its over"<br><br>She reply "wat you mean ? are you leaving me?"<br><br>I sms her " I didnt leave you , you leave me long ago , you just dont realise it , i m no longer no 1 in your life , your clients more important than me"<br><br>she replied " i m so sorry"<br><br>I sat there for the next few hours , looking our flight fly away.staring into the emptiness of the viewhall. Thinking wad did i wrong , why did my relationship fail. How can things turn out like this , when i devote my love n life to her and she treats me like dirt , not even the basic respect of a fren.<br><br>How can i be so low ? i msg her so many questions , and she never answered any ...she just says she's sorry.<br><br>so i began to walk ...took the train to town , look for a fren , then went off to buy beers and sat near the river. I called my closest frens , and started to cry.alcohol does make a  man lose his emotional control. I spend the next few hours staring into the river n thinking wad went wrong. And i called her , many times again , she prob do not dare to pick up the phone. As if i m in the wrong , why m i still trying to call her?<br><br>So i took my luggage and walk the streets alone again , till my mind was so dazed and took a cab home n slept.<br><br>I woke up this morning hoping its all dream...but it isnt.. just a feeling of nothingness...She msg me while i was sleeping , telling she knows she hurt me deeply and will leave me for good this time.<br><br>I did not reply to that.<br><br>How can she treat someone she said she love so deeply n truely  . Becoz she cant disappoint her clients , but she can break her promises n disappoint me .<br>Again and again  n again , coz she knows i will forgive her.<br><br>How many times will u break your love ones heart b4 u learn how to cherish them?<br><br>Perhaps all of us need to lose someone we learn our lesson not to take them for granted. But then , perhaps , the person we end up with in the end , might not be the one we love most and lost.<br><br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> ....</div>

I know i will , i tell myself , when the coldest n loneliest night i bear alone.<br><br>till now ,<br><br>She skipped valentine's day , not a card , not a gift , say she's not feeling well . Its alrite i tell her , i took a week to choose a gift for her , a card and a rose . I dont mind , its okie hun , no worries. She say she get something for me for chinese valentine , to make it up .<br><br>We had planned a previous month b4 going to koh samui today coz tommorrow is my birthday , she suggested and arrange for a trip for me.<br>For one month i was happy and excited for this trip.I even took 3 days leave.<br>I had my hair cut , my teeth clean at the dentist , bought a lot of beach wear . Pack everything early.<br><br>Till the day b4 yesterday , she disappeared again , sms me telling me she's busy , will call me back . never did.<br><br>And yesterday , the day we suppose to fly off to koh samui. She msg me in the morning she's also busy. I forgotten how many times i called and left msges and sms her. and i well knew she might not be able to make it..<br><br>I left home alone hoping last min she would call me , and i sat at the departure hall alone . waiting for some miracle to happen. i check the plane tix booking , it never showed our names . Somehow the internet booking never went tru , i have ask her to double check with airlines twice , guess she never did.<br><br>So i sat there waitin ...alone...hoping its a mistake  and she has a valid reason to be missing. While i m worried sick for 2 days ..<br><br>finally the sms came , 1 hour b4 departure. She's Stuck with work and cannot make it anymore , she's very upset n sorry.<br><br>I was dumb founded.....somehow in my heart i knew it was the last chance i would give to her. and she failed to make it.<br><br>I sms her , "its over"<br><br>She reply "wat you mean ? are you leaving me?"<br><br>I sms her " I didnt leave you , you leave me long ago , you just dont realise it , i m no longer no 1 in your life , your clients more important than me"<br><br>she replied " i m so sorry"<br><br>I sat there for the next few hours , looking our flight fly away.staring into the emptiness of the viewhall. Thinking wad did i wrong , why did my relationship fail. How can things turn out like this , when i devote my love n life to her and she treats me like dirt , not even the basic respect of a fren.<br><br>How can i be so low ? i msg her so many questions , and she never answered any ...she just says she's sorry.<br><br>so i began to walk ...took the train to town , look for a fren , then went off to buy beers and sat near the river. I called my closest frens , and started to cry.alcohol does make a  man lose his emotional control. I spend the next few hours staring into the river n thinking wad went wrong. And i called her , many times again , she prob do not dare to pick up the phone. As if i m in the wrong , why m i still trying to call her?<br><br>So i took my luggage and walk the streets alone again , till my mind was so dazed and took a cab home n slept.<br><br>I woke up this morning hoping its all dream...but it isnt.. just a feeling of nothingness...She msg me while i was sleeping , telling she knows she hurt me deeply and will leave me for good this time.<br><br>I did not reply to that.<br><br>How can she treat someone she said she love so deeply n truely  . Becoz she cant disappoint her clients , but she can break her promises n disappoint me .<br>Again and again  n again , coz she knows i will forgive her.<br><br>How many times will u break your love ones heart b4 u learn how to cherish them?<br><br>Perhaps all of us need to lose someone we learn our lesson not to take them for granted. But then , perhaps , the person we end up with in the end , might not be the one we love most and lost.<br><br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> ....</div>
