Either she's just not sharing it or there is an issue regarding the foundation of their relationship. Either way, it's probably not something which can just be untangled like this...</div></blockquote>Ah So! Devil San, well said!  I tot you was rather curt previously... at least, he eventually chosen to move on. Some other sites I've been to, the women cling on for dear life to their abusive relationships. I gave up reading cause it made me feel this world is so hopeless.<br><br>For this case, my first thoughts were that, she had not trreasured their relationship.<br>No matter how busy, sparing a 5 minute session every day or every few days would not kill her...  No one can really help. But as you said its life choices.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How many hearts will you break before you get over it?<br><br>A long time ago when I was immersing myself in the self destructive abyss of self pity and despair cos of a failed relationship, a friend of mine gave me a diary. In the diary, there were different sayings on each page and she selected a page to write a message to me.<br><br>I remember the words very well. Basically it says, How many hearts will you break before you get over your sadness? And in her message she reminded me about the many people who still love and care for me and its breaking their hearts to see me let myself go this way.<br><br>It is normal to feel sorrowful and betrayed and confused. It is a terrible thing to feel that all the love invested in a person unappreciated. Just don't stay too long in misery else it becomes a habit that is hard to cast off.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sad for your lost but as you said she set up her own company. I'm not surprised that she is sweating and working hard for it to break-even because I believe she must have invested her sweat and blood money into it.<br><br>I don't know the whole situation. Did you offer to help her with her biz? Starting a biz is not easy. You have to work as there is no day and night since you are on ground zero with a negative figure in your accounts book. I don't know she may seem strong but she might have been waiting for you to offer to help.<br><br>She might be so passionate about living her dreams that she neglected you. Anyway you don't need to be 1st place in her heart for her to love you. I mean great if you have 1st priority all the time but priorities do change.</div>
