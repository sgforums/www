            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you everyone for your replies , hugs n wellwishers.<br><br>I know she's my choice , thats why i held on to the invisible piece of rope i held on to , unless last night. Somehow the caring and attentive woman i fell in love with no longer exist from wad i see . I know we still love each other , even 50 years down the road , we would still have a special place in each other heart. But i cannot go on living with someone who doesnt gives a damn abt me , i m  a pisces. I would be lying if i tell u i dont miss her and i dont want her back , 2 hours later would be my 31st birthday. And it would be the loneliest birthday i would ever have. Yes i would be surrounded by frens in a pub filled with pple, song n dance but i would still be alone in my heart.<br><br>I held on to this thinning rope for last half a year , hoping a miracle would happen and things would improve . but it din. I m afraid of losing her , yet i know i already lost her somewhere somehow.<br><br>Love is hard to come by in your life<br>True love is even harder to find<br>Holding on that love takes a lot of effort n time<br>But many have just chose to leave it aside once they have it all<br>And let it erode away with time.<br><br>For those who have someone to love by yourside<br>pls tell him you love him/her and treasure it<br>For nothing is certain in this universe<br>Even boulders erode away in the wind .<br>And so thus our so called love.<br><br>She sms this morning , saying she knows she hurts me too deep and dont have right to ask me to forgive her.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Wuss,<br><br>I was in a similar position to ur gf, I din ans my guy's calls, sometimes I'd tell him I'd call but I din, I din reply to his msgs, etc...  At tt time, I was going thru a really rough patch, work &amp; family stress was taking a toll on me, &amp; I was snowed under ev. day wif a pile of work.  I din feel like tokking @ the end of the day, only wished to be left alone to read...<br><br>Eventually, I broke his heart, &amp; there was a day he cried from nite till the next morning.  I saw his red, swollen eyes &amp; asked him wat happened, &amp; he asked, "Tell me, baby, do u still love me?"<br><br>It was then tt all the memories came flashing back, all those thgs he did to make me smilez, all those times he tried to show me I had his support, &amp; I was the 1 pushing him away.  I din even bother to explain why I suddenly retreated into a shell.<br><br>Then came the hard part, how do we salvage somethg like tt?  We both tried, but we ended up trying too hard, we had quarrels, etc, but we stuck in there.  Finally, 1 day, wif him sitting behind me &amp; holding my waist, we tokked abt the problem, &amp; how it seemed we were trying too hard to make thgs all better again.  It appeared artificial.<br><br>Gd thg was, we managed to sort thgs out by tokking thgs thru, by taking time to smell the flowers, by giving him a hugz whenever I see him after work, thgs tt we used to do, &amp; we found so much joy in.<br><br>I'm lucky in tt my guy chose to reveal how hurt he was, &amp; how I'd broken his heart, cosh it gave me the chance to change &amp; make thgs better between us.  And thankfully this has made the love between us stronger.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by wuss:</div><div class="quote_body"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I really dunno how to describe the feelings i have now...Something would be close  would be.<br><br>numb , dull , empty , void , dazed<br><br>For 1 1/2 years i have been with a gal i love , everything was perfect in the beginning , till late last year . She started her own travel agency and begin diggin herself into work. Sms and calls drizzle to a minimal , sometimes she would disappear for hours or sometimes 1-2 days , sms becomes almost non-existant or no picking up of calls or returns. "Be patient i tell myself , she's busy with work " and i know she is , and i always hope things would get better. But it din , our dates gets cancelled , postponed , she forgets  special days. All she can say is "i m sorry , tied up with work" again n again.<br><br>Be patient i tell myself , over n over again.<br><br>And still things look gloomy , i tried to talk to her, abt us distancing , and the amount of time we do not have for each other . And she acknowledges that, but all she can do is cry and say sorry.<br><br>Be patient , one day i ll see the light at the tunnel . I know i will , i tell myself , when the coldest n loneliest night i bear alone.<br><br>till now ,<br><br>She skipped valentine's day , not a card , not a gift , say she's not feeling well . Its alrite i tell her , i took a week to choose a gift for her , a card and a rose . I dont mind , its okie hun , no worries. She say she get something for me for chinese valentine , to make it up .<br><br>We had planned a previous month b4 going to koh samui today coz tommorrow is my birthday , she suggested and arrange for a trip for me.<br>For one month i was happy and excited for this trip.I even took 3 days leave.<br>I had my hair cut , my teeth clean at the dentist , bought a lot of beach wear . Pack everything early.<br><br>Till the day b4 yesterday , she disappeared again , sms me telling me she's busy , will call me back . never did.<br><br>And yesterday , the day we suppose to fly off to koh samui. She msg me in the morning she's also busy. I forgotten how many times i called and left msges and sms her. and i well knew she might not be able to make it..<br><br>I left home alone hoping last min she would call me , and i sat at the departure hall alone . waiting for some miracle to happen. i check the plane tix booking , it never showed our names . Somehow the internet booking never went tru , i have ask her to double check with airlines twice , guess she never did.<br><br>So i sat there waitin ...alone...hoping its a mistake  and she has a valid reason to be missing. While i m worried sick for 2 days ..<br><br>finally the sms came , 1 hour b4 departure. She's Stuck with work and cannot make it anymore , she's very upset n sorry.<br><br>I was dumb founded.....somehow in my heart i knew it was the last chance i would give to her. and she failed to make it.<br><br>I sms her , "its over"<br><br>She reply "wat you mean ? are you leaving me?"<br><br>I sms her " I didnt leave you , you leave me long ago , you just dont realise it , i m no longer no 1 in your life , your clients more important than me"<br><br>she replied " i m so sorry"<br><br>I sat there for the next few hours , looking our flight fly away.staring into the emptiness of the viewhall. Thinking wad did i wrong , why did my relationship fail. How can things turn out like this , when i devote my love n life to her and she treats me like dirt , not even the basic respect of a fren.<br><br>How can i be so low ? i msg her so many questions , and she never answered any ...she just says she's sorry.<br><br>so i began to walk ...took the train to town , look for a fren , then went off to buy beers and sat near the river. I called my closest frens , and started to cry.alcohol does make a  man lose his emotional control. I spend the next few hours staring into the river n thinking wad went wrong. And i called her , many times again , she prob do not dare to pick up the phone. As if i m in the wrong , why m i still trying to call her?<br><br>So i took my luggage and walk the streets alone again , till my mind was so dazed and took a cab home n slept.<br><br>I woke up this morning hoping its all dream...but it isnt.. just a feeling of nothingness...She msg me while i was sleeping , telling she knows she hurt me deeply and will leave me for good this time.<br><br>I did not reply to that.<br><br>How can she treat someone she said she love so deeply n truely  . Becoz she cant disappoint her clients , but she can break her promises n disappoint me .<br>Again and again  n again , coz she knows i will forgive her.<br><br>How many times will u break your love ones heart b4 u learn how to cherish them?<br><br>Perhaps all of us need to lose someone we learn our lesson not to take them for granted. But then , perhaps , the person we end up with in the end , might not be the one we love most and lost.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

She started her own travel agency and begin diggin herself into work. Sms and calls drizzle to a minimal , sometimes she would disappear for hours or sometimes 1-2 days , sms becomes almost non-existant or no picking up of calls or returns. "Be patient i tell myself , she's busy with work " and i know she is , and i always hope things would get better. But it din , our dates gets cancelled , postponed , she forgets  special days. All she can say is "i m sorry , tied up with work" again n again.<br><br>Be patient i tell myself , over n over again.<br><br>And still things look gloomy , i tried to talk to her, abt us distancing , and the amount of time we do not have for each other . And she acknowledges that, but all she can do is cry and say sorry.<br><br>Be patient , one day i ll see the light at the tunnel . I know i will , i tell myself , when the coldest n loneliest night i bear alone.<br><br>till now ,<br><br>She skipped valentine's day , not a card , not a gift , say she's not feeling well . Its alrite i tell her , i took a week to choose a gift for her , a card and a rose . I dont mind , its okie hun , no worries. She say she get something for me for chinese valentine , to make it up .<br><br>We had planned a previous month b4 going to koh samui today coz tommorrow is my birthday , she suggested and arrange for a trip for me.<br>For one month i was happy and excited for this trip.I even took 3 days leave.<br>I had my hair cut , my teeth clean at the dentist , bought a lot of beach wear . Pack everything early.<br><br>Till the day b4 yesterday , she disappeared again , sms me telling me she's busy , will call me back . never did.<br><br>And yesterday , the day we suppose to fly off to koh samui. She msg me in the morning she's also busy. I forgotten how many times i called and left msges and sms her. and i well knew she might not be able to make it..<br><br>I left home alone hoping last min she would call me , and i sat at the departure hall alone . waiting for some miracle to happen. i check the plane tix booking , it never showed our names . Somehow the internet booking never went tru , i have ask her to double check with airlines twice , guess she never did.<br><br>So i sat there waitin ...alone...hoping its a mistake  and she has a valid reason to be missing. While i m worried sick for 2 days ..<br><br>finally the sms came , 1 hour b4 departure. She's Stuck with work and cannot make it anymore , she's very upset n sorry.<br><br>I was dumb founded.....somehow in my heart i knew it was the last chance i would give to her. and she failed to make it.<br><br>I sms her , "its over"<br><br>She reply "wat you mean ? are you leaving me?"<br><br>I sms her " I didnt leave you , you leave me long ago , you just dont realise it , i m no longer no 1 in your life , your clients more important than me"<br><br>she replied " i m so sorry"<br><br>I sat there for the next few hours , looking our flight fly away.staring into the emptiness of the viewhall. Thinking wad did i wrong , why did my relationship fail. How can things turn out like this , when i devote my love n life to her and she treats me like dirt , not even the basic respect of a fren.<br><br>How can i be so low ? i msg her so many questions , and she never answered any ...she just says she's sorry.<br><br>so i began to walk ...took the train to town , look for a fren , then went off to buy beers and sat near the river. I called my closest frens , and started to cry.alcohol does make a  man lose his emotional control. I spend the next few hours staring into the river n thinking wad went wrong. And i called her , many times again , she prob do not dare to pick up the phone. As if i m in the wrong , why m i still trying to call her?<br><br>So i took my luggage and walk the streets alone again , till my mind was so dazed and took a cab home n slept.<br><br>I woke up this morning hoping its all dream...but it isnt.. just a feeling of nothingness...She msg me while i was sleeping , telling she knows she hurt me deeply and will leave me for good this time.<br><br>I did not reply to that.<br><br>How can she treat someone she said she love so deeply n truely  . Becoz she cant disappoint her clients , but she can break her promises n disappoint me .<br>Again and again  n again , coz she knows i will forgive her.<br><br>How many times will u break your love ones heart b4 u learn how to cherish them?<br><br>Perhaps all of us need to lose someone we learn our lesson not to take them for granted. But then , perhaps , the person we end up with in the end , might not be the one we love most and lost.<br><br></div></blockquote>*pat pat*<br><br>To love is to give and take..<br><br>Well.. is not the matter of how times u break ones heart b4 you learn anything.. is whether you really learn and pick up the mistakes and review yourself in the past.. that you make sure you never repeat the same mistakes again.. Many people can break one after another simply be cos they dun learned!<br><br>You can't say someone who has many love life experiences is a GOOD LOVER!<br><br>CHeers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

She started her own travel agency and begin diggin herself into work. Sms and calls drizzle to a minimal , sometimes she would disappear for hours or sometimes 1-2 days , sms becomes almost non-existant or no picking up of calls or returns. "Be patient i tell myself , she's busy with work " and i know she is , and i always hope things would get better. But it din , our dates gets cancelled , postponed , she forgets  special days. All she can say is "i m sorry , tied up with work" again n again.<br><br>Be patient i tell myself , over n over again.<br><br>And still things look gloomy , i tried to talk to her, abt us distancing , and the amount of time we do not have for each other . And she acknowledges that, but all she can do is cry and say sorry.<br><br>Be patient , one day i ll see the light at the tunnel . I know i will , i tell myself , when the coldest n loneliest night i bear alone.<br><br>till now ,<br><br>She skipped valentine's day , not a card , not a gift , say she's not feeling well . Its alrite i tell her , i took a week to choose a gift for her , a card and a rose . I dont mind , its okie hun , no worries. She say she get something for me for chinese valentine , to make it up .<br><br>We had planned a previous month b4 going to koh samui today coz tommorrow is my birthday , she suggested and arrange for a trip for me.<br>For one month i was happy and excited for this trip.I even took 3 days leave.<br>I had my hair cut , my teeth clean at the dentist , bought a lot of beach wear . Pack everything early.<br><br>Till the day b4 yesterday , she disappeared again , sms me telling me she's busy , will call me back . never did.<br><br>And yesterday , the day we suppose to fly off to koh samui. She msg me in the morning she's also busy. I forgotten how many times i called and left msges and sms her. and i well knew she might not be able to make it..<br><br>I left home alone hoping last min she would call me , and i sat at the departure hall alone . waiting for some miracle to happen. i check the plane tix booking , it never showed our names . Somehow the internet booking never went tru , i have ask her to double check with airlines twice , guess she never did.<br><br>So i sat there waitin ...alone...hoping its a mistake  and she has a valid reason to be missing. While i m worried sick for 2 days ..<br><br>finally the sms came , 1 hour b4 departure. She's Stuck with work and cannot make it anymore , she's very upset n sorry.<br><br>I was dumb founded.....somehow in my heart i knew it was the last chance i would give to her. and she failed to make it.<br><br>I sms her , "its over"<br><br>She reply "wat you mean ? are you leaving me?"<br><br>I sms her " I didnt leave you , you leave me long ago , you just dont realise it , i m no longer no 1 in your life , your clients more important than me"<br><br>she replied " i m so sorry"<br><br>I sat there for the next few hours , looking our flight fly away.staring into the emptiness of the viewhall. Thinking wad did i wrong , why did my relationship fail. How can things turn out like this , when i devote my love n life to her and she treats me like dirt , not even the basic respect of a fren.<br><br>How can i be so low ? i msg her so many questions , and she never answered any ...she just says she's sorry.<br><br>so i began to walk ...took the train to town , look for a fren , then went off to buy beers and sat near the river. I called my closest frens , and started to cry.alcohol does make a  man lose his emotional control. I spend the next few hours staring into the river n thinking wad went wrong. And i called her , many times again , she prob do not dare to pick up the phone. As if i m in the wrong , why m i still trying to call her?<br><br>So i took my luggage and walk the streets alone again , till my mind was so dazed and took a cab home n slept.<br><br>I woke up this morning hoping its all dream...but it isnt.. just a feeling of nothingness...She msg me while i was sleeping , telling she knows she hurt me deeply and will leave me for good this time.<br><br>I did not reply to that.<br><br>How can she treat someone she said she love so deeply n truely  . Becoz she cant disappoint her clients , but she can break her promises n disappoint me .<br>Again and again  n again , coz she knows i will forgive her.<br><br>How many times will u break your love ones heart b4 u learn how to cherish them?<br><br>Perhaps all of us need to lose someone we learn our lesson not to take them for granted. But then , perhaps , the person we end up with in the end , might not be the one we love most and lost.<br><br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> It's ironic to see so often, the thing with couple, about keeping the issue about the relationship to themselves and praying that things will change for the better.
