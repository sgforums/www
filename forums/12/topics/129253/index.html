            <div class='col-md body'>The current generation of 20 somethings, Their life seems to be in a mess compared to the previous generation.Why is this so?<br><br>Life in an urban city like Singapore comes with it many pitfalls. One of it is the moral decay and mental retardation of young people. A package of  deceit manipulation and lies seem to be dominant and prevalent as one enters his or her third decade of life. As always it usually starts during the late teen years as mild and progresses. As one ages, urban  life expereinces and pressures associated with it may bring out such characteristics in otherwise ordinary people. As people in their 20s seems hesistant in trusting one another, the trust which they had during their teen years simply degrades.<br><br>The source of this degradation may be past failures in love, obsession about money,women,love and power and sometimes paranoia seems to be the driving factors.Sometimes psychological problems play a role too. As i write this article, i do notice signs of an increasingly superficial, selfish and power hungry world.People now are eager for immediate success and achievement In the past, morality restrained people's behavior. But now the strength and scope of moral restrictions has shrunk. People don't think about the means; they'll just do anything.This is reflective of a nation where morality is generally defined according to one's feelings. In a postmodern society, where people do not acknowledge any moral absolutes, if a person feels justified in engaging in a specific behavior then they do not make a connection with the immoral nature of that action. Yet, deep inside, they sense that something is wrong in our society. They simply have not been able to put two and two together to recognize their personal liability regarding the moral condition of our nation<br><br>Until people recognize that there are moral absolutes and attempt to live in harmony with them, we are likely to see a continued decay of our moral foundations<br><br>But the world is a place worth fighting for.<br><br>It's up to everyone reading this right now to silently ponder on how  to live your life.  It's time to go back to your Synagogues and Churches, and learn the basics of the moral codes . You can save this world, but it all begins with YOU and YOUR personal relationship with others.  It will be a slow process, but if we all start NOW, we can turn this world around and make it a better place for all and for the future.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hypocrisy is the act of pretending to have beliefs, virtues and feelings that one does not truly possess. The word derives from the late Latin hypocrisis and Greek hupokrisis both meaning play-acting or pretence. The word is arguably derived from hypo- meaning small, + krinein meaning to decide/to dispute.<br><br>A classic example of a hypocritical act is to denounce another for carrying out some action whilst carrying out the same action oneself.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hypocrisy in Religion<br>Hypocritical behavior can be found in religion and institutes of religion. The Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal among supposedly celibate priests is a recent example. During the rule of the theocratic Taliban government there were numerous reports concerning hypocritical behavior the Taliban rulers engaged in while at the same time punishing others for the same behavior [1] (http://www.guardian.co.uk/afghanistan/story/0,1284,624883,00.html).<br><br>The New Testament refers specifically to hypocrites and hypocritical behavior in several places. In one passage, Jesus denounces the sect of the Pharisees for hypocritical behavior.as, for example, the Gospel of Matthew chapter 23, paragraphs 13 to 15:<br><br>"But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than yourselves." (Gospel of Matthew 23:13-15:<br>In Zen Buddhism, the San Francisco Zen Center forced its abbot Zentatsu Richard Baker to resign in the 1980's due to charges involving, among other things, allegedly hypocritical behavior.<br></div>
