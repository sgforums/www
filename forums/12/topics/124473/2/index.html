            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Ding. The Ding in the HK drama serial is such a Mr. NiceGuy. Why are you using his name as your nickname?<br><br>Anyway.. Seems to me that your wife is emotionally weak from the way she weeps and knows everything, and yet she is not reprimanding you but waiting for you to be back by her faithfully again.  Has it ever occurred to you she may attempt suicide or jump off a building when one day she becomes too depressed over your infidelity? Look at what you have done to a woman who has loved you for so long... tsk tsk. I think you should go do some research and check out the reasons for suicide of women.. I am not cursing your wife ok...<br><br>And, you actually shoulder the thought of housing two women under the same room? hmmm... It is evident now that you have committed adultery and your wife can divorce you straightaway based on that, without any period of separation. Get ready the maintenance amount to pay her when that happens.<br><br>I am not flaming you, just warning you.  Just don't want to see her do something silly over you.</div>

Perhaps you are looking for some support since this is Aunt Agony.<br><br>Since this question was put to you by one of our fellow forumites, I'd like to add this for your consideration: If your daughter were to be as unfortunate as to get involved with a married man in future (and I hope not), assuming it's strictly for love and not money, think of just these two simple situations:<br><br>(a) She falls for a married man like you - hoping for a threesome, which is really the most cowardly way to settle your own problem bec you are only thinking of yourself<br><br>(b) She falls for a married man whom she knows is never going to leave his family and children for her - she will be alone on holidays and weekends; she will be left out of his family get-togethers, parties, lives. She will be nothing in anyone's eyes, anyone who is a part of the man's normal family life.<br><br>If it is the latter, do you know how painful that is going to be for her? If she has children out of this union, do you know how difficult this is going to be for her children, born out of wedlock, with a father who isn't around for them when <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">normal, decent</span></strong> fathers would be for their families?<br><br>If you are a responsible father and family man thinking of keeping Mona as a mistress,  if you really loved your mistress, do you want her to be miserable, unable to spend decent family time with you aside from the furtive, clandestine hours?<br><br>This sort of situation is extremely difficult for <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">all</span></strong> parties involved. Your daughter is going to come of age in no time and she is going to understand and know what's going on. Is this one of the values you want to impart to her?  That it's ok for her to share her man with another woman, that it's ok for her to go out with a married man? Do you really want your daughter to accept being <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">second best</span></strong> in her life?<br><br>Women are intuitive by nature. Your wife knows what's happening, it's hurting her but she wants to keep her marriage and family together.  She doesn't have just her pain to think of, she has your daughter to care for while you are out with Mona. I feel sad for your wife..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mr Ding,<br><br>this is my first blog, i have seen many topics and none of the topics has ever push me to type. please heed our advise.<br><br>first, you must know what is yours and what is yet to be. your wife and your daughter is yours and especially your wife, who has been with you for 17 years. Mona is yet to be, even if she is, how can you be sure that thing will not repeat again after 17 years? so treasure what you have now. Around me, i have seen cases of such incident in my upper generation and i can tell you that eventually it will be a tradegy, to you and your descendants.<br><br>Secondly, i completely understand the suffering of being in a long term relationship, especially for your case, a 17 years. It is like eating pork everday. so sick.<br><br>hence when a relationship get longer, usually after 7 years, things will get boring in a relationship. so that is why it is best to get married after that, to start a new life. on top of that, if you have a child, you can transfer your love over to him as he is your own flash and blood.<br><br>i am sure that you love your child very much, every parent love their child, just like how your parents love you. i am sure you do not want your child to grow up in a broken family, there is some studies that say chilldren growing up in a brken family may have physcological problems.<br>so for the sake of your daughter, hang in there!!!<br><br>mona is just a crush, forget her. time will cure all wounds. as for your wife, i musr compliment her for being so understanding. think about it, how many woman is that generous? and i am sure she has alreadly forgive you for the sake of your daughter too, that is why she do not want to talk about it. it will remind her of unhappiness.<br><br>so please breakup with mona and don let it happen again. such relationship with mona will be the first but not the last. you must know how to handle them.<br><br>take care and good luck!</div>
