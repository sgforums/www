But in situation like this, you have to weigh what is more important.  You are now tired with your wife and thinking of divorcing her and you want your ger...  You go to Mona and you think you going to live happily ???  IF you decide to forgo Mona, she alone suffer.  Not that she deserved it, but she is also a resposible party and have to shoulder some responsibilities.  It just too bad she choose a married man.  I am not you and I don't know how much you love your wife.  But that very moment you marry her, you are responsible to her for the rest of your live because she give everything in her life to you.   You cannot dump her now.  Ok say you don't love her anymore and Mona is your life now...  so how are you going to solve your ger problem.  Can she live happily with Mona ?  Can Mona accept her as her own even after she give birth to her own child?  These are some of the questions you got to ask your self.  Even you are head and heel over Mona, you got a responsibilities, not only to your wife but to your child.  You can hurt your wife, can you bear to hurt your child.<br><br>So, shoulder the responsibilities and break with that Mona and go back to your wife.  You said too here that she still love you..  surely, that is a good enough reason for you to go back  now.... God bless ...</div>

But in situation like this, you have to weigh what is more important.  You are now tired with your wife and thinking of divorcing her and you want your ger...  You go to Mona and you think you going to live happily ???  IF you decide to forgo Mona, she alone suffer.  Not that she deserved it, but she is also a resposible party and have to shoulder some responsibilities.  It just too bad she choose a married man.  I am not you and I don't know how much you love your wife.  But that very moment you marry her, you are responsible to her for the rest of your live because she give everything in her life to you.   You cannot dump her now.  Ok say you don't love her anymore and Mona is your life now...  so how are you going to solve your ger problem.  Can she live happily with Mona ?  Can Mona accept her as her own even after she give birth to her own child?  These are some of the questions you got to ask your self.  Even you are head and heel over Mona, you got a responsibilities, not only to your wife but to your child.  You can hurt your wife, can you bear to hurt your child.<br><br>So, shoulder the responsibilities and break with that Mona and go back to your wife.  You said too here that she still love you..  surely, that is a good enough reason for you to go back  now.... God bless ...</div></blockquote>i am already home now or else how i here. my wife is cooking dinner and washing my clothes i think i go help her a bit at least i feel better.</div>
