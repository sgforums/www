Much better choice then as compared to wild carding at boys who probably still depend on their parents for pocket money.<br><br>Ur to young to talk relantionship, it shows from the way u write.

            <div class='col-md body'>Xuan ... U have just experienced the jealousy of an immature boy. Boys usually can't stand their girlfriends talking alot to other guys. Especially without their Acknowledgement. Next time inform before you do. Its too late scolding your child for not taking care of the jug when the milk is already spilled. Emotions are hard to control. I know when you are lonely and you can't communicate with your boyfriend, you tend to seek another close friend. But please, try calling a girl instead of a boy, that way, you could avoid much miscommunication that you liked another guy, etc. But since now that guy is avoiding you... The only solution to build back the trust between you two. You state that you know him better for only a year? Have you experienced close experiences together during that period of time when you both were just friends? He likes you, but doesn't know whether be able to trust you not to talk to other guys on the phone at nights when he is not free. He wants to believe you, but perhaps the amount of time you both spent together as friends are not suffice to convince his "reality concious" that you will change for the better. Or rather, change to suit his needs. IF you really need to talk to guys on lonely nights, perhaps you should convince him logically why, like talking to that guy friend reminds you of him, etc. etc. If he is matured enough, he should understand that he may not be always there for you as he is still a human, and continue to allow you to communicate with that guy PROVIDED he knows that guy well, and that you both do not talk too long.  OK, back to reality. Love doesn't last long, any logical commonfolk would know that, At this age, its really as what saab95 has said, its better to be friends. As you both have not a stable income yet, parents may be a problem in the future, and other reasons stated by saab95. Think positive, count your blessings, at least you still have your Kor =), remember, don't easily get into relationships anymore. Make sure you really know the person, Experienced joyful and trumatising events before, and really enjoys the person's accompany. Otherwise, prepare for heartaches throughout your whole youth.Smile more and enjoy life. If fate really declares you two both together, you two will be together in the future. worry about your studies now.. Get a decent job, enjoy company of your friends, go clubbing, discos, snookers, pools, KTVs, pubbing, beach parties, swimming, exercising, outings, shopping, study together, have meals together, cherish the time spent with friends, get your mind off him. Don't bother making yourself worrying all the time while he is enjoying himself, live your life to the fullest, show him you can live without him, show him that he needs you. =) be desirable, not a bounded slave. Lastly, take care and goodnitez =)<br><br></div>

But please, try calling a girl instead of a boy, that way, you could avoid much miscommunication that you liked another guy, etc. But since now that guy is avoiding you... The only solution to build back the trust between you two. You state that you know him better for only a year? Have you experienced close experiences together during that period of time when you both were just friends? He likes you, but doesn't know whether be able to trust you not to talk to other guys on the phone at nights when he is not free. He wants to believe you, but perhaps the amount of time you both spent together as friends are not suffice to convince his "reality concious" that you will change for the better. Or rather, change to suit his needs. IF you really need to talk to guys on lonely nights, perhaps you should convince him logically why, like talking to that guy friend reminds you of him, etc. etc. If he is matured enough, he should understand that he may not be always there for you as he is still a human, and continue to allow you to communicate with that guy PROVIDED he knows that guy well, and that you both do not talk too long.  OK, back to reality. Love doesn't last long, any logical commonfolk would know that, At this age, its really as what saab95 has said, its better to be friends. As you both have not a stable income yet, parents may be a problem in the future, and other reasons stated by saab95. Think positive, count your blessings, at least you still have your Kor =), remember, don't easily get into relationships anymore. Make sure you really know the person, Experienced joyful and trumatising events before, and really enjoys the person's accompany. Otherwise, prepare for heartaches throughout your whole youth.Smile more and enjoy life. If fate really declares you two both together, you two will be together in the future. worry about your studies now.. Get a decent job, enjoy company of your friends, go clubbing, discos, snookers, pools, KTVs, pubbing, beach parties, swimming, exercising, outings, shopping, study together, have meals together, cherish the time spent with friends, get your mind off him. Don't bother making yourself worrying all the time while he is enjoying himself, live your life to the fullest, show him you can live without him, show him that he needs you. =) be desirable, not a bounded slave. Lastly, take care and goodnitez =)<br><br></div></blockquote>thx..i agree wif wad u sae..i m showin him tt i can live without him...n show tt he need mi!..i 1 make him regret fer his choice..mayb i'm reali nt into r/s...aniway..i'm oready fergettin him in progress..i deleted his contact in msn n hp lo..i'm thinkin tt i c him online den he refuse to tok to mi..why shud i bother to go tok to him n make him think tt i m irritating?...haax...thx fer ur advice...=)</div>

But to be committed is not.<br><br>You should focus on your studies at this point of time.. You are very very young..
