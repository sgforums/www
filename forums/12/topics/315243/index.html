              <p>three weeks ago i wouldn't have imagined that i would be able to have a future with her. but the events over the past four days have really reinvigorated any hopes i had of getting together with her.<em><br></em></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><em>we had a real long MSN chat on both <strong>friday</strong> and <strong>saturday</strong> night, about 3 hours each. i usually don't put much thought into MSN conversations but i felt we had very good things to talk about which ended rather well, especially on friday's when she ended off my telling me i had made her night.<br></em></p>
              <p><em>on <strong>sunday</strong> we met up at Geylang for supper with female classmate of ours and i sent her home in a cab after she admitted she was not feeling very well, after walking through the red light district to get to our destination from the MRT station.<br></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>yesterday</strong>, i got pranked by her and our classmates at vivocity. the story was that, when i arrived they told me that she ran off crying after receiving a phone call and my first reaction was to keep on trying to call and sms her. then, i went to look for her around the mall. it was then the group called me back and she called me away and broke the news to me that it was merely a prank. then, i could see that she wanted to say something else but she changed her mind. though i tried probing by saying "is that all?", she simply insisted otherwise so there was nothing i could do. later, we went to catch a movie in a group, and there was not much<br></em></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>i admitted to them i wasn't angry about the prank, because i was really more relieved that nothing actually happened.</p>
              <p>and yet <strong>today</strong>, she is rather openly avoiding me, for a reason i am really, rather oblivious to as of now. it's really baffling me and i totally do not know what to do.</p>
              <p>hopefully somebody here could advise me on what my next course of action should be... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>she pai sei with what she have done perhaps. ask her what's bothering her, if she don't mind tell you. High chance she won't tell you, so you just tell her simply, "if you ever need anything, you know my number.. *winks*"</p>

              <p>You want her to get down on her knees and ask for your hand ?</p>
              <p> </p>

              In my opinion, you think too much.
              
              If you really want her to be your gf, start the courting.
              
              Be prepared for rejection though.
