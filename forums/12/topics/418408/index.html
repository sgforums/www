              <p>As you know, last time I ask a co worker out and she turn out to be my cousin's bride. So embarassing. So I feel sad because I choose the wrong lady to ask out. I ask some of my friends for advice.</p>
              <p>Then one day we friends go out and then one of my close friend Mr A, he bring out a nice lady, Ms B to join us gang of friends for makan. She purposely sit next to me. So I speak to her and find out more about her. She turn out to be older than me but she is nice person. So I am glad to make a new friend. But afterward, when I meet Mr A again, he keep on promoting Ms B to me. He keep on saying how homely, filial and good cook she is. I very appreciate what Mr A is helping me and I really appreciate to get to know Ms B. But we went out couple of time as a group and I get to know her by talking to her, I try to be nice to her and not be rude, I just not really feel the chemistry. Not just the physical attraction (I of course not looking for pretty girl) also not feel the spiritual attraction. Yes, she is nice lady but I dont know why, I just don't feel interested, only interested in making friend with her.</p>
              <p>So now how do I tell Mr A that I am just only making friend and not interested in Ms B, without offending  him?</p>

              <p>Lie to him and tell him you are interested in someone already. It may be a lie, but it does help to prevent any unhappiness which may occur if you were to tell him directly that you are not interested in Miss B.</p>
