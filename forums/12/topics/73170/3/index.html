            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 7</strong></span><br><br>Time passed quickly and I finished my semester. It was holiday period for me until July and while everyone was rejoicing and planning where to go and what to do, I have to stay at home to rest for at least one week because my wind pipe was inflamed due to flu related illness. It was terrible.<br><br>Recently, Paul had his first argument with Dawn; it was about his easy behaviour around women in general. Dawn exercised certain amount of control over him and it annoyed Paul, who was so used in his carefree life before he was attached. Paul called me and being his good friend, I listened attentively to his ranting.<br><br>'She should have known that I was like that before the relationship... now she is complaining. Ridiculous right? Not as if I like them or what... why can't she just trust me...?'<br><br>I listened until he was tired of talking and had to put down the phone. Time check: it was a two hours conversation. Feeling quite drowsy, I sat by the sofa and rested. Maybe I was under the effect of drugs; many thoughts came into my mind. How many times do we know one another completely before leaping into a relationship? Usually no, because we learn as we lead our relationship. There were obvious and sublime personalities or secrets that we chose to show or filter before being together. This was essential because if Paul were seen with all your flaws, Dawn wouldn't have be with him in the first place.<br><br>We learn as we grow.<br><br>Then how much do I know about Rain? Actually, nothing much. She was so mysterious and I always felt that she has an invisible screen placed in front of her - shielding and protecting her emotional vulnerability and weakness. I respected that though because I know when it was time for me to understand her more, I would.<br><br>'Beep' - there was a message.<br><br>'So suay! I sprain my ankle!'<br><br>It was Rain and fear gripped my heart. I was anxious about what had happened and keyed in furiously into my phone's keypad. Then, I learned that she had slipped and fell yesterday night when she was coming home. The stairs was wet and the sole in her slippers were worn-out - this combination was deadly.<br><br>'Think I may die of hunger; my house has nothing but maggi mee!'<br><br>What? No one at home to look after her? My soft side got worked up again: I was like a worried dad.<br><br>'Where are you staying? Give me your address?'<br><br>'Why? Don't tell me you want to come? Don't worry about me lar.'<br><br>Still, she gave me her address. I changed, took whatever essential stuff I needed and left the house in a hush. With God's blessing, taxi was instantly available.<br><br>'Uncle, this address please... *cough* *cough*'<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 8</strong></span><br><br>I got off the cab and scanned the area around for the nearest Kopitiam. Lucky thing, it was within sight; across the road.<br><br>'What should I buy for her?'<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'Sian...I think I will eat what you eat...'</span> - I remembered this phrase and smiled. Touching my tummy for a while, I knew what I wanted to buy.<br><br>'Uncle ta bao chicken rice. One packets please.'<br><br>Double checking my phone, I moved into the direction of her block after purchasing the meal. I took the lift to the seventh floor and turned right. In less than ten seconds, I found her house.<br><br>'Eh, I am outside your house now.'<br><br>The door opened and a shocked looking Rain stood in front of me.<br><br>'I THOUGHT YOU WERE JOKING!'<br><br>Woman should never take man for granted, especially a serious folk like me. Hiak!<br><br>'Anyway, it's good that you called; the door bell is spoilt.'<br><br>I entered the house and the sight nearly took my life: The hall was barely furnished and had minimal necessity - a mat, a small television and a mini coffee table. The wall was flaking and was in need of serious repainting. It was a sorry sight and I tried my best not to look too awkward.<br><br>'Sorry, my house is crap.'<br><br>'I disagree; it may be simple, but it's certainly not crap.'<br><br>It was a little bleak and I wanted to switch on the lights. Then came my second nightmare: nothing happened.<br><br>'The bulb had fused long ago. Don't worry about it - I am used to the dark.'<br><br>I never knew the girl I have been chatting with for the past couple of months had such sorry reality. Recovering the mental stun quickly, I handed her the packet of food and we sat down at the kitchen. I could see in her eyes that she was touched by my actions, but trying her best to conceal them.<br><br>Now, I felt a duty to look after her.<br><br>'Why are you living alone?' I asked, wondering if it was appropriate to ask.<br><br>Rain quietly ate her food and she looked as if she was miles away from her thoughts.<br><br>Something triggered my hands to move; I put my hands on her wrist and squeezed softly.<br><br>'Don't worry. It doesn't matter to me because the way you are, is the Rain I want to know as a good friend, not what you have or what you own.'<br><br>Rain continued eating, but I could see her eyes grew a little red. Abruptly and suddenly, she choked and coughed.<br><br>'You are such a baby,' I said while patting her back, 'let me get you a glass of water.'<br><br>Quickly I poured her some water and she drank them carefully.<br><br>'Aiya, let me feed you lar,' I whispered as my fatherly instinct came onto me.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>
