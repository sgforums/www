            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 12</strong></span><br><br>It was getting late and the weather hasnÂ’t been very good. I grabbed a cab quickly before I was almost drenched by the coming downpour.<br><br>Â‘Serangoon Central?Â’ the taxi driver asked.<br><br>I was puzzled; how did he know?<br><br>Â‘I remembered I send you here before,Â’ laughed the taxi driver, Â‘and you are wearing the same clothing.Â’<br><br>I wasnÂ’t bothered - my mind was blank. I only wanted to read the letter she gave me.<br><br>***<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Dear Cloud,<br><br>I didnÂ’t know where to start and almost didnÂ’t write this letter. It was your call yesterday that moved me. I feel that you have the right to know more about me and through this letter; things will be much clearer.<br><br>I have a boyfriend named Steve and we were having a long distance relationship. There are parental objection on his side because I wanted to go over to England to stay with him. I hated my family and didnÂ’t want to hang around in Singapore. This issue has been affecting our relationship and he felt that he has to end them because it was going nowhere.<br><br>I was devastated. I went Milk Bar and drown myself in alcohol, only to have met you. When I was drunk, I couldnÂ’t believe my eyes that you looked so much like him. ThatÂ’s why I used your phone to call my own phone, so that I could have your number. Silly right?<br><br>I wanted to forget Steve because I couldnÂ’t believe how little faith he has for our relationship. You were there and I tried to find Steve in you. But the more I attempt to find Steve in you, the more I found Cloud - the real you. The Cloud that I gradually fell for after months of recovery. Your unique perception of love, your behaviour, your sincerity and most importantly, being yourself, empowers and draws me nearer to you.<br><br>But it wasnÂ’t substantial.<br><br>Recently Steve emailed me and told me that I could go over. He had finally managed to settle the parental objection and wanted to patch back with me.<br><br>I asked myself: how? It was torturous. I kept crying; torn between choosing someone who dumped the relationship and had me stranded alone and someone who has been always there for me without expecting anything in return and picked me up when I fell. You are special because you respected my personal privacy. You never asked - you only stood quietly in a corner, always there for me. You are like a holiday inn - a stay I wished that I could be here forever.<br><br>I cannot bear to leave you because I know once I leave the shores of this holiday inn, there is not way I can return. Time would have washed me far away and it would be a no-return trip. I can only preserve a shrine within my memories, to remind me that this special someone ever walked into my life and left footprints. It is those footprints that changed me lifeÂ… changed my soulÂ…<br><br>I will be leaving within this week. I guess, I could only sayÂ… IÂ’m sorry.<br><br>I love you, but only if we met earlier.<br><br>Rain    </span><br><br>***<br><br>My heart was torn and shattered into a million pieces. I could almost hear the pains of those tinkering sounds as if every fallen piece was a part of my soul. It was also as if all was ran by fate and churned by destiny. The bottled up feelings finally imploded and tears leaked from my eyes.<br><br>I was crying.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>
