            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 3</strong></span><br><br>We kept running, or at least I felt that we were running.<br><br>We finally came to an empty bus stop, exhausted, and before I could catch my breath: the girl puked.<br><br>Disgustingly strange, I thought I smelled Marche. I walked over to her and patted her back gently. She kept puking and I had to wriggle my nose and shift my attention elsewhere.<br><br>After the 'Merlion act' - she sat and causally leaned herself on me, with her head on my shoulder. I was praying and hoping that she wouldn't puke on me, if not my mum would kill me if she smelled alcohol.<br><br>We remained in our position for ten minutes, but it seemed like eternity. I swear I have never been so close with a girl before. It was extremely scary but the feeling nice beyond words. Although we don't know each other, I felt that I knew her for long. Maybe that's the reason why I had to urge to help her.<br><br>'I am sorry mister.' Her weak voice finally spoken.<br><br>'Don't worry too much lady. By the way, I didn't mean to take advantage of you or what. I didn't want to disturb you or anything that's why I didn't wake you up or call you and...'<br><br>Then, she returned to an upright sitting position and put her finger to my lips as if she was too weak to say anything.<br><br>'I know what's going on. I am not drunk.'<br><br>Yeah right. A drunkard will never admit that he or she is drunk.<br><br>She shaped a small smile.<br><br>I saw her first smile; it was incredibly sweet. I cannot imagine what will happen to her if other guys were to successfully pick her up. She would have been ruin and probably regret later on. Fortunately for her, she met a genuine good man (At least I thought I was one).<br><br>'You know what? You looked my ex-boyfriend...'<br><br>That was so unexpected of her to say that. Oh well, probably that's why she would rather leave with me than the other two guys. After all, I resembled someone familiar and her subconscious would automatically pick me. Maybe because I am your average Joe next door - I seemed too dumb to be dangerous.<br><br>'But he left me today and the best thing was: today is also our third year anniversary...'<br><br>I nodded my head in disbelieved. A pretty girl like her was dumped? I thought good looking ladies are immune to being dump for life. For that, I was wrong. There must be a serious problem in her relationship.<br><br>'It's all about me... all my fault... I haven't been a good girlfriend.'<br><br>How on earth can you measure the quality 'Good' ? What it takes to classify ourselves as 'Good' or 'Bad' partners? The comparison basis and yardsticks? Maybe it's not us entirely - it could be the love itself. Lost of feelings over the time could contribute to that.<br><br>There was a crude silence before she puked again. I shook my head. Then I took out my phone and there was a message from Paul.<br><br>'<span style="font-style: italic;">Muahahahhahahahhahahaha! Sorry pal, you may have to go home yourself tonight. I have succeeded</span>! - Paul'<br><br>At least something good happened today. As I was about the reply Paul, the girl snatched my phone away nimbly.<br><br>'Hey!'<br><br>'Wait wait! I need to call someone.'<br><br>I was giving her that 'kind' of look while she winked at me.<br><br>'Hello? Ok, bye.'<br><br>The call ended within two seconds and that was an utter waste of my phone bill. She was obviously calling someone unimportant or fooling me with a fake caller. But because of that wink, I had to forgive her. Good looking girls have that mystical power to get away with evil deeds with their appearance.<br><br>'I think you better go home.'<br><br>I flagged down an oncoming cab.<br><br>'Why didn't you ask for my number?' said the girl, holding onto the taxi's door.<br><br>Actually I wanted to ask for her contact number. She was gorgeous, but because it was the she-is-a-girl-from-clubbing theory that prevented me from asking.<br><br>She nodded.<br><br>'By the way, my name is Rain.'<br><br>What? Her name is Rain? What the hell?<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 4</strong></span><br><br>It has been a week since I last saw Rain. Although it was a mere short encounter with her, she left this silly impression that I never forget. I never told Paul about what took place during his stay inside Milk Bar, but anyway, I don't see a need to tell him, yet.<br><br>I was burning midnight oil, rushing to complete my project journal which I am supposed to hand in by tomorrow. Jotting down my last couple of sentences, I was rejoicing when I finally completed the assignment. It was tedious.<br><br>I needed a break; I walked into my kitchen and got myself a glass of water.<br><br>'Beep' - My mobile phone rang.<br><br>'Hi, Steve...Watcha' doing? I cannot sleep... chat with me? - Rain.'<br><br>Ok, I admit I was shocked to receive a message from Rain, but who's Steve? Who the hell is Steve? And how on Earth did she get my number? I felt that I was being stalked to a certain degree.<br><br>'Hehe...I have my own ways...so sian right? When you want to but can't sleep at night?'<br><br>I would have slept three hours ago, if not for my dumb project. Sometimes, I think it's ridiculous; the ones that badly needed rest, don't have time for them, while the ones with abundance full of free time, doesn't want to sleep. My constant lateness has been marked by my tutors in school. I guess it will affect my participation marks - a vicious cycle.<br><br>'I can't sleep not because I don't want - my mind forbids me to... =( '<br><br>Ok. I was forgetful about the fact that Rain was still on the road to recovery from whatsoever problems she has. Anyway, most girls have this tendency to key in expression-like symbols as part of the message to convey their feelings. Does it help? I don't know. I always believed that problems never vanished into thin air; it's always what we do to the problems that eased the tension within us. Maybe we are like machines, too much heat generated from functions will ruin the entire system.<br><br>'Then how do we handle the malfunction?'<br><br>Buy new one? If I had the cash, the first thing I would do is to change my computer, get a cable modem and a good-enough printer. My computer model was outdated many times over and I think even the garang guni fellow would roll his eyes in disbelieved.<br><br>'If only I could. I don't even have the 'cash'...'<br><br>My friend found me a part time job for me in Takashimaya, working at Yakitori - the Japanese snack bar in Food Court. I don't have the cash as well; I can only depend on myself. We are all born penniless; it's our family, our environment and opportunity that made us rich.<br><br>We continued chatting on SMS as if it was all planned. Then, I looked at my Casio clock in my room - it was going to be four in the morning. I don't know why I would engage so long a conversation with her, but my fatigue seemed to have disappeared though. I had to bid her farewell in my next message, if not I will be late for tomorrow's tutorial.<br><br>'Good night Steve... I mean CloudÂ¡Â­ =)'<br><br>The Steve business again? I had to sleep Â¨C leave the thinking for tomorrow.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 5</strong></span><br><br>Paul and I bounded the same train for Orchard; he had to meet his darling girlfriend Dawn to catch a movie, while I had to work today. It seemed to me that Paul was living in Heaven since the birth of this relationship; his smiles were frequent and all over his face whenever he received an SMS from Dawn. I felt he looked like an idiot whispering to himself as he replied her message. Love always instigates people to do stupid things.<br><br>'Bye and remember to say hi to Dawn for me.'<br><br>Without raising his eyes, Paul waved to me and quickly returned to his messaging.<br><br>With a sigh, we went on separate ways. I understand that he was going through his honeymoon period - all the lovely dopey stuff was flooding his mind. Maybe I lacked romantic genes in me; I see relationship more than just your sweet little thing. There has to be certain form of stability. I mean, I rather have a smooth relationship than one that appeared to be loving in the beginning and tearful at conclusion. The fluctuation and tides of love could drown me outrageously.<br><br>'Damn, I am getting sick of this job...' I thought to myself as I searched the cupboard for my apron and uniform. Without wasting anymore time, I moved to where I was assigned to and began my work.<br><br>Throughout my work duration, my mind projected only one image: Rain. I can't comprehend the complication behind the vision but it just came to me naturally. I kept thinking if she would message or call me today. Or worst, none of the above. Though I have her number too, the pride and ego in me refused to dial them. It was always her initiative to contact me during these twenty three days we knew each other.<br><br>'I must be thinking too much...'<br><br>Suddenly, my mobile phone vibrated inside my left jean's pocket.<br><br>A quick check beneath revealed a message from Rain. Ah! Don't tell me she has ESP power and could mind-read me?<br><br>'You looked so cute in your blue apron and hat...'<br><br>I peeped from where I was squatting and after a hard scan around my environment; I saw this familiar pretty looking face at the extreme left of where I was. Oh no! I shouldn't have told her that I worked here. I looked so dumb in this working attire! There goes my scores in her impression - my take is negative ten.<br><br>My heart pounded fiercely against my chest as she winked at me, again. Gathering myself, I smiled back and continued working as if my work was more interesting, even though it sucked. It was the man's instinct to remain calm and still look cool in the presence of a woman that matters to you.<br><br>'Cloud, I forgot to tell you; your schedule today is only until eight. You can leave now.' said Kenneth, my colleague, as he tapped my shoulder and broke my concentration. Ok, now I knew what was going on: she must have asked Kenneth about my schedule beforehand, thus her appearance here.<br><br>I removed my uniform and apron and walked to where she was.<br><br>'Yes my lady?'<br><br>'Had your dinner? No? Let's go~!'<br><br>I had no opportunity to react at all; Rain grabbed my arm and started running, yet again.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 6</strong></span><br><br>We arrived at Cineleisure after a causal walk plus a short sprint that died down less than thirty seconds. There must be some kind of explanation to this: we always ran somehow when we meet.<br><br>'Where you want to eat? Food court? Ok!'<br><br>Like always, my mind was too slow to react. I simply nodded my head.<br><br>Choosing an auspicious area, I picked one inconspicuous corner, hoping that I wouldn't meet any familiar faces here. Who knows? I may be a topic for these people to gossip about, especially when I have such a cutie with me. Although this has never happened before, I was overly paranoid. I was conscious about everything from impression to image to long vision of our possible friendship -I had to be paranoid.<br><br>'Tell me what you want to eat, I will buy for you.'<br><br>'Sian...I think I will eat what you eat...' replied Rain as she hastily glanced through the food stalls from where she was sitting.<br><br>Eat what I eat? I have only known her barely less than a month and she became so comfy with me? This could be a good sign... Oh wait; the Clubbing Girl theory still applies. Control... control...<br><br>I came back with a huge plate of fried rice from Hans. Actually, I wasn't hungry, but since she made the decision to eat, I just followed suit. I was thinking of sharing the plate of food. After all, food tasted better when you shared them.<br><br>'Are you surprised to see me?'<br><br>Due to the unpredictability of a woman's intention, motive and desire, I chose not to answer that question. I never understand woman and never will I be able to and things that I do not understand, I will not attempt to unlock the mystery. I would probably perish in the attempt.  However, I need a decent reply...<br><br>'Yes, but I know why...'<br><br>Her eyes widened as if this wasn't the reply she expected.<br><br>'Chances are, you are pretty sian today, so you could spare the time to find me mah?'<br><br>'Why do you say that?' Rain asked, quite taken aback.<br><br>Why do I say that? A pretty girl like her would never find an average guy like me when she really needed someone important. People like me were as if we were the back sitters, you would pick them when the seats in front are fully taken. I had long resigned to fate.<br><br>'Firstly I am not pretty wor... so I cannot be classified as a pretty girl. So why can't I find you?'<br><br>My mum used to tell me that women who are good with words are cunning and deceptive. Let's hope it's not the case here. Another thing I discovered about women was that when you flattered them about their appearance, they would tell you otherwise. Again, these were some good physical evidences that I should never try to understand women at all.<br><br>Our chatting continued as we consumed the giant plate of fried rice gradually. Rain hated pea, so she conveniently scooped them up and placed them in my spoon.<br><br>Â¡Â®Eat them... don't waste food.Â¡Â¯<br><br>That's so evil. I hate them too, but I have to eat?<br><br>'Yes!'<br><br>I remembered Paul said something once: Love is all about compromising. The minute you don't and want to pick a fight out of mundane issue - you know that your love had weakened. It seemed a little true here; if that was my mum forcing me to eat those peas, I would have verbally resisted...<br><br>I obliged to her will.<br><br>'Cloud, you are so cute... if only... haiz...Â¡Â¯<br><br>Me cute? That's impossible for me to acknowledge that strange fact. And what's with the sigh?<br><br>'It's late Cloud. I have to go off now.'<br><br>Time check: it was nine plus. Quite late, considering that I have to wake up early for tomorrow's tutorial. I signalled to her; we grabbed our stuff and left Cineleisure. I have no idea how she was going back, but her direction seemed to be walking towards the MRT station. I was thinking of walking her there before I rushed back home by bus.<br><br>'I don't think you are taking train. Its ok, you don't have to send me home. I will go off myself.'<br><br>Actually I wasn't thinking of sending; however I pretended that I was disappointed. Then Rain pinched my cheek and giggled.<br><br>'Come on...'<br><br>I smiled.<br><br>Without lingering anymore, she walked towards the station and vanished in less than a minute.  I was satisfied though.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>
