It was as if some part of me disappeared and never returned. The pain was excruciating. I wanted to yell, but my heart made no sound as though it was sucked into the black of hole of circumstances.<br><br>I shouldnÂ’t even have expected anything at all. We were such good friends right? Maybe good friends should always remain as good friends. Love has been around, but itÂ’s about us, the choice we made that made a difference. I can choose to love her, but doesnÂ’t mean that I have to be with her. Illogical? I called it respect.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â‘Why are you giving excuse for your failure. You know deep inside, you donÂ’t feel this wayÂ…Â’   </span><br><br>I shook my head violently to dispel that thought. I was going insane every second.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â‘STOP! STOP! STOP all these!Â’</span> I was screaming to myself.<br><br>Then, my phone rung and I had a chance to refocus my attention. It was a private number.<br><br>Â‘Hello?Â’ I asked and there was no reply. I knew it was Rain.<br><br>Â‘Anything you want to say to me before I go off?Â’<br><br>Â‘It doesnÂ’t matter to me whether you chose him or not because my love for you is more than just possessing you. Since the day I knew you, <strong>never</strong> had I have the opportunity to make any choices Â– ItÂ’s always you who determine what we should doÂ… when we should leave,  when we should run, where to eat, who have to eat the peasÂ… sitting by the swingsÂ… your letters or even going home or even going over to England.<br><br>Have I ever say Â‘NoÂ’ to you?<br><br>NoÂ… because love had taught me to respect and be happy. Why? Because its YOU.<br><br>You made the choice.<br><br>The one decision I ever made for myself, concerning usÂ… is to love you. DonÂ’t have to say sorry because itÂ’s my decision to.Â’<br><br>I knew she was crying too.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

There was a large queue everywhere and Paul hated huge queue.<br><br>There was absolutely no contact with Rain since the day we last met. I knew she had gone over to England. My mind was tired of pondering. If I knew her story beforehand, I wouldnÂ’t have led myself so far. It was a critical stab in my heart Â– a stab that I wouldnÂ’t know how long it would take me to heal.<br><br>Have I regretted? Not at all. She has a special role in my life; she widened my thinking, taught me how to love and the priceless value of a special someone. It was bitter inside, but I knew the core was sweet. It was useless to have my girlfriend around me while her heart lies with someone else. I learned that having impacts in peopleÂ’s life served a greater purpose than one possible relationship. Our connections were like dark clouds - she was one torrential rain that devastated my land, but renewal was beautiful after her appearance, because the soil was rich and water was plenty.<br><br>I was the catalysis that made that happened - this simple dream that existed. I was the fleeting clouds.<br><br>Woman should never take man for granted.<br><br>I have to heal my wounds.<br><br>I need time.<br><br>I touched my tummy.<br><br>Â‘Chicken Rice pleaseÂ…Â’<br><br>~The End~<br><br>(Names has been changed to protect identity)<br></div>
