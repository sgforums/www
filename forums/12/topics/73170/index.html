            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter I</strong></span><br><br>I don't club often and always find quick excuses to reject invitation from my good friend, Paul. Although we are a world of difference in terms of personality, somehow, we ended up as best of buddy. Our friendship has gone a long way since my Secondary school days and even back then, Paul was a popular figure.<br><br>You would find Paul at every happening party in town and everybody knew him. He was the life of the party and his charms were irresistible - both male and female desired to know him.<br><br>Female - because he was the boyish cute type of guys that would make all his little girl fans go 'So cute! My baby!'<br><br>Male - because he was spotted with all the hot babes and some guys just wants to be seen around him.<br><br>Me? A rank above the nerds: your average guy-next door. Nothing spectacular. Nothing interesting. Nothing notable to mention.<br><br>I was literally kidnapped by Paul as he shoved me into the cab and locked me down before asking the cab to speed off to Mohammad Sultan.<br><br>'Please give me some face ok?' whispered Paul as he released his locking stance, 'I need some moral support, especially when Dawn is around.'<br><br>Adjusting my shirt collar, I rolled my eyes, astonishingly.<br><br>'Why on Earth do you need me there when you have everybody around you to support physically and me spiritually?'<br><br>'What are best friend for? Those people who you deemed as everybody are merely clubbing friends. In time of need - I need you!'<br><br>'That's so gay.'<br><br>Paul threw a punch right on my arm.<br><br>'Come on dude. Drinks on me tonight. Any girl you fancy, just tell me.'<br><br>'Don't worry; I don't need any clubbing girls.'<br><br>Somehow, I have this perception that girls that were picked up from the bar wouldn't fall under the category of decent. I mean, if they were to be easily picked up by you, left with the you and ended up in bed a little while laterÂ¨Cthis has probably happened a thousand times before you bed her. She probably has an entire log book about her sexual ONS (read: One Night Stand) partners and worst still, if she already has a boyfriend or even worst: married. I cannot picture the scene of my reaction if I knew I have been sharing my girlfriend or wife with so many men. It's pure murderous deception.<br><br>'We have reached,' said Paul as he paid the driver, ' And my story begins tonight.'<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter II</strong></span><br><br>The party was at Milk Bar in Mohammad Sultan and I felt the ground shaking as I approached the Bar; many people swarmed over our direction - greeted, hugged, slap a pat or whatsoever welcoming body-language over our ever-famous Paul. They knew too, that it was his big day, the day if he could have Dawn, this little petite beauty from our course, as his girlfriend.<br><br>Paul was a flirty rake, but he was serious about Dawn. Everyone knows that. He spent more than a year trying to chase her and the final conclusion depended on tonight.<br><br>'Dawn is inside. Good luck pal. You have until 3 a.m. in the morning.'<br><br>'Oh yah, Cloud,' yelled Paul before entering Milk Bar, 'enjoy yourself first, I will join you soon enough.'<br><br>Well, like always, I was thrown alone, again. Deep inside, I was praying for Paul, wishing him all the best even though I knew he would be victorious. No woman had ever rejected his love proposal; I guess it would be the same for Dawn.<br><br>I already had half the mind to leave Milk Bar. Not because I dislike crowds - in fact I am ok with them. Just that club dancing isn't something that I would fancy. Perhaps I should just settle for some drinks - after all, it's free flow tonight.<br><br>'Whisky coke please.'<br><br>After about five glasses - I grew a little light-headed throughout this lonely drink session with myself, but this doesn't stop me from noticing this girl sitting beside me. I would have rated her overall appearance at least eight out of ten, but surprisingly, she was alone and nobody came up and chat with her. She was clearly weeping; her eyes were bloodshot and puffy. Maybe someone came up before, but could have failed miserably in his attempt to get her number or worst still, unleashed all her anger and tension in form of verbal trashing at him.<br><br>Her fringe was over her face and her top was a little off her shoulder. She looked as if she was in some kind of distress.<br><br>'One more...' she slurred unclearly at the bartender.<br><br>That triggered my soft side: I had this great urge to stop her from drinking, not because I want to pick her up or what, but because it's dangerous for a girl to be drunk in a bar without friends looking after her. At least I knew I have no ill intention, but I truly doubt others.<br><br>I had to do what I had to do.<br><br>'Hey, you better stop drinking so much!' I arched over and whispered near her. She lifted her head as if it weighed ten tons and gazed dreamily at me. Then her features came to a complete change.<br><br>'Why do you have to bother me since you don't want me?'<br><br>Don't want you? It took me six seconds to realise that she may have mistaken me for someone she knew.<br><br>'A girl like you shouldn't be drinking so much!'<br><br>'Why do you care?' she snapped.<br><br>'Well, I am nobody - at least I know all problems in the world could be solved - Drinking only escape reality.'<br><br>She looked into my eyes. I felt a wave of energy washing through me; then her tears slipped and I could see a wounded soul.<br><br>'Hello girl; we are back.'<br><br>Two guys came over behind her and smiled. For a moment, I thought it was her friends, but from the look from their pupils, I knew they were hunting. It was scientifically proven that the pupils will expand when the eyes sees something interesting or captivating. Today, I supported this theory.<br><br>'Get lost!' she screamed before grabbing my hands and dashed out of Milk Bar. She nearly fell when she quickened her pace and I had to hold her tight. The music was loud and I couldn't hear anything, but I believed those guys would have curse at me.<br><br>(To be continued....)</div>
