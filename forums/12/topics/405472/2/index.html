              <p>Hi all.</p>
              <p>I wish to get this unhappy episode off my chest. I had a good friend. I knew him from pri school all the way through adulthood. Once day, he smsed me asking for a loan of 5k. He said he had lost money on shares. Being good friends, I agreed and passed him the money. He promised he would return in 2 months' time. </p>
              <p>After 2 months, he suddenly became uncontactable. He did not reply to my smses and calls. So I decided to go to his place. His mother came out and accused me of harassment. She also yelled vulgarities at me. I then went home and found my "good friend" sms on my hp. It read:"sa meow, if u disturb me again, i will report police." </p>
              <p>I was very upset. I helped him yet he accused me of disturbing him. BTW, my name is Samuel and by "sa meow" he meant that I was a "silly cat". Am I really a silly cat? I am seriously thinking of changing my name. </p>
              <p>This incident really traumatised me alot. Now I don't trust pple anymore.</p>
              <p>Maybe to some of u 5k is a small amount. But to me, a low-income earner, its alot. I slogged for a relatively long period of time to save up the amount.</p>

              <p>it depend in individuals, some may find getting dividends from whatever company share they invest 'suitable' for them, so may find speculating shares 'suitable' for them, some may find selling backside/sex in graveyard hours 'suitable' for them.</p>
              <p>For me i going thru online way and that's me...there are many ways to earn side income be it legally or illegally, see which 'suits' ya interest best.</p>
              <p>My point being is dun restrict yourself to just 9-5 income for $$$.</p>
              <p>By hook or by crook. DIVERSIFY ya income source, such that if one of them cut off, u can live on another..</p>

              <p>it's an expensive lesson to know that's how your friend regards u. Actually the policy is..never borrow from or lend money to anyone. No matter how trustworthy u think he or she is. High chance you will not get it back.</p>
              <p>You passed it to him in cash? If bank transfer, can still trace. Perhaps you value friendship very strongly, that's why your desire to "help a friend in need".
