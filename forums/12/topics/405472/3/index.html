              <p>Hi all.</p>
              <p>I wish to get this unhappy episode off my chest. I had a good
              friend. I knew him from pri school all the way through adulthood.
              Once day, he smsed me asking for a loan of 5k. He said he had lost
              money on shares. Being good friends, I agreed and passed him the
              money. He promised he would return in 2 months' time. </p>
              <p>After 2 months, he suddenly became uncontactable. He did not
              reply to my smses and calls. So I decided to go to his place. His
              mother came out and accused me of harassment. She also yelled
              vulgarities at me. I then went home and found my "good friend" sms
              on my hp. It read:"sa meow, if u disturb me again, i will report
              police." </p>
              <p>I was very upset. I helped him yet he accused me of disturbing
              him. BTW, my name is Samuel and by "sa meow" he meant that I was a
              "silly cat". Am I really a silly cat? I am seriously thinking of
              changing my name. </p>
              <p>This incident really traumatised me alot. Now I don't trust pple
              anymore.</p>
              <p>Maybe to some of u 5k is a small amount. But to me, a low-income
              earner, its alot. I slogged for a relatively long period of time to
              save up the amount.</p>

              <p>well, what are you waiting for ???!!!</p>
              <p>call up your next closest friend and ask him for a $5K loan right now !</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway, either you owe him 5K in a previous lifetime or he'll have to return you the money one way or another in the next life...............end of the day, all accounts have to be squared so not to worry !</p>

              <p><br>When Rock^Star persuaded TS to accept this unfortunate incident as an "expensive" lesson, the word "expensive" had to be used to encourage TS that it is right not to take any further action and it gives TS the impression that any further actions would be more "expensive" in the future. That is one example of a defeatist attitude.</p>
              <p>When Rock^Star gave a one-liner such as "Money can always earn back one ... you just gotta move on", it is definately NOT to encourage TS to think of any possible further actions to fight for his own rights. Don't you think TS deserves justice in his case? Just because YOU THINK that there are no other EASY WAYS to obtain justice for TS, YOU THINK it is RIGHT for you to tell TS felt that his case DO NOT DESERVES JUSTICE??? ---&gt; THIS IS ONE VERY COMMON DEFEATIST ATTITUDE THAT NOBODY EVEN REGARDS IT AS A DEFEATIST ATTITUDE BECAUSE IT HAD BECAME TOO COMMON ALREADY!</p>

              <p>Like I have mentioned many times before, KIND WORDS doesn't always encourage or help anyone IF IT WAS USED IN THE WRONG OCCASIONS! KIND WORDS CAN KILL if every retarded retards in the world believed that kind words is the CURE for all emotional distress. Do you really think TS is not in the state of encouraging himself? Do you really think TS only needs your kind words in order to move on? How about you go and get cheated of some amount of money which are significant to you and we all come here and drown you in our inventive KIND WORDS?</p>
              <p>I will also give you KIND WORDS in the wrong time so that you may experience what TS had gone through and hopefully you will think thrice of your words before you even speak of it.</p>

              <p>Hi all.</p>
              <p>I wish to get this unhappy episode off my chest. I had a good friend. I knew him from pri school all the way through adulthood. Once day, he smsed me asking for a loan of 5k. He said he had lost money on shares. Being good friends, I agreed and passed him the money. He promised he would return in 2 months' time. </p>
              <p>After 2 months, he suddenly became uncontactable. He did not reply to my smses and calls. So I decided to go to his place. His mother came out and accused me of harassment. She also yelled vulgarities at me. I then went home and found my "good friend" sms on my hp. It read:"sa meow, if u disturb me again, i will report police." </p>
              <p>I was very upset. I helped him yet he accused me of disturbing him. BTW, my name is Samuel and by "sa meow" he meant that I was a "silly cat". Am I really a silly cat? I am seriously thinking of changing my name. </p>
              <p>This incident really traumatised me alot. Now I don't trust pple anymore.</p>
              <p>Maybe to some of u 5k is a small amount. But to me, a low-income earner, its alot. I slogged for a relatively long period of time to save up the amount.</p>
