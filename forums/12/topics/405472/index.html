              <p>Hi all.</p>
              <p>I wish to get this unhappy episode off my chest. I had a good friend. I knew him from pri school all the way through adulthood. Once day, he smsed me asking for a loan of 5k. He said he had lost money on shares. Being good friends, I agreed and passed him the money. He promised he would return in 2 months' time. </p>
              <p>After 2 months, he suddenly became uncontactable. He did not reply to my smses and calls. So I decided to go to his place. His mother came out and accused me of harassment. She also yelled vulgarities at me. I then went home and found my "good friend" sms on my hp. It read:"sa meow, if u disturb me again, i will report police." </p>
              <p>I was very upset. I helped him yet he accused me of disturbing him. BTW, my name is Samuel and by "sa meow" he meant that I was a "silly cat". Am I really a silly cat? I am seriously thinking of changing my name. </p>
              <p>This incident really traumatised me alot. Now I don't trust pple anymore.</p>
              <p>Maybe to some of u 5k is a small amount. But to me, a low-income earner, its alot. I slogged for a relatively long period of time to save up the amount.</p>

              <p>Know him from childhood until adult doesn't mean its good friend. If go thru thick and thin, even 6months acquitance can form a brotherhood bond.</p>
              <p>I don't know why many people uses time as a way to gauge as good friends..</p>
              <p>I seriously doubt you know what is called good friends.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>About lending money to friends.</p>
              <p>I always give this advice.</p>
              <p>You lose the friend and the money</p>
              <p>Or</p>
              <p>You keep the money, and lose just the friend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Come on, that guy has no money, can't you also say you have no money.</p>

              <p>Sorry to hear that; $5000 is quite a significant amount to most people.</p>
              <p>All I can really say is to accept your losses, cut off all contact from this fella, and move on. If it's any consolation to you, what goes round comes round, and that unforgiven debt of $5k will someday come back to bite him from the rear.</p>
              <p>I've experienced something similar, with the parents of my tuition students refusing to pay me for teaching their children. So, fine, I refuse to write off their debts. Someday it will all come back to haunt them, I'm sure of it.</p>

              <p>it's an expensive lesson to know that's how your friend regards u. Actually the policy is..never borrow from or lend money to anyone. No matter how trustworthy u think he or she is. High chance you will not get it back.</p>
              <p>You passed it to him in cash? If bank transfer, can still trace. Perhaps you value friendship very strongly, that's why your desire to "help a friend in need". You must be a very loyal friend but don't let this incident get u down. On a very positive note, it opens up your eyes and will prevent a bigger disaster in future.</p>
              <p>Money can always earn back one......you gotta move on.</p>
