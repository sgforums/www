            <div class='col-md body'>Hey... you're not alone. Ever since i started my poly life, i adopted the same lifestyle as you. Not that i wanted it, i was forced into solitude and doing things by myself. A good thing out of it was that i've learnt to be more independent, though not really 100% yet. At least a step forward is taken in this direction. At times, i still hesitant to go out alone, but if i am outside already, i will just "jalan-jalan" alone. Else, i must have a place in mind then i will go out alone. Haha, fear of being seen as a loner? Maybe lor. After all, first impression always counts. But, i slowly and trying to peel away the thick layers of pride. Well, life is short yar?<br><br>I am a person who likes to chill out with people(if possible like-minded) who are fun, spontaneous and considerate. People who like to talk out issues, not just superficial crapping and making a fool out of themselves, who dont everything just heck care and considerate by making the effort to be punctual and not take others for granted. Such are some of the qualities i look for in a friend or friends. Unfortunately, few i have met. Alot of you might be thinking that i should not ask so much with me not being a perfect being. But personally i feel these are not very difficult. I do not request that friend to be rich or influential, just have simple common sense and sensitivity to people around them. I dare to say that i do take conscious effort in displaying the qualities above, such as dressing right for the occassion(some frens who just cant be bothered to dress right, often you going out with them feeling funny),being punctual for meetings/outings, following them to get stuff when they ask me, but the reverse always happens towards me.<br><br>I have tried to compromise alot in terms of being more easy going and accomodating( trying to take interest in what they do), but it was never a two way thing. Also, had frens always using each other for selfish ambitions. Finally, had enough of it, decided to do my own thing. However, sometimes i do wish for company to share and pursue like-minded interests(eg:soccer,music..etc). Oh well, i have seen quite a fair number of people out there who are pretty superficial in treating relationships, thus i rather not search for company, and let it by God's will? Hehe.<br><br>All i wanted to say is that you are not alone, and there are probably many others out there like us. Heh. Well, heading to the army soon. Another chapter, another phase.<br><br>cheers</div>
