            <div class='col-md body'>well, maybe you should give him some space then. it might be hard for you at first, but if it makes him love you that much more then why not give it a try. either that, or he will really start to miss the attention that u showered him with. by doing so, u just might realize how much he loves you.<br>but if the more space you give him and the more u both drift apart, then it would better to juz let go then. it will be difficult for you but please, save yourself and him from more heartaches. love cannot be a one-way street or 1 of you, and most probably it's you, will inevitably be hurt in the end.</div>
