              <p>i feel like a failure in life and an under-achiever.</p>
              <p>I am 23 this year and still in ns this coming aug i will enrol into nus to study business. I feel so old.. My jc peers will be like 20 when they enter into uni and some gals at my age.. They have already gotten their deg. Relatives and my parents used to mock at me for being intellectually weak compared to my cousins who are from all the top jcs unlike me .. Went to normall academic and poly. Even when i get accepted by local uni there was once my father call me useless.. Dad .. I already tried to make you proud.. But i cant make it to ivy unis..</p>
              <p>Some of my peers have the luxury of driving their parents flashy cars like bmw whereas i have not even started learning driving and my family dont have a car.. I have friends who at my age are already earning a stable 2000+ by giving tuition.. And i dont even have 5 digits in my bank.</p>
              <p>I am ugly. When i was young i did not take care of my face and teeth. My face now is like a wreck.. Pimply and with many scars. My teeth is crooked and yellow. I cant whiten my teeth because i have many tooth filling. I am not fat but i do not have a nice muscular body.</p>
              <p>Guess what? I have not stepped into a relationship before. The gals i courted all rejected me either because of my looks or my inept social skills. I can only maintain coversations going with gals but i cant make them laugh because i am not humourous. I dont ask much for a girlfriend.. Just average looking with a pleasant personality and can click with me.. Is that so tough?</p>
              <p>I also have few friends. My good friends are all getting attached.. And do not have time for me.  How i wish i can get to know more friends. Most of the time during my weekends i will spend it alone at home.
                  
                  Am i really useless? Not being rich.. No car.. No girlfriend before.. Little friends.. Ugly.. Intellectually weak.. No degree only armed with a diploma. So old and still in army..</p>

              Sorry that you are such a failure. You are not a failure for being what you are but you compare yourself with others and look down on yourself. What you achieved in life, some other may not be lucky to achieve them. Comparisation is good if it benefit you.
              
              The way you did it is like finding an excuse to be sad of who you are. Even I do think you are a failure for doing so.

              <p>I really despise men like you. Utter defeatists.</p>
              <p>Keep whining about how your life sucks; 'bout being an underachiever bla bla bla - yet not do anything significant about it. How about this? Learn to overcome your own problems, to find your own way around things and find  your own reassurance as opposed to all the girly whining and bitching.</p>
              <p>BTW, learn to edit your own post. At 23, I'm certain you can handle something as easy peasy as posting in a forum right? Or am I wrong?</p>

              <p>why do you give a fuck what others think?</p>
              <p>live life for yourself, your goals, your means.</p>
              <p>not live life according to how others say you should.</p>
              <p>it's ok to be in normal acad.</p>
              <p>many people are, and they do excel in life too.</p>
              <p>why should you worry then, if your parents keep comparing you to others?</p>
              <p>work hard, stop looking down on yourself, be a successful person and prove them wrong!</p>
              <p>there's nothing wrong with not owning a car.</p>
              <p>owning a car just gives you extra responsibility, like having to pay for road tax, parking fees, etc.</p>
              <p>yes, you may say that owning a car gives you the right to show off, but do you think that the price you pay for being able to show off is worth it?</p>

              <p>Hey, at least you're going uni right? When I come out from NS I will also be the same age as you. I don't see anything wrong with that.</p>
              <p>When I was young, I was always compared with my same age cousin whom everyone thought was smarter than me.</p>
              <p>I hated my life, even my mum also everytime compare. So many people looked down on me that I myself don't dare to look myself in the mirror.</p>
              <p>Then I stop giving myself self-sympathy and did something about it. Now I am happy to say, I am smarter than most of my classmates, even still pursuing a diploma, my qualifications are already better than my same age cousin who doesn't even have a proper O lvls cert.</p>
              <p>And suddenly everyone pins their hope on me to be the first male in the family to make it to university. And I'm not doing any of those for them, I do for myself. Their words, actions and looking down on me became my strength to excellence.</p>

              <p>i feel like a failure in life and an under-achiever.</p>
              <pre>/&gt;I am 23 this year and still in ns this coming aug i will enrol into nus to study business. </pre>
              <pre>I feel so old.. My jc peers will be like 20 when they enter into uni and some gals at my age.. </pre>
              <pre>They have already gotten their deg. Relatives and my parents used to mock at me for being</pre>
              <pre> intellectually weak compared to my cousins who are from all the top jcs unlike me .. </pre>
              <pre>Went to normall academic and poly. Even when i get accepted by local uni there was once </pre>
              <pre>my father call me useless.. Dad .. I already tried to make you proud.. But i cant make it to </pre>
              <pre>ivy unis..
              </pre>
              <pre>/&gt;Some of my peers have the luxury of driving their parents flashy cars like bmw whereas </pre>
              <pre>i have not even started learning driving and my family dont have a car.. I have friends who </pre>
              <pre>at my age are already earning a stable 2000+ by giving tuition.. And i dont even have 5 digits </pre>
              <pre>in my bank.
              </pre>
              <pre>/&gt;I am ugly. When i was young i did not take care of my face and teeth. My face now is like a </pre>
              <pre>wreck.. Pimply and with many scars. My teeth is crooked and yellow. I cant whiten my teeth </pre>
              <pre>because i have many tooth filling. I am not fat but i do not have a nice muscular body.
              </pre>
              <pre>/&gt;Guess what? I have not stepped into a relationship before. The gals i courted all rejected </pre>
              <pre>me either because of my looks or my inept social skills. I can only maintain coversations </pre>
              <pre>going with gals but i cant make them laugh because i am not humourous. I dont ask much </pre>
              <pre>for a girlfriend.. Just average looking with a pleasant personality and can click with me.. </pre>
              <pre>Is that so tough?
              </pre>
              <p>I also have few friends. My good friends are all getting attached.. And do not have time for me. How i wish i can get to know more friends. Most of the time during my weekends i will spend it alone at home.</p>
              <p>Am i really useless? Not being rich.. No car.. No girlfriend before.. Little friends.. Ugly.. Intellectually weak.. No degree only armed with a diploma. So old and still in army..</p>

              <p>I suggest that you make newspapers your best friends. They offer free seminars previews. Go to such seminars often. Some might give you new thinking which will result in positive thinking and mindset change only if you know how to disgest those free information which often needs explaination.</p>

              <p>For me - I commit myself to marrathon 2008 Without Any Training and have completed it despite the pain, it's worth it. At least you know your own limits and worth.</p>
              <p>It's the process of knowing yourself (for instance in my own example) to better understand your own mental/body weakness before you proceed on.</p>
