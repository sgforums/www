              you know i am the only son and only child in the family so i feel a lot of pressure to bring glory to my parents and to continue with my family legacy by giving my parents grandchildren. 
              
              But from the way i see.. It seems hard because of my looks.. I cant make my teeth nicer.. My facial complexion can be improved to an extent only.
              
              Because of my looks i lack confidence and self esteem. Amd thats is why i am afraid i will never be able to settle down and raise a family and continue my family name. Furthermore getting old already.
              
              As for studies.. I am always being compared to others.. My dad used to say..( So and so is a doc/lawyer. You leh..? You know how i feel when your uncles and aunts criticize  and look down on you ?)

              hey jay ho.
              
              Sorry to hear about your plight. But at least you manage to get your degree.
              
              I really hope i can do well in uni. My parents invested a lot on me and i really dont want to let them down. And also i dont want my relatives to have a chance to criticize me and cause hurt to my parents. 
              
              But i am also afraid of this new chapt because of my weak past background. I have seen my poly friends who just barely made it to year 2.

              Honestly, if you come here in hope that people will console or encourage you, i think u have made a wrong choice. You just simply have not seen ppl worse off than you. Pressure from parents, relatives, friends or even yourself is so common and if you cant even cope them now, how are you going to cope when u enter the working society? Think doing a degree is going to be tough? Wait till you do it part time and need to work as well. But thousands of ppl can and are doing it now OKAY???

              <p>once u grad from uni and start working in society, dont judge a person success or failure by his qualification or wealth. neither should you put the same perception on yourself. success or failure is also depends on what u can provide for others, help others.</p>

              <p>i feel like a failure in life and an under-achiever.</p>
              <p>I am 23 this year and still in ns this coming aug i will enrol
              into nus to study business. I feel so old.. My jc peers will be
              like 20 when they enter into uni and some gals at my age.. They
              have already gotten their deg. Relatives and my parents used to
              mock at me for being intellectually weak compared to my cousins who
              are from all the top jcs unlike me .. Went to normall academic and
              poly. Even when i get accepted by local uni there was once my
              father call me useless.. Dad .. I already tried to make you proud..
              But i cant make it to ivy unis..</p>
              <p>Some of my peers have the luxury of driving their parents flashy
              cars like bmw whereas i have not even started learning driving and
              my family dont have a car.. I have friends who at my age are
              already earning a stable 2000+ by giving tuition.. And i dont even
              have 5 digits in my bank.</p>
              <p>I am ugly. When i was young i did not take care of my face and
              teeth. My face now is like a wreck.. Pimply and with many scars. My
              teeth is crooked and yellow. I cant whiten my teeth because i have
              many tooth filling. I am not fat but i do not have a nice muscular
              body.</p>
              <p>Guess what? I have not stepped into a relationship before. The
              gals i courted all rejected me either because of my looks or my
              inept social skills. I can only maintain coversations going with
              gals but i cant make them laugh because i am not humourous. I dont
              ask much for a girlfriend.. Just average looking with a pleasant
              personality and can click with me.. Is that so tough?</p>
              <p>I also have few friends. My good friends are all getting
              attached.. And do not have time for me. How i wish i can get to
              know more friends. Most of the time during my weekends i will spend
              it alone at home. Am i really useless? Not being rich.. No car.. No
              girlfriend before.. Little friends.. Ugly.. Intellectually weak..
              No degree only armed with a diploma. So old and still in army..</p>

              <p>Short and ugly is not the end of the road i tell u........</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look at Mah Bow Tan....tall, dark and handsome? No way but he's boss of HDB.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What about Wong Kan Seng? Boss of MFA.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And jay mentioned Ho Ching, worse than you!! She looks like a man!! But still...boss of Temasek and she married Lee Hsien Loong, who is quite handsome and looks 10 times better than her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Come on, pull yourself together. I can feel you don't really receive much love from your family, resulting in your low self-esteem. And your father using tough psychology on you so you can work harder.... I honestly don't agree with such outdated Asian stuff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Set your priorities, work hard and learn to dress up. Style your hair well at all times...and love urself. Not wait for a new face.</p>

              <p>Don't you know that life is imperfect ? </p>
              <p>Everyone has their own flaws and strength. </p>
              <p>So what yours? </p>
              <p>Can't you do anything about your personality and your humour? </p>
              <p>Yes you might not be handsome enough but can't you be sincere enough? You might not be academically-inclined but aren't you in a University? You might not be driving a flashy car but does there mean that you will not succeed in life later on? You might not be so handsome but you can work on a charming personality.</p>
              <p>Accept yourself who for you. Don't reject these little bits that u deem as unlovable. Accept it, love it and appreciate it.</p>

              <p>Bro,</p>
              <p>someone once told me this, and i now say this to you.</p>
              <p>If at the age of 20 plus, you cannot handle simple setbacks in life .. then what will happen when u r 40? 50 ? when u have a family to feed and loan payments to handle, when your loved ones are waiting for u to put food on the table but u r retrenched. will you go to a forum to post about your shortcomings ?</p>
              <p>The whole world can look down on u, but u cannot look down on urself. Cos if u do, there is really no hope liao ...</p>
