              <p>EVERY HUMAN BEING HAS INSECURITIES! But that's normal.</p>
              <p> Guess what? Even the chioest of girls and those FHM models are always not satisfied of their bloody looks! They always like to seek perfection...but there's no such thing as perfect. Being human is the best.</p>
              <p>There are 2 types of guys. Both are ugly, poor and "whatever you want to say". One despises himself for the shit he is in. The other puts in effort to enjoy life to the fullest without giving a shit to what others think.</p>
              <p>No prizes for guessing who I respect more.</p>

              <p>NUS biz lei, quite power, my friend always whine abt how she was rejected by NUS, you should be feeling proud of yourself!</p>
              <p>better to bloom late than never at all, so don't give up on yourself</p>
              <p>oh ya, it's ok if you don't have muscular body,  but a scarred pimply face (volcano skin??) is not ok, suggest u find facial treatment. can't cure it completely, but at least makes you more presentable, impt for job and r/s</p>

              <p>While others have moved on. You stayed behind wondering why you are not like them.</p>
              <p>Thats because you call yourself "good for nothing", you feel like "good for nothing", you think like a "good for nothing", and by gawd, you are a "good for nothing".</p>
              <p>You only have to be good at one thing in life to be successful. Be it a doctor, a hawker, an engineer, a lawyer, an actor, a teacher, whatever, just be good at it.</p>

              <p>after reading through 60 posts. lol. gd4nth, I dont think you are a failure in life. But rarer not experienced life enough. Do spend time with yourself and reflect. See you inner self. Life is about experiencing on your own doing what you think is right. Dont really need to care about others. A share of my experiences with you all.</p>
              <p>I have friends who have declare retired  @ 26 already earn 1 million.</p>

              <p>Erm. Well. It's your life. Just accept it.</p>
              <p>I also have friends who are also going to come out from army when he's 23. Yet I don't see him getting so upset about going into army at such an "old" age.</p>
              <p>He's still leading a fulfilled life out there. A life I would say better than some of the people here maybe. It's all about how you see it from another angle.</p>
              <p>The fact that you can get into NUS Business is already an achievement. Just that in Business course, it's going to be a bit more competitive than the rest from what I heard. So really get yourself mentally prepared if you want to strive for an honours.</p>
              <p>"Ivy" universities are really only for those who are in the top tiers so don't compare yourself with them. And for those "ivy" universities are often overseas. Don't you like Singapore here? Haha.</p>
              <p>Your friends with flashy BMW is never because they are rich or rather it's their parents who are capable to earning so much money that they can afford one.</p>
              <p>If your friends are earning 2000+ from teaching tuition, then go teach tuitions yourself. Tutees aren't coming to look for you. You have to be the one looking for them. And if you feel that you aren't good enough to teach, then start revising all your past works now. As many people have said, it's never too late to start. You have to take the first step out instead of whining to other people.</p>
              <p>Maybe you wouldn't be earning as much as your friends. But at least you can start small. As the chinese saying goes, a thousand-story building starts from the ground. Don't expect yourself to start earning so much right from the start. </p>
              <p>Maybe you should sit down one day and start thinking about yourself. Learn from others. Maybe a good way is to list down your goals and achieve them within a period of time. </p>
              <p>Ya. And it's your life, just accept it. If you are not born with a silver spoon, you are not born with a silver spoon. That's a fact.</p>
              <p>And the fact that you are seeking help means you actually want to change. You just need to start.</p>
              <p>My point of view. You may not agree with me though. </p>
