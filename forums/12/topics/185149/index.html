Even if you really love (or infatuate with) a person alot.... You see... The thing is most of the time all these 'feelings' would PUSH you to ACT... GET CLOSER... KNOW BETTER.... But little do people realise that sometimes being just a friend and enjoying each other's company might just be so much better without adding in the extra pressures...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well.. first off, ask yourself first.  Are you ready for commitment?  Are you comfortably sure he is the right person for you?  Don't think with your lust, think with your head.  Like one fella said is it infatuation?  If you're thinking about marriage, how is he going to support you.  Would your parents agree?<br><br>Once you get that sorted out and assuming you want to go ahead, approach him.  And the best way to do that is face to face.  Don't be afraid of rejection.  Take the Que Sera Sera approach (whatever will be, will be) and you'll get through.<br><br>Don't give a damn if he freaked out.  The point is, you'll get a chestload of weight of your chest.<br><br>Then tell me how good you'll feel.<br><br></div>
