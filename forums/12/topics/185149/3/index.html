            <div class='col-md body'>hi ozzy-gurl...<br><br>Your situation sounded like mine actually...I was also afraid to let my ex crush knew how I felt about him for the fear of losing the friendship. But still, because I thought he was worth it, I confessed to him twice...and although I got rejected (because he only sees me as a close friend and a sister), I knew that it is better to have done it then to have not at all. Because now I know I would never have any regrets in my heart, at least I have tried my best in letting him know my feelings, and even though he did not reciprocate the way I wanted him to, at least I know the outcome and that makes it easier for me to move on. At least there is no more "what if" question on my part...<br><br>The first time after I confessed, we managed to stay close friends, but after the second time, I admit that the friendship is now a bit strained...but the question is, is he worth the risk? Do you want to have a life w/o regrets? If yes, then let him know today <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes. It is true at least you try before you let it go. After my b/f left, I met a new friend who is Sg who has been the motivation for my career achievements. During my depression, he spent a lot of time to comfort and bring me back to normal life when my heart was torn. I decided to spend holidays with him in Malay and it was a sweet memory.<br>I came back to Australia. After that, there were endless conversations over the internet, email...We both realized sth was going on b/w us. I said to him I would move to Sg one day. Then he prepared to go home after 15 yrs working overseas. Since he moved back to Sg, life wasn't easy for him. Our communication was not as good as before, and I used to keep calling and emailing to nurture my hope for our r/s . Our story was real and I believed him at that time he was honest and true to me. Days after days, I carried my special feelings for him, but living in Australia, I wouldn't  know what really happened to him in Sg. Two years had passed since we first met. The communication was weaker and weaker. I wanted to find out what really happened to him because my feelings for him were still there. Also, I did not want to leave him if he was experiencing some difficulties. As a good friend, we would be there when our friends are in need. I decided to go to Sing to find out what happened. At least, being there it would give me some information for decision making. He picked me at the airport and dropped me at the hotel. Next day, he came to have dinner together. Yes. Things have changed. He said to me things have changed but did not mention what it was...He also changed. But I still wanted to know more what had happened to him, but he didn't tell me. He promised to drop by the next day and would take me to the airport when I departed, but he disappeared, just the messages left with the Reception. No phone call. I came back to Australia and I decided to give up although there are always special feelings for him in me, even it has been five yrs.... Yes, at least I have tried if it was a chance, but it wasnÂ’t. I donÂ’t blame him because I understand things have changed and he doesnÂ’t want to share. We departed then.<br><br>It has been 5 yrs. We email each other off and on. Recently, he sent me a note for Valentine day. It stirs my emotions. Lately, he asked me to go to visit him again and implied of coming back, my answer was no because for me, r/s is not a game although I know people do come back to their old friends. I came to visit him twice. Nothing further happned. I have made up my mind. If it happens, he should be the one who comes to visit me to show his sincerity. Today, he has achieved his corporate ladder of a Gen. Mangr, and a person who is charming like him is always surrounded by women. I donÂ’t want the get the pain with him again. Nothing supports me to do so. Am I right?<br><br>What I want to share with you Ozzy-Gurl, be prepared for what it may happen. If it doesnÂ’t happen, at least we have tried and would not regret for not having made it known to him. Be also prepared if it turns out to be painful too.</div>
