She loves her bf so she feels tt she is guilty by treating her bf tt way. Tts y she is confused and not willing to commit.<br><br>Ask urself wat is the reason of u 2 sleeping tog? Is it really love or is it just tt one or two of u need intimate moments? I feel tt since she aready has a bf and stil u went in to break up the relationship, its not really appropriate of u to do so. I disrespect ppl who come in and break the relationship secretly. If its been a incident everyone can see and know, i dun mind, but behind the back is a bit too much.<br><br>Even if u lose her, i am not surprised cos i really dun think u shld be wif her in the first place.</div>

She needs to work it out with him. going to someone else for comfort is going to hurt her bf (imagine yourself in his shoes). To be fair to him, she should work out stuff in the relationship before contemplating other options.<br><br>After being intimate with someone, there is some exchange going on. Even though it isn't evident, there is some part of you given to her and vice versa. Afterall, you've shared something so intimate with each other. Your feelings for her could have developed from there. But without having been intimate, what do you like about her. is she someone you want to be with. I must add though that it may difficult for you to be objective now.<br><br>Even if she leaves her bf, it does not mean both of you should together. After the end of a relationship, we should have some time to recover. it's like sickness, but of the heart. We also may want to think about what happened in the relationship so that it wont happen again. If she starts a r/s with you right away, what guarantee is there that she wont let the same thing happen to you?<br><br>I know you have strong feelings for her now (and also because you have been intimate), slow down and think things over. any mistake will be emotionally costly!</div>

How long have you guys known each other to be so intimate?<br><br>Secondly, she built an impression that she's interested in you, how sure are you in this? I can build an impression in another guy that I'm interested in him, no big deal about it. Just whether we choose to do it or not. Matter of fact is, she may be lonesome, not able to get intimate with her bf that's why you got a chance to be intimate with her...<br><br>Hello? Hey, please wake up. Are you trying to say that you want her as a gf? What do you know about love? Love doesn't mean going behind another guy's back screwing his gal up. And love doesn't mean going behind bf's back and start on an affair. She can do it to her bf now, what makes you think she won't do it behind your back one day should you fail to satisfy her?<br><br>You're afriad to lose her? In the first place she don't belong to you. In fact you have no right to feel whatever you're feeling now coz you're the third party!<br><br>Gosh, you're old enough to think, there's a quote that goes something like 'Do whatever you want on others and let others do what on you.'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks all of you for your valuable advice. Its tough to let go although I do not technically have her. I know that what i am doing is not right in any way but I do like her a lot and now i'm trying to distance myself from her so that i do not fall deeper into the hole. Is it true that she is only seeking physical comfort without any feelings tied in? Thats a hard pill to swallow.

Its tough to let go although I do not technically have her. I know that what i am doing is not right in any way but I do like her a lot and now i'm trying to distance myself from her so that i do not fall deeper into the hole. Is it true that she is only seeking physical comfort without any feelings tied in? Thats a hard pill to swallow. Is it also possible for her not to feel anything after we have become intimate on more than one occasion? It would be nice to hear from all of you as your experiences are a good guide for me.</div></blockquote>Hi...<br><br>what devil1976 is saying is true. She's not with you so you are not losing her. However, it does not mean that you do not have feelings for her and neither is this going to be easy. But to let go of her now is the best decision. If she is unattached in the future, you can then pursue her.<br><br>With regards to your other questions, having those answers may make it even harder for you to let go, suppose you find out that she has feelings for you. It's not appropriate at this time. If she can do this to her bf (be unsure of her feelings), suppose you guys get together, then things make turn out like now too. It's not just having someone but also how...<br><br>It's not easy but you are making a right decision...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have decided to step away by minimising my contact with her. But she wonders why I am getting colder and she tells me that she has feelings for me. Its getting tough friends. Its like wanting to do the right thing yet having deep feelings for her which cannot be erased instantaneously.
