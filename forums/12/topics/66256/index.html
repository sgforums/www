What's your age? And also depends on how you define 'lasting'? 3 years? 20 years? Forever till death do us apart? Personally, I find it rather subjective... I didn't go into such depths as I understand that such discussions could get pretty lengthy? And often if you happens to be discussing it with an unfriendly individual (speaking in general, not referring to you hor ), it could be an unpleasant waste of time....<br><br>1st point I would like to bring out? Lasting relationship might not be a fulfilling relationship... Have you seen marriages where the spouses can't get along well... Each have their own 'partner' outside of marriage? Together just for the sake of children? Together just for the sake of parents? Plenty....<br><br>Another thing about 'spending time with gf / bf'.....<br><br>1. It's not always possible to spend time with your partner around the clock.<br><br>2. It's not the quantity but the quality that counts.<br><br>3. Other than time with your partner, you'll also need to have your own life and he /she... A life of their own.<br><br>4. Not all individuals likes to 'spend more time' with their partner. It certainly doesn't mean that they hate it, but perhaps maybe feel that freedom and other commitments might be equally important or perhaps not to be neglected?<br><br>At this century, it's also interesting to mention that people are changing... Relationship styles could also be changing for some too... Not all people are looking for 'everlasting love' nowadays....<br><br>If you don't know how to manage your time well with your partner, spending MORE time with them might not neccesarily be a good thing...<br><br>1. Partner might not like it.<br><br>2. Lost control of other aspects of your life and indirectly causing 'impact' or problems to your BGR. eg. Relationship with others (family? friends?) breaks down, financial problem... etc.<br><br>3. More conflicts especially due to previous matters not resolved, etc.<br><br>Getting pretty lengthy?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  It's just like studying for your exams... Spending more time with your books open doesn't necessarily means that you'll score well....<br><br>And one last point? Technology is 'innocent', it's up to how people wanna use it or abuse it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Well... The above are just my personal opinions, does not necessarily reflect anything?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
