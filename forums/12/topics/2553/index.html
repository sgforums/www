            <div class='col-md body'>Steroids can be considered a touchy subject especially if you go around pointing fingers at every 100kg hulk and attribute it to needles and drugs .You wont get a straight answer from any "physically gifted" person about his bag of toys .What i do feel from my encounter with these drugs is the dependence on it ,no its not addictive at all ,go do your studies ,how can injecting testosterone using a 23 g 1.5 inch needle be addictive .The effcts are addictive ,when you walk around in the gym ,you feel great the pump sensation is a very high feeling of raw power pumping in the veins .Yah ,and not to talk about the girls that tend to stick around you in the gym asking for advice , and no ,the myth that girls go crazy for bodies is not very true ,they look for intellect and most of all the size of the green muscle ,cash. It is very safe to cycle steroids ,using it for once then going cold turkey ,then using it again ,it beats training for years ,and dont believe what you hear about ppl gaining 10 kg of muscle by eating chicken breasts and mass gainer ,they never told you about the embaressment of having a friend to administer injections to their butt .Neither are the claims of aggressivness and empty headedness true ,steroid users are not dumb and do not hit ppl .Takes alot of knowledge to use ergogenic aids ,need lots of medical definitions or you end up with acne and gynocomastia and bleedin livers .Also they dont get aggressive easily most of your average user is just someone who likes his body sculpted but tired of hearin those hypocrites say no pain no gain .I have had many injuries when i romped the gym with the heaviest and the biggest meals with that mindset ,what i believe is that it is how bad you want it and what sacrifices you want to make . My girlfriend who is a very pious person and a very sweet innocent thing relly couldnt understand this point , i could gladly give up bodybuilding for her if she was willing to part some time just to spend with me ,so damn tired of having to rush around like crazy just to spend time when she couldnt even spare teabreak to talk over the phone .I was hoping to participate in the nationals this year if not for her presence in my life which is a good thing .I am confused though i seem over reliant on the drug ,whenever we have tiffs i would start stocking up a little bit of steroids till now i have a full arsenal of them and now that its real rocky and theres no commitment on her part i think i would distract myself for mths now ,but i hate to be reliant on ampules and pills .I would come clean eventually ,hopefully if theres something to stop for maybe get a clean job .And no i dont deal in steroids ,so just go befriend the largest guy with an ego to match and maybe he just kill you gently with his balckmarket prices .I am a steroid abuser ,so go ahead and sue me .</div>
