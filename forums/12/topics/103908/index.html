            <div class='col-md body'>True Veloren. Sometimes we forget that everyone has more than one side to them.<br><br>How do you think the term 'two-faced' was formed?<br><br>But returning to the topic.<br><br>I used to pity myself a lot. Why am i single? Why don't i have lots of friends? Why am i not handsome? Why am i not rich? (Though the ones that strikes me the hardest are the first two questions).<br><br>I thought about it a lot, and i end up coming out with low self esteem. I mean, to me, i'm a great guy, i treat everyone well, but why don't i receive many presents when its my birthday? (Which i later realised was because i don't buy much bday presents for others either)<br><br>I pitied myself until I found out there was really no point. I could pity myself for all I want, and no one will care. After all, this is my life. And I am the ultimate controller of my life (not forgetting God). If I donÂ’t do anything about it and just gripe and gripe, 5-10 years from now, IÂ’ll still be the same old me.<br><br>I also found out that with age, and some certain events (I had two friends committing suicide in just 2 years), my thoughts mellowed and I became much more confident.<br><br>I read in one post that people make the greatest changes at 16,18,21. I am inclined to agree. I have changed a lot at these stages, and continue to do so.<br><br>Just remember, if you start pitying yourself, there is no hope, for you cannot move at that stage. You need to get out.<br><br>I realise also that the greatest thing stopping you is motivation. Heck, itÂ’s the greatest things stopping <span style="color: darkred;">EVERYONE</span> from succeeding, I kid you not.<br><br>Some suggestions to motivate yourself would be:<br>1)	Exercise. Convince yourself that you want to be fit. Keep that  picture of you being strong in your mind. Do it alone if you canÂ’t get a friend.<br>2)	Pray. If youÂ’re religious enough to, it can really help.<br>3)	Read some self-help books, and act on it.<br>4)             Go see a counsellor, psychologist to help you.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*Attitude Is Everything...*<br><br>Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say. When someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, "If I were any better, I would be twins!"<br><br>He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed Jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.<br><br>Seeing this style really made me curious, so one day I went up to Jerry and asked him, "I don't get it! You can't be a positive person all of the time. How do you do it?" Jerry replied, "Each morning I wake up and say to myself, Jerry, you have two choices today. You can choose to be in a good mood or you can choose to be in a bad mood.' I choose to be in a good mood. Each time something bad happens, I can choose to be a victim or I can choose to learn from it. I choose to learn from it. Every time someone comes to me complaining, I can choose to accept their complaining or I can point out the positive side of life. I choose the positive side of life."<br><br>"Yeah, right, it's not that easy," I protested.<br><br>"Yes it is," Jerry said. "Life is all about choices. When you cut away all the junk, every situation is a choice. You choose how you react to situations. You choose how people will affect your mood. You choose to be in a good mood or bad mood. The bottom line: It's your choice how you live life."<br><br>I reflected on what Jerry said. Soon thereafter, I left the restaurant industry to start my own business. We lost touch, but often thought about him when I made a choice about life instead of reacting to it. Several years later, I heard that Jerry did something you are never supposed to do in a restaurant business: he left the back door open one morning and was held up at gunpoint by three armed robbers. While trying to open the safe, his hand,shaking from nervousness, slipped off the combination. The robbers panicked and shot him. Luckily, Jerry was found relatively quickly and rushed to the local trauma center. After 18 hours of surgery and weeks of intensive care, Jerry was released from the hospital with fragments of the bullets still in his body. I saw Jerry about six months after the accident. When I asked him how he was, he replied, "If I were any better, I'd be twins. Wanna see my scars?"<br><br>I declined to see his wounds, but did ask him what had gone through his mind as the robbery took place. "The first thing that went through my mind was that I should have locked the back door," Jerry replied. "Then, as I lay on the floor, I remembered that I had two choices: I could choose to live, or I could choose to die. I chose to live.<br><br>"Weren't you scared? Did you lose consciousness?" I asked.<br><br>Jerry continued, "The paramedics were great. They kept telling me I was going to be fine. But when they wheeled me into the emergency room and I saw the expressions on the faces of the doctors and nurses, I got really scared. In their eyes, I read, 'He's a dead man. " I knew I needed to take action."<br><br>"What did you do?" I asked.<br><br>"Well, there was a big, burly nurse shouting questions at me," said Jerry. "She asked if I was allergic to anything. 'Yes,' I replied. The doctors and nurses stopped working as they waited for my reply... I took a deep breath and yelled, 'Bullets!' Over their laughter, I told them, 'I am choosing to live. Operate on me as if I am alive, not dead."<br><br>Jerry lived thanks to the skill of his doctors, but also because of his amazing attitude. I learned from him that every day we have the choice to live fully. Attitude, after all, is everything.<br></div>

Sometimes i just feel damn inadequate. I dont think i am overdoing anythung, anything i do is just me, although different "me"s trying out different stuff.

But acting jerky to guys have the complete opposite effect.<br><br>We get sick and tired of you eventually, and erm, we get detracted from you. I believe that's the cause of it.<br><br>So if you stop acting jerky to guys, and start acting NORMAL instead of trying out your fullest potential all the time(which gets really tiring. I've been through this before.), i think you may be able to get at least someone who can talk to you.<br><br>Being local .. it may help a bit, but look at all the pple who's local and DON"T have friends. Its all a matter of approach. Being taller or brawnier is not going to help you have more friends at all.<br><br>In short, this bully-jerk facade has got to go, especially when you're talking with guys. There's no need to put up the mask when you're not using it. Sometimes it can backfire and scare away people, instead of attracting them.</div>

I personally feel that the cause of problem 1 is that the kids at your school are discriminating you, since you've mentioned that you have no problems communicating with other people.<br><br>That only shows that the problem doesn't lie in you, it's with THEM! Why should you put all the blame on yourself when the fault doesn't lie in you?<br><br>I think you're putting too much pressure on yourself. Remember, for the things that you can't control in life, don't be bothered about them. Your life will be less stressful that way! I'm a living example of that statement <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>In the past, I was very unhappy with myself as well because I wasn't handsome, nor was I tall. I became very self-conscious, and kept telling myself that I was the ugliest guy on Earth. But eventually, I came to realise that it was something I couldn't change, and that I was only making myself more and more depressed each day. I had to accept myself as the person I see in the mirror everyday, but there was something I could definitely do to reduce that depression.<br><br>I took steps to get a new hairstyle, got contact lens, got new clothes, learnt how to have a good conversation and how to bullshit with people. At least, when I look at myself in the mirror, I wouldn't feel so bad about myself.<br><br>Strangely, I grew to like myself more and more each day, and now, I love to look at myself in the mirror. I realised that I had less worries, and I wasn't as self-conscious as I was before.<br><br>Hope that helped! And trust me, you are not crazy.<br></div>

To aaron. How am i ever jerky to guys? I am naturally aggressive but not openly aggressive to guys, least not like my gangsta friends who keep asking if other ppl wanna fight with them. I actually get along well more with guys. As for my class, its coz they are always in the girls' cliques or their own cliques already forged within the 1st 3 months or cca cliques.<br><br>To verloreen. I appreciate ur advice. Its pretty much the same as what i have heard frequently. But sometimes i find it hard to accept, coz it just sounds so easy to accept that it cant be it, i think it must be me. My white friends keep telling me racist stuff like how people here are savage and i shouldnt wanna mix with them anyway, but it sounds so narrow and simple. Im not saying ur reasoning is like them, although it sounds simple. But then again.. local or white, whatever local friends i do have (WHO ACTUally tak to me cooly) they are cool with me, are from OUTSIDE school. So maybe its not me. Just confused.<br><br>Perhaps thats why i focus on my beloved crew; 3 guys, 1chinese, 1white, 1eurasian, all local, all not from my school. We all do parodies and get alone fine. Same with me and their other friends. And my friends from outside of school, and their friends of friends, like when we go to chalets and stuff, i mix pretty well and kp in contact with some of them. So i guess looking at it from that viewpoint maybe its not me entirely. ahhh well..<br></div>
