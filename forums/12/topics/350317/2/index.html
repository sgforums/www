              <p>Hey, although i'm only 16 but i think i already have a adult mindset. Since you don't wanna bad negative effect to happen, i can give you some advise but it might not work, but i do really want to help.. If i were you..</p>
              <p>Firstly, i would tell my wife all these thing so as to avoid her being angry and feeling i'm a jerk after we married. </p>
              <p>2ndly, since you know the "lady" know the boss, depending on how much they know each other, then you should decide whether to tell your boss. What i mean is, think first. If the boss treat that "lady" very well or whatever reasons, you might get fired or perhaps get him and "lady" angry.. I don't know how to explain myself in 2nd point, but i think you understand what i mean..</p>
              <p>Thirdly, do not ever REJECT someone especially a lady infront.. Since you know, lady gossip a lot, i don't mean all but most do. That "lady" might tell other people that how good she treat you and this is how you treat her back or mayb something like talking bad behind you..</p>
              <p>I think that is all the point i thought of now, there might be more if i think of later. Sorry for my broken english, i just wanna help you out :D </p>

              <p>Hi, thanks for your points. My manager is fair towards us. This is something which i'm glad to have such a manager. But i don't think this will leads to being sack.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, i do agree with you that girls are not to be offended even if they are in the wrong. Generally, they are simply too narrow-minded.</p>

              <p>i think you should seize the chance and screw her. really i do think that way if you can live with that.</p>
              <p>if you don't want to, you have to let her know you're married its not good for a married man to be with a girl this way, might spoil a girl's reputation.  Tell her you care for her don't want to spoil her reputation invite gossip.</p>
              <p>if after saying stuff like that she still don't want to stop then ho seh liao lor.she definitely wants you and willing fight with your wife for you. so before saying anything also must prepare rejection speech in case instead of warning her only become warning+rejection.</p>

              <p>Or perhaps it is she who is rather jovial....thats just her personality.</p>

              <p>So my own suspicion is that it is just a combination of personality, maybe you are a little fat and look jovial, and she likes to joke with you, thats all.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">As to any "confrontation" or "telling her to stop" , I seriously do not recommend you to take such an action, because it will be very awkward and will go down badly.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">At most what you can do is to be less responsive, put a cool face, and so on. After some time she will be developing some distance with you naturally.</span></p>

              <p>I'm not really jovial but i don't think i'm a boring person. Infact, i am serious when i'm at work. As for her, up to this stage, i don't know what kind of person she is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've been less responsive to her. I don't join in the conversation between her and my manager. I try to portray the image like "only talk business when working. No private matters." But sometimes, i do pass sarcastic remarks to her, hoping she will distance away from me.</p>

              Hi Hawk Eye,
              
              I think you can try telling her verbally to show some respect to you since you're already married and those actions such as having physical contacts are not acceptable. If she continues to behave this way, you should bring it up to the attention of your direct superior who is your dept manager. If your manager is biased against you, you can always report this matter to HR.

              I beg to differ. Hawk Eye is not make a fuss out of it. If it happens only once or twice, then she's probably foolish at the point in time. But if she continues to do that, it isn't acceptable and there is a limit on what we can tolorate. I am sure Hawk Eye's wife won't be happy about it either.

              <p>Not all female colleagues are alike.</p>
              <p>They can size you up instantly.</p>
              <p>The social ones get friendly immediately.</p>
              <p>The shy ones take some time to warm up to you.</p>
              <p>The vicious ones hate you because... they hate you.</p>
              <p>Which is preferable, one that likes your tummy, or one that hates your guts.</p>
              <p>As long as she is not making a pass at you, or trying to seduce you, its ok, just enjoy it and work happily. Don't do anything you shouldn't be doing.</p>

              <p>Hey, although i'm only 16 but i think i already have a adult
              mindset. Since you don't wanna bad negative effect to happen, i can
              give you some advise but it might not work, but i do really want to
              help.. If i were you..</p>
              <p>Firstly, i would tell my wife all these thing so as to avoid her
              being angry and feeling i'm a jerk after we married.</p>
              <p>2ndly, since you know the "lady" know the boss, depending on how
              much they know each other, then you should decide whether to tell
              your boss. What i mean is, think first. If the
              boss treat that "lady" very well or whatever reasons, you
              might get fired or perhaps get him and "lady" angry.. I don't
              know how to explain myself in 2nd point, but i think you understand
              what i mean..</p>
              <p>Thirdly, do not ever REJECT someone especially a lady
              infront.. Since you know, lady gossip a lot, i don't mean all
              but most do. That "lady" might tell other people that
              how good she treat you and this is how you treat her back or
              mayb something like talking bad behind you..</p>
              <p>I think that is all the point i thought of now, there might be
              more if i think of later. Sorry for my broken english, i just
              wanna help you out :D</p>

              <p>you're stupid for even suggesting that...do NOT tell your wife. It'll only make her jealous and angry that you're not doing anything. James Bond doesn't complain to his boss when someone is making him feel uncomfortable. Because ONE, nothing makes him feel uncomfortable. and TWO, he handles all his problems by himself.</p>
              <p>So settle this James Bond style. Look at her in the eyes and tell her to get away from you. Be serious - do not joke; do not smile.  Tell her that there's no way she's going to get you because you are happily married and she's not your type. If you want to take it up a notch, tell her she's ugly. She'll probably cry, but just give her a piece of tissue and send her on her way. If she becomes crazy and stalks you or tries to screw with your marriage life..THEN tell your wife. but be sure to mention everything that you did too. and constantly remind your wife that you love her. Simple as that. Remember, James Bond is every man's role model.</p>
              <p>this is not a joke...</p>
