              <p>If you say about cultural difference, its not that big difference from me cos she's an Indo-Chine. We're both asians and asians are more conservative compared to westerners.</p>

              <p>In the end, i did not confront her about this. I just gives her the cold shoulder instead.</p>

              <p>Hi Hawk Eye,</p>
              <p>I think you can try telling her verbally to show some respect to you since you’re already married and those actions such as having physical contacts are not acceptable. If she continues to behave this way, you should bring it up to the attention of your direct superior who is your dept manager. If your manager is biased against you, you can always report this matter to HR.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Tell her verbally ah? Guess i can't be that harsh to a girl....</p>
              <p>However, i did mentioned to my manager about me not comfortable with her closeness. My manager did not say much and did not take that as an issue cos he knows her before she joins us.</p>

              <p>No, i cannot say she ugly but she is not pretty too.</p>
              <p>I've confirmed this with some fellow males that when we claim a girl's beauty, there are most certainty that we are talking about the same kind of standard normal guys would pay attention to.</p>
              <p>But it does not applies to her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our chairman's wife dun like girls who wear really short skirts but she did! And although short skirts may be sexy to some girls but i wanna puke when i walk behind her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And she likes to wear high heels too. But somehow it looks funny when she walk with her heels. Not like those typical OLs with high heels that walks confidently.</p>

              <p>... maybe you can put your marriage photo frame of you with your wife, BIG one... Or when she's starting to do something (that you find quite harrasing that you really can't stand of)...  then you can call your wife (or pretend to do so) in front of her... until she's bored, feeling ignored and leaving...  it will 'turn her off' (I meant... something like discourage her to distract you further), and hopefully... visiting your desk less often... (because she thinks that you're 'getting more occupied to your wife' than 'entertaining' her)... </p>
              <p>It shows to your colleagues also... that in case anything happen in the future, like she's accusing you that you had been flirting to her (beware... it seriously might happen if turned out that she has hidden intentions)... then you can prove your innocence... Remember again that man always be the first to take the blame in any marital dispute... </p>

              <p>If one day, you got the chance to mix with her together with her friends.. you can observe her carefully...</p>
              <p>...Does she being that friendly (touchy freely etc) to her other friends too? If yes then no worries, it's just her friendliness nature... If not, then in my opinion I think she's 'really' interested to you (physically) on your chubbiness... and she finds you're attractive even further, becoz you're being a challenge to her... as simple as that... </p>

              <p>Just act normal, do u know that u are noticing her every actions and behaviour. U are subconsciously cheating on ur wife. Just that ur wife is polite enough not to state it and she appreicate ur honesty and tell her the situation u are facing.</p>
              <p>if you cannot, ask for a transfer to another department. Tell ur wife to confront her! Since she already know it! If can , ask your wife to give her a slap on the face to tell her to wake up.</p>
              <p>Destroy her repeautition! hahhahaha!!! Give her some punishement! Send people to rape her!! LOL! --&gt; dun do it , scare her can already!</p>
