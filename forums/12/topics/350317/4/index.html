              <p>Hi, i felt that i got harassed by the new female colleague. Can anyone teach me how to shoo her off?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You see, i just got married, just changed a job. Then one month after i joined the company, theres this indonesian chinese gal who joins the company and is in my department. She knew my manager before she joined the company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As of today, she joins the company barely for two weeks but on alot of occassions, her actions, gestures indicates that she wants to be close to me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
              <p>- She "stupidly" ask me why am i so fat, got tummy. And answers herself that, "on nevermind, since you are married and does not bother anymore about physical appearances"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- When she can't finished her food, she ask me to finished it for her (using her used utensils).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- When she's bored, she comes to my desk, stand closely behind my chair. And on 2 occassions, i felt that her breast touches my shoulder. Which means she stands very close to me. So if i turn over, my face might just hit her breast!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Then she asked if my wife got mind anything about my tummy. I said no, my wife will only carasses it. So she said that, since my wife "sayang" my tummy, she will hit/pat my tummy lor. So, during lunch, she would just hit my tummy for fun. As if i've known her for long, even when manager is with us during lunch time!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Then theres some plastic bags or boxes on my table, she would just open it up and see whats inside. So rude right? So i just said to her "must you open up anything and see?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- Today she gave me a tupperware of indonesian beef rendang made by her auntie. At first she said that she wanted to give it to the manager but the manager rejected and said that he had eaten before. Hence she gave me. So, is the rendang really for the manager or for me?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I felt that she should learn how to respect her male colleagues especially when one is married. There were two other male colleagues which was her university classmates but she don't treat them like this. Why me? How come me? Its not that i'm rich nor i'm good looking. Somemore i'm married!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Aren't she's ashamed of herself?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She is only 25 this yr, single and complains about no boyfriend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Can anyone teach me how to stop this kind of harassement? Of course, i dont' want to be that fierce to insult her or be mean to her. But how can i make it known to her that i don't want all these attention and i'm married?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Note: I only appreciates good advices. If your "advice" was meant to be a joke, asking me to seize this chance and screw her, then you'll be automatically ignored.</span></p>

              <p>You already know the answer in your mind! You need to be fierce to her and insult her, if she does not stop it, tell of the manager. A girl must know how to behave herself and protect her.</p>
              <p>She does not have bf, so u pity her! Shit u! That's is stupid of u. She is in the unmarried field, still have other suitors.</p>
              <p>You should pity your wife! She is marry to u! OMG! What mindset u have? No bf , go marriage consultant , tell pple to matchmake her!</p>
              <p>Anyways , stop behave like a wimp and try to have affair in office! u are a asshole! That what i can say!</p>
              <p>Sorry for that remark. That what I feel. you are putting urself into fire! That girl is a Slut! Trying to break a happy marriage. u should spend time with u wife and try have friendship with u! if that cannot, state u reason!</p>
