            <div class='col-md body'>well, what do you people do when this happens?<br><br>:  you were so close with this guy. you chatted on the phone almost everyday with him. sms too. the two of you chatted about almost everything under the sun. he told you about his ex, and you told him yours. both of you likes to talk about couples and stuffs. he told you he wants to find a stead, and you told him you wanted one too. (you dunno if thats a hint or wat) and you started to forget about your ex and your miserable past. only then you realised you've fallen for that guy and began to feel that talking to him is a pleasure, and you're very very happy..<br><br>and you have the thinking that he likes you a little teeny weensy bit, perhaps. and one day, his old computer was being repaired. he's back to playing games and finds no time and no need to talk on the phone with you. but when he needs something for his game, he looks for you. and asked you to play with him, let him kill, so that he can have those "golds" and buy items. and you did so willingly.<br><br>you thought of it as "Xing Fu" because you can play with him. even if its wasting time everyday just for him to kill you in game is a kind of happiness, which you later realised that you're rather "being used" and had been a fool. you cried in the middle of the night, just thinking about how nice it was before he had his computer repaired. you cried just thinking about him. you cried thinking about those happy times. you cried cause you're scared, "what if i fall for the wrong guy again..." you told yourself you're gonna hate this guy. even your friends encourage you to do so.<br><br>then one day, his computer breaks down, he's so bored, he sms you. he asked you for a chat on the phone. you forgot all your "im a fool", "im going to hate him" and "being used" thinkings and immediately jumped next to the phone, waiting for his call. and when the call comes, you were feeling very excited and happy. but, there's nth left in mind to talk about. there was this uncomfortable silence. your mind were rushing like mad to think of things to talk about, but failed. and that seems to be the last phone call from him.<br><br>and now, when you sms him, all his replies are never longer than a sentence. its all the same. eg. "Ok" "Ya" "Lol" "Oic" its not even a line...now, you wish he'll ask you to join his game and let him kill, but its impossible. he has already got his complete set of items. there's no need for you anymore...he doesnt sms you or call you like the past. its like being ignored totally...<br><br>you've also realised, you cannot forget him. you tried. but his face, his voice, his everything still appears in your mind. you wish you can go out with him during christmas. and you know this is possible before his computer was repaired. but now, it seems impossible... and whats worse, next year you're gonna be in the same class as him... you know this is only a crush. and yet you still miss him greatly, you know you still yearn for his phonecall, you still miss his voice, you know you really really need and miss him very badly...but things are never going to be the same anymore...distance between you and him are drifting further and further away each day. you tried not to sms him, hoping that he'll sms you. but it never happens, and it never will. haisss...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

He knows that you are a good friend - a good friend to a man is always there regardless of how little time spend to upkeep them. He loves to play games - he wants to get something out from the game with your help. You agreed. He sees things black and white - therefore he simply feels that you are helping him in spirit of friendship.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You, being a girl, are taught by nature to look beyond the surface. You see the grey area in the midst of black and white. You are his good friend, and of course, you hate playing games or 'making used' by him because he DOESN'T return this favor through the extra sms/calls/etc. (Please read above paragraph and you would understand that its NORMAL for him because he only sees things straight black and white) You like him, no doubt and pinned on him to do things that could make your entire day happy, yet you keep mum about your expression.<br><br>How would he know?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Its time to work out a plan to express your long-felt feelings to him. It may or may not work, depending on how you do it and probably the actual liking he may or may not have. Stop all this waiting for this phone call when in reality, he doesn't have to call you, cause in the first place, why must he? You have change the variable to 'you have a right to request' and not to wait aimlessly.<br><br>P.S: Are you a Scorpio or a Taurus? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

(you dunno if thats a hint or wat) and you started to forget about your ex and your miserable past. only then you realised you've fallen for that guy and began to feel that talking to him is a pleasure, and you're very very happy..<br><br>and you have the thinking that he likes you a little teeny weensy bit, perhaps. and one day, his old computer was being repaired. he's back to playing games and finds no time and no need to talk on the phone with you. but when he needs something for his game, he looks for you. and asked you to play with him, let him kill, so that he can have those "golds" and buy items. and you did so willingly.<br><br>you thought of it as "Xing Fu" because you can play with him. even if its wasting time everyday just for him to kill you in game is a kind of happiness, which you later realised that you're rather "being used" and had been a fool. you cried in the middle of the night, just thinking about how nice it was before he had his computer repaired. you cried just thinking about him. you cried thinking about those happy times. you cried cause you're scared, "what if i fall for the wrong guy again..." you told yourself you're gonna hate this guy. even your friends encourage you to do so.<br><br>then one day, his computer breaks down, he's so bored, he sms you. he asked you for a chat on the phone. you forgot all your "im a fool", "im going to hate him" and "being used" thinkings and immediately jumped next to the phone, waiting for his call. and when the call comes, you were feeling very excited and happy. but, there's nth left in mind to talk about. there was this uncomfortable silence. your mind were rushing like mad to think of things to talk about, but failed. and that seems to be the last phone call from him.<br><br>and now, when you sms him, all his replies are never longer than a sentence. its all the same. eg. "Ok" "Ya" "Lol" "Oic" its not even a line...now, you wish he'll ask you to join his game and let him kill, but its impossible. he has already got his complete set of items. there's no need for you anymore...he doesnt sms you or call you like the past. its like being ignored totally...<br><br>you've also realised, you cannot forget him. you tried. but his face, his voice, his everything still appears in your mind. you wish you can go out with him during christmas. and you know this is possible before his computer was repaired. but now, it seems impossible... and whats worse, next year you're gonna be in the same class as him... you know this is only a crush. and yet you still miss him greatly, you know you still yearn for his phonecall, you still miss his voice, you know you really really need and miss him very badly...but things are never going to be the same anymore...distance between you and him are drifting further and further away each day. you tried not to sms him, hoping that he'll sms you. but it never happens, and it never will. haisss...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  </div></blockquote>so you have fallen for an immature computer game geek who is insensitive, inconsiderate and thinks of nothing but his stupid computer games??
