            <div class='col-md body'>Looks like many folks here are into the concept of demonising sex. You can have a great relationship without sex and do end up with a breakup. You can have great sex without a strong relational bond and also end up breaking off from the other party. It goes both ways, and demonising sex gives a slanted view towards one end.</div>

How do you know that they are strong in their own relationship while you are not in their shoes?<br><br>While I disagree that pre-marital sex enhances a non-married relationship, the reason being, premarital sex can cause complication and confusions to stir up within a relationship between the couple. Even if one takes precaution by using contraceptives, they are not always safe.<br><br>In the end, it would mostly result in complications like the couple being surrounded by early-pregnancy issues, unwanted pregnancy issues, unknown illnesses, untackled issues, resentments, guilt and doubts. Some would even end up being in a shotgun marriage. Do you think they like it this way? Maybe they do, maybe they have no choice. But what about the remaining days living together?
