            <div class='col-md body'>I heard a story of a guy from Malaysia Radio station that his gf with him for  2 yrs cheated on him by having sex with a guy ,know less than 3 months. his gf lose her virginity to during that flirt!<br><br>The guy was very angry cos he is a virgin too and he complain to the DJ that how can his gf give so easily of her virginity! The DJ shoot back at the guy and asking him ,did he ask her gf for her first time. The guy was stunned and keep quiet for sometime during the air! Then he asking for advice whether to forgive his gf anot.....<br><br>I think the guy is naive for 2 yrs never ask for sex with his gf. In the end,another guy claim her away and the guy still a virgin. To me,it was like 'WTF?'.<br><br>It is good to stay virgin until marriage ,provided u r very sure both will really keep their promise. But advise to all guys in r/s is, 'Just do it!'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Maybe the playboy who play his gf knows she is her virgin and decided to lay his hands on her. If he knows she is not virgin,playboy may not be interested on her!</div>

The DJ shoot back at the guy and asking him ,did he ask her gf for her first time. The guy was stunned and keep quiet for sometime during the air! Then he asking for advice whether to forgive his gf anot.....<br><br>I think the guy is naive for 2 yrs never ask for sex with his gf. In the end,another guy claim her away and the guy still a virgin. To me,it was like 'WTF?'.<br><br>It is good to stay virgin until marriage ,provided u r very sure both will really keep their promise. But advise to all guys in r/s is, 'Just do it!'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Maybe the playboy who play his gf knows she is her virgin and decided to lay his hands on her. If he knows she is not virgin,playboy may not be interested on her!</div></blockquote>Your purpose seems good. You seem to have ok intent... BUT your way of enforcing your purpose and intent seems to take a turn not many like it.<br><br>Its like you wanna confirm the car is yours, you spray paint your name under the car bonnet to make sure it is yours.<br><br>Pre-marital sex... too much is at stake. Not a wise choice, but how many can wait till after marriage?</div>

But I believe that virginity is a very precious and sacred thing a girl has. And if she gives it away so easily, that shows how cheap she is.<br><br>No offence but I think that one should wait till after marriage before bringing sex into the picture. I'm a guy, and I don't need to bed my current gf to secure her love for me. I know I'm secured enough and we are still very much in love with each other.<br><br>Having sex will not secure a relationship. Love does! Sex is only part of the after-marriage relationship. If every guy thinks like you do (having only sex in the mind without considering commitment, love, faith, trust in a relationship etc) then sad to say, they will eventually be in for a very painful and angry breakup, either sooner or later.<br><br>Again, I have to stress, that people without maturity should NOT be in a relationship. Not trying to give a lecture here but, since so much had happened to me in the past and cos of my experiences, I'm totally against pre-marital sex. </div></blockquote>strongly agree! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
