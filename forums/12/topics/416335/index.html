              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Certainly, it must have been a shocking to any partner on the receiving end for such devastating news. For a gay person to engage in a heterosexual relationship is actually quite common as the revelation will sink in after they realized that they are not sexually attracted to their partner, which will spark a reflective, introspection journey that end up with your kind of conclusion.</p>
              <p>I think your relationship with her will eventually deplete its meaning because this new found knowledge about yourself will make this equation an error, serving nobody's needs.</p>
              <p>Telling her honestly will likely to be met with denial and bitterness. You must anticipate that pain is inevitable - it depends on how swift the cut you want to deliver, instead of dragging this doom relationship further into some illusion of grandeur. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>I am with her for 3 years already and she thinks we will get married. But after this relationship with her I found out that I’m gay and I’m very sure now. She is a stunning beauty but I can’t seem to get on bed with her each time she suggests we do it I tried but I have little feeling compared to when I fantasize about guys. I still love my gf but I feel it’s not fair to lead her on since I am sure of my sexual orientation now. How should I tell her this?</p>

              <p>I’m not sissy but very metrosexual. Some says I look Korean but I have viet blood in me and half chinese. I always make it a point to trim it eyebrows and make sure my hair is in place before going out and often I go for facials and sensual massages. My hair is long for a guy and it’s silky straight and nice colour. My gf thinks I care too much about my appearance but she’s like that too. I recently seen a counciler to discuss about my sexual orientation this is how I knew I am gay.</p>
