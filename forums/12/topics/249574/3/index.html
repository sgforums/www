            <div class='col-md body'>I think you are mostly hurt becoz of the lies she told you, doesn't matter that her intentions are good. A lie is a lie, it hurts like any other lies. Third parties like us can suggest that she was trying not to hurt you, but a lie is a lie, it breaks your heart. I had been lied to, so I understand how you feel. You rather people to tell u the truth, get upset about it and move on, rather than get lied to and harbour false hopes, this hurts 10 times more.<br><br>I think what you will learn from this experience is learn to pick out the truths and the lies. It will make u a more savvy and intelligent person. Just dont let such an incident make you into a skeptical person. It should strengthen you, not worsen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by UsedKill:</div><div class="quote_body">Here's what happened(brief summary).<br><br>I met this girl during attachment and she would frequently talk to me through emails, etc. We soon exchanged hp numbers and we would sms each other alot.<br>She had bf problems, she said he was quite abusive and stuff and would confide in me. I asked her why she told me all this things, she said it was because she felt that she could trust me. I offered to help her. Once I went to accompany her when she left her bf house, but she couldn't take it and went back a day later. Anyway a few days later she found out that I liked her but she did not get angry, only asked me to find out more about her first because rushing into a relationship is not good, I agreed fully.<br><br>The next day she told me her bf broke up with her. I was happy of course. And over the weeks, we would hang out, I gradually fell in love with her, I asked whether she had feelings for me, she replied she saying "abit" but she needed to get over her ex bf stuff first. We would exchanged many smses, some mushy ones, she told me she felt lucky to be loved by me and was lucky to have me. But one day she became very cold towards me, she would not reply to most of my smses. I asked her about what was going on, she replied that she had family problems, I offered to help her but she said that her family only wanted her to be with people they trust. I accepted it. Still, I felt there was something wrong, I asked her about it, but she stuck to what she said, I decided not to bother her and let her deal with her own problems first.<br><br>A couple of weeks later, she said she had to go overseas for a month or two to settle some stuff. I wished her well and anxiously waited for her return.<br>Two weeks later, I was bored and decided to see if I could find her blog on a blogsite. I found it, and it was a blog that she started with another guy.<br><br>I was shocked, horrified, totally shattered. Apparently she did not break up with her bf after all and it was only after she got together wtih this guy(an old friend I think whom she didn't contact for a long time I think) only then did she went to settle things with her bf. When she got together with this guy, it was around the same time she started becoming cold towards me. Oh ya, apparently she went overseas for two days only.I was taken for a fool for a whole month not knowing what was going on. In fact I was fooled from the very start because she did not actually break up with her bf, either that or she went back to him without telling me. I confronted her about this through sms, she told me it was a decision made by her parents and a relative. Her mother did not approve of her becoming close to me and her mother loved the new guy.<br><br>Now thinking back about what she said. It really meant nothing at all. Words with no substance. She took me for a total fucking fool, made use of my good will. I was just a spare tyre after all. Gave me half truths when I asked her for an explanation, pushing blame to her parents. Now I find it hard to even believe whatever she said about her bf. I'm taking this as a valuable lesson not to trust people so easily, especially people who come up to me with problems. I have finally seen the duality of people's personality.... Sickening people, pretentious, double headed snakes.<br></div></blockquote>Yeah treat this as a harsh lesson. Sometimes, being a good guy is a bad thing...<br><br>The fact that you infatuate with that girl so quickly was your fault too..don't you think so? that's why love in this type of thing is soo...easily manipulate..<br><br></div>
