The chances of you getting that girl is just as good as the other guys she knows. </strong></div></blockquote>He has said he would have been ok with the girl wanting to choose to be with someone else. Point here is how she lied about things and wasn't honest with TS. I know it's not going to be easy to tell someone else they are not the one, but one thing is for sure is she could have handled it better. Don't blindly defend a girl you don't know just because you're a lady yourself.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>I know most guys in such situation thinks they are the Knight in Shining armor.<br>The protector of the weak, and therefore have access to priviledges other guys do not get. 10% true. </blockquote></div>This is really gross generilisation, can't say very much beyond that. And also, you are making the wrong assumption that TS is this kind of guy in the first place.<br><br><strong>[quote]But unfortunately, girls typically won't show their true knight in shining armor how psychotic she really is with her rantings of her ex or watnot.</strong>This part is typically quite true, girls/ladies/women never feel comfortable talking about an ex with someone they truly like. There's friends you talk about your bf with, and there's bf potential. Kinda seperate there.<br><br>But going back to the overall picture, you getting it wrong about the TS wanting to have 'special access' and 'special privilege'. I think he mentioned enough in his starting post to show that it's not losing the girl that really bugs him, it's how she handled it. I don't think I need to point out how exactly this is shown but I think you should read that first post carefully again before making wrong conclusions and assumptions again.</div>

Ppl can tell u everything and anything, paint the picture beautifully for you, but u can never be certain they meant what they said. Sometimes ppl can say things because at that point of time they felt really good about it, but in another time, they may not think so. These days ppl have many choices for their partners, u shouldn't take relationships too seriously, not especially at ur age. we are not living in our parents times. get married at 21 or younger and that's it for life.</div>

You know what type of girls to avoid now. What I can deduce from this is she is making you wait as a spare tyre so actually you should not wait and don't rush into the confession so fast as well. I won't be surprised if she calls you again when her abusive bf dumps her or whatever.<br><br>The lesson here to learn is that while waiting go date other girls as well. This way, you don't waste time and/or energy thinking about her.<br><br>doko</div>

I want to make it clear that I would respect her decision fully(though of course I would be sad for a while) if she told me she loves the other guy and wants to be with him.
