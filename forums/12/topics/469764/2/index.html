              <p>best he could try work at supermarket like ntuc or shop and save
              to earn $$$.it pays the bills than folks labeling him permanently
              as lazy etc etc..Worse he could do is end up as a supervisor at a
              petrol station after werking years there!</p>
              <p>As an american u shouldnt say this to  your fellow
              sporeans.....he may be weak and needs help which only the strong
              and brilliant can provide.</p>
              <p> sporean isnt nazism where the weak is based on surviviale
              of the fittest.there is still an asian influence based on good,bad
              and kindness in this otherwise imperfect and flawed world which is
              far from fair.</p>

              <p>What is HotelPartTimeJob.com.sg?</p>
              <p><em>HotelPartTimeJob.com.sg</em> is a portal set-up by the <em>Singapore Hotel Association (SHA)</em> with the support of the <em>Employment and Employability Institute (e2i)</em> for casual labour in the hotel industry. The portal, which is 
              administered by SHA, focuses on matching casual workers* to ad hoc and 
              short term assignments available in hotels. One of the objectives of the
               portal is to provide opportunities to those who have the passion but 
              are not able to take up full-time and permanent part-time positions due 
              to current commitments. The portal also gives one the opportunity to 
              earn some money, while the hotel industry benefits by having a ready 
              pool of casual workers.  <br> <br> <em>* Casual workers are defined as those hired to work on an as-and-when-required basis and are paid by the hour.</em></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><br><br>What is the difference between HotelPartTimeJob.com.sg and any other manpower agency portal?<br><br>1. This portal is Singapore’s first casual jobs website managed by an industry association – the Singapore<br><br>    Hotel Association (SHA).<br><br>2. Only casual jobs from local hotels are offered through this portal.<br><br>3. HotelPartTimeJob.com.sg allows you to indicate the days and periods in which you are available for<br><br>    work. This allows you to plan the work around your lifestyle and current commitments.<br><br>4. The portal only focuses on short-term and ad hoc job assignments, otherwise known as casual work.<br><br>For Candidate Users<br><br>How do I sign up as a Candidate User?<br><br>To create a Candidate account, please follow the steps below:<br><br>1. Click the Registration / Join us on the top right corner of the Home Page.<br><br>2. Complete the online registration form. Click Submit.<br><br>3. Once your account has been approved, you can start using HotelPartTimejob.com.sg and receive job<br><br>    invitation whenever there is a suitable job match. <br><br>How many hours do I need to work per job order?<br><br>It would depend on the job orders submitted by the hotels. However, each job order is likely to be between 4 to 8 hours. <br><br>What is the job requirement?<br><br>Each job order would have its own specific requirement. However, the general requirements are as follows:<br><br>- To be able to be on your feet for at least 4 hours<br><br>- To have a passion in service<br><br>- No experience is required<br><br>- Able to speak English <br><br>If I register now, when will I receive my first job invitation?<br><br>It would depend on the job order available, and whether it matches your stated<br>“Preferred Working Availability”. If you are available for most of the periods, there is a higher chance of being successfully matched. <br><br>How am I notified of a job order?<br><br>If there is a suitable job match, you will receive notification either via email and/or sms, depending on your indicated ‘Notifications’ preference. <br><br>How do I express my interest for a Job Order?<br><br>To express your interest for the job order, please login and go under the Job Invitation tab and click Express Interest. <br><br>You may also call SHA at Tel: 6513 0233 to express your interest for the job. <br><br>How do I know if I have been selected for the Job Order after I have expressed my interest?<br><br>You will be contacted by the hotels directly. You can also click on My Job Schedule to view your allocated job order(s). <br><br>When am I requested to rate my job order experience?<br><br>Please rate your job order experience within 7 days from the Job End Date of each confirmed job. <br><br>How soon can I get paid after completing the job order?<br><br>Different hotels would have varying payment policies. The hotel will advise on their payment policy when the job assignment is confirmed. <br><br>Where can I download the User Guide for this portal?<br><br>At the homepage, click ‘Download’ at the top menu bar, and download the user guide for candidates.</p></div>

              <p>Although you are aimless now but you need to find what actually your dream or goal. Even something that you really want to do. </p>
              <p>No point to post in here, let people bombard on you an yet NO ACTION taken from yourself. Time fly and what ever pass cannot come back.</p>
              <p>I believe you should find someone who able to motivate you and push you out of comfort zone. Otherwise you might have to change yourself and find positive people to advise you, it might help.</p>

               u made a mistake, just admit it and move on instead of making up

              <p>by the way, the battle of stalingrad didnt start in 1940... its 1942....</p>
              <p>u r real unlucky as well - i like history and know a lot about it</p>
              <p>since you are acting like such a retard right now, one cant help but wonder why....</p>

              <p>Still afraid of interviewer asking you question?</p>
              <p>Then be your own boss. Be a self-employed person.</p>
              <p>Feng Zengkun – Straits Times<br><br><strong>Singapore.</strong> A new generation of Singapore hawkers will get training under a formal program that the government is keen to co-fund.</p>
              <p>The Workforce Development Agency (WDA) has called for bids to set up a
               new hawker training center here, The Straits Times understands. If the 
              proposals are feasible, it will shortlist candidates by July.</p>
              <p>In a tender exercise that opened in March and closed earlier this 
              month, WDA highlighted the need to “build a pipeline of skilled hawkers 
              in anticipation of the 10 new hawker centers to be built within the next
               decade.”</p>
              <p>Under the proposed scheme, WDA could subsidize the cost of setting up
               the school and course fees, and also help market the program to 
              Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>In return, the operator of the school is expected to set aside places
               for new and local entrants to the trade and help its graduates find and
               keep jobs within the food industry.</p>
              <p>The WDA would not say how many bids were submitted but at least one 
              social enterprise, Dignity Kitchen, has confirmed it has applied to be 
              given the chance.</p>
              <p>“Nobody is capturing the knowledge of hawkers now, and we should, 
              because the hawker food here is something that is uniquely Singapore,” 
              said Koh Seng Choon, executive director of Project Dignity, which helps 
              disadvantaged people, as well as those with disabilities.</p>
              <p>The scheme to provide a complete course — and certification — for 
              hawkers is a first and will be a boost to a sector facing the twin 
              onslaught of air-conditioned food courts dishing out food cooked in 
              centralized kitchens and ageing hawkers who are closing shop.</p>
              <p>The agency’s move is part of a larger effort to beef up the tourism 
              and food and beverage workforce here, in anticipation of the opening of 
              upcoming attractions like Gardens by the Bay and the International 
              Cruise Terminal.</p>
              <p>An expert panel set up by the government last year to look into the 
              new food centers had also called for a culinary institute to help 
              experienced hawkers here pass on their skills.</p>
              <p>Food experts are not short on ideas for the best recipe for success.</p>
              <p>Food consultant K. F. Seetoh said it should equip aspiring hawkers 
              here with kitchen skills such as chopping techniques and the basics of 
              say, getting the amount of sambal and vinegar right in bak chor mee.</p>
              <p>But the school should also aim to create the cream of the next street food hawkers, he added — ‘the superstars’.</p>
              <p>Project Dignity’s Mr Koh said his proposal also includes a 
              demonstration kitchen to simulate a hawker stall. This would help 
              students understand what is required for a grade A under the National 
              Environment Agency’s guidelines for hawker stalls.</p>
              <p>It would also set aside places for people with disabilities and other disadvantaged people, in keeping with the group’s vision.</p>
              <p>Not everyone is convinced a school will work.</p>
              <p>“Good street food is very subjective. How do you determine whose 
              recipe the school should teach?” said Mr Perry Ong, chief executive of 
              NTUC Foodfare, a social enterprise here which operates a chain of 
              foodcourts.</p>
              <p>Food industry experts added that the school may have an uphill task getting brand-name hawkers to divulge their secrets.</p>
              <p>Seetoh said: “Some hawkers protect their recipes to their deaths, 
              while some may not know how to teach. Other hawkers don’t even know what
               it is about their recipes that gives them the edge.”</p>
              <p>Mr Ong added: “The younger generation may also not be willing to 
              become hawkers because it is a hard life, and not all hawkers are 
              successful.”<br><em><br>Reprinted courtesy of Straits Times</em></p>

              <p>Please la stop scolding him. As if scolding him will help him..only making him feel more worthless....He is here to seek help.....</p>
              <p>He isn't the only one in this position..don't be surprised but ALOT of other people are too, some worst off..there are still people who are 30 and getting degrees so they can start work....</p>
              <p>As people have already mentioned, your best bet would be to start from scratch and be humble. Try private sector companies....</p>
              <p>Leave your pride at the doorstep...</p>
              <p>If future employees ask you what have you been doing for 9 years, just tell them the truth BUT end off with a resolution..that you are ready to start a new..</p>
              <p>Don't be discourage if u send in multiple resumes and get rejected. It is obvious you're in a disadvantage but its a numbers game really....Nobody here can predict what type of employees employers are looking for...some employers could be looking for less qualified employees but with lower wages to make their balance book look good at the end of the year.......</p>
              <p>Jump at any opportunity you can get ok?</p>
              <p>Meanwhile what are u doing currently? Nothing? My advice is just get any random job at the mean time to help shape your attitude and getting used to work life..could be anything from sales person to 7 eleven to petrol kisok or even learning a skill as a hawker apprentice ...insurance agent.........or just so some social work la to earn good 'karma"</p>

              <p>As you can observe,MOST singaporeans in spore obviously do not intend to help BUT MAKE THINGS  WORSE.</p>
              <p>WHEN THEY SEE U SOMEWHERE,,,they start calling u foul names and start tearing u apart and eating u like some demented zombie who craves human flesh.</p>
              <p>From the above ,u will notice they do not intend to spare u even for the slightest mistake. Try to get a job with good kind people around if u were scared off from the sight of them for almost a decade.</p>
