              <p>What do you mean you don't have a job ? You do.</p>
              <p>Your profession is being a leech... your mom works for you, for free.</p>
              <p>The question is , do you want to work for someone ? Answer: you don't.</p>
              <p>As long as you have no bills to pay.. easy money to spend.. you arn't gonna find a job.</p>
              <p>The only way.. is to wait for your mom to die... when the money runs out , you may perhaps see the value of keeping a long term job.</p>
              <p>But for the moment... you are quite comfy where you are right now.</p>

              think of what you want to do for your career...try out something first...if not right, then switch till you find the right one, rather than sitting at home loafing around and leeching on your mum.
              
              there are plenty of entry level jobs out there, be it accounts job, admin job, marketing job, sales job....
              
              just do something worthwhile and don;t waste your life away like that.  else one day you will find yourself too lazy to find yourself a job anymore.  that will be too late.
              
              i am sure you can find a job.  it is a matter of choice.

              <p>At this point in time I don't think you have much choice. Ideally you might want to be an engineer but without the relaxant experience and the gap of 9 years, what you are looking for might not come easily.</p>
              <p>if I'm you, I'll take up whoever is willingly to offer me, even service jobs like waiters and crew at MacDonalds. You'll be able to work up to become captains or floor managers. You might also want to consider joining uniform service like prison officers or security specialist at Cisco and such.</p>

              <p>i would try fast food outlets if cant get into nice cushy job in electronics....they tend to promote people with diploma faster.</p>

              <p>is not a fool.if i were a fool.....i would be dead by now.</p>
              <p>now lets discuss this kid with 9 years lapse shall we??</p>
              <p>what would your solution be?what should he tell the interviewer?????it wont be easy covering up unless he has proof such as in business or even product he is doing for years ..show documented proof using a video or photo if interviewer insists.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>lame lies???well they are not lies if he did any one of them.holding down a job is tough in spore where employers are spoilt for choice.in most cases violence works best in most sporean werkplaces unfortunately.</p>
              <p>as an adult he should choose his path and think of his own excuses.....lies n excuses are different altogether.he should start from scratch as a fresh diploma holder and even lower his expectations of salary to most singaporean jobseeker dismay.</p>

              <p>best he could try work at supermarket like ntuc or shop and save to earn $$$.it pays the bills than folks labeling him permanently as lazy etc etc..Worse he could do is end up as a supervisor at a petrol station after werking years there!</p>
              <p>As an american u shouldnt say this to  your fellow sporeans.....he may be weak and needs help which only the strong and brilliant can provide.</p>
              <p> sporean isnt nazism where the weak is based on surviviale of the fittest.there is still an asian influence based on good,bad and kindness in this otherwise imperfect and flawed world which is far from fair.</p>
