I usually see them walking side by side with their girls. The relatives I have who used to carry their then girlfriends (now wives) bags are now in their 50's and 60's and they're still walking hand-in-hand, still carrying their wives handbags and going for romantic afternoon movie dates.<br><br>If a guy carrying his girl's handbag during their courtship is any indication of a romantic, loving lifelong mate, "wimp" is the last thing that should be used to describe such a person, esp with the escalating rate of divorces these days.<br></div>

How many of you have experience knowing a gal/guy who have the look that impressed you but after you get to know him/her for some time, you begin to find his/her look becoming not as impressive as before?  Even he/she did not change at all.<br><br>Again how many of you have experience knowing a gal/guy who look arent impressive to you at all but after you get to know him/her for some time, you begin to find his/her look becoming more and more impressive?  Again he/she did not change at all.<br><br>I believe look is more of a mind thing.  You may found one fat woman who you feel look like shit, but to someone else she could be the beauty he is seeking.  I even think that situation can change someone point of looking at looks.  I can still remember the first day after I have being release from my confinment for 2 week in BMT, even the old auntie also look nice to me.<br><br>Regards</div>

How many of you have experience knowing a gal/guy who have the look that impressed you but after you get to know him/her for some time, you begin to find his/her look becoming not as impressive as before?  Even he/she did not change at all.<br><br>Again how many of you have experience knowing a gal/guy who look arent impressive to you at all but after you get to know him/her for some time, you begin to find his/her look becoming more and more impressive?  Again he/she did not change at all.<br><br>I believe look is more of a mind thing.  You may found one fat woman who you feel look like shit, but to someone else she could be the beauty he is seeking.  I even think that situation can change someone point of looking at looks.  I can still remember the first day after I have being release from my confinment for 2 week in BMT, even the old auntie also look nice to me.<br><br>Regards</div></blockquote>yes. I can be turned on by guys who are good looking at the first glance. But that doesn't mean I will fall in love with them. Because before I do that, Iwould have to like them first. And to like them means I would have to find out about their personality. And if his personality is like shit, no matter how good he looks like, he would still end up looking like a jerk to me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>i.c.y</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Looks matter for the first impression.<br>After that, mannerisms and character come in and looks become a bonus after that.<br>So, first impression counts. You may not look handsome/pretty, but its the way how you carry yourself that impress ppl. If you are nonchalant abt your appearance, then, difficult to score...
