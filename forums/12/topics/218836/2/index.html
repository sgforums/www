            <div class='col-md body'>Ya lor what's MEAT Vision.... been meaning to ask ever since I saw that word.<br><br>To the TS: Stop the low self esteem thing la... build your confidence up. Personally, I think you got confidence liao (got confidence to put your problem here) just need to give it a boost. For me the easiest way is talking to my image in the mirror every morning when I wake up. Well I look like a bus ran over me... but hey, at the very least I get to cheer myself up. Tell yourself you are going to have a great day with your partner today! Do that often enough, and your brain will automatically switch into that mode.<br><br>Next thing, get some professional help in self grooming, ie a small make over. You'd be surprised at what little make overs can do. Don't make drastic changes, otherwise boyfriend or not... sure get heart attack.<br><br>The 1 thing guys dun often notice, is subtle changes in their partners.<br><br>Next up, keep your mind occupied with positive subjects, that way you'll have less time to think about the negatives.<br><br>You have a great day now....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">would u pls tell us more on the way you look?<br><br>hmm.. u need to have a bit more confidence with yourself.  Can start by dolling yourself up.  Juz go for a new hair cut, buy new clothes and dresses that will make u look different.  It's not difficult.  Ask some good girl frens on wat's the trend now, go shopping together and refer to magazines lor.<br><br>If you yourself dun feel good abt the way you look, i think u cant blame him for comparing u with others.  And if u are confident, you wouldn't mind at all.<br></span><br><br></div>

Be satisfied at least that you have a bf. There are always people who are worse off than you in terms of looks or other situations. If you don't try to shake off this low self-esteem, this relationship is not going to work out in the long-run. Your boyfriend will eventually get tired of your low self-esteem because he cannot breathe and he might want out unless he is very patient with you.<br><br>doko</div>
