From now till the start date, play and do watever you want.  But at start date, you have to honour it.<br><br>Small baby steps.  Just look at the content page of your notes/books first.  Get a feel of what you have to cover, what's essential, what can be left out.  Then try scheduling chapters to a study plan.  Then plan swee swee liao ... try to follow it, bit by bit.<br><br>Reward yourself.  1 hour of cramming, 15 minutes of TV / games etc.<br><br>Get out of the house since the family irritates you.<br><br>Btw, a little bit of sugar/chocolate makes the medicine go down but you still got to put the medicine in the mouth first.<br><br>Good luck &amp; hang in there, it'll all be over soon.<br><br></div></blockquote>when it comes to term breaks or sch holidays and there is assignmens to be done.i like to do it at the start of the holidays but alot of times...slowly do until last minute then pedal to the medal.<br>for the past 2 semesters, it's fear of failing that forces me to study at the last few weeks though the pros start from day1.<br>anyway nice analogy on the medicine part.<br>btw what's medicine? i havent been to the docs for years</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Biotech needs to memorise???? Geez... I don't really think so.<br><br>Bio is a breeze for me in all the way until I grad from uni... all it takes is a understand of the big picture. Often many students paid too much attention to the details and not see the big picture and that is where the stress comes from.<br><br>Get the pic picture (i.e. the skeleton) of the subject then fill in the details. MIss some details is ok.. as long as your skeleton is there.<br>Bio is like math. You have to see and understand the 'biological formulae' and then apply (i.e. fill in the details with biological terms).<br>Memorizing will surely kill you!<br><br>At least you still have the 'tech'part in biotech.... mine was microbio and biochem. All I had was viruses and bacteria, chemical names and formulae and I did tons of bacteria cloning and DNA sequencing. If I memorise all my stuff I'll be mad!<br><br>Try alternating your study periods with sleep. The biological terms would be absorbed easier with short naps.
