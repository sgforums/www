              <p>As a gal, let me give you the perfect advice of our reaction, for the first few dates, we are only testing the ground, gal do not fall into relationship because to us, love is very important, unless you go for those cheapsake gals, then I have no say.</p>
              <p>Sometime, we also act tough, as gal, we need to show our color too, therefore you find at times, we treat guy coldly and ignore them, then we see their reaction, and will know how much this or that guy really love us. As most of us are educated, do not think we can easily fall in Love, we think of all aspect, from looks to careers to $$ and characters, Love to us is not something like buying groceries at the wet market. And like me betray our gal feeling abit here, the more harder to chase a gal, the better is the gal, cos she study the situation, pick and choose carefully and never in a rash to say I love you kind of stuff, why good, becos this type of gal is like me, very caution and careful, if she become your gf or wife, she will be a good wife taking care of house and husband and as gf, a good one who can give sound advice to lead you to glory.</p>

              <p>True, jealousy will creep in, I would say that most of us gals are sensitive and territory, every movement the bf makes, every gals he talks to, every appointment he attends etc etc are questionable and suspicion to his gf or wife.</p>
              <p>For a guy, once attached, please mind your movement, becos if you think you are going to behave like single kind of life, free and easy, then you are absolutely wrong, and not long later, you will find yourself in deep shit with your gf or wife</p>

              fall into relationship because to us, love is very important,
              unless you go for those cheapsake gals, then I have no say.</p>

              now now, for once or twice, this is a darn good piece of advice.
              
              e 1st few time she agree to go out with u, means u haf chans liao.
              rest depends on how good u r liao.
              
              btw, under normal sircumstances, if u r not handsum or rich, u better be humourous, but that don't means being funni or clown.
              
              but persistence (- wishy washy) in courtship 90% of times will pay off, i guarantee + chop.
              aniway, trust me, courtship is the best time in a relationship, cz it kips your heart pumping. once in a r/s, that feeling is lost. u sld enjoy while u can.

              <p>I am having trouble figuring out whether this girl is interested in me or not.</p>
              <p>When i was with her alone, she would suggest we go for dinner/lunch or outing. However, when i smsed her when is she free, she did not reply most of the time. I am wondering whether i stand a chance of her being my gf. I am also shy to keep on asking the same question "when are you free"</p>
              <p>Also, whenever i was with her, we would behave like we were close to each other. We shared food and drinks together. Does it mean anything? Or just wishful thinking of myself that i stand a chance?</p>
