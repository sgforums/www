              <p>Just say,"You got nice hair." will do, sounds more sincere and it is a compliment not flirting. Don't confuse compliment with flirting, compliment is "just" while flirting is "just not", that means you want something more. JL and your whole class are confused as you are. Most probably you're just a friendly easy going person. As for JL he is nothing but a playful guy that's all.</p>
              <p>If you got nothing to hide, carry on be friend with SV and ignore JL, most likely he is jealous.</p>
              <p>Why you guys quarrelling over SV? She must be a hot chick or what?</p>

              <p>Well, actually she (the first girl) isn't angry with me for commenting about her hair. She gave me a smile when I told her, so she knows that it was just a comment... But, I will take that piece of advice, when I give such a comment next time.</p>
              <p>To see my relationship with SV, see the first post in this thread (first page)... Now, you will understand what I will say below.</p>
              <p>JL still assumes that I have a crush on SV and he doesn't like it when he sees me talking to her. He would say, "Oi, what are you doing? Stop flirting with SV!" and come in the separate us. He would force SV to move away from me, so he could seat beside her. Even he thought I was jealous when I watched him playing with SV a hand game...</p>
              <p>I've told SV to ignore JL, as he is just 'playing around' for now and needs to find out the truth. I did talk a lot with SV recently, but it was to clarify the misunderstandings between our relationship, not flirting. Now, we are only just friends, though I told her I would come and talk to her occasionally, to tell her how I feel or describe my life. JL still needs to mature and understand that he should not try to play around like this.</p>
