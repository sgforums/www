              <p>if you holding other country passport you might not be treated
              so good when you are oversea. Example : if you hold batam passport
              or indian passport,you think they can move around in other country
              so free and easy? most of the cases they will be check by police at
              the road side first before us. ppl even look down at them cos
              they holding a third world passport. Alot of countries we go do not
              need any visa lor. If youso shame to be sg.. imgrate lor.</p>

              <p>you are speaking like a typical frog in the well Singaporean. you don't even know anything about, well anything, and go on to say about people holding Indian passport.</p>
              <p>First of all, there is no such thing as Batam passport. Batam isn't a country Mr SmartyPants.</p>
              <p>And secondly, I am holding an Indian passport. I can't remember ever being "checked by police at the road side" in the way you put it. Rest assured, I am very sure that I have definitely travelled around the world more then you.</p>
              <p>Ppl look down at us? LOL! You go to an uptown shopping center in Singapore itself and see who the shop ladies will approach first, almost definitely the Indians.. Why? Because lately the tourism from India has increased a lot and they have some real spending power.</p>
              <p>Don't be stuck in a mindset that belongs to the pre-2000 era..</p>

              <p>Its not that everyone thinks its safe, it is safe. Try living in other countries. You never know if that is your last day out sometimes. You can just killed in the bus while listening to your music (Greece), a child can get killed for nothing by Police themselves (Greece), you go to uni and get shot down (America), you go to market or travel in train and get blown apart (India, London, Spain), you get sniped while filling your petrol (America), you get arrested for nothing and people call you terrorist (Glasgow) and the list just goes on and on.</p>
              <p>Now when was the last time anyone's perfectly fine life got disturbed in such a way in Singapore? Hmmm... I can't think of any, can you. This is what I call safe.</p>
              <p>Unless your definition of safe is different then I rest my case.. haha..</p>
              <p>Whats going on below the "perfect image" is no big deal at all. As long as you ignore it, it doesn't directly affect your life.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, when u make a police report, what they will file as will be "record purposes". You seriously dun think the police will mount a 24hour watch for your house, do you?</p>
              <p>However, if the victim is the son of some rich businessman or minister, the Ah Long would be caught within a day. Sorry, but this is how things work here.</p>
              <p>Listen to some of the advice posted here. Set up a CCTV, approach ur town council or MP, or learn martial arts and beat them up when u see them. LOL!!</p>

              <p>I disagree with you. Being born and raised here doesn't mean you're 1st class either! When major events(F1, etc) are held here, your own country roads are being blocked for other people use. When we need to build a reliable military, locals are used instead of foreigners for the defence of this country.</p>
              <p>Migration is simply a choice that TS is considering.</p>

              <p>Chunsiang, you are still young.<br> let your parents settle this problem.<br> <br> No need to earn money. When you old enough, you will know money

              <p>To Chunsiang,</p>
              <p>I think this is a good advice.</p>
              <p>Concentrate on your studies first. If needed, just stay in your school library for revision</p>

              <p>Which is pretty true, that's why most houses (other than those in the city) have no gates too. Though if you're living in the city, I wouldn't recommend leaving the door open at night or you'll get some drunkard strolling in... or you'll find the TV missing the next day. :P</p>
              <p>Of course, it's not a utopian society or something; I was at classes once, when some guy started shooting students a few floors down but was finally pinned down by one heck of a brave tutor/lecturer.</p>

              <p>yes in australia or canada, most rooms are not lock including the bathroom. funny, based alot on trust and community spirit. unlike singapore. small flat or big house alike, all lock and double bolted.</p>
              <p>we must change our mindset , in the past most of our parents keep alot of money and jewellery at home. but now everyone use credit card. there is no cash, so little incentive for thief to steal.</p>
              <p>no way they are going to cart away 28 inch tv rize.</p>

              <p>you have my respect for your maturity at the age of 13.   I have not met any  mature 13 year old before.  clap clap for you.    report to the police, if they pour paint on the wall it is vandalism.   don't count on the PM and president they are hopeless, exist to earn money out of us.   Yes, migrate when you strike rich.</p>
