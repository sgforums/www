              <p>hi all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thought i will give you guys an update since i have not written for sometime. Well basically i kinda wrote my feelings to him and was really happy that he responded the same. However ,things remained to be disappointing because up till today, he still didn't officially ask me to be his girlfriend and also never attempt to hold my hand. Haiz, needless to say, i am so very the dsiappointed. I don't know what else to do. I wish some expert can help me there. What  else can i do because i find myself stooping lower and lower to the extent that i find him starting not to appreciate me liao.  As i am a very focused person, i don't think i can date other guys while at the same time trying to make this work.</p>
              <p> Someone, please help me! Truly appreciate.</p>

              <p>Why dont you just simply enjoy all the time spent with him in the movies/dinner and try to understand him better, the harder you try to make yourself likable to him the more you are not being yourself and the more desperate you will look in his eyes and he'll start to lose respect in you.</p>
              <p>if you really like/admire him why don't you ask him if you can be together with him, i dont see why being proactive is a purely male prerogative</p>

              <p>Both of u are 'testing' waters lar. In other words, means to an end. What is the end only u know and he knows.</p>
              <p>My suggestion - enjoy the 'trip' and forget about the end(s). If u feel uneasy, lump it.</p>
              <p>PS - love if it becomes or is made exclusive is not love lar - but something else masquerading as love.</p>
              <p>Previous posting to another :</p>
              <p>One cannot possess love, it is always <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bigger</span> than one. Assuming one has it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within</span>  - one can at most, share, appreciate or partake of what is ... .  Of course, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it is possible to possess a person</span> in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>guise of</em> love</span>; what good is a dead, plastic flower?</p>
              <p>The heart hankers for <span style="text-decoration: underline;">eternity</span>, sadly, the mind interprets <span style="text-decoration: underline;">permanency</span>!</p>
              <p>Hence possessiveness comes into play. PS - Words are 'birds' - the word 'love' is not love, the word 'God' is not God, and the word 'fire' of course, is not fire. Love is an <em>existential herenow</em> experience n the heart resonates that which 'frees' or is freeing. Love abides <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ONLY</span> when reason(s) and fear(s) are not there. Where there is an ego there is no love but needs,expectations, jealousy, comparison .....</p>

              <p>hi all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thought i will give you guys an update since i have not written
              for sometime. Well basically i kinda wrote my feelings to him and
              was really happy that he responded the same. However ,things
              remained to be disappointing because up till today, he still
              didn't officially ask me to be his girlfriend and also never
              attempt to hold my hand. Haiz, needless to say, i am so very the
              dsiappointed. I don't know what else to do. I wish some expert can
              help me there. What  else can i do because i find myself
              stooping lower and lower to the extent that i find
              him starting not to appreciate me liao.  As i
              am a very focused person, i don't think i can date other guys while
              at the same time trying to make this work.</p>
              <p> Someone, please help me! Truly appreciate.</p>

              <p>if the more action u take, the less reaction he gives. so why not take the risk of not doing anything and letting him do the work?</p>
              <p>on the other hand, if u need a conclusion right away because the vague guessing game isn't ur cup of tea, why not just clarify directly?</p>

              chasing the female prey. When do you ever have the prey jumping
              right before the hunter, grabbing his gun barrel, even pushing the
              barrel into (her) own breasts? (If) faced with such a situation,
