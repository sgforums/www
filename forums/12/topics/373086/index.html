              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p>I hope someone can help me out. I have recently been going out with this guy on 1-1 dates every weekend for several weeks. I would like to know if there is any meaning behind this? Would a guy bother to ask a casual lady friend out every weekend just to watch movie or have dinner? I have never been in a relationship before hence i am totally clueless if this action of his meant anything.</p>
              <p>I sincerely hope someone can enlighten me because i am quite torn by it. I don't like to play mind games (well if this is considered as one). I don't wish to go on a 1-1 date with a guy if he is just purely treating me as a friend because i think that's so selfish of the guy. If there is anything that i need to hint to the guy, please let me know.</p>
              <p>Someone,please enlighten me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>
              <p>S.</p>

              <p>You are right about girls who go out with guys but never want to progress further than just being ordinary friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Usually, if a guy is interested in a girl, he will ask her out as often as he can.  Very rarely will he ask a girl out many times if he is not interested in her in the BGR way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand, girls may not be looking for a relationship whenever they go out with guys.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A girl will feel flattered that she is the target of a guy's attraction, and as such, she may consider going out with him occassionally just to "hang out" .  There is perhaps an ego thing at work here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So there is a big difference in general, how guys and girls behave with respect to "asking the other party out" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Thanks all for your replies. At first i must say i don't have any feelings for him despite a few times out . However subsequently he still  continued asking me out so slowly i guess i developed some feelings for him. I think the guy must be really stupid lor to think that i am not interested in him and yet each time he asks me out, i agree to go with him. However i agree that he could be just treating me as a casual friend and like what some said, he is just using me to kill time which is what i fear most. I don't know what is the best way to ask him. I just want to know whether he has any feelings for me. If no, then i will just stop going out with him anymore less i sink deeper and end up getting really hurt. Like i said, i have not been on a relationship before so i don't want this bad experience to be my last. I still want to settle down.</p>

              <p>If you are really afraid of getting hurt, then I suggest you don't even consider the notion of getting into a relationship.</p>
              <p>Just because you are so in love with him doesn't mean he has to be madly in love with you. I mean, come on, what does he have to do to profess his love? Beg you? He has already asked you out, girl. What more do you want? Of course, you can choose not to go out with him. A guy can only do so much. The other side has to reciprocate.</p>
              <p>If you do not want to play mind games, whatever that means to you, just tell him. You are only afraid that your feelings get hurt. I tell you, the longer you drag, the more you will get hurt. If you are thinking, "but Im a girl, a guy is supposed to do this and that..", then I'd say "hey forget it la, you like to expect guys do this and that for you."</p>
              <p>Go ahead, send him a note, sms, whatever. A great way would be to ask him (if you are someone who likes beating around the bush) "hey do you go out with other girls 1-1?."</p>

              <p>You are right about girls who go out with guys but never want to
              progress further than just being ordinary friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Usually, if a guy is interested in a girl, he will ask her out
              as often as he can.  Very rarely will he ask a girl out many
              times if he is not interested in her in the BGR way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand, girls may not be looking for a relationship
              whenever they go out with guys.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A girl will feel flattered that she is the target of a guy's
              attraction, and as such, she may consider going out with him
              occassionally just to "hang out" .  There is perhaps an ego
              thing at work here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So there is a big difference in general, how guys and girls
              behave with respect to "asking the other party out" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              </div>

              <p>You see, it doesnt have to mean a guy confirm must get the girl just because he asked her out. Yes, he could be interested, assuming there is interest. It could be he's exploring the characteristics of the girl and how she is compatible with him or whether she will bring excess baggage. If your boss interviews you, he cannot simply make a decision immediately to hire you unless he is desperate. He has to consider whether you are suitable for the job and how capable you are.</p>
              <p>So you see, it doesn't mean he's damn interested in the girl and must get her at all costs. Heck, he could even lose interest after a few dates.The same could happen to girls. After all, this is human nature. We lose interest due to some X reason. But I'd say girls change interest like the flick of a switch more often than guys.</p>
              <p>And we have the case of the girl going out with the guy even though she knows she wants nothing romantic out of this. This is where the confusion begins. Here the guy wants a relationship and the girl knowing this, as most girls do, leads him on and at the end of the day,  tells him, "I just want to be friends, dear". It's just plain sick and disheartening to hear such stories happening because this is really selfish on the part of the girl. But of course, reality sometimes hurts and we have to be prepared that such people exists.</p>
