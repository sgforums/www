She preyed on your weak strength of character.<br><br>What sort of relationship would you want to see yourself falling into? A relationship that fools around with the 'break-up' stance whenever argument arises?<br><br>If your Love only understands companionship, then you will probably have to tolerate the Â‘what's notÂ’ until you crumble emotionally.<br><br>So you demand changes? And if somebody is not learning, you can't use the same equation to solve the same problem because you will be getting the same result.<br><br>What if the way for her to change is for you to be out of the picture? Would you have the courage to walk that route?<br><br>P.S: This is probably the third case (involving man with weak Mars) we have here. I shall repeat again: When you strive to treat a woman like a princess, at best, you become the best jester in town. Evolve your woman to a queen and you being her rightful king. Then you shall see equality and not lose your dynamic and foundation of your relationship to fear.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ducktan:</div><div class="quote_body">i treat her like a princess. give in to her when quarrel. but she, everytime when we quarrel, she never fails to break her promises. she promised not to keep quiet. promised not to be so attitude. but when i tell her that she broke her promises, she will reply a ' SO? ' then i also have got nothing to say. there are times when we quarrel till very jialat  i will suddenly give in and apologize. then she will then admit her mistakes and promise not to repeat. but again and again she repeats them. i know she loves me. but she doesn't show she that she treasures me. i'm really tired of giving in to her. but if i don't do so, i'm afraid that i will lose her. very afraid. now we have just quarreled. and the same thing repeats itself. i told her recently that this is the last chance i give her to prove that she treasures me. but just now. she just don't want to reply. hang the phone. and i said i wanted a break. she just cry. complains that i don't love her. and i have to call her again and again. people please tell me what to do? i don't want to be the one always to give in. i don't want her attitude and she always breaking her promises. lastly, i don't want to lose her.<br><br>thanks for reading. sincere replies please <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>Ok, it's a clear signal that she doesn't like you anymore as her bf.<br><br>Few questions to ponder though, what kind of bf were you to her? Is she happy whenever both of you are together? When was the last time that you make her feel that she's being loved? When was the last time both of you had a nice and comfortable chat with each other?<br><br>I'm sure both of you loves each other and it's only a matter of time before both of you are back together again. It'll happen once she realised your loss and start to miss you. And hopefully when that time comes, you must treasure her for good.<br><br>Communication is very important in all relationships, it helps you to understand more of the other person and also allows the other person to know more about you. Couples have arguements and quarrels because they do not have enough communication with each other. They assumed they knew about each other and when the either party doesn't react/behave in the assumed manner which, they end up quarrelling. Nobody will be humble enough to admit that they've made the mistake by making assumptions about the other party, and this is a very commonly found mistakes in all relationships.<br><br>Do take note though, disappointment doesn't necessary means that the other person has changed or doesn't love you anymore.<br><br>So make a point to have a chat with your loved ones, be it a short chat or you're busy. There are always ways to pass your messages through them anytime in our everyday lives.<br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
