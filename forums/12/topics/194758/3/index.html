            <div class='col-md body'>SHE is indeed too pampered.<br><br>Maybe she is too young and sort of immatured.<br><br>She may not be good in expressing her feelings towards you and expect you to wait her on your knees.<br><br>However, she dared not express or expose her feelings too much may be due to certain reasons that you are unable to see/ feel....Women are hard to figure out sometimes...unpredictable.<br><br>She may be fearing that you find out too much and scared that once you know that she loves you alot, you might not love her as much. Sounds ridiculous, but some women are just like that....<br><br>One Phrase: She is Afraid of getting hurt cuz she is too self-centered.<br><br>Like you mentioned she loves you, I believed she does. And she is afraid that one day you will tell her you do not want the r/s anymore. That's why when the faithful day comes, she exclaimed that you do not love her anymore.<br><br>The problem doesn't lies with you, you have done your part.<br><br>The crisis of this r/s is your gf, the way she thinks and behave. From your words, it seemed that she doesn't know what she wants and if she knows what she wants, she doesn't care what other people feel....like you.<br><br>I think it is better to have a clear cut talk with your gf rather than to let things haggle on. R/s that has not really ended always end up in alot of coming backs....<br><br></div>

I understand how you feel. the feeling is like you love her so much but you cannot stand her behaviour. Is easy for others to say be a man let go but is hard for people like us to do it becos we took so much time and effort for the ones we love.<br><br>usually the ending will go 3 ways.<br>a) she will dump you, sadly if the girl finds another stronger, better, or richer guy usually she will go. think it in a positive way the faster she go the less suffering you need to suffer and will show what kind of girl she is.<br><br>b) you will dump her, usually this takes years to happen, The shouting, screaming and crying will soon take is toll on you, soon you ask yourself why are you doing so much for her. The feeling is like, suddenly you feel sick and tired of sending her around or giving in to her. Looking at her will only feel very sianz..The feeling in you will grow and soon you find yourself looking at other girls and chatting with them.<br><br>c) The happy ending. Thats what you will hope for. Less crying, shouting and screaming. but for this to happen something bad must happen to her for her to treasure you.<br><br>just want to say this, no matter what happens just do you best. If you feel that you have done enough then is time to let go. Do not be too hard on yourself. If your gf do not treasure you some other girls will, but you must be willing to give other girls a chance.</div></blockquote>All i can say is dun put in too much or u will hurt more  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, how old are you guys. If she's a young teenager, aiya common la.<br><br>Secondly, before you start letting your thoughts run wild, always try to put yourself in her shoes at the scenario. Maybe you might find out why she responded in that manner. Have a good talk with her, and try to make her understand how you feel. If possible, ask her how would she feel if you treated her the way she treated you. If she starts shouting or throwing tantrum, just walk away la.</div>
