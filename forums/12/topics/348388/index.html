              <p>Am sure many have experienced this before lah - the irrational (rational?) feelings of sadness connected to it.  I suppose it also depends on who broke up with whom etc.</p>
              <p>For my case, it was just bad timing. If I had met her a year or so later, it might have turned out very different. After just a few months, we imploded. We still stayed in contact, barely. Like an email twice a year. </p>
              <p>I moved on with life, but I wrote letters to her which I never sent. I knew she was seeing someone. But then 6 years after I last saw her, I suddenly get an invite to a wedding.</p>
              <p>While I don't usually think about this sort of thing, through the years I've sometimes thought that losing her might in fact be the biggest regret of my life. </p>
              <p>So my questions!! </p>
              <p>Why girls like to invite the ex to wedding ah? We didn't even have a long relationship, and I doubt the current fella knows about me. </p>
              <p>For people who actually went to the wedding - was it a good move or did you need to get drunk after that. :p</p>

              <p>But I did have an ex where we agreed to inform each other when we both got married (to different people). Just inform, not invite lah - So well we did.</p>
              <p>I figure whatever sadness you might feel is merely that a phase of your life is officially over. That is reason enough for a sort of sentimental nostalgia - but don't mistake it for anything more than that.</p>

              also depends on who broke up with whom etc.</p>
              <p>For my case, it was just bad timing. If I had met her a year or
              so later, it might have turned out very different. After just a few
              months, we imploded. We still stayed in contact, barely. Like an
              email twice a year. </p>
              <p>I moved on with life, but I wrote letters to her which I never
              sent. I knew she was seeing someone. But then 6 years after I last
              saw her, I suddenly get an invite to a wedding.</p>
              <p>While I don't usually think about this sort of thing, through
              the years I've sometimes thought that losing her might in fact be
              the biggest regret of my life. </p>
              <p>So my questions!! </p>
              <p>Why girls like to invite the ex to wedding ah? We didn't even
              have a long relationship, and I doubt the current fella knows about
              me. </p>
              <p>For people who actually went to the wedding - was it a good move
              or did you need to get drunk after that. :p</p>

              <p>Wow. She holds you in high esteem then.</p>
              <p>You consider it as an ex-relationship, but she consider it as past friendship.</p>
              <p>She has the maturity to invite you to her big day.</p>

              <p>Thanks for the advice peoples.</p>
              <p>Yah definitely not reading into it as anything like "oh, maybe she still lurves me". But it's just so strange considering the implosion that ended the relationship. We were never friends before the relationship, so it's not like we had a history to fall back on.</p>
              <p>S's Cat: I am inclined to think you're right - to rub it in my face a little and show me what I've missed out eh. Maybe not in a really evil way, I dont think she habours THAT much animosity. We emailed each other twice a year or so since then but they've always been friendly enough mails.</p>
              <p>hahah yah, better not yam seng too much and drink too much at the dinner huh.</p>
              <p>For Master - man that really sucks. She seems like she is still really bitter for whatever reason huh. You totally shouldn't have gone for it, esp the baby shower! I doubt I would be snubbed or anything if I should go because I don't know many of her friends and they don't know who I am.Just an unknown figure in the back.</p>
              <p>mancha - yep have congratulated her already. Will probably at least send a gift. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I agree with mancha - take it at face value that she simply wishes to celebrate with someone she considers to be a friend.  If you don't figure you can simply be there to share her joy, it's probably not worth going to and sending a gift will suffice.</p></div>
