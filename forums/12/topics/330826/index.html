              <p>Hi all, i've joined sgforums and its been about two years already. Posted replies in some forums here and there, but this is the first time i start a new topic, and i hope to find some good advice from you guys.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've been with my boyfriend for about two years already. We went through alot just to get together, therefore i cherished this relationship and i love him really really much. And our relationship is nearly perfect. But here's the problem: I get jealous too easily, and I'm very scared this will jeopardize our relationship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We had a few quarrels here and there, and most of the time, it is because of my jealousy problem. I know sometimes there's nothing much for me to worry about, because i know he is a good guy, but yet when we are out together, there are times when i can't help but feel insecure when a pretty girl walks by and his eyes happen to be glancing at her. Or when he mentions about his ex-crush, i just get that green feeling i cannot shake away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've looked at advices on the internet. Issues pertaining to low self-esteem, therefore it brings about insecurity issues leading to jealousy. All of this, i've read before. Sometimes i even tell myself, 'dont say anything sarcastic' when he is mentioning something to me about the opposite sex, but sometimes, my mouth doesnt go in sync with my brain, and I've said things i've really dont mean it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How do you guys overcome the feeling of jealousy? Please advise, because I really don't want to lose this relationship..</p>

              <p>sister, men aren't perfect and they never will be. if the only problem you have with him is him looking at chicks on the road, then you have no real problem. you considered lucky k.</p>
              <p>the next time he glance at pretty girls, just glance at good looking men, then trade notes. </p>
              <p>as for the ex talk yeah just tell him you're not interested in listening about his ex rush and ex gf. i don't understand why people keep on talking about their ex bfs and gfs either, it's a turn off for some people.</p>

              <p>well, you gonna control. If you have been with your current bf with like 2years. Where's the trust level i mean? 2years is quite reasonable time and the rs should be quite strengthen thru time and experiences right?</p>
              <p>Talk to him, let him know you are jealous. In a nice way, what you dont like, tell him. Maybe he can change alittle, but dont expect drastic changes. At least, he know where to like control, when talking about babes etc...</p>
              <p>Wish you all the best, my advice is let him aware of this, and tell him you will get turn off by the way he talk to you on the certain topic (whatever the topic is).</p>

              <p>Hi. I'm not any expert or nor I have sufficient experience to give advice. However I do have a female friend who is in her mid 20s having the similar issues. It got her into a very bad shape knowing she herself is the problem, not the guy.</p>
              <p>Anyway the counsellor she spoke to, identified 2 issues. Insecurity and Low Emotional Control. You found an answer to Insecurity, ie is to improve your self-esteem. However reading from the web is grossly insufficient to really improve it. I'm sure if you had read enough, you'll realised it take months to improve yourself significantly. Self esteem is something that takes time and a whole lot of self committment to improve. It encompasses your whole life, not just in your relationship with your bf.</p>
              <p>The other often overlooked thing is our ability to control our emotions. In your post, you gave a very good example of your lower control.</p>
              <p>"<em>Sometimes i even tell
              myself, 'dont say anything sarcastic' when he is mentioning
              something to me about the opposite sex, but sometimes, my mouth
              doesnt go in sync with my brain, and I've said things i've really
              dont mean it</em>."</p>
              <p>Say Person A let Person B and C down in a business project. Both B &amp; C reacted with anger. B went and smashed up A's office, but C just moved on. C has more emotional control than B.</p>
              <p>Maturity. A mature person have better emotional control. It takes even more discipline to have emotional control. Humans are ruled by emotions. To have control over emotions, you rule yourself.</p>
              <p>Goodluck in your quest.</p>

              <p>hey, thanks everyone for ur advices. I'm trying to curb my jealousy problem, and it's slightly better now. But there this other problem that i have... Its that my bf frequents porn sites and sggirls, and has a collection of more than a thousand photos in his computer that he 'collected' since he was a teenager. I understand guys watching porn, and keep porn pictures, therefore i closed one eye on this issue. What i dont get is, he even 'collects' photos of different girls from sggirls.com,those self-taken pictures of girls, model pictures, and all of them are clothed. When i approach him about this issue, he says that he just keeps it for fun, and doesnt really look at it. My burning question is, if you dont really look at it, why keep it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It hurts me to see that he keeps such pictures, at times, i feel that am i not enough for him? Does he have to keep pictures of other girls?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This has been in my mind for days. I dare not talk to him about this, in fear that he might say i dont trust him, or restrict him from doing what he wants. In a way, he is honest to me, because he even lets me go through his 'collection' of photos. But then again, at times i cry to myself, because i question my own self-worth, to him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Other than that, he is a loyal guy. Very sweet to me. Therefore, i really dunno how i should feel about this issue..</p>
              <p>Pls advise, thanks.</p>

              <p>I suggest that you just let go of the issue...guys collect all this without reason sometimes. It doesn't mean that he loves you any lesser when he is looking at all these, doesn't mean that you are not good enough for him. It is just something in-built in guys I guess.</p>
              <p>I am married to my husband already but he still has pictures of models inside his computer. Same as your boyfriend, he also showed it to me but instead of getting uptight I will joke with him about the models...unless he starts comparing me to the models then i will start to get irritated. But if not, all is pretty normal.</p>

              <p>I suggest that you just let go of the issue...guys collect all
              this without reason sometimes. It doesn't mean that he loves you
              any lesser when he is looking at all these, doesn't mean that you
              are not good enough for him. It is just something in-built in guys
              I guess.</p>
              <p>I am married to my husband already but he still has pictures of
              models inside his computer. Same as your boyfriend, he also showed
              it to me but instead of getting uptight I will joke with him about
              the models...unless he starts comparing me to the models then i
              will start to get irritated. But if not, all is pretty normal.</p>

              <p>Hi all, i've joined sgforums and its been about two years
              already. Posted replies in some forums here and there, but this is
              the first time i start a new topic, and i hope to find some good
              advice from you guys.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've been with my boyfriend for about two years already. We went
              through alot just to get together, therefore i cherished this
              relationship and i love him really really much. And our
              relationship is nearly perfect. But here's the problem: I get
              jealous too easily, and I'm very scared this will jeopardize our
              relationship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We had a few quarrels here and there, and most of the time, it
              is because of my jealousy problem. I know sometimes there's nothing
              much for me to worry about, because i know he is a good guy, but
              yet when we are out together, there are times when i can't help but
              feel insecure when a pretty girl walks by and his eyes happen to be
              glancing at her. Or when he mentions about his ex-crush, i just get
              that green feeling i cannot shake away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've looked at advices on the internet. Issues pertaining to low
              self-esteem, therefore it brings about insecurity issues leading to
              jealousy. All of this, i've read before. Sometimes i even tell
              myself, 'dont say anything sarcastic' when he is mentioning
              something to me about the opposite sex, but sometimes, my mouth
              doesnt go in sync with my brain, and I've said things i've really
              dont mean it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How do you guys overcome the feeling of jealousy? Please advise,
              because I really don't want to lose this relationship..</p>
              <p>Thanks people. :)</p>

              <p>have u told him b4 about this? ur insecurity? if he knows about it, he can better understand why u do some of the things u do.. and also, maybe he will curb his ways..</p>
              <p>however, its really very normal to be looking ard.. i mean, not only at girls, but at other human beings.. obviously ur eyes will go to something that moves.. delibrately not looking will be weird..</p>
              <p>if he has the heart, he will at least start to cut down commenting them, at least in front of u..</p>
              <p>but u must understand that telling him ur insecurities may also backfire, he may be pissed and think y u r restricting him.. its up to u to talk to him properly about it and not in a condescending tone..</p>

              <p>it's common, this shows how much you care about him and love him.</p>
              <p>some guys pick on this point to test the reaction of their girl (: (purposely)</p>
              <p>Him speaking about girls is an inevitable thing, be it worklife, school life ect. he will bound to meet up and interact with the opposite gender.</p>
              <p>however, your good point, is too, your weakness. It will lead to quarrels (which you had already mentioned)</p>
              <p>Try to be more understanding and trust him. If you are deeply in love, nothing, even the most prettiest of girls can separate him from you</p>
