              <p>By the way hor, bestmen and bridemaids are usually meant for and
              hand-picked only for the third-world ugly ones. Cos the bride and
              groom wouldn't want their bestmen and bridemaids to outshine them
              in the wedding.</p>
              <p>So jojobeach, you can have all the men that you need if you're
              not smart enough to figure that out for yourself yet. Looking at
              the bride and groom, I would say "good luck, good luck to you ya".

              <p>Haha till now I haven't seen any freelancers who still cannot sustain themselves with they money they earn from freelance gigs. Not all of my friends are in the world of freelancing, some have been posted to Japan Koei as game illustrators and one went to Blizzard as a CG artist.</p>
              <p>Yes I would like to see what you do for a living. Entrepreneurs are freelancers themselves too. I still won't call myself a 'lao ban' until I have a group of people I can command under me lolx. It is so insulting to the word 'boss' when it's only a 1-3man company lolx.</p>

              <p>Nope its not buffet style, but I believe you can opt for it since it's cheaper. Yes, the bride and groom gets to walk down the aisle before the dinner starts (don't forget about your groom!) The couple had actually married 5 years ago, but only held their wedding dinner last month due to financial diffculties.</p>
              <p>Have you considered taking up a lower interest personal loan? Some credit cards also allow you to break the payment into 2 year installment with a minimal interest (Stanchart charges about 12% p.a instead of 24% p.a. if you rollover payments on most credit cards) or 1 year with 0% interest. This should alleviate some of the problems you're facing. Also please encourage your relatives to give angpao instead of gifts :)</p>

              <p>Rainee, your parents are in Malaysia and they bug you.</p>
              <p>My mother bugged me too, such that even if I am not in contact with her. I still detest myself for any little link with her......to the point that I am cutting off all links with a big chopper and wishing for the best.</p>

              <p>Why is the parents expected to die at a certain time period
                  instead of planning for the worst when both parents are too old to
                  walk and requires maid and money to survive thru their old age?</p>
              <p>No doubt the TS is kinda prepared for her loving role as a wife
                  &amp; mother in the future, but did the TS ever consider the
                  alternative where she might need support from the family?</p>
              <p>Rainee, your parents are in Malaysia and they bug you.</p>
              <p>My mother bugged me too, such that even if I am not in contact
                  with her. I still detest myself for any little link with
                  her......to the point that I am cutting off all links with a big
                  chopper and wishing for the best.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>I am not the one who brought up the issue that they are expected to die at a certain age, they are the one who pondered upon it and brought it up to me. Hence me coming here to get advice on what to do "if" they pass away at a certain age...don't get the idea that I am cursing them to die or something. It is pretty normal to discuss what is going to happen once a parent pass away so that necessary steps can be taken to take care of the single parent who is still alive.</p>
              <p>As for why the dinner is to be held in Singapore, it is because most of Rin's family and relatives are here, plus most of our friends are here as well. I am going to hold another smaller scale one in KL just for my side of relatives if they can't make it to the Singapore dinner.</p>
              <p>And you talk about the support from family, do you mean from my parents? I have long ago given up on getting support from them...everytime I tell them my problem they will use it against me in the future, they refused to provide any financial support and have already made this very clear since the very beginning...</p>

              <p><br>rainee, you have to stop being super defensive of yourself and take a look at what  you have wrote. Is it really important to you that people sees you as a better individual as compared to your parents?</p>
              <p>No matter how bad your parents have treated you in the past and at the present, you cannot deny that every part of you comes from your parents and it is their blood that is flowing within you and substaining your life. Please understand that not all parents can comfortably express their love for their children. And do you think you should let everyone in here know why do you think your parents refused to provide you any financial support. Is it because you refused to stay in Malaysia and be together with them?</p>
              <p>I still believe that your parents have always loved you and you should also try to understand their love for you from their perspective and not based on the kind of parental love that you desired/expected.</p>
              <p>Reflecting all the negative feelings back at your parents will never make you a better person than them. You need to reflect upon your own actions and behaviour and grudges that you have bore against your parents and FORGIVE them.</p>
              <p>This is necessary if you really want to be better than your parents in the future and not slowly becoming one of them at the present or even worse than them in your future. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I am not being defensive, I am just stating the facts. Sorry if I come across as being defensive.</p>
              <p>As about coming to Singapore, they are the ones who agreed to it as long as I give them their monthly allowances and come to visit them every fortnight. This agreement is something that we have discussed together, not something I forced down their throat. I have asked them if they are happy with this arrangement, and they said yes and they are ready to let me work here. Before this, they were not ready, hence I spent nearly 2 years after my graduation working in Malaysia. I only moved to Singapore and got married to Rin after getting their approval.</p>
              <p>Another thing is, I have married a Singaporean, so it is just logical that I move here...cannot expect my husband to move to Malaysia with me right? When I work here I can give them a better life, so it is a win-win situation. Last time when I was still working in Malaysia I could only give them very little to support their living...understand that they are no longer working and I am the sole breadwinner in my family now. I am not saying this to brag or to say that money solves everything, but it does help them to achieve a more comfortable life. And in order to have this, they understand that certain sacrifices have to be made, in this case I would have to shift to Singapore.</p>
              <p>I am not expecting them to provide me with financial support. I have been learning to be dependent and earn my own livings since I was 18. All I am asking for is their understanding that I would need more time to achieve what they want out of me. That's all. If they can give me that, I would gladly forget all those things they have done to me before and never bring them up again.</p>

              <p>You must understand that.. ROM early before the ceremony ..

              <p>Erm, I hate it when people assume I ROMed with my husband for the sake of getting the PR status. I have the ability to get the PR even if I were not married to him, based on my job alone, I would be able to get that status easily.</p>
              <p>Forgive me if I sound like I am bragging here, but I feel like I need to set that right first.</p>
              <p>The purpose of me getting ROM is cos of one, we feel that it is time for that kind commitment, and secondly, because we want to get a house together. We understand at that time that we would only be able to get the house with the grant if we produce the marriage certificate. We need the grant to cut down on the price of the house.Plus our parents were encouraging us to register our marriage as it is a proof of our commitment. And yes, my parents included, in fact they are the one who bugged me to go ROM. Yes, I will continue to love him if we did not get ROM, but why let the relationship stay stagnant when we are ready to move to the next level of commitment?</p>
              <p>And you had said you want to look at the situation more objectively, basically we have already ROMed, so there is nothing we can do to change that. We can think of that as our advantage from now on, at least there isn't a problem with getting the grant for the house.</p>

              <p>As above, please view things objectively, I have already moved here, I won't be moving back, I don't believe in sacrificing my own happiness in the future just so that I can please my parents. Based on what you have said, it would be better if I stay in Malaysia and don't get together with my husband so that my parents would be happy, right? So maybe then my parents would be happy, but what about me? Should I keep giving in and sacrificing my own feelings so that others can be pleased?</p>

              <p>Erm, I hate it when people assume I ROMed with my husband for
                      the sake of getting the PR status. I have the ability to get the PR
                      even if I were not married to him, based on my job alone, I would
                      be able to get that status easily.</p>
              <p>Forgive me if I sound like I am bragging here, but I feel like I
                      need to set that right first.</p>
              <p>The purpose of me getting ROM is cos of one, we feel that it is
                      time for that kind commitment, and secondly, because we want to get
                      a house together. We understand at that time that we would only be
                      able to get the house with the grant if we produce the marriage
                      certificate. We need the grant to cut down on the price of the
                      house.Plus our parents were encouraging us to register our marriage
                      as it is a proof of our commitment. And yes, my parents included,
                      in fact they are the one who bugged me to go ROM. Yes, I will
                      continue to love him if we did not get ROM, but why let the
                      relationship stay stagnant when we are ready to move to the next
                      level of commitment?</p>
              <p>And you had said you want to look at the situation more
                      objectively, basically we have already ROMed, so there is nothing
                      we can do to change that. We can think of that as our advantage
                      from now on, at least there isn't a problem with getting the grant
                      for the house.</p>

              <p>I see.</p>
              <p>But you did mention you are not getting a house.. yet ? I'm confused.</p>
              <p> Next level of commitment?...hmmm... next level of commitment usually means.. starting a family together..... you know.. have babies ?</p>
              <p>And I have no idea where you're getting your information from.. but I think you are quite misinformed about how things run in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Getting la, most probably next year. Just not immediately.</p>
              <p>Getting ROM will also help to move things faster...because the level of commitment is there...if you are just bf/gf usually there won't be any talk of getting house...like some of my friends, they have cohabited together for years but no talk of getting married at all. Needless to say until now still never talk about having their own house, etc.</p>
              <p>Yes, we are planning to start a family together once we have the means to and everything has settled down...means after getting the house and holding the banquet. I am not not ready to move to this stage, just that circumstances are preventing me to do so...as in, not enough money to do everything at the same time. But at least when we have ROMed, it is more natural to talk about these things and easier to plan for the future as compared to if we just remained as bf/gf. And once there is a plan, I can envision it coming true.</p>

              <p>As above, please view things objectively, I have already moved here, I won't be moving back, I don't believe in sacrificing my own happiness in the future just so that I can please my parents. Based on what you have said, it would be better if I stay in Malaysia and don't get together with my husband so that my parents would be happy, right? So maybe then my parents would be happy, but what about me? Should I keep giving in and sacrificing my own feelings so that others can be pleased?</p>

              <p>rainee, that's not what I meant. I also hope that you can have better relationships with your parents.</p>
              <p>You may be upset with me, but I do not have any ill intentions to you and your destiny.</p>
              <p>It's my rule of thumb never to interfere with anybody's destinies, so please keep that in mind.</p>
              <p>Is it right to say that your parents gave you that ultimatum only when you insisted on leaving Malaysia for work?</p>
              <p>I hope you can resolve your differences with your parents and although it may be unfair in your opinions that you needed to take the first step. But you will have agreed with me in your future that this may be one of the best decisions that you have chosen to take in your past.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, your future is up to you to craft and decide based on your present's decision. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
