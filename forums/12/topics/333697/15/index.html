              <p>Yup, I did call up a few restaurants to ask about their

              <p>The last time.. my best friend did her wedding.. she also ordered wine.. but by the time the wedding is over.. she has to carry 5 boxes of unused red wine back home.. and end up giving it away .</p>
              <p>You may want to check.. if the restaurant will require you to purchase minimum boxes ? or they let you refund the unused cases back.</p>
              <p>But if you don't want to headache.. then no need wine lah.</p>
              <p>I mean.. how many of your relatives drink wine ?? Not a lot of Asian knows how to appreciate leh.</p>

              <p>If that's the case, then leave everything up to your parents to decide lor.</p>
              <p>You just need to shoot yourself with a <strong>tranquilliser</strong> so that you can be a good daughter and learn to show LOVE and respects to your parents and not just showing them your money and your attitude.</p>
              <p>I don't think you want to HELP your parents to love you more if you are not capable of understanding kinship and humble yourself sincerely before your elders.</p>
              <p>Just a matter of time before your act comes apart with your in-laws anyway, how long do you think you can deceive them about your attitude towards your own real birth parents?</p>

              <p>Girl like rainee who is soon to become a woman and a future Mother to her husband's children, should be more sensible and more mature in her thinking. Despite the fact that her occupation is a teacher, and her nationality is a Malaysian, she should reflect upon her own attitude towards her parents.</p>
              <p>If she is not able to get along well with her parents and have enough grace to practise FORGIVENESS towards her parents and all her hoo-ha that she claimed to have "suffered" during her childhood, then how is she going show her husband that she will be able to get along well with her in-laws in their future?</p>
              <p>Maybe her in-laws won't be as "nasty" as how she condemned her own real birth parents, but it's a clear fact that no matter how much a person can change her environment and the audience, as long as she is NOT able to change herself, she is just a time bomb awaiting to be explode.</p>
              <p>This will be my last call for rainee to CLOSE up all her issues and resentments that she is still holding it against her own real birth parents and use this opportunity to practise FORGIVENESS and develop some grace within her own character.</p>
              <p>Afterall, this is necessary to ensure a smooth married life ahead of her and also to prevent any future misunderstandings between she and her in-laws and also her real birth parents.</p>
              <p>To close up all the uncertaincies issues with her in-laws and real birth parents in the future, she can start by correcting and fixing up within herself first before she comes and badmouth her elders (in-laws, real birth parents) rudely and unfairly in a forum. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I do not know why you care so much that I am talking about my parents, not like I am talking about yours...anyway this is an open forum so I can post my own problem as it is and not restricted to what is suggested by you. Plus I have never bad-mouthed my in laws, show me where I have badmouthed them in this whole thread.</p>
              <p>You are not even the moderator of this forum so stop acting all proud and haughty...look at the advice you have given to me and act upon it yourself...you dun like what I have posted here, shut your trap, stop being a busybody and go somewhere else where your advice will be better appreciated.</p>
