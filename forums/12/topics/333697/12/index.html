              <p><br>dun shoot her le la....i can feel that she very poor thing already. I believe she is not the type who act proud and haughty. I mean, who will spend the time here to type such a long post out and talk about their problems which is already very depressing for them?</p>
              <p>Anyway, to TS, if your parents are so concerned about their own face, why not hold the banquet first? (yet again, they might complain say wad no ROM means no name also)</p>
              <p>Since they are living in malaysia and you are living and working in singapore, most probably they do not understand why you cant hold the wedding banquet (Singapore hold wedding, very very very expensive. in hotel, $800 per table at least, even if you hold those cheaper ones in restaruant, u probably get about 500 plus to 600 plus at least)</p>
              <p>I suggest you break down the cost of expenses to them. Everything written on paper. After that, compare against on how much you and your future to be hubby can afford and what is left in your bank. i can forsee that if you go with your wishes of your parents, you are on dangerous track (financial burdens and "crsis")</p>
              <p>Since your parents care so much about their faces, then try not to hold the banquet too far away from your ROM date.</p>
              <p>For housing, take up loan. If you and ur future hubby has a steady stream of income, then should not be a problem paying loan off every month.</p>
              <p>You are right, one step at a time, but remember, when u have done your best and pple still point their fingers at you, you have no regrets.</p>
              <p>My sincere wish to you is you and your hubby will strike toto! =)</p>
              <p>but den, work hard!</p>

              <p>It's obvious that rainee have absolutely no love, respects for her real birth parents, and yet she is not ashamed to constantly use her parents' requests/expectations to hide her own greed for a wedding banquet that she cannot afford and even to the extend of owning a house.</p>
              <p>If she's not full of hypocrisy, then I say she is full of herself.</p>
              <p>Would you even want to marry a girl like her and bring endless burden to your family?</p>
              <p>She should count her lucky stars that she can find someone who even want her.</p>

              <p>The best solution right now.. is go step by step.</p>
              <p>A few of my friends.. they also same situation with you.</p>
              <p>First they do the wedding.. .. but they didn't do the studio
              photoshoot...They only engaged a photographer to take pictures
              during the wedding.</p>
              <p>Then after the wedding.. they live with their parents for a
              while until they saved enough money and found their dream home. So
              they don't loan much from banks which is the best thing to do.</p>
              <p>Buying home.. you cannot rush ... you must get something you
              really really really like before you make the long term
              commitment.</p>
              <p>Have you and your hubby talked about babies ? Like when you
              think you want to start a family ?</p>
              <p>If you are not in a rush.. then you can take your time before
              you move out on your own.</p>
              <p>As for your parents.. just tell them.. you havn't found the home
              you like yet, so there's really no rush. Besides.. the housing
              market is going down in Singapore.. you don't want to go into
              negative equity.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Another reason we want to move out soon is because my in laws have just sold their house and moving into a smaller one. My father in law also need us to move out because my husband's room will be used by him as a home office...so we have to get our own place as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>Babies ah...not so soon la. Now just want to get the housing and banquet issue out of my head. Babies will have to wait until a few years later when we are more ready.</p>
              <p>Yea housing market is going down...we are hoping the price will dip next year so we can buy around March...then won't be so expensive...</p>

              times he said he wants to quit this path and go back to a full time
              job, I can sense his reluctance and I also felt that he is saying
              that because he feels he needs to...so that's why I stopped him and
              asked him to concentrate on what he is doing now...</p>
              <p>Anyway this is just what I thought...but he's here, so he can
              tell you what he really thinks.</p>

              <p>Relax...</p>
              <p>For whatever his decision is.. your position should be... " whatever you do dear.. I will always support your decision."</p>
              <p>Go with the flow.</p>
