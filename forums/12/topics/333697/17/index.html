              <p>Parn,</p>
              <p>I think it is about time you get down from your moral high ground and look at things more objectively.</p>
              <p>Forcing her to "love" and "forgive" her parents now.. is .. totally.. useless.</p>
              <p>You cannot force love.. and you cannot force forgiveness.. everything must come from the heart...</p>
              <p>Right now... the situation is not about love or forgiveness..</p>
              <p>Look at the situation more objectively.</p>
              <p>Rainee...</p>
              <p>Honestly.. I believe your parents still worries about you.</p>
              <p>You did put yourself in a very disadvantaged position as a girl. Some more in a foreign land.</p>
              <p>Based on your previous postings... you have no intention of getting a HDB or a property now with your hubby... then why both of you go and ROM so early ?</p>
              <p>You and your hubby have no intention of starting a family with babies yet... another reason why you shouldn't have ROM.</p>
              <p>You must understand that.. ROM early before the ceremony .. In Singapore.. we practise so.. is because back then... the wait time for a new HDB flat is very long.. as long as 5 years... that is why new couples ROM then apply HDB first ... once they have the flat...then they do the ceremony.</p>
              <p>This is why your parents are angry you do not ROM and get new flat... yet also don't perform ceremony.</p>
              <p>You are a girl.. you are disadvantaged right now. Your hubby has nothing to lose.. that is why your parents are upset.</p>
              <p> Then I ask.. what is the purpose of you getting ROM so soon ? For getting a PR sake ?.. I don't know.. but that would be a very silly reason to get ROM.</p>
              <p>If you claim it is all about love for your hubby.. then I ask you.. can you still love him.. even when you are not married to him ? Surely... the answer must be a yes ?</p>

              <p>How can we talk about houses and sharing a life together only after we have ROMed? Months before ROM we have already started talking about spending our life together, about joint account etc.</p>
              <p>It is pretty normal for people to ROM when they are ready for it and after they have discussed all the plans as mentioned above. It is the natural step to take when you can see yourself living in the same house with the person, having a family together...if I can't see myself doing all these with him or have never discussed it with him, why would I agree to marry him?</p>

              <p>rainee, that's not what I meant. I also hope that you can have
              better relationships with your parents.</p>
              <p>You may be upset with me, but I do not have any ill

              <p>It's my rule of thumb never to interfere with anybody's
              destinies, so please keep that in mind.</p>
              <p>Is it right to say that your parents gave you that ultimatum
              only when you insisted on leaving Malaysia for work?</p>
              <p>I hope you can resolve your differences with your parents and
              although it may be unfair in your opinions that you needed to take
              the first step. But you will have agreed with me in your future
              that this may be one of the best decisions that you have chosen to
              take in your past.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, your future is up to you to craft and decide based
              on your present's decision. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I do hope me and my parents can have a good relationship one day. In fact, it is always my wish that one day I will be able to live in peace with them. You think I want to quarrel with them? What for?</p>
              <p>Can you propose then what should I do to resolve the differences? And please don't say something like I should divorce my husband and go back to Malaysia because that is something I will never do.</p>

              <p>Well rainee, since you explained it that way, I think I can understand...your parents behaviour cant be much different from mine.  Though I am currently in a different stage now.</p>
              <p>We cannot shut our parents off totally.  No matter how, even if you are mad at them, you cannot put them out of your heart like it is very easy.</p>
              <p>Our parents may be selfish, but they arent likely to 'sell out' their daughters too 'cheaply'.  And selfish people dont exactly want things that will ruin their future.</p>
              <p>Maybe consider that your parents are insecure themselves and insecure for your sake.  They are residing in Malaysia and expecting you to buy a home in Sg.  Think of it as them being selfish.....you have a home and wont go back to borther them in Malaysia.  Even if you are leaving for overseas......a home in sg is worth its rental to generate some cash or something you can fall back on.</p>
              <p>And looking at the cost of living in sg and malaysia, i dont think its feasible for either of your parents to come live with you in sg.  Medical, servants and living expenses is cheaper in Malaysia. If possible, plan to have cash available to finance some flights ticks for yourself and your parents to visit once in a while.</p>
              <p>And in future, with babies or children, you can hope for some help from them. (I typed 'hope' because some parents can be very disappointing in that aspect.)</p>
              <p>Parents can be such pain in the backside but I guess everyone of us has to grin and bear it, unless you wish to become heartless......</p>

              <p>I do hope me and my parents can have a good relationship one day. In fact, it is always my wish that one day I will be able to live in peace with them. You think I want to quarrel with them? What for?</p>
              <p>Can you propose then what should I do to resolve the differences? And please don't say something like I should divorce my husband and go back to Malaysia because that is something I will never do.</p>

              <p><br>All parents want to be involved in managing their children's future....no matter how old their children may be. Don't you want to be in that role in your children's future too? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>I'm happy to hear that you have that desire to reconcile with your parents one day. If I were you, I would return that managing power back to my parents and make them feel useful and needed to be managing some parts of my life.</p>
              <p>I would've allowed my parents to make the decisions for my wedding banquet, seeked their opinions on houses (what kind, type, location, price, what to look out for...so on and so on).</p>
              <p>One thing we must know is, parents always must nags at us no matter how well we have done in our lives. Parents will always seems impossible to satisfy and be agreeable. That is because they do not want to feel redundant or even ended up as a burden or useless to their children. So please allow them to nag at you and be prepared for it ok?</p>
              <p>I do not know your parents personally, so I might not be able to give you specific advice on what you should do.</p>
              <p>But seek their opinions and advices on some areas in your life to make them feel useful and wanted and needed by you. And also allowed them to feel they played an important role of managing you and your lives, so that you can see how proud they are of you in the future.</p>
              <p>It may be difficult for you to see where I'm coming from, but you will be able to see what I meant when you become a mother and you will see your relationship with your parents will automatically be revealed to alot much easier for you to understand than you had expected.</p>
              <p>Do not rushed and expect them to change overnight, be patient and things can and will only get better for you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
