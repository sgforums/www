              <p>Okie, I think I have posted about my parents quite some time ago, but I am now encountering even more problems with them, so let's see if any of you can help me out with ways on how to deal with them.</p>
              <p>My parents are currently residing in Malaysia (they have their own house there), they are both retired and received quite a reasonable amount of allowances from me every month. They have access to my car (which I am paying for as well, they only fork out money for the petrol) so they have no problem getting around. They are both in their late fifties and I am trying my best to make sure that they are enjoying their retirement period.</p>
              <p>Recently I ROMed with my husband and my parents have been causing problem ever since. At first they pestered me on why can't I hold my wedding banquet together with my ROM ceremony and I told them that I do not have enough money to do so. Both me and my husband are not millionaires, we are just average people trying to earn a living to survive in this city which has a high cost of living as well. We told them we will hold the banquet in one or two years time and for a short while, they seemed to be ok with that idea. After that they changed their mind and wanted me to get a house instead. So I said I can use our savings to buy the house first but because of that, the banquet would have to be pushed until even later.</p>
              <p>So obviously they are not happy about that because they said I am making them "lose face" in front of their relatives and they kept thinking that I am not going to hold the banquet anymore in the future. I really dunno how to explain it to them at times. Everytime I try to explain something to them they will doubt my words and said I don't care about their "face" anymore, don't care about their well-being anymore. If I really do not care, I won't even spend a single cent on their allowance every month (which is quite a hefty sum, it takes up around 40% of my total pay every month). When I try to explain things to them, they will keep threatening to come to my workplace to create a scene. I really can't afford to let them do that if I want to still work peacefully in my workplace for a long duration...</p>
              <p>Another thing is that my hubby and I have plans of migrating to another country in maybe 6 or 7 years time...but that time they should be quite old already (and maybe one of them would have already passed away). I am the only child in the family and I do not want to shirk my responsibility of taking care of them but if I migrate, how do I go about it? Is it alright if I just hire a full time nurse or maid to take care of them in my absence?</p>
              <p>I really want to be filial and responsible towards them but sometimes they do make things very difficult for me. Appreciate any comments or ideas on how I can solve this problem or at least stop them from keep bugging me...thanks for reading.</p>

              <p>Maybe you can make your parents stop pressing you to hold a banquet or buy a new house by asking them to contribute a sum of money to the banquet/house expenses which I believe they wun be willing to do that.  Since they want face, tell them you will deduct 50% of your allowances to them every month, sell off the car to save up a sum of money to hold banquet or buy big house lor.  Tell them that you need to support them, support yourself, the car, give allowance to your in-laws and family planning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With regards to your concern on migration, i think it's too early to think about that..you cannot predict what will happen tmr.  If you do not have the ability to hold a banquet in 1 or 2 yrs, why think of migrating in 6 or 7 yrs? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All the best.</p>

              to save up a sum of money to hold banquet or buy big house
              lor.  Tell them that you need to support them, support
              yourself, the car, give allowance to your in-laws and family
              planning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With regards to your concern on migration, i think it's too
              early to think about that..you cannot predict what will happen
              tmr.  If you do not have the ability to hold a banquet
              in 1 or 2 yrs, why think of migrating in 6 or 7 yrs? </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Thanks for the well wishes :)</p>
              <p>I can't cut their allowances, they will give me no peace if I do that. I am also trying to let them enjoy their life after retirement but seems like maybe they are too free le, then keep thinking more and more and come up with weird thoughts and start bothering me with all the petty, trivial stuff.</p>

              <p>I am really very confused now.</p>
              <p>Sometimes I don't want to tell them, but they will keep asking me until I have no choice but to tell them.</p>
              <p>But I never tell them anything much, just told them that I will be getting a house some time next year. I had thought they would be happy to hear that, but it seems like now they come up with other things to bug me about ie about the banquet.</p>
              <p>It is like endless pestering. It is getting to be very irritating and harder for me to tolerate as the time goes by.</p>

              <p>I have tried threatening them with that last time, but they just threatened me back that they will come and make trouble in my office. And they really did at one point, that's why I am scared they will repeat it again.</p>

              <p>Yes, I know shouldn't be over filial...sometimes I dunno whether I am being over filial or not. I actually dun feel much attachment towards them because when i was younger, I was actually abused and beaten up quite badly by them. Even until now they have never regretted their action and justified it by saying that every parents do that to their kids anyway.</p>
              <p>I am not doing it because I really feel affectionate or attached towards them. I am just doing it out of obligation and trying to keep things peaceful. I am not someone who likes to stir up shit if it can be avoided.</p>
