              <p>We have known this since super young. Its been imprinted in our minds that it is inevitable our parents will pass away some day. We all have witnessed the grief and sorrow of our parents towards the passing of thier parents. Instead of using it to keep on reminding us, i do not see why they should put this kind of fear into us constantly and and especially unwarranted.. We have acknolwedged it and its not like we are out of control wasting parents money with gambling and/or doing all those things that are not considered.. filial in our culture.</p>
              <p>Not especially when the kidshave gone through, blossomed under a broken family with broken marriage and have made the parents proud not just academically but as persons of character, publically acknowledged as a good son/daughter, regardless of the abuse and loneliness when young..  man.. just talking about it fuels the anger within me. But i have looked past that...</p>

              <p>There are many causes to shorten ones life..</p>
              <p>Most important is you live a full life.. be it short or long.. and you let your child live a happy and fullfilling life.. be it short or long.</p>

              <p>Well, one of it can be that u tell ur parents, that u wont get pregnant until u have a banquet. N u explain to them, that will be at least, 6 months or so AFTER u have bought ur house due to financial situations etc..  like u said how u need to do the house, furniture. Hey i know its tough. I also got a house. N only just did my kitchen. N cost me 18K just for kitchen reno. U gotta constantly drill it into thier heads.</p>
              <p>You tell them ur willingness to compromise has show them that u respect them and wish that they in turn respect you and support ur decisions. Or shit.. is gonna go downhill. And both side is not gonna happy, n tell them they wont be craddling thier precious grandchild to sleep if this kind of BULLSHIT continues.</p>

              <p>You have spoken my mind...other parents have commented how I
              have made my parents proud in terms of my education and also my
              career...not that I am bragging, but I am considered to be in a
              much better situation and my parents' life is considerably better
              compared to others. I dun understand why can't they be grateful for
              all they have gotten now instead of keep pushing me for more and

              <p>Actually it has always been like this since I was
              young...whatever I have done, it is never enough. Like how they
              have always complained that my job sucks and make them lose face (I
              do not know why they hate me going into the teaching line)...they
              never realised that it is with this job that they are able to enjoy

              <p>Whatever I have done, it is always seen as something which makes
              them lose face...never for once they have told me that I make them

              <p>My dad also never attended my older bro's graduation. Cause he decided not to go back work for my dad. He still thinks my older bro make him lose face. But my bro is making it big man..ffs! hello! My bro also felt alot of resentment towards my parents , but he is the oldest, wisest and most patient and soft spoken one out of us sibling, he reigned us in together to be patient with our parents choices in the past.</p>

              <p>They cannot stop comparing. It is like ingrained inside their

              <p>Yea, I got think in that way also...what about my face when they
              are forever talking about theirs...they have made me lose face
              times and again when they created scenes in my office etc but I
              have never brought it up again. But of course that doesn't mean

              <p>Not just ur parents la.. my siblings, currently my older sis is the most accomplished out of all of us.. n she still compares her with other family members n friends. But they will eventually ease off slowly as long as u are consistent with ur stance and overtime they will acknowledge u. Patience ah.. hopefuly through patience they will eventually fully understand. And throw in a 'Grandchild argument' along with other stuffs. They shouhld be sensitive about that..</p>

              <p>It perfectly makes sense. Cause u can derive ur statement from my stated situation. Its fair enough also to say, we sometimes forget the love and care our parents put into us ah. Thats why now grown up liaw.. i am more forgiving and understanding. I hated thier guts when i was 17 yrs through out to 21. I kanpo after a siblings meeting, which made alot of sense in why sometimes our parents acted the way they did. Thier difference in background , discipline , the times they struggled to come out successful. Even with a broken marriage , financially they have done extremely well. That to me was the price . Like all things, they come with a price. </p>
