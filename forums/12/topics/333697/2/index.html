              <p>It is very common for parents to use threats to control their children. Not the most ethical thing to do.. but it can be the most effective way.</p>
              <p>As long as you made known to them it works on you.. they have no reason not to use it again and again.</p>
              <p>Using threats to disrupt your life is a form of emotional abuse.</p>
              <p>If they ever do that to you again.. threaten them back.. say if they keep pushing you will kill yourself lor....</p>
              <p>Once they realised what they have to lose.. they will stop.</p>

              <p>Okie, I think I have posted about my parents quite some time ago, but I am now encountering even more problems with them, so let's see if any of you can help me out with ways on how to deal with them.</p>
              <p>My parents are currently residing in Malaysia (they have their own house there), they are both retired and received quite a reasonable amount of allowances from me every month. They have access to my car (which I am paying for as well, they only fork out money for the petrol) so they have no problem getting around. They are both in their late fifties and I am trying my best to make sure that they are enjoying their retirement period.</p>
              <p>Recently I ROMed with my husband and my parents have been causing problem ever since. At first they pestered me on why can't I hold my wedding banquet together with my ROM ceremony and I told them that I do not have enough money to do so. Both me and my husband are not millionaires, we are just average people trying to earn a living to survive in this city which has a high cost of living as well. We told them we will hold the banquet in one or two years time and for a short while, they seemed to be ok with that idea. After that they changed their mind and wanted me to get a house instead. So I said I can use our savings to buy the house first but because of that, the banquet would have to be pushed until even later.</p>
              <p>So obviously they are not happy about that because they said I am making them "lose face" in front of their relatives and they kept thinking that I am not going to hold the banquet anymore in the future. I really dunno how to explain it to them at times. Everytime I try to explain something to them they will doubt my words and said I don't care about their "face" anymore, don't care about their well-being anymore. If I really do not care, I won't even spend a single cent on their allowance every month (which is quite a hefty sum, it takes up around 40% of my total pay every month). When I try to explain things to them, they will keep threatening to come to my workplace to create a scene. I really can't afford to let them do that if I want to still work peacefully in my workplace for a long duration...</p>
              <p>Another thing is that my hubby and I have plans of migrating to another country in maybe 6 or 7 years time...but that time they should be quite old already (and maybe one of them would have already passed away). I am the only child in the family and I do not want to shirk my responsibility of taking care of them but if I migrate, how do I go about it? Is it alright if I just hire a full time nurse or maid to take care of them in my absence?</p>
              <p>I really want to be filial and responsible towards them but sometimes they do make things very difficult for me. Appreciate any comments or ideas on how I can solve this problem or at least stop them from keep bugging me...thanks for reading.</p>

              <p>I have read ur point of view, Rainee &amp; I feel ur stress.  And from here I hav absolutely have no idea why parents wld wanna stress their kids bcos of their "face".</p>
              <p>Perhaps, may i suggest, tat u think hard &amp; try to look from their point of view?  Why is there a need for them to push u up to the wall, why are they in such a hurry, what is really bothering them?</p>
              <p>Do they have such opinion tat since both of u work in SG, u shld have earn much more money than the people tat they know?  If so, wat will be the way to show them that it's not always the truth?</p>
              <p>I know when parents push too hard, their kids will only wanna stay away from them as far as possible cos it's such a chore.  But bcos u r being filial..u r torn in between.</p>
              <p>I wish u the best, rainee &amp; nekoRin.  Must jia you oh!  p(^o^)q</p>

              <p>some parents,like yours treat having children machiam like 'cash cow'. to bring them up to only benefit themselves materially.There's no love here. Manipulative parents will always like to tie their children down using our culture as an excuse.</p>
              <p>but in regards to what parn have said it's a very grey line...maybe u can describe to us abt ya childhood.From there we can analysis.</p>
              <p>rainee..just think it this way.ya dad was the breadwinner when ur younger right? does he did wad he tink was necessary without consulting ya mum and u all? since ur the breadwinner for them now, i believe u should do the same. If u deem what is right for survival part by all means do it dun consult them.they might just 'sabotage ya plan only' with their outdated mindset.After all, if u fall, they will fall also.If u collapse, they will as well.</p>

              <p>Do you not love your parents? Why would you even think they're
                  bugging you or even a burden to you?</p>
              <p>I can't believe you even thinking about one of them passing away
                  in 6 or 7 years time!And how would you feel if next time your
                  children also think the same way about you and your husband?</p>
              <p>I don't believe if you say you cannot afford to even have a
                  wedding dinner in Malaysia. Do you think your parents really wanted
                  you to hold the dinner in a 5star hotel? Why don't you ask them
                  about it?</p>
              <p>I'm sure they loved you and misses you very much and that's why
                  they are still in contact with you and frequent.</p>
              <p>I don't believe a person without morals like you can even be a
                  teacher, and your husband who married you is also not a nice guy in
                  real life or he's just a blind man.</p>
              <p>You can NEVER repay the love, attention, time, that your parents
                  have spent on you. Do you really think your money is that great and
                  it's fair enough for you to repay them?</p>
              <p>Touch your own heart and conscience and forget about the money
                  or your bank a/c for once, and LOVE your parents before it's too
                  late!</p>
              <p>You must have forgotten one thing, YOUR HUSBAND CAN ALWAYS LEAVE
                  AND FORSAKE YOU FOR ANOTHER WOMAN, BUT YOUR PARENTS
                  WILL ALWAYS LOVE YOU!!!</p>
              <p>Don't focus too much on money and status, even if you are
                  multi-millionaires in real life, you are still poor and wretched as
                  a person. Cos you have failed to show love and respect to your
                  parents as a human and you have failed to embrace that
                  ability that only humans are capable of doing so.</p>
              <p>Can you still considered yourself as human? You're worse than an
                  animal. Even my dogs and cats know how to express love to me better
                  than you can show love to your parents.</p>
