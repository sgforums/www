              <p> </p>
              <p>No intention in this world can justify an adult hitting a defenseless child.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not only do you inflict physical pain.. you are also causing psychological damage to the growing child.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You may think that if her parents didn't hit her.. she would be worst off.. now that's an assumption.. no basis .. no proof.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Because I can also argue that.. if her parents didn't hit her.. she coulda be a Harvard graduate by now. and earning big bucks instead of scrimping through in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Parents who hit their child into submission are just cowards who don't try to understand their children.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hope none of you forumers will ever do such a thing in the future.</p>

              <p>Yes, I do not wish to rush and compromise on everything until it turns up in a way I do not want it to be. I want to take my time to organise something which will make me and my guests happy, so definitely need more money + more saving time.</p>
              <p>Actually I dunno what they are so worried about, I am not even asking them to contribute to the banquet fund. Ever since I turned 18 I have not asked them for a single cent, everything inc. my food, etc I have paid on my own.</p>

              <p>Cuz most elderies have this thinking that a couple is not officially married as long as they never go through traditional customary procedures..Hence, they might feel like you will be living with your hubby æ²¡å��æ²¡ä»½..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>rainee..stick to whatever decisions that you deemed as right =) Is your wedding mah..it should be a happy occasion for you..better than choosing options that dampens your mood...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is really "chor" to host a wedding though..they should emphatized with your financial status also mah...wedding banquet, honeymoon, gowns, photoshoot &amp; those "wu eh bo eh" stuff for the traditional customary procedures..house..renovation.. =.='''</p>

              <p>No, not enough. At least 15 tables. Some of my Malaysian relatives might be coming to the Singapore dinner also.</p>
              <p>Plus restaurants usually want 15 tables and above. Otherwise you won't get the whole room to yourself and also you won't get to walk down the aisle...</p>

              <p>It's normal for couples to take out a home loan from banks for their first home and if you are too proud to accept your inevitable fate, then good luck to you and JYJY for being selfish to make the decision to stay at square one.</p>

              <p>Anyway, to TS, if your parents are so concerned about their own face, why not hold the banquet first? (yet again, they might complain say wad no ROM means no name also)</p>
              <p>Since they are living in malaysia and you are living and working in singapore, most probably they do not understand why you cant hold the wedding banquet (Singapore hold wedding, very very very expensive. in hotel, $800 per table at least, even if you hold those cheaper ones in restaruant, u probably get about 500 plus to 600 plus at least)</p>
              <p>I suggest you break down the cost of expenses to them. Everything written on paper. After that, compare against on how much you and your future to be hubby can afford and what is left in your bank. i can forsee that if you go with your wishes of your parents, you are on dangerous track (financial burdens and "crsis")</p>
              <p>Since your parents care so much about their faces, then try not to hold the banquet too far away from your ROM date.</p>
              <p>For housing, take up loan. If you and ur future hubby has a steady stream of income, then should not be a problem paying loan off every month.</p>
              <p>You are right, one step at a time, but remember, when u have done your best and pple still point their fingers at you, you have no regrets.</p>
              <p>My sincere wish to you is you and your hubby will strike toto! =)</p>

              <p>This comes from the mouth of someone who goes around demanding to be given a 30k ring <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> In all my posts you would notice I have never asked for a grand wedding
              banquet nor do I want a 30k diamond ring...all I want is a peaceful
              life with my husband, that's all. I am not as calculative and
              unrealistic as someone here.</p>
              <p>The cheapest wedding dinner you can find which will fulfill my parents' expectations will need at least 15k...I have already calculated it before. If you do your research you will know that most restaurants only allow you to hold the banquet once you have 15 tables and above, and each table nowadays cost 600++, even in a restaurant. So multiply 15 with 600++ will already cost around 10k, and that is not inclusive of wine + beer, plus photoshoot...all these will cost near to 15k. Am I being extravagant? I am not talking about having a banquet in Fullerton or any five star hotels now. Just having a banquet in a restaurant will easily cost up to 15k (and this serves as a lesson to those of you who are planning to get married as well, better save up early).</p>
              <p>As for house, of course we are going to take up loans, but no banks will give you 100% loan. The most HDB will give out is 90% plus you still need to pay COV to the house owner as we are buying resale since we want the house fast. The COV can be as high as 20 to 30k, and this is not yet inclusive of furnitures, appliances, etc.</p>
              <p>In what way am I being extravagant? If you are getting married, you will know that these are necessary things. Please do your research carefully before making baseless accusations here which will only put you in a bad light.</p>
              <p>I can only deduce that you are someone naive, someone nowhere near the getting married stage and not even aware of how much all the necessary stuff will cost. If you think that I am complaining and acting pitiful here, you can always choose to ignore me and don't reply to this thread if it irks you. I am not forcing you to advise me nor can you force me to accept your advice just because you think it is good.</p>

              <p>Haha we wish to strike toto too, but what is the possibility of that happening? *wry smile*</p>
              <p>Anyway, I had first gone with the plan of holding the banquet first. But my parents later advised me to go and get a house before holding the banquet so I decided to listen to them and hence is now saving and looking for a house. But now they have changed their mind and wanted me to hold the banquet IMMEDIATELY after getting the house which wil be a bit impossible because all our savings will be drained by then.</p>
              <p>Yes, we are going to take up loans to help pay for the house, but my husband is working as a freelancer at the moment so might be a bit hard to get a high amount of loan. But is alright, I believe we will find a way to get the loan...but will still need cash to pay for the COV (as mentioned above).</p>

              <p>Haha, ok...thanks for clearing things up. Then just take this as a lesson to her ba...on how much to save up before getting married. The amount is seriously not a joke.</p>

              <p>This comes from the mouth of someone who goes around demanding to be given a 30k ring <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>The cheapest wedding dinner you can find which will fulfill my parents' expectations will need at least 15k...I have already calculated it before. If you do your research you will know that most restaurants only allow you to hold the banquet once you have 15 tables and above, and each table nowadays cost 600++, even in a restaurant. So multiply 15 with 600++ will already cost around 10k, and that is not inclusive of wine + beer, plus photoshoot...all these will cost near to 15k. Am I being extravagant? I am not talking about having a banquet in Fullerton or any five star hotels now. Just having a banquet in a restaurant will easily cost up to 15k (and this serves as a lesson to those of you who are planning to get married as well, better save up early).</p>
              <p>As for house, of course we are going to take up loans, but no banks will give you 100% loan. The most HDB will give out is 90% plus you still need to pay COV to the house owner as we are buying resale since we want the house fast. The COV can be as high as 20 to 30k, and this is not yet inclusive of furnitures, appliances, etc.</p>
              <p>In what way am I being extravagant? If you are getting married, you will know that these are necessary things. Please do your research carefully before making baseless accusations here which will only put you in a bad light.</p>
              <p>I can only deduce that you are someone naive, someone nowhere near the getting married stage and not even aware of how much all the necessary stuff will cost.

              <p><br>You called yourself a teacher and yet you are not able to understand my sentence when I already mentioned to you NOT to use your parents' expectations as an EXCUSE for a wedding banquet that you cannot afford. Go for a SIMPLE, CHEAP, AFFORDABLE WEDDING BANQUET THAT IS AFFORDABLE TO BOTH YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND. Which part of my sentence DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?</p>
              <p>And don't be naive to give people the impression that both of you are going to bear all the costs by yourself. Both of you are ORPHANS is it? No parents to help you to bear some of the cost is it? Keep your pride to yourself and swallow it if you really need to and humbly seek your parents for help to bear some of the cost for the wedding banquet.</p>
              <p>As for your HDB flat, how many bedrooms flat are you talking about? Go as low as you can afford to own a HDB flat for both of you, at least both of you got a roof over your head and stop paying rent.</p>
              <p>If both of you have absolutely no savings/CPF at all to afford to pay for anything, then you better review your own lifestyle and spending. Don't live like a princess if you cannot afford to live like one. It's not too late to regret and correct your own lifestyle and keep track of your own spending.</p>
              <p>And if you need to remind me that you are giving your parents 40% of your income every month, then you can save it and go remind yourself to SEEK HELP FROM YOUR OWN REAL BIRTH PARENTS.</p>
              <p>Keep deducing lor...someone insensible like yourself can only keep deducing for life and never end up living a life anywhere even close to success.</p>
              <p>Maybe you should go reflect on YOU, YOURSELF, YOUR OWN ACTIONS AND BEHAVIOUR towards your own family, and you can go compare with other couples out there living in Singapore that are even earning lesser income as you and your husband and yet they are able to own a roof over their heads.</p>
              <p>I give you a clue ok? Don't go and think of your own race and compare with their own success stories, go and think of the race of your nationality and see how that race managed to survive in Singapore, able to have a wedding banquet, own a roof over their heads, and STILL BE HAPPY with their married lives.</p>
              <p>That's what happens when a girl is not smart enough, bringing unnecessary and putting her loved ones into this kind of endless dilemma.</p>

              <p>The best solution right now.. is go step by step.</p>
              <p>A few of my friends.. they also same situation with you.</p>
              <p>First they do the wedding.. .. but they didn't do the studio photoshoot...They only engaged a photographer to take pictures during the wedding.</p>
              <p>Then after the wedding.. they live with their parents for a while until they saved enough money and found their dream home. So they don't loan much from banks which is the best thing to do.</p>
              <p>Buying home.. you cannot rush ... you must get something you really really really like before you make the long term commitment.</p>
              <p>Have you and your hubby talked about babies ? Like when you think you want to start a family ?</p>
              <p>If you are not in a rush.. then you can take your time before you move out on your own.</p>
              <p>As for your parents.. just tell them.. you havn't found the home you like yet, so there's really no rush. Besides.. the housing market is going down in Singapore.. you don't want to go into negative equity.</p>
