              <p><br> Marriage marks the bonding between two people and their
              FAMILIES.</p>
              <p>It is not always necessary for the bride and groom to foot the
              bills for the wedding reception and it should be as affordable as
              it can be for both families of the bride and groom.</p>
              <p>If either families preferred a granduer wedding reception, then
              both families should work together with the bride and groom to
              decide the best possible wedding reception affordable.</p>
              <p>It seems clearly that both families weren't communicating and
              this could be one of the problems that many forumers here has
              failed to factor that missing piece of information into rainee's
              situation. People just plainly read what others type nowadays
              without much processing and understanding isn't it?</p>
              <p>If rainee sincerely seeks help from forumers in here, she should
              be more honest and be transparent about her feelings and her
              current situation. Withholding information on purpose and
              especially those informations that may place her in a
              disadvantageous position in her stance at sgforums may indicated
              that she might already have a clue that she was in the wrong. Even
              so, the advices that she received may not be relevant to her
              current situation as a single piece of additional withheld
              information could change the composition of the situation entirely.
              I'm not surprised if she realised that she's not getting the real
              help that she seeks in here because of that.</p>
              <p>I would've expected a moderator to give better and neutral
              advice to rainee. Just because people here knows her more than her
              parents, doesn't means they should be taking sides with her and
              support her even though what she was doing or thinking is wrong and
              without morals.</p>
              <p>If the TS wasn't rainee and it was some nobody that nobody knew
              about, then people wouldn't have felt obliged to take sides
              and would've change their stance to neutral and advised more
              sensibly. So as a moderator, don't take sides and do give sensible
              advices to other forumers who needed help.</p>
              <p>Advising children to go against their parents is definitely a
              BAD advice to suggest. If you are a parent and people suggested to
              your child/children to go against you, what would you feel? Would
              you have agreed with those advices too?</p>
              <p>Children don't and will never have that luxury of choosing their
              parents in their life, that is the law of nature and it is there
              for us to respect and obey.</p>
              <p>Whoever agrees with advices that encourages children to go
              against their own parents will one day find themselves in the
              parents position. So be warned of what you have advised others as
              it will come back to claim you.</p>
              <p>Don't be a moderator if you are unable to resist the temptations
              of joining the wrong crowd to give morally incorrect
              encouragements to forumers in need of help.</p>

              <p>This is a public forum and everyone is entitled to have their own viewpoint.  Just so long people don't start insulting etc, everyone is welcome to participate in the discussion.</p>
              <p>Obviously you have issues with my point of view, that's completely fine with me.  However, I appreciate that you stop making false accusation or assumption that I am taking side. FYI, I don't even know rainee in person other than that she is one of the forumers of Sgforums.</p>
              <p>Whether I am fit to be a moderator or not, well again, everyone has a different viewpoint and expectation.  I am not here to please everyone so if you really have an issue with me here, you have a choice not to post on AA.  However, if you want to continue to participate in the discussions, you're most welcome to do so just so long as you would refrain yourself from making further derogatory comments to anyone!</p>
              <p>Your cooperation is much appreciated!</p>

              <p><br> You truly do not LOVE your parents at all.</p>
              <p>Please only talk about terms and conditions with strangers and
              friends, but not to your own parents!</p>
              <p>What kind of love are you showing to your own parents if you
              don't even LOVE them enough to OBEY THEM?</p>
              <p>How would you feel if one day your daughter also shares the same
              thinking as you? Even though you will treat your daughter better,
              but that doesn't means you won't be put into the same situation as
              your parents are facing from you at the present.</p>
              <p>You know your parents aren't as bad as you make them out to be,
              there are worse parents out there and there are also many living
              examples of children who have overcame situations like this with
              their own LOVE!</p>
              <p>Do you really expect to bring your parents down on their knees
              and restrained themselves to live their remaining lives to do your
              bidding and die in the way that you would've wanted of them?</p>
              <p>Drop this entire ego thing for the sake of your own future, and
              go humbled yourself before your parents and let them know that you
              LOVE them and do love them for as long as you lived.</p>
              <p>Don't be like many of the forumers here who do are not wise
              enough to appreciate their own parents and even have the
              unthinkable thoughts of going against their own parents who have
              painfully brought them onto this world and brought them up to be an
              independent individuals.</p>
              <p>You can do better than them and you have the choice to correct
              your life right where you parents would've wanted you to
              become.</p>

              <p>u must find out what they want ultimately, guess no use playing high and seek with them...u plus both ya parents age can be 100 plus yrs old le not children anymore. u will have to piece together bit by bit like jigsaw puzzle what they do with the money back then. this is a way to start finding out their real intentions. i say again NO BEATING AROUND THE BUSH! Small details like where they spend the money on also very impt. just liken it like police investigation of a murder like tt.</p>
