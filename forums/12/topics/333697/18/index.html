              <p><br> All parents want to be involved in managing their children's
              future....no matter how old their children may be. Don't you want
              to be in that role in your children's future too? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>I'm happy to hear that you have that desire to reconcile with
              your parents one day. If I were you, I would return that managing
              power back to my parents and make them feel useful and needed to be
              managing some parts of my life.</p>
              <p>I would've allowed my parents to make the decisions for my
              wedding banquet, seeked their opinions on houses (what kind,
              type, location, price, what to look out for...so on and so
              on).</p>
              <p>One thing we must know is, parents always must nags at us no
              matter how well we have done in our lives. Parents will always
              seems impossible to satisfy and be agreeable. That is because they
              do not want to feel redundant or even ended up as a burden or
              useless to their children. So please allow them to nag at you and
              be prepared for it ok?</p>
              <p>I do not know your parents personally, so I might not be able to
              give you specific advice on what you should do.</p>
              <p>But seek their opinions and advices on some areas in your life
              to make them feel useful and wanted and needed by you. And also
              allowed them to feel they played an important role of managing you
              and your lives, so that you can see how proud they are of you in
              the future.</p>
              <p>It may be difficult for you to see where I'm coming from, but
              you will be able to see what I meant when you become a mother and
              you will see your relationship with your parents will automatically
              be revealed to alot much easier for you to understand than you had
              expected.</p>
              <p>Do not rushed and expect them to change overnight, be patient
              and things can and will only get better for you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Ok, I give you credit, finally you said something that made sense.</p>
              <p>Of course I will let them play a part in it, just that now they are in Malaysia so it is hard for them to play a 100% role in the preparation due to the distance and also because they are unfamiliar with all the procedures involved. I have already told them that once I have narrowed down my house choices I will bring them to look at the houses and help me choose. I will do the same for the banquet as well, once I have narrowed down the choices I will bring them along to test the food, etc. And for the KL dinner, I will seek their help to recommend a restaurant as I am not too familiar with that area.</p>

              <p>Maybe you should have your wedding banquet first?</p>
              <p>I believed your parents are probably worried because as a
              girl in the marriage, you are at a disadvantage if both of
              you haven't been formally introduced to all your relatives of
              your marriage through the wedding banquet.</p>
              <p>It's a common fear that most parents would have for their
              daughters, they are afraid that situations may change in your
              marriage in the future and it's important for them to see you
              having a "name" or status in the marriage by having at least
              a wedding banquet.</p>
