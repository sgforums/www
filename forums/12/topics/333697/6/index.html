              <p>It perfectly makes sense. Cause u can derive ur statement from
              my stated situation. Its fair enough also to say, we sometimes
              forget the love and care our parents put into us ah. Thats why now
              grown up liaw.. i am more forgiving and understanding. I hated
              thier guts when i was 17 yrs through out to 21. I kanpo after a
              siblings meeting, which made alot of sense in why sometimes our
              parents acted the way they did. Thier difference in background ,
              discipline , the times they struggled to come out successful. Even
              with a broken marriage , financially they have done extremely well.
              That to me was the price . Like all things, they come with a
              price.Â </p>

              <p>try to see if they can accept deposite one month or less before the wedding. if not tell them just put a few hundred as a downpayment to book the date. pay the rest of the deposite later. then use yr credit card to pay for it. by the time the bill comes. wedding is over n u have cash to pay back.</p>

              <p>well, all the best to you la. By saying more may just complicate u further.</p>
              <p>Sometimes if they truly meant to care, they shouldve done it ages ago.. not when we are already extremely independant all grown up liaw with individual goals to achieve. Thats what happens when u train ur kids to be extremely independent, they have little or sometimes no regards to other people except thier own. And its hard to tell them what to do especially things like this.</p>

              <p>another way that some couples fund their weddings.</p>
              <p>parents invite whoever they want but they pay for the tables. then they will have the rights to the ang paus from the people they invite.</p>
              <p>so if he wants face. he gets to invite all the people he wants n he can carry the burden of profit n loss.</p>

              <p>What I believe is that the place we live in affects the meaning of wedding dinner. In order to have a wedding dinner in SG, it uses up alot of money. Given a new couple who just started working, it's not really feasible not to think like that especially when there is little financial help from the in-laws.</p>

              <p>My parents are actually helping alot. They know that we are saving for a house.... so they decide to sell off the current house (at AMK), shift to somewhere near where we intend to get in the future so that we can get the 40k grant from HDB. And also help as in helping us pay some of the housing downpayment.</p>

              <p>try to see if they can accept deposite one month or less before

              then use yr credit card to pay for it. by the time the bill comes.
