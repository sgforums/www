              <p>Hi rainee, you've stated that they'd like to know more about your situation in Singapore, and have 'face'.</p>
              <p>Not sure if this was already posted, but I think the best solution would be to get them to move over to Singapore, sell the properties in Malaysia, and buy a bigger house for your whole family. Now they've a lot of face, and can go around boasting that their precious daughter bought them a new house in Singapore...blah blah.</p>
              <p>After they move over, they'll see that life isn't easy in Singapore, and it certainly isn't some gold miner's dream. Hopefully, they'd understand and 'help out' in your banquet preparation. After all, they'd want to invite their friends/relatives from Malaysia to Singapore to attend the wedding banquet...more 'face'. Moreover, you can save spending on two separate banquets.</p>
              <p>Of course, all parties must be agreeable...seek your hubby's opinion asap before you decide.</p>

              <p>I see, had guessed so. <br><br>It's nice of you to share the financial burden with your hubby...but try not to worry and get too emotional.

              <p>They're demanding, but I believe they do love you and not wish to drive you up against a wall. It shocks me however, to see how they try to control your life even after you're married.

              <p>Just for comparison's sake, my company only pays mid-line managers in JB/KL about RM $3,000RM /mnth, whereas Singaporean line managers gets about ~ S$3.5K - S$4.5K /mth. Based on the current conversion rate of 2.4:1, Singaporeans are paid about 3 times more. So in order to sustain the same amount of contribution to your parents, you'll need to find a job in Malaysia that pays you 3 times more than the average line-managers.</p>

              Just want to add, yes it is possible, parents do not always want the best for their kids/kind to them.
              
              It took me two years after i got married to be able to afford my own house. I didn't really hold any banquet, just that my hubby and I were only 24-25 when we got married. thereason? so we can stay together without my mum losing face. At that time, i'd worked for a yr plus and he 9 months only.
              
              then staying with my parents, my mum made me give $700 every month. she would threaten to throw out my things everytime we have arguments. and she loves to say bad things abt my hubby that are not true. she never thought, oh, i want my kids to be able to afford a house so I ask for less money. that's why it took us so long to be able to afford a flat too.

                                Marriage marks the bonding between two people and their
                                FAMILIES.</p>
                                <p>It is not always necessary for the bride and groom to foot the
                                bills for the wedding reception and it should be as affordable as
                                it can be for both families of the bride and groom.</p>
                                <p>If either families preferred a granduer wedding reception, then
                                both families should work together with the bride and groom to
                                decide the best possible wedding reception affordable.</p>
                                <p>It seems clearly that both families weren't communicating and
                                this could be one of the problems that many forumers here has
                                failed to factor that missing piece of information into rainee's
                                situation. People just plainly read what others type nowadays
                                without much processing and understanding isn't it?</p>
                                <p>If rainee sincerely seeks help from forumers in here, she should
                                be more honest and be transparent about her feelings and her
                                current situation. Withholding information on purpose and
                                especially those informations that may place her in a
                                disadvantageous position in her stance at sgforums may indicated
                                that she might already have a clue that she was in the wrong. Even
                                so, the advices that she received may not be relevant to her
                                current situation as a single piece of additional withheld
                                information could change the composition of the situation entirely.
                                I'm not surprised if she realised that she's not getting the real
                                help that she seeks in here because of that.</p>
                                <p>I would've expected a moderator to give better and neutral
                                advice to rainee. Just because people here knows her more than her
                                parents, doesn't means they should be taking sides with her and
                                support her even though what she was doing or thinking is wrong and
                                without morals.</p>
                                <p>If the TS wasn't rainee and it was some nobody that nobody knew
                                about, then people wouldn't have felt obliged to take sides
                                and would've change their stance to neutral and advised more
                                sensibly. So as a moderator, don't take sides and do give sensible
                                advices to other forumers who needed help.</p>
                                <p>Advising children to go against their parents is definitely a
                                BAD advice to suggest. If you are a parent and people suggested to
                                your child/children to go against you, what would you feel? Would
                                you have agreed with those advices too?</p>
                                <p>Children don't and will never have that luxury of choosing their
                                parents in their life, that is the law of nature and it is there
                                for us to respect and obey.</p>
                                <p>Whoever agrees with advices that encourages children to go
                                against their own parents will one day find themselves in the
                                parents position. So be warned of what you have advised others as
                                it will come back to claim you.</p>
                                <p>Don't be a moderator if you are unable to resist the temptations
                                of joining the wrong crowd to give morally incorrect
                                encouragements to forumers in need of help.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> It probably culturally constructed for parents to love their children, as well as for children to be filial. But in reality, it can creates a cognitive dissonance, especially if reality seemed to suggest otherwise.</p>
              <p>Abuse comes in many form and the act of abuse often sow the seed to reproduce a latent effect in the future. In Rainee's case, the absence of kinship created a situation where she don't feel very much for her parents as these are but the manifestation of the cause sow by her parents during her growing years.</p>
              <p>But since we are bounded by culture - there is still an unseen obligation Rainee to care for her parents. Surely, if this element was missing, I wouldn't be no surprise if she opt to cut ties. But of course in reality, there is only so much of freewill one can choose to have - because many choices are fettered by societal context and culture. Especially in Asia.</p>
              <p>There are definitely no easy solutions, but I would like to point out something: your parents didn't seemed to change their attitude or stance towards you since young. They seemed to practice some sort of guilt-induction, so as to bend you according to their expectation. Most parents does that sort of thing in varying intensity, but those that exploit the relationship will often create domestic tragedy, like those you find in newspaper articles.</p>
              <p>For this: I say listen to yourself. If you are not ready, then you are not ready. Acting upon a decision recklessly, while knowing that it's not wise, is foolish. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"> </p>

              <p> But hor.. JB is really not that far away from Singapore lah.</p>
              <p>Why can't you just arrange the ceremony in JB and have the Singapore relatives go over instead ?</p>
              <p>All you need to do is arrange for hotel rooms for the convenience of your Singapore attendees...</p>
              <p>And I'm sure the cost is much lower than in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2 family arrangement will seem much bigger than one. The whole occasion will look more grand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I used to go over to JB to attend my friend's wedding quite often before.. So.. I don't see why you couldn't do it either.</p>

              <p>My in laws prefer to do it in Singapore. And quite a lot of our friends are also here in Singapore. If we do it in JB, it would be inconvenient for them plus the cost of booking hotel rooms for all of them would be too much for us to bear. Cannot just let them stay in some kinda cheapo and unsafe hotel also...</p>
              <p>Yea, I will hold my ground and carry on with my original plan...take things one step at a time...</p>

              <p>Maybe you all think I should be big-hearted enough to forget everything and forgive...but I have tried to do that to no avail. So please do try to understand your child now or in the future, instead of beating or abusing them when things don't go according to your plan. It can leave a very deep mark which can be very hard to be erased once it is there...</p>
