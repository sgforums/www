From young till now, my family has always been looked down upon but my eldest uncle's wife, whose attitude and mouth is quite bad. I pity my mum who needs to hear things that's demeaning and insulting even though it may not be a direct one. And why all this?? money...<br><br>I may not come from well to do family but at least my family is self sufficient, sometimes we may SEEM to encounter some financial difficulties bcos my dad is not very educated and he holds a low paying job and my mum's working part time. However, we do not need pple's help in any ways and i'm really grateful that my uncles and aunties like to give me some money occasionally bcos they do to award me for my efforts in school, currently pursuing a degree.<br><br>Story goes like this ( heard from my mum since young)......<br><br>When my mum was a few mths pregnant, my mum stayed in the hospital for a few days. During that time, my 7th uncle n his current wife (not married yet) was staying in my flat for FREE when they were still young. During the few days when my mum was in hospital, my aunt/uncle brought another couple to my house as they were their frens from msia, not informing my parents at all until my dad came home and discovered it when he came home cos he's in the hospital accompanying my mum and nv go hm for days. HOW thoughtful..<br><br>......... few years later, my 7th uncle became slightly richer, did quite well in his job, and got recognition from my eldest aunt, i was like 5 to 6. First incident that sparked off the unhappiness, it was CNY and we're all at my grandparents house. During dinner time, the eldest aunt of mine who was GOU YAN KAN REN DI tt time said loudly that she wanna "reserve" the chicken drumstick for my 7th uncle's son who was 2 yrs younger than me, maybe it doesn't sound wrong but tt's how she favoured the 7th uncle. And for her info, i hated drumsticks and like wings and chicken breast instead.. lol..<br><br>..... btw the yrs there're some events lk my 7th uncle didnt do tt well in job, owe pple money, the eldest son also owe pple money and my other uncles and aunties hv to help them repay the debts and up till now still haven't repay and her own husband borrowed few k from my dad lk 20 yrs ago to repay debts and also nv return and she got scolded by my 7th aunt and my dad won 4D few yrs back and she became slightly better, or seeing me doing well in sch, compared to cousin, son of 7th uncle who was not that academically inclined etc etc.. what made me wanna post this is bcos my mum told me that the auntie called her up and asked her whether our family needed any help for my education, can go approach my 8th uncle or the 6th one bcos they're single and they are the ones who helped those screwed up pple pay their debts. My mum said dun need bcos we can afford.. a few days later, that aunt called up and asked the same thing again, as if we'll borrow money from her, this rly pissed my mum off and she said she wun be that nice if tt aunt called up again, asking the stupid qn again.<br><br>money money money, cause of all troubles...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I got one personal story which relates to money and relative problem.<br>My mother side family owns a bungalow in China, and the property developer wants to demolish it for building apartments. Since my mother has a lot of siblings ( 4 male, 8 female ), and when the bungalow was demolished, many problem surfaced. First, the money which they got from the developers was solely entitled to the 4 sons, and the females didn't get a share of it. The eldest uncle was the greediest, wanting most of the money and got into bad relationship with my family, which is as good as severing ties. To think he was working in a government related job. That shows how greedy China people are.<br>FYI, I was born in Singapore.</div>
