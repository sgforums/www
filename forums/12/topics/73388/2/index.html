I still think about him, miss him, see him... i want to let him know that i still feel something, i still feel weak in the knees..<br><br>but if i do that... it will only make me more repulsive.<br><br>and i have a boyfriend now... i met my ex on a sat to give myself a 'closure' because i always thought there was something wrong with me so he broke up with me. But I look better now and i know it's not me. So it was a good meet-up though we never talked about our past relationship- and i never told my boyfriend about the meeting because there's no point in it.<br><br>it will only hurt him.

            <div class='col-md body'>people refuse to ask for a patch not because they can really move on, it just pride matter. Actualy, if you really love someone so much before, you cant really say you move on metally and if you do, that means you didnt love the person in the first place. Its not just about self pity...  I dont tink you can move on really metally if someone close like your grandfather etc passed away.... yeah.. you may do what you need to do... you refuse the patch, to sit down and eventually might solve the problem... they choose to escape like a coward(no offense) and because of pride and some end up dwelling in misery. Solitude triggers memories often too painful too bear. people are all indiviually different, there is often differences, a good and healthy relationship means sorting out differences and not everytime a problem occur = breakup . if there is the case nv had one relationship because every person you meet is going to be different.</div>
