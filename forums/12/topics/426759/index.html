              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Hi people, I am kind of confused now... I could not write more into details due to some circumstances but I try to give as much as possible and I hope u guys can help me.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I will be graduating soon and I have been under the tutelage of my teacher AA for the last six months. He is a rare gem in my course of study and he is helpful and caring to his students and sometimes he could even stay beyond office hours to help us. He is well liked in school. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Because of his caring n helpful character, I just felt normal whenever he was helping me; it’s only until 3 months ago that I start to feel that he is more concern for me than the rest of the class. And later, the class starts to feel it too. Jealousy spills and they start to talk about him liking me and vice versa behind our backs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">There is even once when they wanted to take a picture of AA and me in a consultation behind our backs. I turned back and stared at them. I guessed that AA heard them too but he did not react and he just went on with the consultation as normal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">After that he became more focused and caring to me and my classmates start to gossip more about us...</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I always had a great deal of respect for him and nothing else more. I did not think of him in anyway romantic as I know it would affect his career, personal relationship, reputation in society. but recently I am abit confused about my feelings and I related this issue to my closer friends and they told me that probably I am moved by his care and concern for me. Recently I teared as I thought of myself leaving school soon and I don’t get to see him in future... </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">They also said that he might have a crush on me but he knows that it’s impossible between us and there’s no future so he tries to compensate it by helping me more than the others...</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I am not sure of his feelings but I hope it is not as what my friends told me above. But up till now, he did not act in anyway intimate or sleazy to me and everything is dealt with professionalism.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I am a legal adult and he is a few years older than me. I am mature so don’t worry about sex issues and I am not going to create any trouble for him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I will see him a few times more so this is how much I will tell now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Before I end off, I have a desire to go up to him on the last day of school and ask him why he treats me so well and helped me so much. Do u people think it is appropriate of me to do so? Or are there any other better options I could try to do?</span></p>

              <p>It is appropriate.</p>
              <p>Just ask it in a jokingly manner and not too serious - You two might end up in an awkard scenario.</p>
              <p>And also, from what i read.... My personal opinions..</p>
              <p>- You are having a crush on that teacher of yours hence the topic. If you have no feelings for that teacher asking a question that normal should be no problem.</p>
              <p>- It is normal for teachers to have favourites, most teachers have certain "star pupil" in their books. Your friends probably sparked rumors and etc from jealously.</p>
              <p>I guess the option for you now is to determine/overcome your feelings for that teacher....</p>
              <p>Just my opinion.</p>

              <p>I cannot predict anything but still, i think if you can ask that question in a casual manner you will get the answer you are so loooonging to find out, without any negative effects.</p>
              <p>Its hard to ask especially since you are likely having feelings for him, i can understand when i picture myself in your shoes.</p>
              <p>Or you can just move on like what mancha said.</p>

              <p>Let me explain the mechanics of the crush.</p>
              <p>At the start, you were normal, that is because you have not been feeding your subconscious that he is treating you special.</p>
              <p>Slowly you began to build up on that. He is treating you special, he is treating you special, he is treating you special. It goes on and on until you believe it. Others notice it. You become more receptive to this care, but he on his part just goes on normal, and because of your receptiveness, give you that bit of extra coaching. This then makes you feed your subconscious again, that it is true he likes you, and you begin to have feelings for him. You made yourself have a crush on him.</p>
              <p>Don't ask him if he has "special" feelings on the last day, just say thank you with a present.</p>
              <p>Keep it at teacher/student level and things will be great, for now and the future.</p>
              <p>Don't go for him, go for  your career.</p>

              <p>Always!</p>
              <p>Everytime when  I am on a course or lecture, I will feel that I am special to someone there, and that person would look as if she likes me.</p>
              <p>I would approach her and talk to her, and everything is always smiley and dovey. And I would start thinking like you did. But at the end, I would just be on my way.</p>
              <p>Its all in my mind.</p>
