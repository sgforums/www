              <p>Hi.....</p>
              <p>Are you a pretty girl in school ?</p>
              <p>If you are a pretty girl..........it is very possible that the teacher like you romantically.....</p>
              <p>Another question I wanna ask is.......are you especially good in certain subjects, or especially dilligent and meticulous in them ?</p>
              <p>If the answer is yes.....then maybe he does not like you romantically but just like you and pay more attention to you because you are a star student who is very talented.</p>
              <p>(this happens to me once)</p>
              <p>So I believe by thinking over those 2 questions......you can see the likely answer.....</p>
              <p>Also, another thing is.......</p>
              <p>Your friends / your peers are smart.....they see and can guess what is going on....</p>
              <p>So if your friends are saying something, and lots of them are saying it, then it is possible that they are correct.</p>
              <p>If your friends have been saying that your teacher likes you romantically, I believe they must be at least partially correct. They wont misjudge or misread the situation totally.</p>
              <p>I believe the best way for you is this :</p>
              <p>- if it is true that all signs point to the teacher having a crush and a special liking to you,</p>
              <p>I recommend you just take it as an exprience and then move on with your life. You can remember it as something unique or interesting or sweet. But no need to take any further action.</p>
              <p>Do not go and ask the teacher specifically, "why are you treating me so good", there is no need to vocalize this and bring this out to the open.</p>
              <p>Some things is better left unsaid.</p>
              <p>I do not recommend bringing it out to the open, or do any other action which escalate or destabilize the relationship.</p>
              <p>By the way, dont think too much about it either, because you and him are not suitable for any relationship once the school term is over. He will go back to his girlfriend, you will go on with your life (further schooling or working), and there is age gap and life-stage gap between the two of you.</p>
              <p>It's something which happen for a short period or a window in your both's life.</p>
              <p>So leave it at that.</p>
              <p>Dont talk or say anything to him openly.</p>
              </div>

              <p>i am neither of those 2 points u said above. i am just normal looking, there is alot of girls, and also much prettier girls than me in class. Its a situation where u can see A-listers who are pretty and more dilligent more social and vocal and dress up nicer than me.<br>he is not like those normal teachers who will look out and cater to star students only. if he is, he wouldnt have helped me so much.</p>
              <p>i know he speaks out alot for me even in front of the other teachers. there's once the other teachers make fun of him when he tries to do so.</p>
              <p>i did not ask him any of the questions i desired to know. perhaps i did the right thing, i just took my things and go, while walking off, i turned back and saw him looking at me...</p>

              <p>Well....if his teachers colleagues have made jokes about it........then it's too noticable......</p>
              <p>Anyways I believe you must be careful.....because something I dont like about teacher-student relationship is..........it is an abuse of position.</p>
              <p>Since he is your teacher, maybe you think he is caring, attentive, kind, etc,...that is because he is your teacher who is supposed to teach and guide you........what if you meet him on the streets or on other settings and situations and he is not your teacher, would you develop any relations with him and would your impressions be the same? This is what I dont like about these kinds of teachers because I feel they are taking advantage of their position to seduce young girls.</p>
              <p> You should also learn from this experience, because next time after you go out to work, maybe you will meet some kind and attentive boss, and I hope you can draw some lessons from this episode so that next time you know how to behave to those people who are seemingly so kind to you exceeding the normal or usual expectations.</p>
