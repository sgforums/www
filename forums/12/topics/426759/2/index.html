              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">i think probably some people misunderstood what i was trying to say. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Courier New"; color: black; font-size: 10pt;   ' lang="EN-US">          o</span><span style="color: black; font-size: 7pt;  " lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">        </span></span><em><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black; " lang="EN-US">Because of his caring n helpful character, I just felt normal whenever he was helping me; it’s only until 3 months ago that I start to feel that he is more concern for me than the rest of the class. And later, the class starts to feel it too. Jealousy spills and they start to talk about him liking me and vice versa behind our backs.</span></em><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">although i started to feel that he is more concerned for me than the rest of the class, i still find it kind of normal because in my course, you can see clearly some teachers treating their "pet students" slightly better.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">but from then on, his helpfulness escalated to something which i feel not that simple as treating me as his "star pupil" or "pet student". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">he always excuses himself to go to the toilet or somewhere before my consultation. i dont have fixed consultation time so its random timings. its always at reaching my turn then he had to go toilet, and come back refreshed and neat and after popping a mint into his mouth that he can sit down and do consultation with me.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">my class had to bundle each of our stuffs up, everyone is busy and we had only one roll of raffia to share. he took scissors , cut the raffia string, and help me tie my stuffs. he never help the rest. and i never even asked him for help.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">i think he is always watching out for me, everytime i needed help or i have difficulty with something, he will be there before i call out for help.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">he asked me stupid and redundant questions. for example, there once when everyone is supposed to pack our things to bring down to store or bring back home, he came to help me open the door when i am leaving, and then he asked me where am i going (which is like duh!!!) and i replied him "Home lor!!" and he blushed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">in my first post where i said that my classmates are trying to take photos behind our backs... that's because they saw AA and me sitting on the floor having consultation. ok now i felt abit stupid in that scene then... but normally he had consultation with others either standing up or sitting on chairs. i dont know why he is so comfortable with me til he can sit on the floor and make me sit beside him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">but afterall these things said above, everything is dealt with professionalism and he had never been hanky-panky with me. we never crossed the line of a normal teacher and student relationship.</span></p>

              <p>it's possible that you're smarter or showing more interest in
                                      what he's teaching, compared to other uninterested students. he
                                      appreciates you and pays more attention to you, coming to like you
                                      and care about what you think of him. it's a cycle of good. where

              <p>Let's put it this way:</p>
              <p>Asking him a question like this regardless of WHEN you ask it - its merely to gratify  a curiosity on the source of his kindness.</p>
              <p>Teachers are human. When we meet a student who is more precocious, more teachable, more willing to learn  - suddenly it makes all the extra effort and time you spend worth it. You don't mind doing more for the student because you know that an exxtra hour you spend with this one kid will help him/her go miles further than other peers who simply don't have a more receptive attitude. As a teacher, when I meet students like this, I can say that I feel very fond of them - and even when you stop teaching them, you enjoy seeing them grow up into better people. Professionally, that is the joy of teaching - the emotional satisfaction that you rarely can achieve with other jobs.</p>
              <p>Same for students, when there is an adult who stops judging you, and instead just focuses on caring for you and helping you to improve - the attention can be very touching. Not only that - it is also very fulfilling.</p>
              <p>You sound pretty matured for your age - and my suggestion to you is the best way you can thank your teacher for his efforts is to appreciate it for what it is - and ignore whatever rumours or ideas your friends are planting in your head. Focus on what it is you are trying to improve, and thank the fates that you met a 'gui ren' someone who helps you along in your life to achieve greater heights. Treat him professionally and thank you with sincerity. This will help him to become a better teacher - and for you to become a better student.</p>

              <p>well i just feel that probably telling more wont harm much, because</p>
              <p>1. there is nothing for me to hide and nothing embarrassing i wrote. its not like i am writing thoughts of sleazyness or icky bits like those teeny girls.</p>
              <p>2. probably telling more will get me better comments from people. Thanks everyone!</p>
              <p>3. the days i will see him are countable in one hand. and most likely i wont see him after that.</p>
              <p>4. if he really saw my post , well, if he wants to answer me, he will. if not he will act like as if he saw nothing.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Hi people, I am kind of confused now... I could not write more into details due to some circumstances but I try to give as much as possible and I hope u guys can help me.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I will be graduating soon and I have been under the tutelage of my teacher AA for the last six months. He is a rare gem in my course of study and he is helpful and caring to his students and sometimes he could even stay beyond office hours to help us. He is well liked in school.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Because of his caring n helpful character, I just felt normal whenever he was helping me; it’s only until 3 months ago that I start to feel that he is more concern for me than the rest of the class. And later, the class starts to feel it too. Jealousy spills and they start to talk about him liking me and vice versa behind our backs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">There is even once when they wanted to take a picture of AA and me in a consultation behind our backs. I turned back and stared at them. I guessed that AA heard them too but he did not react and he just went on with the consultation as normal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">After that he became more focused and caring to me and my classmates start to gossip more about us...</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I always had a great deal of respect for him and nothing else more. I did not think of him in anyway romantic as I know it would affect his career, personal relationship, reputation in society. but recently I am abit confused about my feelings and I related this issue to my closer friends and they told me that probably I am moved by his care and concern for me. Recently I teared as I thought of myself leaving school soon and I don’t get to see him in future...</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">They also said that he might have a crush on me but he knows that it’s impossible between us and there’s no future so he tries to compensate it by helping me more than the others...</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I am not sure of his feelings but I hope it is not as what my friends told me above. But up till now, he did not act in anyway intimate or sleazy to me and everything is dealt with professionalism.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I am a legal adult and he is a few years older than me. I am mature so don’t worry about sex issues and I am not going to create any trouble for him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">I will see him a few times more so this is how much I will tell now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">Before I end off, I have a desire to go up to him on the last day of school and ask him why he treats me so well and helped me so much. Do u people think it is appropriate of me to do so? Or are there any other better options I could try to do?</span></p>

              <p>Wah, yer story remind me of tat Drew Barrymore movie "Never Been Kiss before".</p>
              <p>So similar wan leh.</p>
              <p>I think u shld do the rite thing by keeping distance from him. He shld do the same too. It is not rite for teacher-student to start relationship.</p>
              <p>U still young, got a lot of guys will go after u, so no need to be desperate for teacher.</p>
              <p>Anyway, u r gal rite? If I am not mistaken.</p>
              <p>Unless u r guy, then woohoo, very complicated.</p>

                              <p>Let's put it this way:</p>
              <p>Asking him a question like this regardless of WHEN you ask it -
              its merely to gratify  a curiosity on the source of his
              kindness.</p>
              <p>Teachers are human. When we meet a student who is more
              precocious, more teachable, more willing to learn  - suddenly
              it makes all the extra effort and time you spend worth it. You
              don't mind doing more for the student because you know that an
              exxtra hour you spend with this one kid will help him/her go miles
              further than other peers who simply don't have a more receptive
              attitude. As a teacher, when I meet students like this, I can say
              that I feel very fond of them - and even when you stop teaching
              them, you enjoy seeing them grow up into better people.
              Professionally, that is the joy of teaching - the emotional
              satisfaction that you rarely can achieve with other jobs.</p>
              <p>Same for students, when there is an adult who stops judging you,
              and instead just focuses on caring for you and helping you to
              improve - the attention can be very touching. Not only that - it is
              also very fulfilling.</p>
              <p>You sound pretty matured for your age - and my suggestion to you
              is the best way you can thank your teacher for his efforts is to
              appreciate it for what it is - and ignore whatever rumours or ideas
              your friends are planting in your head. Focus on what it is you are
              trying to improve, and thank the fates that you met a 'gui ren'
              someone who helps you along in your life to achieve greater
              heights. Treat him professionally and thank you with sincerity.
              This will help him to become a better teacher - and for you to
              become a better student.</p>

              thats a very good reply there and judging frm the way u speak i reckon u are a teacher too. i believe that at times it takes one to know one. so i wld suggest TS to really believe in wad ShrodingersCat is trying to tell you. Honestly i dun tink he's trying to seriously overcome that line of teacher and student but he's probably fond of u as a student and in that sense, real teaching joy probably come frm seeing ur own students excelling not only in studies and also in person. With that mentality in mind, thats probably the reason why he acted that way. U are probably v lucky to have met some1 like him.

              <p>Hi.....</p>
              <p>Are you a pretty girl in school ?</p>
              <p>If you are a pretty girl..........it is very possible that the teacher like you romantically.....</p>
              <p>Another question I wanna ask is.......are you especially good in certain subjects, or especially dilligent and meticulous in them ?</p>
              <p>If the answer is yes.....then maybe he does not like you romantically but just like you and pay more attention to you because you are a star student who is very talented.</p>
              <p>(this happens to me once)</p>
              <p>So I believe by thinking over those 2 questions......you can see the likely answer.....</p>
              <p>Also, another thing is.......</p>
              <p>Your friends / your peers are smart.....they see and can guess what is going on....</p>
              <p>So if your friends are saying something, and lots of them are saying it, then it is possible that they are correct.</p>
              <p>If your friends have been saying that your teacher likes you romantically, I believe they must be at least partially correct. They wont misjudge or misread the situation totally.</p>
              <p>I believe the best way for you is this :</p>
              <p>- if it is true that all signs point to the teacher having a crush and a special liking to you,</p>
              <p>I recommend you just take it as an exprience and then move on with your life. You can remember it as something unique or interesting or sweet. But no need to take any further action.</p>
              <p>Do not go and ask the teacher specifically, "why are you treating me so good", there is no need to vocalize this and bring this out to the open.</p>
              <p>Some things is better left unsaid.</p>
              <p>I do not recommend bringing it out to the open, or do any other action which escalate or destabilize the relationship.</p>
              <p>By the way, dont think too much about it either, because you and him are not suitable for any relationship once the school term is over. He will go back to his girlfriend, you will go on with your life (further schooling or working), and there is age gap and life-stage gap between the two of you.</p>
              <p>It's something which happen for a short period or a window in your both's life.</p>
              <p>So leave it at that.</p>
              <p>Dont talk or say anything to him openly.</p>
