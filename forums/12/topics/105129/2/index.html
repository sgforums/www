Next week gonna have the entire art society over for dinner at my place for pot luck, a few of them were quite enthusiastic, and that makes me feel better for some reason heh.<br><br>Called a girl up and asked if wanna hang out sometime, she said she had church camp and would let me know when she free. Same thing with another girl who said would let me know her schedule at some stage.. Although my cynical side says, its just a polite way of telling one to fuck off.. i like to believe this is aNYTHING but negative. Also called up another friend, gonna watch a movie next week when he's free. And a friend will be returning from oz next week, will call her and meet up. Oh and tomorrow is graduation nite thing, even though i feel it will suck with me being alone, i'll still go and hang out there positively. Then saturday and sunday is filming week with my crew and our parodies.<br><br>I guess i must keep myself active.</div></blockquote>k</div>

All your energy is directed inward and your mind is constipated. You feel depressed.<br>When you are an extrovert, your mind frees up because you are focused outside of yourself.

By achieving these, try being a 'servant'.  Let me explain.<br><br>1. Knowing yourself - understand your needs and your attitudes and behaviour. Take note of issues like, not tactful, big mouth, not considerate, etc... and maintain the good points about yourself.  In short, upgrade your personality.. and not fake it out.<br><br>2. Try to relax and love yourself.  Loving yourself will help others to love you.  This means that you have to learn to accept the facts of life, stop whining and move on.  Read up self-help books if you want to but do bare in mind that you are different from others so please stop comparing yourself to others.  They don't have what you have/experience and you don't have theirs.  (note: all winners are borned a loser, they ultimately win because they never allow themselves to go into depression and keep motivating themself to move on regardless of hardship)<br><br>3. Being a social 'servant'.  Serve others.  Be solf spoken and be actively volunteering to take part and help out.  Try avoid expecting what others can offer you but think about what you can offer others. Hmm.. ever try helping out at the People Association Youth Club or something?<br><br></div>
