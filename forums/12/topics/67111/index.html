            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... I understand your points of views, it's just unfortuntate that I must tell you it is virtually impossible to have a relationship with a serious christian if you are a non-believer. Soon or later you will find yourself starting to compete with Jesus for his/her attention. People may say that love can overcome all... but unfortunately in this case it's also a case of love vs. love. Human relational love versus a soul's love for his King... and in a christian context, the latter love is far, far more powerful and important.  I tell you the truth, sometimes even this kind of problem can be found in christian couples... if one is on and one is not so on. To a christian, our God is above all, even our relationships.<br><br>Is it any wonder there's so much friction when it comes to this.<br><br>Understandly I understand all the cursing and swearing over this issue, but I'm afraid it's not really gonna change much in the past or in the future. If you want a relationship with a christian, your best bet is a half-past-six one who dosen't take it seriously. I'm sure they are a lot of them around.<br><br>For the rest of us, we identify with this song:<br><br>What a beautiful smile<br>A radiant girl<br>Fell in love first time I saw her<br>She stays on my mind<br>IÂ’d give anything<br>To know everything about her<br><br>Pre-Chorus:<br>ThereÂ’s light in her eyes<br>And I know itÂ’s all for him<br>She carries on and on<br>Like he was her best friend<br><br>Chorus:<br>SheÂ’s in love (echo)<br>ItÂ’s not hard to see<br>But I would like to believe it was with me<br>Someone got a hold of her heart<br>And he wonÂ’t let go<br>And I know<br>SheÂ’s in love<br><br>Verse2:<br>She looks to the sky<br>When she talks about him<br>She believes he hung the moon<br>Said he had to go away<br>She waits for his return<br>Says heÂ’s coming for her soon<br><br>Pre-Chorus2:<br>How can this be fair?<br>This guy can walk on water<br>DonÂ’t guess IÂ’ve got a prayer<br>HeÂ’s written love letters - to reach her<br><br>Bridge:<br>She worships the ground he walks on<br>She just smiles when she says his name<br>ItÂ’s a match made in heaven<br>I canÂ’t compete with the King of Kings<br><br>Heh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>

Though I won't be too sure if we go deep into things but I think they're handling it quite well...? Think it should be the appropriate amount of space they leave in between for each other... And yes, respect... Sometimes when you get too deep into the other party's life, it's easy to be dragged in... Do not prejudice against (at least don't show it lah...) others' religion... At the same time you don't have to be pulled in... Your partner would have to weigh for himself/ herself, wanna put the relationship on risk?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, i dun think many people know this, but Christianity is a collective term for Catholics and Protestanism. Like bird is a collective term for 'pigeons' and 'storks' etc. Under Protestanism are all those denominations - 'Presbyterian, methodist, anglican etc'<br><br>I think such problem of ostracising and keeping to their ownselves run more along the protestants, not as a whole, the' christians' cause I am a catholic myself and I do not see this problem. I have seen many marriages of catholics and non-catholics or atheists which work out fine. But it's very very difficult betw a catholic n protestant. My cousin married a protestant and the marriage was almost stopped. It was disastrous, lucky they are fine now and able to work out their differences.<br><br>Most protestants are a very closely banded people who deal mainly with their own people. I am not simply plucking such statements from air. Dun flame me, cause I can back up my statements with facts. But this is another case. I am not flaming protestants or what, this is not a religious thread, i am simply pointing out the differences.<br><br>Generally, a marriage of 2 pple should mainly be of same faith. Any religions would encourage marriage within the same faith, only Islam requires it by law that a muslim marries a muslim as ordered by MUIS. For protestants, situation gets very sticky with them if one is a protestant, while the other is not. As described by some other forumers, there might be ostracizing n stuff like that. So know what u are getting urself into betw u commit urself into a relationship.<br><br>Rgds<br></div>
