I just ask him about the company and finally he admits that this PROPNEX is MLM ( multi level marketing )......wat does he gains from this thing? Like the more people u recruit, the more money you earn and sit there and take people's share without doing anything?</div>

I can't help but laugh when I read yr post.<br><br>I can see that your friend is trying to recruit you but he may not know how to explain things in a clear manner to you.<br><br>Real estate is not MLM as there's no product involved. However, recruitment does have it's benefits for the recruiter as he/she will take a cut from the commission of the deals that you close. However, the person who recruit you would have to be able to help you to solve problems/situations/questions that you encounter during your course of work in real estate. (Believe me, you will encounter diff people with diff problems and if you don't know how to resolve, your credibility as a real estate agent will be lost.) So just take it that the cut from your commission is payment for these on the job coaching.<br><br>To start in real estate, you need basic info on how to do the paper work for diff properties i.e. HDB, private, commercial etc. That's where the courses come in.<br><br>An established real estate agency will provide basic course for you to get to know the ropes of carrying out the transaction, i.e. find customers, match buyer to sellers, official paperwork and collect your commission etc.<br><br>The cost of the basic course will vary according to agencies. Usually would be a few hundred dollars. You should attend free seminars offered by diff agencies before you decide which one you want to join.<br><br>'CEHA - Common Exam for Housing Agent' is a common exam issued by the real estate governing council, taken by real estate agents to test yr knowledge on various aspects of real estate transactions.<br><br>You need NOT have CEHA before you start working as an agent as long as you register with an agency. CEHA will become compulsory by 2008. CEHA is a separate thing from the basic course that you take at the agency to start off your real estate business.<br><br>If you are very familiar with conveyancing laws and regulations and real estate marketing, you can just go for CEHA without taking any courses. Otherwise you better attend CEHA courses before you go for the exam. For folks with a Bachelor in Real Estate from NUS or Conveyancing lawyers, they are exempted from CEHA.<br><br>If you don't trust your friend, go to other agent. Best yet is to attend free seminar offered by real estate agencies and get a feel of the business before you commit yourself.<br><br>Important thing is: Are you able to last at least first 3 months without income? Real estate transaction payment normally pays 3 months later if you are lucky. Some may drag longer.<br><br>Good luck to you!<br><br>-I know coz I'm a real estate agent too and I passed my CEHA already!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> -<br><br></div>
