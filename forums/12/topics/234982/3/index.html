However cowardly the guys are if they still don't make the move, if the gals are interested in them and they have other guys who make the move to know them - they will go for them.<br><br>Guys, don't wait for the gals you are interested to get their boyfriends then you will regret for not making the move.

If she smile and after that do other things or look away then the next time you see her smile to her again.  YOu smile each time you see her and then when you are sure you wanna break the ice by talking to her go ahead.  At least, she is aware of your existence and that she has returned your smile means that she is friendly towards you@!</div>
