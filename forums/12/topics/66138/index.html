To be honest with you I am only an 'O' level holder and I do not have a degree. In fact I am a drop out from Poly too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  Anyway I am a late developer and I am still keen to pursue a further education. Therefore I have done tonnes of research on further education.<br><br>Ok to start with, I think I am more farmiliar with the 'down under'. Not only bcoz I have been the twice (holiday) but I have lots of friend who have studied there or lived there before. as far as Australia is concern, always choose the state uni. With all due respect, that doesn't mean that others are lousy. Put in this way, the state uni are just more recognised lor. I think I might be able to give you a rough breakdown;<br><br>Tuition fee ~ $6k per semester depending what faculty<br>Accomodation ~$150 per week - most would share a house with some friends and that would cut down the cost<br>Transportation ~BUY a car. Its dirt cheap as compare to Singapore. Recent a friend just came back from Australia. He bought a 2nd hand car and drove for a year. Guess how much was the car? $1.2k and he actually manage to sell it off after 1 year for $800. And this car has never died on him for that year when he was driving it. Taxi are ex. More ex than Singapore. Otherwise if you live near the school then I guess you could take bus lor.<br>Food ~ Better start to learn cooking. Dining out is not that cheap either there. Groceries and raw item s are cheap in supermarket though.<br><br>Hope the above breakdown helps.<br><br>As for Informatics, coincidently I have actually worked there before for 2weeks to 'sell' the course to potential students. I don't think I want to discuss about Informatics in the forum in case of sensitive issues. I might PM you instead lor.<br><br>I don't think I am good enough to be a consultant but I am willing to clear your doubts or at least tell you where to find informations if you require them. Drop me a PM and we can discuss further. The reason why I am so enthusiatics to help is bcoz I really love to study but I can't so I hope I can help those who can. So good luck! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Its good to study lor. Ok now back to your question, SMU or SIM? Most people perceived that studying in Singapore is cheaper as compared to oversea. I would say only to a great extent if you are talking about NUS or NTU which is heavily funded by the government. If you compare the tuition fees for SIM or SMU to the Aussie's uni fees, they are about the same. But of course for oversea there is more cost involve lah like accommodation and food, etc, etc,etc....So in that sense, yes studying in Singapore is cheaper lor. BUT don't forget going oversea will gain you not only your degree but on top of that the exposure to various cultures that you may not find in Singapore, hence broaden you contacts, perspective, etc,etc,etc,etc.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
