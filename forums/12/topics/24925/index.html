            <div class='col-md body'>Hi ... just wish to share a story, and hopefully, can get some advices from all of you.<br><br>Started way back in June 1997. Got to know this bunch of friends who i play basketball with. 1 of them "J" who i got very well along with has a girlfriend. I haven seen his girlfriend yet, but from what i gathered from his friends and himself, "G" is a very nice girl. Impression of "G" was pretty alright then, but did not bother too much at that time. I'm still in the party mood.<br><br>Months later, heard from ppl that things were going rocky between "J" and "G". Since "J" is a friend, and i'm also an oper of their school channel, i had no problems finding out what is "G"'s nick over mIRC. Found her, talked to her ...<br><br>The conversation was simpel. What went wrong, what happened. Why it became this bad. Who was at fault. When all this started. Thoughout the conversation, could see she is pretty upset and tired. Upset is too mild a word to use, but can't think of a better word. Indeed, by end of 1997, they broke up soon.<br><br>After that conversation, and after they broke up, if i ever see her online, i do ask to see if she is ok. At first was cause "J" is a good friend of mine, and since "J" was sorta ... bastard before, i just sorta talk to her everytime i see her online.<br><br>From normal conversations turn out to friends. Friends to confidents. From confidents ... to i don't know. The change of events became so sudden, that her and i don't even know how it all started. We just ... feel so much and cared so much over that year and we feel a lot for each other. Mind you, it is still the ONLINE thing.<br><br>Sometime in 1999, i gotten ill. That time, i was working and studying so my health got very poor. My health was not very good in the first place. She warned me of late nights and working all the time, but i was pretty independent at that time. Served me right. Was not able to login to the net for a period of 2 weeks. Totally uncomfortable. When i finally got back online, she thought that i did not want to talk to her anymore. She thought she did something wrong to make me feel angry. LOL. My feelings was messed up that point of time. WHY? Its all an online chat but yet i was crying from the text that i read, and the emotions that i feel from her words.<br><br>I could not sleep that night. I aint too sure for her. I feel very troubled and confused. I want to love her and be there for her. I want the relationship to be REAL. Spoke to her the next day. Wrong move. She told me she could not get over the past. SHe told me she dare not face me. She is not up to it. Fine. Respect her decision. Still friends, but not like before.<br><br>All these continued till .. mid 2000? yea .. she told me the truth. She is very well aware of the feelings from both of us. She feels she is not good enough for me ... and feels i deserve someone else better. Plus, all the emotions and affections were thrown online. How can the real thing happem? Even up till then, i had never seen her BEFORE! So under what position can we say we love each other? I was wondering .. OH NO! 3 years and i finally understand why.<br><br>Sept 2000, her birthday. I got something for her. Pulled a god-brother of hers (also basketball buddy who encouraged me to be with her cause he is aware of my feelings for her and trusts me) to her house vinicity to pass her her present. Waited downstairs from 4:30 till around late evening time. .. around 8? 9? She finally came down and i saw her for the first time. And last time. Neat, decent, and very lovely. If we aknowledge the love between us, it would be a dream come true! She came down ... blushing, red, looking down. Accepted her present, said a soft thank you and RUSHED upstairs. LOL<br><br>Talked to her over the mIRC the same night. Told me that she was really happy to get my gift and to see me. But she still could not accept me cause ... she feel so much inferior. I could not understand how she get to think of so much ... @!#$%! but i still comforted her and tried to cool her down.<br><br>I quit poly half way and started working. Work work work, and now in the army. Yea, we still keep in contact. Via sms now. She's in J2 this year and the pressure is catching up on her. Still in good contact. Concern is still around and ... feelings? On my side still stronger than ever. Hers? I dunnoe. Still hoping to find out.<br><br>1997 ~ 2002 now. How much have i done towards this relationship? Is this a relationship? I'm confused myself. How can i make be with "G" since she had feel so strong for me in the past? I need help .. and lots of help ... in order to pull myself together. Its driving me nuts to think of her all the time.<br><br>Conclude:<br>I'm still by myself and her herself. I know she is living her life pretty simple now, just as i am. I just want to love her and pray that she is happy. I just wish to love her ... in reality.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Mr salaried worker, is it my comprehension ability or your language ability?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Let's do a word by word analysis of yr sentence,shall we?<br><blockquote>they could/would have developed feelings and since they did, the expectations of looks would be there.[/b]</blockquote>Development of feelings leads to the expectations of looks.<br>Logical enough? In other words, expectations of appearance are the result of feelings that developed over a period of interaction.<br><br>My point is entirely different. What I said is that <strong>girls are more likely to develop feelings for the guy</strong> during the course of online interaction. Guys are less likely to develop that feeling because because they need to know how the girl looks like first. Whatever feelings they may have are tempered by, like u said, expectations.<br><br>and when those expectations are not met... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>In any case, thanks for helping me spent the last half hour at work! hehe..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> TGIF.<br>[/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm .... i think i noe what you mean. By taking the initiative? Worth considering ... but what kind if initiative? It's like... you know you have feelings for her ... and yet the communication medium i guess now is left with sms ... its like a very difficult thing to bring it to real life ...<br><br>I understand that such feelings are not reasonable esp since it is more of an online thingy ... but how is it explainable if she feels the same thing too?<br><br>Cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey man bro...you should be asking yourself just what is it that is holding her back? ask her, talk to her, express yourself, try everything! she said something like not good enough etc right? c'mon...what is this. who is not good enough for anybody? based on what grounds can you say u are not good enough for anybody?<br><br>if you ask me, i'd say to hell with it. she just doesn't want you.<br><br>from another perspective she might be in a crisis and is not sure what she wants in life. maybe she doesn't have confidence in herself. if thats the case, you will have to touch her by sincerity like other bros have said. do something, restore her confidence and you're on your way.<br>be prepared, though, right from the start she's able to come up with all those 'not good enough for you' feelings, along the way, these feelings will sure be back to haunt her, and, if not handled properly, might just lead to disaster.<br><br>jus my 2 cents worth  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
