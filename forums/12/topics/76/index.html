            <div class='col-md body'>Hi I'm in the medical line so i'll tell ya what i know......schizophrenia is characterised mostly by hallucinations, delusions.... so if u are seeing strange things or you hear people talking when there is obviously no one around.... its a strong indication u may have schiz....also some szhiz may tend to me depressive and other times manic (the "crazy" shouting type) but with medication many of them can be perfectly normal. What medication did your psychiatrist give u? if u post it i can tell u what its for... schiz will be at least given an anti-psychotic agent and perhaps an anti-depressent.<br><br>Second of all i dun think the psychiatrist will deny telling you your diagnosis (if it is schizophrenia).<br><br>Anyway if u have any other questions feel free to post here.<br><br>regards,<br>Workerbee<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Been too busy in the past, and missed out this post.. Dunno if you still want it, but this is what I learn about Schizophrenia in my Psychology class.<br><br>Problems of is mainly<br><br>- Perceptual<br>Hallucinate by seeing and hearing things that are not there. Usually you will hear commands telling or something beckoning you to do stuff.<br><br>- cognitive<br>Delusions, often associated with thoughts of being followed, have some extraoridnary power or thinking of artistes falling in love with you.<br><br>Subtypes<br>~ Disorganized<br>Having thoughts that are odd and often have no links to each other, this is the most common problem. can just talk and talk lots of things out, but there is things may not associate to each other. Well if you can write a para of your prob as above, likely you don't fall into this type.<br><br>~ Catatonic<br>This type is charaterised by one just stop doing things half way and freeze there, but one will still know the things that's going ard him. Just the mind didn't want to control the legs to walk so stop there.<br><br>~ Paranoid<br>This one is a different from other subtypes. One can still have a trend of well-thought out ideas, and pattern of thinking, but has persucutary delusions. Like feeling annoyed, or fearful, or uncertain. Like who feels unsafe and suspect that someone is trying to stab you on the back kind of thing.<br><br>~ Undifferentiated<br>This is more commonly known as multiple personality disorder like what fireice had mentioned earlier... One can just change from one character to another just like you switch the channels of the tv.<br><br>How old are you?? I feel that likely it's the hormones in your body that's creating all the trouble that's all. We all have funny times in our lives, and it's usually becoz of excessive of certain hormones being activated. Should be better after taking some medication.<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)

But anyway, it takes about 10 yrs to train a doctor to become specialist. Actually my psychiatrist also can't help much with my problems, I only go back to him for medicine only.<br></div>
