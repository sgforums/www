Dunno if you still want it, but this is what I learn about Schizophrenia in my Psychology class.<br><br>Problems of is mainly<br><br>- Perceptual<br>Hallucinate by seeing and hearing things that are not there. Usually you will hear commands telling or something beckoning you to do stuff.<br><br>- cognitive<br>Delusions, often associated with thoughts of being followed, have some extraoridnary power or thinking of artistes falling in love with you.<br><br>Subtypes<br>~ Disorganized<br>Having thoughts that are odd and often have no links to each other, this is the most common problem. can just talk and talk lots of things out, but there is things may not associate to each other. Well if you can write a para of your prob as above, likely you don't fall into this type.<br><br>~ Catatonic<br>This type is charaterised by one just stop doing things half way and freeze there, but one will still know the things that's going ard him. Just the mind didn't want to control the legs to walk so stop there.<br><br>~ Paranoid<br>This one is a different from other subtypes. One can still have a trend of well-thought out ideas, and pattern of thinking, but has persucutary delusions. Like feeling annoyed, or fearful, or uncertain. Like who feels unsafe and suspect that someone is trying to stab you on the back kind of thing.<br><br>~ Undifferentiated<br>This is more commonly known as multiple personality disorder like what fireice had mentioned earlier... One can just change from one character to another just like you switch the channels of the tv.<br><br>How old are you?? I feel that likely it's the hormones in your body that's creating all the trouble that's all. We all have funny times in our lives, and it's usually becoz of excessive of certain hormones being activated.

Anyway, some answers are common sense, juz that when u r blinded by luv, u cannot see the light, got it?  So not all advices given here r "dangerous"...<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So, you're feeling stressed out. Everything needs your attention all at once. You might even be feeling a bit depressed. You decide to go talk to someone, but whom do you talk to? A friend tells you to go to a psychiatrist. Your sister suggests that you see a psychologist. A co-worker mentions that she went to a psychoanalyst. So to add to your stress, you now have to figure out the differences between each of these "P" words to know where to go for help.<br><br>A psychiatrist is a physician who deals with mentally ill patients. Psychiatrists are MDs, so they can prescribe medication. As a result, they usually deal with clinical issues such as schizophrenia and manic-depression whose treatments tend to require medication.<br><br>Psychologists, unlike psychiatrists, are not MDs, and they tend to deal more with emotional issues than with clinical issues. For example, a person experiencing low self-esteem would visit a psychologist rather than a psychiatrist because they do not have anything physically wrong with them; they just need to talk things out. A person with schizophrenia would visit a psychiatrist because they would need medication to correct the chemical imbalance in their brain.<br><br>Psychoanalysts follow Freud's theories that painful childhood memories contained in the subconscious are the cause of mental illness. Psychoanalysts are like psychologists in that they usually deal with emotional issues and do not prescribe medication. However, their approach is different from that of conventional psychologists. Psychoanalysis is a method of searching through a person's subconscious memories for the source of their current difficulties, rather than focusing on conscious memories. Psychoanalysts also tend to meet much more often with their clients. Rather than meeting only once a week (as is common with psychologists), they usually prefer to meet as often as three to five times a week.<br><br>How to choose<br>Some people may use a combination of the above approaches at the same time. For instance, a patient may go to a psychiatrist for medication, but meet with a psychologist regularly to talk about their issues. Often this combination is pushed by GP for financial reasons.<br><br>As for looking for someone to talk to, one way is to ask your family practitioner (GP)<br>for a referral. You can also look for<br>a social worker or therapist specializing in whatever issues you wish to talk about.<br><br>When you are seeking help, seek the right one.<br>Be well raingal.</div>
