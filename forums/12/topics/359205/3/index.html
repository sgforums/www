              <p>thank you, thank you!</p>
              <p>anyway what jojo meant was.. girls generally treat sex as sacred, giving themselves to the person they love. so they're private about such matters..</p>
              <p>so it's very weird that she would tell you about her sordid past, as if she's showing off her bragging rights.</p>
              <p>but there are always exceptions to the rule. also, i think when she shared, her tone wasn't that of a bragger right? rather, she said it like it didn't matter?</p>
              <p>that's because she might be ashamed and vulnerable, and not want you to think badly of her. so the only way to do that is either hide her past, or pretend that it doesn't matter to her.</p>

              <p> If u die only to the 'bad', it is only natural tht u would expect what life should be or have anidea of what is to come, cos the past(good) is wanting to repeat itself in another form in the future.</p>

              <p>thank you, thank you!</p>
              <p>anyway what jojo meant was.. girls generally treat sex as
                  sacred, giving themselves to the person they love. so they're
                  private about such matters..</p>
              <p>so it's very weird that she would tell you about her sordid
                  past, as if she's showing off her bragging rights.</p>
              <p>but there are always exceptions to the rule. also, i think when
                  she shared, her tone wasn't that of a bragger right? rather, she

              <p>Well.. sorta correct.</p>
              <p>But I just couldn't figure out why she did it... wouldn't it be better if you don't know at all ?</p>
              <p>I mean all you had to know was, when was the last time she had sex.. and did she use any condom.. and the last time she had a blood test to make sure she's not infected ?</p>
              <p>And really what's the point of judging a woman based on her past ?</p>

              <p>that's a dumb way to handle it. it's like walking in blind. any relationship should be built on truth and transparency.. if you have an ugly past, and your partner accepts you, that shows you how precious it is. but you hide it, or pretend it isn't there, sooner or later that past will come back.. and takes you by surprise.</p>
