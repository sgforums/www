              <p>Thanks for ur reply .</p>
              <p>First of all i would never do anything wrong to a gal . And
              after reading ur post i`m really thinking if i truely love her . As
              we started out not as friends first but as one night stand`s.</p>
              <p>Maybe it`s just like wat dumbdumb! said. I might have
              this feeling that i`ll be doing something wrong if i were to break
              up with her. Cause i dont wanna be an asshole no more. But up
              till now i still cant get over her past . And wats worst is i keep
              thinking about it . It`s making me crazy. Maybe i should just break
              up with her and let her go back to her old ways. I can`t save her
              anymore. Although i would really like to.</p>
              <p>Plus sometimes when i talk to her i realise i dont know nuts
              about her. Recently she told me she really loved me
              cause in our 3 months as a couple she has already rejected 5
              guys who asked her to be their gf. But i didnt even know about it .
              Cause she didn`t want to tell me about me . All along i thought it
              was normal for a person to say no to another person if he or she is
              already in a stable relationship . But when she told me that she
              knew she love me cause she rejected 5 guys . It felt so wrong. What
              if one day we quarrel ? Will she go find another guy and spend the
              night with him ?</p>
              <p>I guess i`m super insecure in this relationship and maybe i
              should give up . Is kina like her past and the fact that i know so
              little about her is really bothering me .</p>

              <p>from what i have come to understand, it's not the good times which test your love for each other, rather it's the tough times that do.</p>
              <p>if she stays with you, and still loves you through the tough time, then, i say she's worth it. it goes the same for you.</p>

              <p>I t  seems that u are looking into the future thru her, she is not obliged to stay or not stay, the question that only u know or ought to know by now  - do u love her for love or do u love for her reason - if its the latter - no hope lar.</p>
              <p>U are evolving and so is she - when the reasons change - can u imagine the beating love would take. Love that is exclusive is like compressing the sky into a room! Love that is inclusive embraces - love is for giving, not for getting (that is why the word forgiveness!)</p>
              <p>It makes no difference wheter it is 2 days or 5 months - and for having a past (whatever it means to u or her) its has nothing to do with what is transpiring bet the both of u now.</p>
              <p> If she is holding to the past - its her business = the answer lies in u, not in her, love cannot be cast in stone, if it is - its dead!</p>
              <p>As for good/bad/rite/wrong love its subjective and relative - cos love is an existential experience , not an object (thing) to be used willy nilly.</p>
              <p>If u give love - dont count, if u are counting or have expectations (it mite be unconscious) - it is a bargain,its a transaction - it is trying to mould a human being to fit your ideals of love, of life and so on so forth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What i am implying is that u are here (on earth) for urself and likewise she is here for herself - the rich (inner) share - the impoverished(inner) pretends to share  ...</p>
              <p>When one is self-full ( not to be confused with selfishness) - one is able to share cos he/she is abundant, overflowing. however when one is ... it is a compromise, seeking out each other to fulfil what is lacking in oneself.</p>

              <p>If u cannot relate  -  be it with ur lover , be it with ..... it is going to suffer in terms of quality. relationship is a thing ( love that is that is made into an object or thing) means it is merely adding on something to what is already a finished product! That is why the quickness of wanting to own  - well, its easy to own a chair, a job , a car, to own  a person is ..... at least from my viewpoint - to enslave another - remember - the jailor and the prisoner - are equally prisoners!</p>
              <p>Alas, i m misconstrued - i m not here to make u wrong n make myself rite -  u  are free to to be what works for u,</p>

              <p>The fact is that despite all of your claims, you're still nothing but a fucking hypocrite who can talk a whole lot of goody-two-shoes bullshit about being constructive and then turn around and spew shit about people kicking their babies.  Try all you want to switch the topic to trivial shit like language, but there's not hiding the filthy, vile splotch of scum that you are.</p>
              <p>Anyway, carry on.  I'll pop in once in a while to keep you on your toes and point out your bullshit.  There's no doubt you'll provide plenty of evidence of your place at the bottom of the evolutionary and moral ladders.</p>

              <p>Now you all know why SG Girls don't like this type of SG Guys.
               </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think I still need to stress that it's EXTREMELY important for
              SG Guys to grow up mentally.</p>

              <p>I dont care u r really a he/she/it, whatever it is, the post that u put are only trying to attract attention, if not piss ppl off. Well I guess u win, cos it bothers ppl like me to ask u to wake up ur farking idea. </p>
              <p>I hope u can just leave AA alone and not trying to stir shit here. And I hope all the forumers can do their part and ignore this idiot, and if possible, try to tell any TS in AA to ignore this bugger too.</p>
              <p>This idiot is one of the reason why i keep refrain from posting here. Lastly I wish AA gd luck.</p>
