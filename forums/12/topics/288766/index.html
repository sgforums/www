            <div class='col-md body'>i agree that u seem pessimistic lol.<br>but to me being pessimistic is a pretty good thing.<br>it pushes me to do stuff. eg, usually i'll try harder for subjects im pessimistic in and get more motivated to study it. i usually go bo chap if i find myself optimistic towards a subject, only to end up finding so many things that i dont really understand abt it...long story cut short, being pessimistic allows continual improvement to take place.<br><br>my theory is be optimistic towards life and pessimistic towards the goals in life  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
