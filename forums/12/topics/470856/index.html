              Ok the joke's on me..
              
              We had been casually going out since early months of the year, and getting along pretty well. Out of â€˜funâ€™ (for lack of better word), she even became my â€˜pseudo-girlfriendâ€™ during the CNY period when our families were nagging about our singlehood status.
              
              Sensing a connection, I began to woo her. During the time of courtship, she might have some residual unresolved past hurts from her last relationship â€“ which she somewhat managed to resolve or buried â€“ but that is of little importance. It was very natural, I read her very well and we enjoyed each otherâ€™s company very much. And when time was ripe, I told her to have faith and take a gamble with me â€“ that I ask for nothing except for her to be happy.
              
              She agreed and we became an item.
              
              It was fun, romantic and surreal. Iâ€™ve been in enough relationships to say that this is something I never had before. And somewhere along the way, I lost myself and became that selfish, insecured and possessive guy; and my expectations from nothing rocketed to sky-high. 
               
              And no, she wasnâ€™t the problem â€“ my fears were unfounded; probably because I, in my folly, wanted to defend against â€˜threats that werenâ€™t even thereâ€™, being jealous of sh!ts that didnâ€™t matter totally. Not to mention, sheâ€™s one hell of an attractive woman and there were guys circling around her constantly (she fended them off). I failed to see that her acceptance is the greatest assurance she could give and finally she left. My petty ways had worn her out finally.
              
              It had been 3 weeks since ground zero, she had long retrieved her clothes and belongings from my place, I have past the depressed/despair stage. And what we have left is the awkwardness and running-out-of-topics in the conversations that she or I sometimes initiate, oh yea we are also colleagues.. so not very cool yea..
              
              I see so much potential in this and through the spilt, I realized many things about 
              myself which I resolve to change. Sheâ€™s one heck of a great girl, and I hate to simply walk away and leave everything to the wind. I want to fight for this, but I got nothing to hold on to except the awkwardness and a â€˜friendshipâ€™ which isnâ€™t real.
              
              Should I walk? Or should I fight on? I want to brace on, but how?

              <p>You've been a jerk, and you took her for granted.</p>
              <p>For her.. it's " too little, too late". Your true colors has revealed itself and it wasn't pretty.</p>
              <p>I am assuming you have already done your customary  thousands apologies and sworn on your life you will treat her better from now on....words..... with nothing to prove.</p>
              <p>Don't go chasing her... all your empty promises will be useless. It'll just be viewed as another of your "get out of jail" card.. except she no longer wants to play.</p>
              <p>There's really nothing you can do except BE a better guy. Don't do it for her.. do it for yourself. She'll know if it's truly genuine change or just another of your bullshit act.</p>
              <p>Hopefullyy she can SEE the <strong>real</strong> change in you some time in the future....there is a possibility she MAY change her mind... but don't hold your breath for it.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>From your posting, i assumed that u had only 1 or few relationships before u ended up with her.This could explain why u are over possessive.</p>
              <p>Trust is the most important factor in a long run relationship, u got to learn from your mistakes.</p>
              <p>For the moment, i suggest u stay put and treat her like a normal colleague with no special treatment.Take this as a cooling period and considered she was already gone.</p>

              I read some of the posts and I really cringed... esp that Jojobeach's reply..
              
              I think at this juncture.. all the past mistakes and etc are really water under the bridge.. no point keep harping on them :(
              
              Got stone-walled again when I threw a casual invitation to watch a movie together.. She said "go with some other girl" but if you're not going can I get the free tix?

              <p>If you think its worth it, go after her again.</p>
              <p>But it could get messy.</p>
              <p>Beware of the office politics, if people notice you are having trouble with her, they may just think that you can't focus on your job.</p>
              <p>Don't wait until you improved yourself and be able to demonstrate to her you changed, because by then, other guys would have conquered her heart (as you say, the vultures circling).</p>
              <p>Maybe reason as to why you are possessive, could have been due to your past relationships. Past hurts may have caused bias opinions.</p>
              <p>My first girlfriend, preferred me, years ago because I never had a relationship before while she had gone through 3 relationships. But anyway, it didn't work out, haha.</p>

              <p>Ok the joke’s on me..</p>
              <p>We had been casually going out since early months of the year,
              and getting along pretty well. Out of ‘fun’ (for lack of better
              word), she even became my ‘pseudo-girlfriend’ during the
              <span>CNY</span> period when our families were nagging
              about our singlehood status.</p>
              <p>Sensing a connection, I began to woo her. During the time of
              courtship, she might have some residual unresolved past hurts from
              her last relationship – which she somewhat managed to resolve or
              buried – but that is of little importance. It was very natural, I
              read her very well and we enjoyed each other’s company very much.
              And when time was ripe, I told her to have faith and take a gamble
              with me – that I ask for nothing except for her to be happy.</p>
              <p>She agreed and we became an item.</p>
              <p>It was fun, romantic and surreal. I’ve been in enough
              relationships to say that this is something I never had before. And
              somewhere along the way, I lost myself and became that selfish,
              insecured and possessive guy; and my expectations from nothing
              rocketed to sky-high.</p>
              <p>And no, she wasn’t the problem – my fears were unfounded;
              probably because I, in my folly, wanted to defend against ‘threats
              that weren’t even there’, being jealous of sh!ts that didn’t matter
              totally. Not to mention, she’s one hell of an attractive woman and
              there were guys circling around her constantly (she fended them
              off). I failed to see that her acceptance is the greatest assurance
              she could give and finally she left. My petty ways had worn her out
              finally.</p>
              <p>It had been 3 weeks since ground zero, she had long retrieved
              her clothes and belongings from my place, I have past the
              depressed/despair stage. And what we have left is the awkwardness
              and running-out-of-topics in the conversations that she or I
              sometimes initiate, oh yea we are also colleagues.. so not very
              cool yea..</p>
              <p>I see so much potential in this and through the spilt, I
              realized many things about<br> myself which I resolve to change. She’s one heck of a great girl,
              and I hate to simply walk away and leave everything to the wind. I
              want to fight for this, but I got nothing to hold on to except the
              awkwardness and a ‘friendship’ which isn’t real.</p>
              <p>Should I walk? Or should I fight on? I want to brace on, but
              how?</p>

You started off with the flirting and causal dating, which might gave her the impression that you are easy-going, confident and non-possessive. She probably realized that the price she is going to pay to remain in this relationship isn't worth the value in exchange - getting out is probably an easier option. </p>
              <p>Being colleagues certainly complicate the matter a little, especially when you have to work with her. It is hard to draw boundary - between professional and personal - and fighting on (in your definition) might end up a HR issue. </p>
              <p>Somehow, you get the sense that this gnawing insecurity is ruining the potentiality of a good relationship. However, this is one hell of a devil that is arduous to surmount: you are likely to have anxious attachment - in which your anxiety unconsciously starts pumping in the minute you sense your partner is not giving you the attention, love and expectation that you need. You seek for <span style="line-height: 1.231;">anecdotal </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">signs that would suggest (even subtle ones) that </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">partner do not love you, even if it sounds illogical when you share them openly. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">You might be able to accept things logically, but emotionally, it is a hard fight within.    </span></p>
              <p>Perhaps seeing this woman as a catalysis to awake your motivation for self improvements could spur inner change. After all, when we fail to change our environment, we are challenged to change ourselves<span style="line-height: 1.231;">. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Fight on. If you think that she is truly the want that you want to spend the rest of your life with then go for it i'd say. Never let a chance slip away. For once it's gone, it's gone forever. If she's willing to give you a 2nd chance, grab it and never let it go. They say that relationships will strengthen if you manage to sort things out, come to an agreement and get back together after a break up.
