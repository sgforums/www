              <p>Hi Lma0,</p>
              <p>You still have feelings for her, but you believe that the relationship will not work out, so you decided to end it here. There is no definite right or wrong to such decisions, but it is understandable why you are unable to get over it.</p>
              <p>This melancholy which you are feeling now will not disappear any time soon, but the most important thing for you right now is to learn how to move on. You can try shifting your focus to other things in your life, such as your family, your studies, and your friends.</p>
              <p>They will be pillars of support for you, and will help to reduce the sadness in your heart bit by bit. </p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, that is the way it has to be. You may wish to try out Voluntary work or Activity clubs, they do help hasten the healing of wounds for some.</p>

              <p><br>Instead of requesting for a break-up because you didn't want her to suffer, why don't you request to STAY and endure any suffering together with her?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it because it is THE EASIEST solution?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How can you guarantee your love to your future girlfriend(s) if all you did were to RUN AWAY whenever the situation isn't looking healthy?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>True love and noble decisions are supposed to be self-less, not like the selfish decisions which you had made to take care of your own fragile world.</p>

              <p>Although it is not the right time now for you to have another half, but have you considered what caused your feelings for her to fade away?</p>
              <p>If you are unable to answer this question now, in the future, your next relationship(s) may just meet the same end.</p>
