              <p>I kinda felt very bad emotionally, I felt so useless I cant even help others that need help. There was this girl I met, in game, then slowly we became friends. Then when i was chatting with her on the phone, I slowly got to know more about her. She told me she met a online guy in reallife. Typical game called Audition, boys meeting girls, girls meeting boys. Then she told me that the boy had sucked her boobs! I was like yeah wtf ! I kinda gave her more advices, teach her what to do and so on. She's my junior, meaning that she is younger than me lah! Wtf seeing others getting hurt by another person. I really got that upset feeling that can cause me to sad for hours. I dont like watching other people suffering so badly. Now that fucker got another girl or what I dont know lah! Just heard from her that the boy told the another girl that she is nothing to him. I know what he can do on others, can do on her. I told her to break up with the boy and just stop all contact with him. Then she is like so confused and seemed to need help. But at least she has some conscience with her pride and refuse to continue letting the boy touch her bottom or have sex with her. I really felt like becoming stronger, protecting everyone that I know, that I care and love for. Even though just online friends, but I want the best for all. Am I a fucking sick guy or what? What should I do now? I believe she is in danger and her mother doesnt know much about the sexual thing.</p>
              <p> The fucked up boy is same age as me, 16. The girl is 14.</p>

              <p>Be prepare to lose this friend - that is if you are a real friend to her.</p>
              <p>The best thing you can do now is to tell the whole matter to her family, and let them decide how they want to handle it, but I can assure you that she will almost definitely turn against you.</p>

              <p>Intentions are good but you should be focusing on your studies now 1st. 1 of the most important thing in helping people is to make sure you will not cause any harm to yourself be it physical, academic or emotional etc.</p>
              <p>You can try to advice her etc and theres nothing sick about it. Such actions personally i would recommend the girl's mother be told and maybe even a police report lodge since underage sex is against the law and should not be done in the 1st place.</p>
              <p>Working with juvenille offenders for the past few yrs including boys who engage in underage sex, i would say sometimes being charge helps them 'wakeup' their idea though some of them i won't deny will not bother to change and will return to their old ways after they are discharged.</p>

              <p>wow aYexa..i think u shld persuade the girl to tell her parents abt it and let her parents to settle this matter themselves..that's the most u can do i guess? dont even bother to find out who's that guy becoz that will cause more unnecessary trouble.</p>
              <p>hmm..16..i have a fren who was pregnant at 16 and her husband is oso the same age as her..and now after 2 years?..everything's still going smoothly with their 1 year old plus kid...sometimes being pregnant at a young age is not something negative..the way u look at it is more important...im 18 now btw..and im really glad that they are doing well.</p>
              <p>rmb to think before u act ar...good luck.</p>
