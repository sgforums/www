              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Finally something sensible from you after:</p>
              <p>1) I have 3 friends and all of our husbands were taken by PRC
              woman,so they are evil: Is it that you and your friends are of same
              class/group? And a great work on generalising 1.6 billion
              people.</p>
              <p>2) <span style="color: #333333;">I have been
              dating the same guy for almost a decade. He was a divorcee with a
              beautiful daughter, whom I love and I adore.:</span> <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 13px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The guy dated you for 10 years?Holy! And still
              you couldn't figure out he was keeping you as
              backup?</span></span></p>
              <p>3)<span style="color: #333333;">He was
              earning more than he ever had. The now and then drinking session
              becomes frequent. He began picking on my faults, and eventually he
              didn't even come home.:</span> <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 13px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">So you admit your faults.</span></span></p>
              <p>4)<span style="color: #333333;">Local girls
              are not materialistic. In fact they are very simple women, who just
              want to build a simple happy family of their own. Yes I do enjoy
              buying designer goods, but I was a faithful caring woman who knows
              how to love a man and love his family.:</span> <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 13px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">I am not materialistic apart from the fact that I
              make him buy all designer stuff.</span></span></p>
              <p>5) <span style="color: #333333;">Why? Anybody
              knows why?:</span> <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 13px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">OMG really? You stil don't know?You need a bunch
              of people from internet to tell you that you were pious and great
              how bad the guy is and how bad his new wife is?</span></span></p>
              <p>6) <span style="color: #333333;">And I had
              spent my time, and money, on that piece of "garbage" whom I was
              ready to be married to.--&gt;</span> <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 13px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes you did,now admit it and move
              on.</span></span></p>
              <p>7)<span style="color: #333333;">Everything I
              built for the last decade, now belongs to a PRC woman who did
              nothing but spread her legs --&gt;</span> <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 13px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Since you know the secret, why not try it out
              yourself? It's not that easy obviously.</span></span></p>
              <p>8) <span style="color: #333333;">Beside every
              hot chick is a very bored man as far as physical beauty is
              concerned.</span><span style="color: #333333;"> --&gt;</span> <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 13px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">And beside a rich guy there is a bored gal as
              well emptying his stuff and staying around only for his money,as u
              know!</span></span></p>
              <p>9)<span style="color: #333333;">She had spent
              10 years with the guy prior. It would not have been a level playing
              field as you suggest.--&gt;</span> <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 13px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">So she too supported him in many ways and you
              didn't know about it.</span></span></p>
              <p>10)<span style="color: #333333;">As far as
              physical appearance is concerned, that prc sht is no way better
              looking than me. Nice people would say she is average. Straight
              forward people probably would say "ah tiong bin".I say cb ah tiong
              bin. --&gt;</span> <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 13px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Obviously she knew how to use
              it. </span></span></p>
              <p>11)<span style="color: #333333;">But Genie was
              right, she was "new", she was "different", but impossibly
              better.--&gt;</span><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 13px;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">New after 10 years?Are u
              serious?</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I understand all this is not easy, you supported a guy for a
              time and he left you when things became better.Where have I seen
              this?Yes in movies, drama and hell yeah in life. Poor guy sells his
              house to fund his gf for studies who meets a richer guy and leaves,
              poor guy works hard supports her and her family and she goes with a
              rich guy,poor guy supports a gal and she marries a rich guy
              thanking her brother.</p>
              <p>So stop whining and live with your branded stuff. It happens to
              many, that is way life is. If you are over these meaningless
              sympathy from strangers,use this to forge a new life and kick the
              guy in his ass.Else wallow in self pity with bottles and ur gf(I am
              sure they are  in a worse way than you)</p>

              <p>Thanks ! :D</p>
              <p>Genie and Medicated Oil are awesome !</p>
              <p>Whether there are people better off or worse off, it does not and will not make my bitterness any lesser.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I realised, thank you to the kind souls here, I have been holding on too much to the anger and hatred.</p>
              <p>And maybe was too soft hearted.</p>
              <p>When I was abandoned, and lost everything, who from that place care? Who from that place worry about me? Nobody.</p>
              <p>Only my own family, and my own circle of friends.</p>
              <p>Even strangers from here.. Hahah..</p>
              <p>So what business is mine that he is having a tough time now. Why should I even feel sorry for him and his family. I was not the cause of all these shit. He himself created all those mess.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think i have been idling and drowning myself in self pity for abit too long..</p>
              <p>I tried, waking up every morning with a positive thought, and going to sleep with another one.</p>
              <p>Tried to find things to do, hit the gym, find people to eat dinner with, to drink with. Go KTV. Sing songs all night long.</p>
              <p>And I will be clearing the rest of my annual leave with a holiday somewhere away from here. :D</p>
              <p>And most importantly, blocking everyone from that place on my whatsapp and phone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only thing that should concern me right now, I know. Is Myself !</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheers everyone !</p>

              <p>Ok Jojo. Now I know. And learnt.</p>
              <p>I was silly and naive the last time. We were living together, and I didnt think marriage was important, and thought we were just like a married couple without a certificate. Plus I had a good relationship with his girl, his mom and his siblings( yeah i give, they take i know. Actually they are merely users)and didn't thought of having another kid.</p>
              <p>But now I really, really realised the importance of that god damn certifcate.</p>
              <p>It was so easy for that idiot to do that to me, leaving me with nothing in the end, because he was not bound by the law to be responsible for me.</p>
              <p>I was not hoping for a better option. Just naive and guillable. Sigh</p>
              <p>And the prime of my youth gone justlike that. @#$*$*÷!!</p>
              <p>But I am still generally lucky. My friend has got two kids. Its gonna be so much tougher for her.</p>
              <p>Anyway life goes on for us. Just have to control that anger and not let it eat me. Who knows I may really end up with someone better !! </p>
              <p>EVen if I don't I believe im still better off without someone like that</p>

              <div class="crumbs">Above was taken from the thread titled below. My aim was to basically find out why you hate men which was the reason why "my spider sense tingled". So I decided to do a quick check of your early posts. <br></div>
              <div class="crumbs"><br></div>
              <div class="crumbs">So point is do you think you are a feminist?</div>
              <div class="crumbs"><br></div>
              <div class="crumbs">As for you stating that "I love men and is happily married
                  to a man whom is not afraid of women with brain. He finds women who

              <div class="crumbs"><br></div>
              <div class="crumbs">Is this bcos you are angered when you see posts in Aunt Agony whereby women have suffered. You then get angry at said women becos in yer perception they "have no brain" and have failed your "feminist" cause. Women must prove they are better than men?<br></div>

              <p>Dear Mr Genie99,</p>
              <p>I repeat again.. I am not a feminist.. 
              far from it. Perhaps you may want to find out exactly what a feminist 
              is.. before you mislabel me, just as many other male forumers here had 
              been doing all too often.</p>
              <p>I enjoy the female role.. my 
              husband do his best to provide, protect , make me happy and feel 
              secure.  I want to feel like a woman, not like a man. </p>
              <p>I do not hate good men.. I do not like men who treats women badly.</p>
              <p>I
               do not agree with men who insist that exploiting and oppressing women 
              is OK  because it's our "culture", or that's our role to be submissive 
              and be subjugated by men.</p>
              <p>There are many women out there who 
              are victims to men's oppression and manipulations. Laden with confusion 
              and guilt , a woman cannot be happy. To be happy we need to stop being a
               victim.</p>
              <p>The Ying Yang is balanced and complementary to make one whole circle. That's how relationship should be too.</p>

              <p>Mr Genie, thank you for your unsolicited advise. Your feeble attempt to control my online behavior is actually quite laughable.</p>
              <p>When a woman comes online to "rant".. she is not looking for a pityfest.</p>
              <p>If a woman wants to look for patronising, hypocritical, pretentious, and self-serving interest, she go talk to her family and friends.. who will tell her,   things are not as bad as it seems, everything is going to be ok,.. the moral support.. yes.. all the fakeries to make her FEEL better. Worst are the ones who attempts to manipulate her for their self-interest. That's the job of her friends and family.</p>
              <p>I don't partake in pityfests.. doing so only enables self-pity, increase denials and slows healing.</p>
              <p> I cut the BS. I give the raw truth.. most of the time.. that's all a woman needs to see beyond the fairy tale fog and get back on her two feet.</p>
              <p>A woman need to take care of her self first.. before she can take care of others. She cannot give what she doesn't have.</p>
              <p>But I highly recomend you do not attempt this with your wife.. your job is to cry with her when she is sad, and laugh with her when she is happy, and pretend you understand her,   because you are her family.</p>

              there, you had to go conquer a piece of garbage.</p>
              <p>But like all foolish women out there... regardless of
              nationality, you think you must be so special... that you can make
              an unfaithful , irresponsible man... become faithful and
              responsible to you... the great delusion.</p>
              <p>Your 'ex" boyfriend is a user.. the past 10 years.. you had been
              his rebound, his free care giver, free nanny and free fuck
              buddy.  Perfect boyfriend ? No, you've been blinded.. by your
              own severe lack of self-esteem.</p>
              <p>Your self-esteem is ZERO.. that you've allowed yourself to think
              that piece of garbage is actually "perfect" for the past 10
              years.</p>
              <p>10 years.. and he never marry you ? 10 years and he never got
              you pregnant ? And all of a sudden.. he got a pRC pregnant within a
              few months ? Wow... he must really NOT want you to be part of his
              family.</p>
              <p>Stop wallowing in self pity , and start growing some
              self-esteem. Else you will only end up "falling in love" with
              another piece of garbage again and again. All the while thinking
              you found something worth holding on to.</p>

                                <p>I repeat again.. I am not a feminist.. far from it. Perhaps you
                                may want to find out exactly what a feminist is.. before you
                                mislabel me, just as many other male forumers here had been doing
                                all too often.</p>

              very well. The world does not revolve around your reality, if he world's reality differs from yours sadly you r the problem. 
              
              I do agree wif u that this time what i said is uncalled for
