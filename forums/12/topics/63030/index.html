Although i am not in your present position, but i could feel what you are going through.<br><br>To think positively, you need to tell youself you can do it. If you find that you do have problems motivating yourself, maybe you can try talking to someone about your problems... Sometimes we feel better after talking to someone...<br><br>I hope it helps...</div>

Its not depression, rather now that you are all grown up, you will begin to ponder over whether IS THIS LIFE that you truly want to seek? Totally unfulfilling and meaningless - working the hell of your soul just to meet ends needs and the cycle continues.<br><br>You want to rest because there are things you may like to do, but simply you do not have the time/money to do them. Simple things like even completing the entire Huan Zhu Ge Ge III series or something. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> More importantly, your social circle would be rather stagnant if you couldn't spare a portion of your time to upkeep/expand them.<br><br>There is three things I would advice you to do:<br><br>(I) Seek religious help/assistance. Your body is tired because your soul is empty. People who are spiritually fulfilled will be very contented as a person. Religion can be a guide to unknown direction.<br><br>(II) Spare your time to get some good positive books to read or simply hang around in Kinokuniya/Borders to read them if you don't want to waste that money. Chicken soup for the soul is a good-read. What you can learn from books is alot and the best thing, they are always there when you need them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>(III) Take up Yoga or body-mind exercise to gain more about self-awareness. Not only healthy and good for the body, you learn to de-stress yourself through good means, which will make you feel better.<br><br>Cheers</div>
