            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi, does anyone have any tips on how to stop looking/ogling at girls? The reason I am asking this is because I have this problem on keep looking/ogling at them when they appear. I know this is normal but it annoyed many girls such as most of them notice that I keep looking/ogling at them and get annoyed like they would keep looking back at me with either a normal/blank face expresson to check out if I am ogling at them or they would blink their eyes and look away when we get into eye contact, some common ones which I have seen them frequently (in school, neighbour or in work place) even look up at me when I appear and make a frown annoyed face then look down when I was talking to my friend and laugh which I happen to look at their direction where my friend is standing as if I am trying to get their attention or they would bring their male friend/boyfriend along and purposely hold hand and kiss in front of me and the girl would keep looking at me to see if I got shocked/surprised (which I did not) and the guy would also look at me as well. I know they are annoyed by me looking/ogling at them but I did tried some ways to  avoid this and it doesn't seems to work such as I tried my best not to look at them, keep looking down the floor while I am walking and/or surrounded around them but I can't, it is like I still want to look up and look at them. I also tried to get addicted to something such as my playing my handheld game, mobile phone but it still doesn't work, I still look up and start to look at them constantly. Does anyone have any other tips how I should stop looking/ogling at them?</p></div>

              <p>looking and ogling is a natural reaction but you just have to be more discreet...</p>
              <p>just look normal and natural... don't show off any dirty looks when you are looking or you will just come off as perverted.... and staring is rude, so just a short glance as if you are just checking out who is passing by, and then look away.... you can only take a long look if she is at a further distance from you so that it seems like you are just looking at the surroundings</p>
              <p>if you are talking, just look natural as well and look at her in the eye and only look at the face... again you will come off as perverted if you are talking to her but looking at her breast </p>

              <p>You cannot STOP looking at girls.</p>
              <p>You can only control the WAY you look at girls.</p>
              <p>Your lack of self confidence affects the way you interact when you lock eyes with girls.</p>
              <p>You are coming across as CREEPY. That's why girls find you annoying instead of feeling flattered when you "admire" them.</p>
              <p>Girls are used to guys looking, the problem is when a guy stares lecherously or creepily.</p>
              <p>When you occasionally lock eyes, give a small nod and a smile with confidence.</p>
              <p>If you quickly turnin away shyly and trying to "secretly" look at her later, people will think you are mousy. A mousy guy is simply not attractive at all.</p>
              <p>Try to increase your self confidence, when you do, girls will be looking at you instead.</p>

              <p>looking and ogling is a natural reaction but you just have to be more discreet...</p>
              <p>just look normal and natural... don't show off any dirty looks when you are looking or you will just come off as perverted.... and staring is rude, so just a short glance as if you are just checking out who is passing by, and then look away.... you can only take a long look if she is at a further distance from you so that it seems like you are just looking at the surroundings</p>
              <p>if you are talking, just look natural as well and look at her in the eye and only look at the face... again you will come off as perverted if you are talking to her but looking at her breast </p>
