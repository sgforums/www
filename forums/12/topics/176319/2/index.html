U may never know that he`s eyeing ur every move..<br><br>If u`re still single, my best suggestion to you is to get hold of a handsome GUY fren to pose for a day, then meet up with that fuking loser, boost ur Bf`s earnings and wealth, something to the extend that he may never reach.. and let him know that he will never haf a chance with you.<br><br>One other thing u can do is to change ur HP number..<br>it`s not too difficult rite?<br>If it`s the only link that connects the 2 of u all then it`ll be gone.<br>ask ur common frens not to give ur number away like that.<br><br>Probably, what u`ve done is correct, that is to ignore him totally,<br>If u deem fit, Never Return a message/call, for all, he may get the wrong idea that u need him.<br><br>Bless,<br>Babyboy<br><br>P.S if u need male models can contact me, i got a few nice looking frens for hire, comes in all genres.. haha jk lah<br></div>

What she did was get a few guys to go home with her. Those guys are actually her students. Then if the stalker comes up to her, she says need to tuition them because they are weak. After a few months, stalker gone.<br><br>Go out with a group of friends and then say got activities. Just do whatever to keep him off. Then off he will go, knowing that you are always super busy. But make sure your act is real enough. These guys are actually pretty smart. They can guess what you are thinking.<br><br>If you can't do that, just tell him plainly that you don't like him.

            <div class='col-md body'>Disagree with you.  Sure, the guy appears to be a "victim", but if he wants to bang his head against the wall, &amp; the wall gets irritated &amp; doesn't wanna feel the impact of that blockhead anymore, then it's the wall's perogative to give the guy's head a big bua lu ku.<br><br>Ok, seriously speaking, it can be really annoying to have someone who really refuses to give up.  Ever experienced the irritation of a mosquito that keeps buzzing at your ear No matter how many times you flick it?

I may be young...but i sure know how it feels to be ditched like that.<br><br>Man, you sure are cruel. If he has that kind of mental problem or something, then would he be like that for so long? And why only her? Why does he not give up and go on to tackle someone else?<br><br>I suggest you do what is best...what would you expect if you were the desperate guy?<br><br>Maybe u can give a date a try...if it just doesn't work out...then let him know...or you can give him a single test.<br><br>Do what Fatum suggested.
