            <div class='col-md body'>You are angry, but just do not know how to express it. at least thats what i think abt ur situation. maybe when you get angry your body lanquage will become odd and messed up, so people do not take you seriously. There's no point to get angry? sometimes anger can be power, though i think you shouldn't go overboard with being hot-tempered or cold-tempered (got such word?)<br><br>haha just one thing, mi do not think you can be a teacher. there r teachers out there that get angry at a class, do not know what to do, stand infront and stare blankly, while her body lanquage tells everyone that she does not know what to do, and what to expect. and then when the class starts being harsh towards her, pple, especially boys, will know how to take advantage when such a weak teacher comes in. sometimes to the extent of throwing malicious remarks that will offend the teacher. when the teacher cannot take it anymore, she (most likely) will break down and cry. try not to be a teacher.<br><br>sometimes you got to show some temper, as a "military deterence"....so that people actually think twice before offending you. or carry out something harsh on someone that offended you and make that example known to everyone. don't just tell it, make sure pple witness it, then you should be safe. no one will dare to take you lightly....</div>

If you can't express 'anger', at least take an effort to suppress 'laughter'...? Or you can easily give people a 'wrong message'...? Go see a doctor if you really need to?</div>

Having a good temper is something out your personality. You do want to change this personality, but don't know how you go about doing it. I think this is more about self discovery... about how you can blend this personality with the people around you.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Astro mode: On</strong></span><br><br>Astrologically speaking, I suspect you may have weak Mars, the planet that governs your anger and temper or have missing fire element in your Natal Chart. Because your Mars (or missing Fire Element) is very likely to be weak, you feel that the word 'initiating' is missing. There is also a lack of motivition to do things because the drive to work, perform and everything else is missing. There is an absence of courage to fight for your desire and you are likely to be a person who takes what that comes to you than a person that make things happen.<br><br>It probably also explains why you cry, when others would have blew their top. This suppression is unable to evolve into verbal/action, thus transformed into emotional energy (tears).<br><br>P.S: Are you a Pisces, Cancer?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Why I say name..<br><br>For example myself.. My name was given by a fortune teller.. I mean. how many of you find that fortune telling is true.. But somehow or rather for me its true..<br><br>My chinese middle name has"huo" (fire) in it.. and my last name has rain(or water content).. For me.. When I tend to be in a fiery temper.. No matter how pissed off I am.. I will usually cool off after 10 mins.. When I am in a heated arguement.. my tears will tend to flow.. Not that cause i loose out in the arguement.. (In fact I am still quarreling).. But tears just flow out without control..<br><br>My point here is that sometimes its in built in you.. Be it your name or like what Yun said..

Not because an Aries is an Aries - rather, the God of War's ruling planet is Mars.<br><br>This is the same as Scorpio - who has two ruling planets: both Mars and Pluto. Just that Aries's temper tends to be outwardly and Scorpio tends to be inwardly.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A little astro lesson here:</strong> </span><br><br>What causes weak Mars?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> It depends on the placing on your planet Mars. She is a Taurus and as for temper-wise, the bull is gentle until provoked. But that is only her Sun Sign. Then if her Mars lies in gentle-sign like Pisces, the fiery side of Mars is douse by the watery fishes and the Masculine side of Mars is neutralised by the most feminine sign of Zodiac. Thus, you can picture how the temper is being affected.<br><br>Mars in the following signs are afflicted: Taurus (detriment), Cancer (falls), Libra (detriment).<br><br>Mars doesn't only rule temper - it also rule your energy, our drive and animal instinct (inclusive of sex). Those who studies Psychology or read about them - still remember Freudian theory of Id, Ego and Superego? Mars represent Id - our basic needs and desire. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
