              <p>yah that is not easy. If you joke around too much people find you TOO FRIENDLY, just take note that some people are SLOW in mind. TO you, may be you know them as if for years, but TO them, they may still take you as a stranger. Theory of Relativity. </p>
              <p>So if you overboard or cross their line, they will find you strange and distance from you. it is natural. just remain neutral, and let them slowly digest your presence.</p>
