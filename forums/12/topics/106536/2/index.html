Man who flirts around even when they are attached simply implies that they are not satisfied with what they already have.  In addition, these men are basically looking for alternative and supplements.<br><br>It's really up to you to decide what you want for yourself in this type of relationship.. what's the fruit out of it and once you figured it out.. you will know what you should do.<br><br>*************************************************************<br><br>Sigh.. I search for years for my special someone.. those who found it, didn't cherish it.  Why...</div>

But when it goes beyond that little line and add a small dose of deception, the issue deepens and is usually no longer plain flirting. Man under this category usually has the INTENTION to fool around <strong>consciously</strong> and this is their choice, not breed from their seemingly-friendly personality.<br><br>Attempting to know someone and attempting to ask for contact number is really doubtful. His intention is questionable.<br><br>You may wished to check things out, instead of taking the back seat and wait until something really happens. Probably nothing serious actually came out from the little online flirting, but you should monitor him; his body language and his attitude towards the relationship. To blast things now, would far be too early.<br><br>P.S: Remember, you are giving him the benefit of the doubt and THIS is indeed a chance given. You will learn something new and when situation ain't favourable, at least you did what you ought to do as a gf.<br><br>Cheers</div>
