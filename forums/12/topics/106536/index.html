            <div class='col-md body'>yes rvt2004,<br><br>cherish the relationship.<br>As a guy, i must say that sometimes who stray. Not every guy will stick with his partner for life ...<br><br>sometimes when we sit in the bus, we look out of the window and wonder about whats happening in another bus.<br><br>To confront or date him out to give him a shock of his life , will merely just a way to spite him .... but if he wants to spite you back, he will leave you. unless that's what you want.... but i doubt so right missy, else, we wouldn't see you post here.<br><br>looking at your age, i hope you are no greenies in the dating game.<br><br>You got to know where you guy is the passive or a reactive guy...or maybe some other pattern....u know what i mean.<br><br>Don't think we can tell you what to do.<br><br>But generally, some guys may have some specific need for interest. For example, he may likes to flirt...In fact nothing wrong with that...except perhaps with other girls. Remember the times when both of you just started out? I am sure he flirts alot with you. Don't he?<br><br>Over time, as both of you get to know each other more, there's not much things to flirt. Guys like to flirt with things that he can't get, when he got it.... well you know how the story goes usually.<br><br>how would you expect if you confront him or date him? do you expect him to melt down on his kneels and beg you for forgiveness? I doubt so ..really.<br><br>Even if he does, there's alwyas the stigma later in the relation that you made a fool out of him. Man has ego. Unless you man doesn't. But again , I doubt so.<br><br>What I suggest is to tell him online that you already have a BF in real life or just got to know a new BF and how good he is. Slowly distance from him. One important thing here you can mention is that he is sure a nice person and will definately find someone that loves him very much. This will proabably work becasue in real life he's got you to fall back on. Man's like a grown up baby, when he's hurt emationally, he  will run back to the one who can shower him with unonditonal love.<br><br>Be there for him. He will feel that all the online dating are all shit when he spend some much time sizing the friendster up and yet she let him down.<br><br>From there, pick the pieces up. Some times, one have to pretend we don't know anything ina relationship. He may still give u cold shoulder. Hopefully he doesn't friend another friendster.<br><br>Do some thing different with him. Dress differently. As much as I hate to say, Man are visible creatures. If you are scantily dress, then try dressing conservatively. Vice versa. but don't go over board. Us e adifferent perfurm.<br><br>Know his prefernce for day and night but ask him subtlely. Gather much more info about him...again subtlely. He just lost his online friend and now he's vulnerable. get to know him as much as you can but subtlely.<br><br>Tough work? yes...no one say that relationship is like candle, once you started the flame it will continue to burn.<br><br>There is always a reason when man go astray. And the reason ain't superfical. Take an extreme case, the man may appears charge up with sex drive, but what really interest him maybe just a listening ear over a romantic dinner. The obvious is just to shield ones vulnerablilties.<br><br>Once you discover his vulnerabilites and love him for it, your man will love you for life.<br><br>Have a good life and love it !<br><br></div>
