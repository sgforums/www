            <div class='col-md body'>Me and my ex broke up 2months ago.. till now I m still unable to forget about her.. when she broke up with me.. she told me that she wants to focus on her studies.. she told me we could still be friends...<br><br>But we never spoke to each other ever since....<br><br>Clinging on to my hope that one day we could be back together.. Till one day which is a month later after we broke up, I discovered she was attached already... I almost went crazy... coz I still remembered the reason we broke up...<br><br>Yesterday being christmas.. I msged her a christmas msg.. She replied me.. 'Thanks and merry christmas to me.. and saying that the other guy (I think it's only right for me not to mention his name.. though I dun like that person that much) says hi to me'... At that moment.. I was feeling kind of angry as well as upset.. thinking that is it purposely trying to make me know that she is with him... I have met up with this guy b4 when me and my ex were still together.. He was her best friend... and she told me b4 there wont be a possibilty of them being together..<br><br>I'm feeling kind of lost and upset... wonder if she really meant what she said when she told me that the breakup was due to her studies or was is becoz there was another guy in her heart... Just one month since we broke up and she is already attached... that's why I do not know whether I should believe or not believe wat she told me b4....<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>concentrate on studies, or any other reaons are just reasons to be used for breaking up.  perhaps to her, telling you otherwise (other than she's with another guy) will make it more palatable for you.<br><br>I have been through such cases before, the gal told me she broke off because of religion (we're different religion) but in less than half a year, she's getting married to another guy.<br><br>I am trying to highlight the fact that it doesn't matter what reasons or excuse she used previously, the fact remained that both of you are not together anymore.  Hence, the main thing is to forget her and move on.<br><br>I would suggest break off all contact, since both of you are not together, you can lead individual seperate life.  By not contacting, you will not be reminded of her &amp; things associated with her.  time will heal.</div>
