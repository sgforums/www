But I would like help you see things in a more positive light.<br><br>First of all, since your gf "walk" with this new guy so soon after breaking up with you, suffice to say, she probably have the intention to be with him when breaking up with you.<br><br>Instead of being upset with her for "lying" to you. Why not see things in better light that she didn't want to hurt you by saying she is breaking up with you for that new guy.<br><br>Seeing your extreme "reaction", it is understandable, that she sort of tell you a white lie so that you can have your pride.<br><br>As for her telling you that she is with the new guy, she is probably saying that so that you will "give up on her". She already had given up on you... so you should just close the book on her and move on.<br><br>She broke up with you to be with the new guy, isn't this more noble rather then trying to double time you and him? so in a way, she seemed like a nice person.<br><br>You should deep inside your heart wish the two of them well. As for you, you shouldn't take things too personally, a r/s needs mutual affection and attraction, maybe she is just not the one for you. Why not wait and seek out another lady that feel for you the way you feel for her....<br><br>Try to be positive, and you sound young, there are more opportunities down the road....<br></div>

But mine was an outright zaosai. What I see from your ex is that she has a integrity problem. Distance yourself from her. YOu'll cut down your agony better. Go and indulge yourself in a new hobby. Study hard. You got your driving licence? If not go get one. Or upgrade your licence. Enough money to spend? If not go find some work to do.<br><br>Have you neglected your friends when you were attached? Then its time to compensate your friends.<br><br>Join more social activities. You'll realise that there're lots of better girls out there. This move worked for me. It also worked for my ex boss who's also a good friend of mine. It also worked for other people. It will also for you. You have nothing to lose when you jettison a girl who jilted and lied to you.</div>

And for the guys who bad mouthed girls, <span style="color: red;">when you have a gf but meet another girl that you want to be with</span>, what will you do?<br><br>Will you tell your gf straight out that you are leaving her for another girl?<br><br>Or will you be concerned with her "feelings" and come out with some crap excuse so save her pride?<br><br></div></blockquote>Woah... If seriously I met someone else "whom I wanted to be with" while having a partner, I seriously rethink my commitments to my GF because I have already "broken" the fundamental relationship ties with my GF.<br><br>One of the reason why I still remain single till now is because I want to make sure the next person I decided to be with (and she also agree to share her life with me) will be the person I wanted to be with, not anyone else. So... should such situation comes up where there is another woman who possess such values, my bond with my GF will still be strong and no other woman can shake that r/s.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by m_lancer:</div><div class="quote_body">Me and my ex broke up 2months ago.. till now I m still unable to forget about her.. when she broke up with me.. she told me that she wants to focus on her studies.. she told me we could still be friends...<br><br>But we never spoke to each other ever since....<br><br>Clinging on to my hope that one day we could be back together.. Till one day which is a month later after we broke up, I discovered she was attached already... I almost went crazy... coz I still remembered the reason we broke up...<br><br>Yesterday being christmas.. I msged her a christmas msg.. She replied me.. 'Thanks and merry christmas to me.. and saying that the other guy (I think it's only right for me not to mention his name.. though I dun like that person that much) says hi to me'... At that moment.. I was feeling kind of angry as well as upset.. thinking that is it purposely trying to make me know that she is with him... I have met up with this guy b4 when me and my ex were still together.. He was her best friend... and she told me b4 there wont be a possibilty of them being together..<br><br>I'm feeling kind of lost and upset... wonder if she really meant what she said when she told me that the breakup was due to her studies or was is becoz there was another guy in her heart... Just one month since we broke up and she is already attached... that's why I do not know whether I should believe or not believe wat she told me b4....<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div></blockquote>my advice to u now is DUN look for another girl. make sure u DUN...<br>cos when u tink dat u've forgotten her, and b ready for the next rs, ur heart is not and u'll treat the next girl as a sub.<br>so pls dun. remain single now.<br><br>gd luck, god bless.</div>
