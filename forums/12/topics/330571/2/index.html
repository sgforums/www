              it's true that love transcends all barriers...

              or be able to engage in meaningful conversation?

              <p><br>I hope that Hwaimeng is not havin doubts abt marrying her, but more like he is unsure if he can live with another person. </p>
              <p>Hwaimeng, I wld not suggest u to get married &amp; work tis out from there, but as per Jojo, dun get married until u r sure abt it.  Living together is a big committment.  But since u love her so much..try to work things out before deciding to get married.</p>

              <p>Hello everyone,</p>
              <p>After reading all your posting, I like to give my view. If you are not sure dont get married.</p>
              <p>As i m married and divorce to be honest at time you dont know the person you married until you are really married. As long as you are not married there is always some acting but once all paper are sign than the true colour will come out.</p>
              <p>So to any of you that are getting married please bear in mind, you have not seen the true person you are going to married until you are 100% married to him/her. Also there will be the other family members to take into consideration.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Last advice is go for Marriage Preparation Course or Engaged Encounter Weekend it does help you to be prepared.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></li>
