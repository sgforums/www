            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Kuc<br><br>I was in the same situation once. I was in love with a malay lady who was attached.<br><br>So I went up to her and told her.<br><br>She said that her family will definitely be unable to accept her dating someone of another race and she also said that her boyfriend has done nothing wrong and don't deserve that kind of treatment.<br><br>So itÂ’s a no but guess what...when I think about it now, I felt very happy and relieved that I told her.<br><br>Why? Because I finally found some balls to do something I want to do...<br><br>Why canÂ’t you do the same?<br><br>Imagine tomorrow is the end of the world, you reflect on your life and realize that you still donÂ’t know the answers just because you have no courage to askÂ…how would you feel?<br><br>I read your postsÂ…I can see that you want to shake off this burden you have been carrying all this while. Now is the time to find some balls to do it.<br><br>When you are afraid, your fear will start throwing all sorts of negative images into your mind Â…Questions like:<br><br>Â” If itÂ’s a yesÂ…what if someday she pulls the same trick on me?Â”<br>So what? If shit happensÂ…you take it like a man and you move on. At least you tried, there are no regrets.<br><br>Â“Will she be willing to stick around and remain friends? Will things be back to normal if she rejects me?Â”<br>Who cares? You want her as a lover, not a friend. Be true to your feelings and be prepared to walk away if you donÂ’t get the answer you want. DonÂ’t settle.<br></div>
