            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by askthefool:</div><div class="quote_body">sry my bad<br>but can u elaborate more on the sensible choices thx<br><br></div></blockquote>Before I start, you're getting quite sound advices from the forumites above... Go through their post CAREFULLY.... Try to understand what their points are....<br><br>In 'sensible choices', I was referring to the BALANCE... Between what's answerable to your gf and what in reality can you accomplish....<br><br>Aborting a child could be a cruel thing to do, but giving birth to one only to SUFFER in this world and perhaps face a family which is totally torn apart ain't such a brilliant idea too....?<br><br>It's IMPORTANT to seek your gf's opinion on this issue 1st... The MANY other comments which follow from relatives and family members are more of secondary importance (unless they would have direct roles to play later... eg. taking care of child or financial support...)....<br><br>Women tends to be more emotional.... Men more practical..... Try to strike a balance from there... You've got to figure out your decision(s).... But that doesn't mean that you should totally ignore how your gf feel...<br><br>How long have the both of you been together...? A 'forced' relationship is usually not a good one... Even though 2 parties should have been a very compatible couple.... Reality would drag you along to the extent that both parties would be worn out and no longer feel that the relationship is existing for the sake of its true existence....<br><br>I SENSE you're still YOUNG... I BET so is your gf....? From a logical point of view and MINUS the ACTUAL FEELINGS between you and her currently... I would say ABORTION is a BETTER OPTION...<br><br><strong>Main REASONS</strong> would be :<br><br>1. You said you're financially unestablished.<br><br>2. Both of you are probably still YOUNG. I'm not commenting on your level of maturity here, but chances are your MENTALITY (and hers) would be CHANGING in the future to come... Which would indirectly be contributing to a MAJOR IMPACT on your relationship with her...<br><br>3. SOCIAL PRESSURE. Abortion or birth, you'll probably face this in either cases. Giving birth to a child would probably lead to a PROLONGED pressure existence. I'm not saying this should be a main reason for you to quit on the relationship, but its EXISTENCE can never be underestimated on long run. Unless you're financially stable and your relationship is a FIRM one, its difficult to fight on this disadvantaged background.<br><br>4. Note that from point 2 ALONE, is enough to give you so much more COMPLICATIONS later on in life. Point 3 is not only about YOUR ABILITY to overcome, please do also take into consideration of the IMPACT on your gf? This is a relationship, it takes 2 hands to clap... And usually such impacts are MUCH STRONGER on the female than male under such circumstance.<br><br>~good luck... Make sure you have proper talk with her. Even if you go for the abortion, it doesn't mean that you'll have to break up with her? I think you've already got this point from the beginning..? If your relationship with her is not stable enough after she's sensible enough to take the abortion (meaning no direct impact of the decision-making on your relationship with her), you'll both of a BETTER CHANCE of seeking a better future for your relationship BASED on this situation that you've both gone through together and establishing your relationship not by 'situational force'.... You still can have a child in the future with her when both of you are more mature in mentality and established on status... IF under such circumstances FAILED, you would probably have SKIPPED the MISFORTUNE of having 3 RUINED LIVES... Namely yourself, your gf and your child.... To be 'grouped in a suffering case'.....<br></div>
