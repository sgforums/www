Sure gain weigh! Or you get posted to some zuo bo camp, make you whack canteen breaks every morning, lunch, afternoon tea break... sure gain weigh...<br><br>Either that, if all else fails, bloody hell just eat pure lard when you come back Singapore, go newton to eat char kway teow ASK for more oil and pak yu(pork lard). Whack all the lard you can find and make sure you have 3 servings of lard each time for 5 meals a day! If you still can't gain weigh after 1 year of that, you can stop trying then.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heh, I'm also the same age as you. Yah, do some exercise like jogging and push-ups, etc. For me I try to run at least 10 miles or so a week, and do at least 50 push-ups a day.

I can't even do 5 pull-ups.<br><br>Try to motivate yourself mentally and emotionally. E.G. I'm going through all these because I want to be healthier and stronger, I don't wanna embarass myself in front of the ladies, etc. Writing down helps, though I don't go for that.<br><br>The protein stuff at GNC is quite useful. i've been taking protein powders and bars for a few months, and I can roughly see the effects.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dun like  sweating like mad? hehhe like me, that's why i took up working out in gym instead with a healthy diet. It'll go real well.... within a year or 2, you'll see your muscle growing  and V shape forming. Diet and supplene tis important too.<br><br>However, w/o those jogging and stuff, you'll only gain those Strength but not much stamina. Maybe swimming is good occasionlly since you dun perspire.<br><br>Do read up more on how to acheive that. If dun want spent money on gym and supplement, it'll be tougher though.... a lot of self dispine is needed then... just invest in 2 dumbbells and  maybe a pushup bar to do simple excerise at home (not just a few but like continuous one for 1-2 hours! Play play style wouln't work). With just 2 dumbbell you'll be amazed how much you can do.<br><br>Swimming and diet... yes rememebr these.. no point getting those muscle pumped up with layer of fats surrounding it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yeah.. just saw you mention you're skinny type.. definetely some supplement from GNC, or you'll not gain much from those pumping. Read up more on which brand and what supplement to get.<br><br>I used to take Protein powder and amino acid(not really advisable coz heaty) in the past.</div>
