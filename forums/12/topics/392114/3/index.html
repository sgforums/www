              <p>This is another indication that the stories are fake.</p>
              <p>It is almost similar, except you permutate and change some actors and details.</p>
              <p>So the "Malay" guy is changed to "Caucasian" guy.</p>
              <p>My guess is, in the next one, you will see "Indian" guy.</p>
              <p>All the non-Chinese race will be inserted inside the story.</p>
              <p>Hmm...</p>
              <p>Only fools would believe such internet chain mails. You guys are more stupid than those victims of Nigerian scammers.</p>
              <p>How many times I said, dont spread unclear online rumours.</p>
              <p>'"My friend's friend experienced this" , means its a fake story already.</p>
              <p>"Pass it around to everyone you know", means it is confirmed 99% you are being asked to be a stupid chain mail agent.</p>

              <p>actually, my experience is slightly different, I kenna quite a few times now from indian nationals, they'll come up to you, wag their heads, and ask for little things like cigarettes if they see you smoking or a few dollars for cab fare, invariably saying they have lost their wallets and passport or what not. And some of them have quite good english with definitely a non-local accent.</p>
              <p>just last year outside the old supreme court towards boat quay this fellow came up to me and straight up asked for 10 dollars for cab fare, saying his international card got swallowed up by the ATM, I refused, and he just turned and walked away, then he turned around and said loudly, "those two boys behind me were kind enough to give me $10, thank you boys, you are really kind hearted, your parents would be proud of you !" and then he waves at this two teenagers behind him ....</p>
              <p>what a farktard, so he's been trying this trick on more than one fellow .....</p>

              <p>just like i said there are good and bad people in all race and all nationalites.</p>
              <p>i once gave money to a pre-teen who claimed she has no money to go home.  after i gave her $5 she called out to her friend and said, "lets buy something to eat."</p>
              <p>they are definitely locals.</p>

              <p>NUS farmers are always pretending to be more than they are. What they need to know is one thing. They are farmers, peasants, F-A-R-M-E-R-S, country bumpkins like their counterparts in the two other shitty universities NTU and SMU.</p>
              <p>I'd rather kill myself than end up there, or send my children to these places. And do you notice these graduates are very much like cavemen and cavewomen?</p>
              <p>And i love how pathetically funny they sound in newspapers when they talk about their "experience" in university and awkwardly say they spent 5 or 6 stupid months overseas in some dumb exchange programme, and a sorry pathetic "10 days" in South Korea. Really a bunch of loser toads.</p>
