              <p>Please do not spread email hoaxes and unclear rumours.</p>
              <p>Also, from the above,</p>
              <p>----------</p>
              <p>I noticed a middle aged Chinese lady with an umbrella</p>
              <p>----------</p>
              <p>She was about mid 20s to early 30s and
                                      pretty pleasant looking I must say</p>
              <p>----------</p>
              <p>From the above description, I can tell it is a fake story.</p>
              <p>Because why would a middle aged lady be 20s to 30s ?</p>
              <p>Middle age is 20s to 30s ?</p>
              <p>I dont think so. The writer forgotten about this mistake.</p>

              <p>I have to admit, most PRCs if not 99.99% I've known are cheats.</p>
              <p>That's because SG people are most gullible, naive and innocent people in the world. SG people grew up in a soft, kind and protected environment...so SG people will ended up eaten deliciously by PRCs....whether it's sexually or financially.</p>
              <p>No wonder PRCs looked down on SG people and they think of themselves as Upper class Chinese and First generation immigrants, acting high and mighty cos they possessed the same status as your SG grandparents when they first migrated to SG.</p>
              <p>I don't like PRCs anymore.</p>

              <p>Frankly speaking, I am a Malaysian and Malaysians don't give a damn. I once witnessed a motorbike accident when the dude was lying in a pool of blood, the pepetrator was more bothered with calling his tow truck than the condition of his victim. All the motorist just left him there for 30 minutes until some kind soul came to help him.</p>
              <p>Had that China girl came over to any typical Malaysian and started crying and accusing us of touching her. I think the first thing we do is walk away and ignore her - the typical Malaysia Boleh attitude. Nobody cares.</p>

If you started trying to reason with her, then you had fallen into her trap. In general, people will most likely sympathise and believe a female as victim. You will ended up with paying her as demanded by her.<br><br></dd><dd>Just take out your mobile or ask someone (if you had no mobile) to call the police, let the law enforcement authority deal with her. For sure, all this PRC girls dare not face the justice of the law cos most of them are overstayers.<br><br></dd><dd> Better still, if you witness such incident, be sure to stand up and fight for the justice of such poor men.  Ladies who come forward will carry even more weight.<br><br></dd><dd>TOGETHER WE CAN RID OUR SOCIETY OF THESE SCOURGES.</dd></dl></dd></dl></blockquote><p></p></div>

              <p>actually, my experience is slightly different, I kenna quite a few times now from indian nationals, they'll come up to you, wag their heads, and ask for little things like cigarettes if they see you smoking or a few dollars for cab fare, invariably saying they have lost their wallets and passport or what not. And some of them have quite good english with definitely a non-local accent.</p>
              <p>just last year outside the old supreme court towards boat quay this fellow came up to me and straight up asked for 10 dollars for cab fare, saying his international card got swallowed up by the ATM, I refused, and he just turned and walked away, then he turned around and said loudly, "those two boys behind me were kind enough to give me $10, thank you boys, you are really kind hearted, your parents would be proud of you !" and then he waves at this two teenagers behind him ....</p>
              <p>what a farktard, so he's been trying this trick on more than one fellow .....</p>
