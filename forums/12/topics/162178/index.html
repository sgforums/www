A cut in interest means they earn less but better than the person declare themselve bankrupt and they get nothing or the person end life and they get nothing either.<br><br>No matter which is it, it's definitely not a solution to your friend's problem but more like trying to escape. If you are a friend who are really concern about your friend, then I would suggest that you let her settle her own debts even if it takes her a long long time to repay it. I don't know the reason why your friend can end up owing so much money but be it a lesson to her.<br><br>Maybe what you can do to help her is more to her daily life like once a while treat her to dinner or buy her things that she needs. Unless you are damn rich enough to pay for her debts if not I would advise you against that.<br><br>And please, stop her from jumping from one hole to another. Borrowing money to repay debts is as good as back to zero. Some people will resort to gambling and trying their luck to win money to pay back debts. Be realistic, if one is so lucky, I don't think that person will ever be in debts. STAY AWAY FROM LOANSHARKS!!!</div>
