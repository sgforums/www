            <div class='col-md body'>yeah... time is a factor. As time goes by, your strong emotions will fade eventually. If you have not felt strongly for that someone, then it was just a fling.<br>So think good bout it, carry on with life  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Personally, I'd advice a nice cold shower, get a new hobby, get back old hobbies, meet new friends, bring a good book to a cafe... the ist goes on.
