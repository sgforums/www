Unless there are pressing matters for him at hand to handle...otherwise I see no reason why he should not do it.

            <div class='col-md body'>I don know how U can change hinm Clara, as for me.  I know I am umb.  basically, cause I used to be so very independ, I expect my g/f to be likewise as I still wish to carry on my own life, I mean normal relationship with my friends (not refering to girls lah).  just to remain in touch with them.. but g/f is possessive lor.. I only understand and realised years later.... anyway, I leave far away from her... me in central , her in East.  in the end , I ended up sending her home and returning home taking the last bus...<br>AS for him, you need patient, really, all the more when he is living so close to you.  guess U may have already except the way he is.....</div>
