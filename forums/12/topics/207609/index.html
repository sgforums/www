            <div class='col-md body'>I'm currently having this relationship with my gf for 3 years. All have been fine until she started working as an engineer months ago. She start to work 9am to 9pm, mon to sat, which meant only sunday is free for me.<br><br>I'm serving my ns now, which meant most of the time, i can only be out during the weekends. I dont know about the others, but i firmly believe a relationship can only last when it is been maintain together, example is like physically meeting and not only chat on phone or smses.<br><br>Things started to detoriate when i complain to her that i'm feeling very sian. Reason was i felt nelgected due to her work and she doesnt really make the effort to call me during lunch or dinner. Of course she did call once a while, but having a work which requires her to work the hours like she was having her final year exam, i felt there was a need for a more "quality" communication.<br><br>This week i was having my leave from monday to thursday. I told her why she couldnt be more "zhi dong" as in to come over to stay since we already have too little time for eachother. But as usual she will blow up and insist i dont understand her. What is the resonale behind this? I only ask her to be a little more zhi dong only to be slap across the face as branded as "not understanding " ? <strong>Am i asking her too much when time is the one that is drifting us part?</strong><br><br>Thus, she quarrel with me all the time saying things like i dont trust her and i'm too immature becoz i cant understand what she is doing. But seriously, who in the world can tolerate when he can only phyically see his gf <strong>once a week</strong> and weekdays was like strangers?<br><br>She never think of giving in when she was the one who is giving so much absences. And always like to think she is not in the fault and keep aruging in loud volume that she has no choice and i dont trust her and dont understand her.<br><br>Since long ago, she started to take things for granted. She no longer take the iniative to meet me at mrts during going out and instead always insist me waiting for her at mrts. She no longer buy me stuff where she used to buy me cute toys and sweets and even i complain hungry in camp, she never even think of buying things for me to eat in there. She no longer give in during quarrel and always insist i'm the one at fault.<br><br>Today i spot check her handphone and find that there is tonnes of this fucker who keep feeding her with smses and phone call. When been asked who the hell is he, she immediately blow out, as if she kana slapped in the face.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Honestly, is this what a gf should behave? i really dont know. I started to feel drifted becoz we are having quarrel more frequently then having dinner together. Keep saying want to maintain relationship but yet have this kinda thing and expect me to cool off and be a man?</div>

But for so long, i have been the one who is always doing the first step. Until last week, i finally gave up being the first to sms or call. It's like feeling how come only i'm the only who give in to the relationship and the other party does not?<br><br>Sorry if i didnt add that in, sometimes i go over and sometimes she comes over. But the fact is if i go over, there's no room for me, thus we have to sleep out in the living room which is rather uncomfortable and cold. Thus, it is been agreed that coming over to my house will be a wiser choice.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You know?

SometimesÂ… you just need to sit back and relaxÂ… maybe you can wait for her to look for youÂ… as you had been the one looking for her thus she might felt that she doesnÂ’t have a need to look you upÂ… thusÂ… Sometimes waiting for things to happen is the way to make things happenÂ…<br><br>Looking at her hectic scheduleÂ… she must be very tired thus be understanding towards her if you love herÂ… DonÂ’t care too much about who is looking up each otherÂ… all these will be very minor issuesÂ… Be more gentlemen and give in to her moreÂ…<br><br>Lastly, it is wrong to look at her handphone thus you have to stop doing thatÂ… what if she is the one doing thatÂ… wonÂ’t you be tired and piss offÂ…?<br><br>Love is not an investmentÂ… sometimesÂ… how much you invest is not equivalent to how you got back or how much you want it to beÂ… Buy the bookÂ… Men are from Mars and Women are from VenusÂ… after you have read the book then you would understand better how women thinksÂ…<br><br>Just sit back and think over your actions and her actionsÂ… communicate with herÂ… and let each other have more private time and spaceÂ… DonÂ’t kill off this relationship if you really love herÂ… If she leave you then you will never get to see her again as she might avoid you thusÂ… relaxÂ… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by SoonKeong:<br><strong>I'm currently having this relationship with my gf for 3 years. All have been fine until she started working as an engineer months ago. She start to work 9am to 9pm, mon to sat, which meant only sunday is free for me.<br><br>I'm serving my ns now, which meant most of the time, i can only be out during the weekends. I dont know about the others, but i firmly believe a relationship can only last when it is been maintain together, example is like physically meeting and not only chat on phone or smses.<br><br>Things started to detoriate when i complain to her that i'm feeling very sian. Reason was i felt nelgected due to her work and she doesnt really make the effort to call me during lunch or dinner. Of course she did call once a while, but having a work which requires her to work the hours like she was having her final year exam, i felt there was a need for a more "quality" communication.<br><br>This week i was having my leave from monday to thursday. I told her why she couldnt be more "zhi dong" as in to come over to stay since we already have too little time for eachother. But as usual she will blow up and insist i dont understand her. What is the resonale behind this? I only ask her to be a little more zhi dong only to be slap across the face as branded as "not understanding " ? [b]Am i asking her too much when time is the one that is drifting us part?</strong><br><br>Thus, she quarrel with me all the time saying things like i dont trust her and i'm too immature becoz i cant understand what she is doing. But seriously, who in the world can tolerate when he can only phyically see his gf <strong>once a week</strong> and weekdays was like strangers?<br><br>She never think of giving in when she was the one who is giving so much absences. And always like to think she is not in the fault and keep aruging in loud volume that she has no choice and i dont trust her and dont understand her.<br><br>Since long ago, she started to take things for granted. She no longer take the iniative to meet me at mrts during going out and instead always insist me waiting for her at mrts. She no longer buy me stuff where she used to buy me cute toys and sweets and even i complain hungry in camp, she never even think of buying things for me to eat in there. She no longer give in during quarrel and always insist i'm the one at fault.<br><br>Today i spot check her handphone and find that there is tonnes of this fucker who keep feeding her with smses and phone call. When been asked who the hell is he, she immediately blow out, as if she kana slapped in the face.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Honestly, is this what a gf should behave? i really dont know. I started to feel drifted becoz we are having quarrel more frequently then having dinner together. Keep saying want to maintain relationship but yet have this kinda thing and expect me to cool off and be a man?[/b]</blockquote>Hey guy, I know how you are feeling right now. All I can say is that she has fall out of love with you already.<br><br>Listen: you made a lot of mistakes. Things dun go bad overnight. It's a gradual process. It's not because she started work as an engineer a few mths ago that she lost her feelings for you. All along, your own high feelings for her has blinded you and caused you to make a lot of mistakes in this r/s.<br><br>Yes you are right that a r/s shd be face-to-face and not through sms/phone. But why did you complain to her about you being insecure--you feeling sian, you feeling neglected. You have to take it easy and act like nothing at all. You are making all the complaints and has revealed your insecurities to her, which is a HUGE turn off.<br><br>Of cos you dun understand her. You dun even understand what you are doing is making her dislike you more. You mus understand women speak in secret language when they are slowly losing interest in you. That's why they dun make sense to you at all. She is losing interest in you, that's why she never gives in. One thing is also she has a headstrong attitude. You ask urself if u like that kind of girl. When she is in love with you, of course she will do a lot of things to make you happy. Then when you so happy, you were too blinded by ;ove and did a lot of things that you shdnt do. When women are in love they will try to make time for you.<br><br>You know why she never do all the loving stuff for you any more? That's because she is losing feelings for you. And to think you actually checked her handphone...of course she will blow up cos u tried to control her life which is wrong. Her feelings for you are dropping and the guy who is smsing her will soon replace you, no kidding. It's a matter of time. You must consider whether you want to withdraw gracefully and look for another gf... if u have the courage. Im not trying to be negative but the situation looks bad, guy.<br><br>Btw, what did the sms say? flirty? how did she reply ?<br><br>A girl in love will not quarrel with you. A girl in love will try to make you happy. That's the truth. Stop saying negative things to her and disappear from her for a while.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Very grateful for those who actually gave thoughts of my situation before deciding your replies, from peeps like 0lala, blu_sky, Beckhamagic and boredandsleepy.<br><br>First of all, i will like to add on to what i iniaitely forgotten to add on.<br><br>Spot check on handphone is one usual stuff we do with eachother. As in, for me and her it's nothing wrong as we check on each other's hp message often. It's a belief that if this small simple stuff also cannot be make public to their partner, den what more can a relationship be carry on further?<br><br>Ok then let's bring over to today's issue. As usual i spot check on her handphone and found this guy whom keep smses and call her.<br>I will like to ask the guys out there: "if u see ur gf's handphone got so many of this <strong>ONE</strong> guy's sms and call history, will you not be on fire? Especially if she never told you about this guy before?"<br><br>Then when confronted her, she make a fuss and shout at me say there's nothing over them. Being shouted at, of coz i will feel angry and upset wad. Then naturally will shout back aint it?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Not that i wanna compare or anything like that, as what <span style="font-style: italic;">blu_sky</span> said, even if she work long hour, if she really wants to meet or to maintain the relationship, it is always possible de. Dont tell me having worked for 12 hours per day makes you the queen and expect everything to go your way?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> How i wish i could be so xiao sha. I'm this kind of guy who wants relationship to be on going, spend quality time and always have the spark going on. I had experiences of going into relationship and then things starts to gets very sian and no one makes the move to spark the relationship. Thus, i felt very sad and unappreciated when suddenly feeling for eachother gets less and less becoz of quarrel and less time together.<br><br>Sad to say, i talked to some of my best frens and most of them told me to break off. Since she already grow into such a state where she dont treasure the relationship anymore becoz she always quarrel and never really put in effort in this relationship. But deep down my heart, i really really dont wanna end it this way. Chasing her was already a feat and then for all those sacrifice and time loss for her, really se bu de to do anything.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Tell me to relax give her more space, with only one day of meet up and very seldom communication, how much space can i still give her?</div>
