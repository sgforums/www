As in, for me and her it's nothing wrong as we check on each other's hp message often. It's a belief that if this small simple stuff also cannot be make public to their partner, den what more can a relationship be carry on further?<br><br>Ok then let's bring over to today's issue. As usual i spot check on her handphone and found this guy whom keep smses and call her.<br>I will like to ask the guys out there: "if u see ur gf's handphone got so many of this [b]ONE</strong> guy's sms and call history, will you not be on fire? Especially if she never told you about this guy before?"<br><br>Then when confronted her, she make a fuss and shout at me say there's nothing over them. Being shouted at, of coz i will feel angry and upset wad. Then naturally will shout back aint it?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Not that i wanna compare or anything like that, as what <span style="font-style: italic;">blu_sky</span> said, even if she work long hour, if she really wants to meet or to maintain the relationship, it is always possible de. Dont tell me having worked for 12 hours per day makes you the queen and expect everything to go your way?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> How i wish i could be so xiao sha. I'm this kind of guy who wants relationship to be on going, spend quality time and always have the spark going on. I had experiences of going into relationship and then things starts to gets very sian and no one makes the move to spark the relationship. Thus, i felt very sad and unappreciated when suddenly feeling for eachother gets less and less becoz of quarrel and less time together.<br><br>Sad to say, i talked to some of my best frens and most of them told me to break off. Since she already grow into such a state where she dont treasure the relationship anymore becoz she always quarrel and never really put in effort in this relationship. But deep down my heart, i really really dont wanna end it this way. Chasing her was already a feat and then for all those sacrifice and time loss for her, really se bu de to do anything.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Tell me to relax give her more space, with only one day of meet up and very seldom communication, how much space can i still give her?[/b]</blockquote>if you think you've done all you could for the relationship, it is time to take the back seat.  Relax a little.  Don't look for her and 'press' her for more time.  Don't complain that you feel neglected.  Remember, no complaints.  If she misses you, she will look you up and find time for you.  If she doesn't, maybe she is never meant to be yours.<br><br>Remember, relationship is like a bird in your bad.  Squeeze too tightly, the bird will die.  Hold to lightly, it will fly away.<br><br>Good luck dude!</div>

You were a teenager when the relationship started, it's only understandable that as a couple, you guys did cute things like buying each other cute stuff, sending each other lovey dovey smses every night etc.<br><br>But as young adults now, learn that (sadly) love is not everything there is to your life. It takes more than just love to keep the world going, contrary to popular love dramas. Don't expect to be your SO's everything, because you are not.<br><br>Don't be desperate for her attention, show your understanding through words.

She used to treat you like someone important to her and will go the extra distant for your sake. But now that she has come out to work, she is exposed to a whole new world of things... You have to accept it, you are no longer her priority.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>You should stop holding to the pass, gone are the days when you both were still schooling... or hanging out more offen. Just face it, If you are still of importants to her, she will make the effort regardless of how busy she is. But unfortunately from your post it doesn't seem so.<br><br>Now she has so many new things on her plate, maybe like attending meeting, doing projects... and meeting new people all the time. She may have to work closely with some of them too and in the event, lose interest in you eventually.<br><br>Grow-up my friend, stop calling her and see if she will look you up herself. Don't be too upset over this kind of stuff while you are in NS. Don't put too much into this relationship anymore. Cos when you finish NS and come out to work, you may also have a different outlook to it.<br><br>In the meantime, Stay cool... with the guns.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
