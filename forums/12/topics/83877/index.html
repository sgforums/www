Nope, i dun think tat u R a failure lor,,, It is really hard to accept a rejection.<br><br>Jus gonna accept the fact lor. True, it is kinda of awkward in the beginnin lor... I feel tat u should jus bear wif it, n treat her as a normal friend lor...<br><br>I feel tat it will be kind of rude jus to leave her things outside, without intendin to meet her lor. Think she could sense the uneasiness in u, so she decided to meet u... Could tell she quite understandin of u, coz she so know tat u most prob won't turn up... But i think tat tis is a gd chance for u to have mantain a friendship wif her lor... If u do tat, - leaving her things at the gate, it seems lik u very Jue qing lor... N quite mean... sorry to say tat... And i feel tat it will also break her heart lor...<br><br>Better have a friend than an enemy rite? At least next time meet on the street, not so awkward lor...<br><br>Really think tat u should meet up wif her lor... Jus act lik normal friends la...<br><br>U asked why do gals still wanna be friends wif guys they have rejected... I feel tat coz they still lik u as a friend lor. Even though u may not be suited for each other, but she cherish the moments she spent wif u, n don wish for it to end jus lik tat, coz u r not suited for each other... Being friends, could at least means u both will still be in contact wif each other lor.<br><br>If she really get a kick from seein ur dejected face, i don think she will even make the effort to meet u out, n give u a choice to decide to meet up or not... Either she will jus say, don want fine, or jus ask u to put her things outside her door...<br><br>Worried about leadin the guy on???<br>I think tat most gals feel tat coz she rejected u once, u should know v well her intention liao... She only want mantains as gd friends lor... Tat's why have no worry lor...<br><br>So, puker up ur courage, n go meet her la! Gd luck!

            <div class='col-md body'>simulacrum, girls simply think in a different way than guys. It doesn't means anything even if she don't mind to meet up with you after she rejected your request to take your friendship to a higher level.<br><br>No need to feel bad about it if things doesn't work out. It doesn't means that you are inferior to her in any way. Continue to be her friend if you don't mind, but erase any hopes of her going back to you...usually it works better because you will be less nervous with her if you don't have any desire for her to be your gf...and she might be attracted to the real you once you start to relax and open up to her. Since you cannot go after her, might as well let her be attracted to you instead. Afterall, there is no fixed route to getting a gf. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cheer up, simulacrum!

Come on, I mean look guys are always at an advantage when it comes to courting a relationship. Yes, some of us might have more rejections than others but you win some and you lose some, you can't win them all... most impt, is to keep trying!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>In essence, there's so much more fish out there. Yes the time for you to forget about your love for her will take some time to mend and heal, but remember, you can't force someone to love you and if she does'nt want to start or be with you, its better to be friends then to lose a friend, i always say.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Now comes the good part, as guys we can keep trying, even after facing rejection, it makes you stronger and build confidence in yourself.

If you can't alter them, it stays with you forever.<br><br>If love maturity has a rating scale, between you and her would probably be a vast difference. It is <strong>not</strong> even about being magnanimous - its how your heart desire to see situation and things. Remove ego and allow rejection to regenerate you instead of resisting that spiritual growth.<br><br>Cheers</div>
