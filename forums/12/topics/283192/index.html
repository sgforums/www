            <div class='col-md body'>When a student asks for advice during the "exam" period or during his school life in general, why do so many people immediately tell the student to "concentrate on studies....next time then think of love-love"... &lt;-- this method of advice is too "extremist", implying that one should forget the heart and concentrate solely on the mind.<br><br>I've been through school...and had to battle with my emotions during this period too...especially since thats the period of your life when you're gonna be thrown left-right center by your fluctuating hormonal levels.<br><br>Trying to find a balance in this would probably be the best solution.<br><br>Thread starter...this girl that you like....she is in the same class...is going to be going throught the same examinations as you...yes?<br><br>And you're afraid that she will find out because you feel she doesn't know you well enough?<br><br>If so...<br><br>1) Get out from that hole you've begun to dig for yourself....if you like her, tell her....but when you tell her, also include that while you would like to get to know her better, you would prefer it if you both could first concentrate on the coming exams. But let her know that your intentions are there....<br><br>2)Now that she knows your intention, tell her that you would like to study WITH her for the upcoming exams...tell her that you want to make sure that both of you do well...and show her that exactly that by taking responsibility in making sure that the "study time" is really for studies..and not just to woo her.<br><br>3)If she turns down your offer for 1) or 2) then pour your emotions into you studies....if you can show her that you can do well in your exams even despite her heartwrenching reply to you, you might just stand a chance...nothing sayz more about a man than how he overcomes adversity</div>
