            <div class='col-md body'>A well-known speaker started off his seminar by holding up a $20 bill. In<br>the room of 200, he asked, "What is this piece of paper &amp; is it worth<br>anything?"<br><br>"It is a $20 bill, encashable in international &amp; national markets for its<br>quoted value?" replied one of the many participants who raised their<br>hands.<br><br>He proceeded to crumple the dollar bill up using both his hands till it<br>became a bundle of wrinkled paper. He then unfolded it again and making an<br>unsuccessful attempt to keep it<br>straight he asked, "Would you still be able to negotiate it for it's<br>quoted value?"<br><br>" Yes!!" was the echoing reply from the participants.<br><br>"Well," he said, "Looks like I haven't done enough! What if I do this?"<br>And he dropped it on the ground and started to grind it into the floor<br>with his shoe. He picked it up, which was now all crumpled, dirty, defaced<br>&amp; not easy to recognise from a distance. "Now will some one like to trade<br>it for its quoted value?" Many hands went in the air.<br><br>"I think this piece of currency is still holding its quoted value,Â¡Â¨<br>replied a participant in a slightly unsure voice. "This bill can still<br>fetch goods worth 20 Dollars,Â¡Â¨ said the other participants. Every one<br>agreed.<br><br>"My friends, there is a very valuable lesson in this exercise that we are<br>just through with. It may have appeared to some of you, that I was able to<br>deshape, deface, mutilate &amp; alter the $20 bill during the process as the<br>effects were quite visible". "However, No matter what I did to this piece<br>of paper, you still upheld its negotiability because you were sure in your<br>mind that my actions did not actually decrease its value. It was still a<br>currency note worth $20".<br><br>"Many times in our lives, we feel like as if we are dropped, crumpled, and<br>ground into the dirt by the decisions we make and/or the circumstances<br>that come our way. We feel as though we are worthless. It may also appear<br>to onlookers as if it has really happened to certain extent. But no matter<br>what has happened or what will happen, please remember you never lose your<br>"Value"."<br><br>Values that you cherish are indeed devoid of worldly disturbance &amp; always<br>are your saviour.<br><br>Many a times, we judge people and ourselves through outer appearance. We<br>spend so much time and money to groom ourselves but forget to cultivate<br>our inner soul and mind with education and reading. You may be unwashed,<br>dirty and shabby but donÂ¡Â¦t forget that little integrity, honesty and<br>righteousness you possess. No matter how miserable and devastated you are<br>during times of adversities, your wealth of experience and knowledge are<br>still an asset. Failure is the mother of all success.<br></div>
