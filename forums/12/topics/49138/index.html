I had know this girl who was my friend's ex-gf. We actually knew each other for quite long, but no contact since she was still my fren's gf. From march, i had been having contact with her as we are taking a course together and we exchanged contact numbers<br><br>Thru all this contact, i started to have some feelings for her, n thus i started to ask her out. I bought her to ECP for cycling, went to stadium cove waterfront for a walk cum dinner. I really enjoyed her company.<br><br>And now, I felt that I wanted to tell her my feelings that I liked her. But do u think I should ? Or should I delay my timing till later ? We can talk alot during phone or when we met outside. We can talk abt anything and she can tell me that she got some1 who's chasing her (rejected) and she got a crush on some1(she knew that it's only a crush) But, the thing is that all the dates, SMS, phone calls are inititated by me. Is that normal ? How can I tell I have chance ?<br><br>I really can't bear to hold on, but I hoped to get a better timing and way to tell her my feelings. Is there any good way ?

If it is, it would prove to be a minor barrier there. It could affect friendship and maybe because of this, she may feel the barrier too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Good company, love spending time with each other, etc - this doesn't really guarantee you love from her - liking company does not always equal to love. You mentioned about you expressing your feelings to her, my words is that - what's your motive behind it? If is just to reveal and feel better inside, regardless of consequences, then go ahead. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>IF your motive is hoping that she would be your girlfriend - then your planning for this final move would be critical. I take is that hold your tongue first and advanced steadily. A spell well prepared, would be more devastating then a minor spell cast on haste. I suggest; leap deeper into understanding on good days like birthday, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> What do I mean by leaping deeper?<br><br>You understand her, etc, how far do you understand about her speakable past? Her attitute towards her own love? The case problem between her ex`es? The list goes on.<br><br>On good days like after a birthday dinner, a walk on the beach and star gazing - (the thing is not pressuring or appeared to be kapo and she may feel defensive). The key to this is to reveal about yourself - the kind of funny, strange weird or serious definition and attitude you have for love, while she act as your audience - a good way to keep conversation good as well.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quote of the day</span></strong>: If you do not open your heart, other's heart will remain close to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> From there, you can gauge better and understand how she thinks and feels on intimate level. Probably your answer and question would be solve from there?<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanx to all who replied my posting ... i'm really heartened ...<br><br>Well, I believe i do luv her thru all the moments i had been together. I had developed this luv for her that I felt that I need to tell her my feelings, and hopefully know what's her feeling are for me too.<br><br>I do belive the whole issue now is "Time" ... if i tell her now, I may be too hasty and may not produce the desired effect. I may also lose the time to open myself up to her and also know her better. But, if i do not say earlier, there could also be a possibility that some1 may beat me to it, and she may agree to "him" instead of me, due to my own procrastination ...<br><br>That's the dilemma i am in now ... to tell now, or later ? I know its a very subjective argument, but i hope to listen to all views before i decide my choice. And r there any nice way/method i can do/employ to make sure my "spell" is cast appropriately ?<br><br>Again, thanks to all who contribute to my posting, esp Yunhaier.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Take a good time to tell her any time soon. Just be sincere about it. It's best you two can meet up and talk about it. Forget about SMS alright...that's not the way to go.<br><br>Remember, these relationship is between the two of you... nothing to do with hre ex who is your friend too. Honestly speaking, if your guy friend think rationally... he'll continue to be friends with you. Look it this way, they broke up not bcos of you but maybe by mutual grounds?<br><br>Tell her but leave her options open. It takes two hands to clap.<br><br>All the best to you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>My thoughts. Try hinting to her. if she draws back...then stop the hinting, If you get favourable answer, pop the question in the near future.<br><br>It is most likely the friendship will be affected if she rejects you. Its not a matter of how you treat her after that...coz she might just want to avoid you. So be prepared.<br><br>Of course you stand some chances if not she would not have gone out with you so many times. But then she might just treat you as a bro..this is the worse excuse gals like to use when it comes to rejection  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>No Offence to ladies out there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, the girl probably knows that you are interested in her because you initiated every encounters and she kinda enjoy them. She probably waiting for you to show your true feelings to her. She may or may not reject you, but give yourself sometime and give yourself a chance to show her that you really care for her.<br><br>Since she allow you to initiate activities, you might as well take this opportunity to impress her with your charm. It is not too late to express your feelings later. Seize the moments and who knows you might just turn her heart towards you. Good Luck and stay sane!</div>

So i wish to seek advice from all experts in here, like Yunhaier, etc ... ( I like your love story, Yunhaier ! )<br><br>I'll give a backgrd story of my problem. I had know this girl who was my friend's ex-gf. We actually knew each other for quite long, but no contact since she was still my fren's gf. From march, i had been having contact with her as we are taking a course together and we exchanged contact numbers<br><br>Thru all this contact, i started to have some feelings for her, n thus i started to ask her out. I bought her to ECP for cycling, went to stadium cove waterfront for a walk cum dinner. I really enjoyed her company.<br><br>And now, I felt that I wanted to tell her my feelings that I liked her. But do u think I should ? Or should I delay my timing till later ? We can talk alot during phone or when we met outside. We can talk abt anything and she can tell me that she got some1 who's chasing her (rejected) and she got a crush on some1(she knew that it's only a crush) But, the thing is that all the dates, SMS, phone calls are inititated by me. Is that normal ? How can I tell I have chance ?<br><br>I really can't bear to hold on, but I hoped to get a better timing and way to tell her my feelings. Is there any good way ? I know such things can be only 2 results; Success or Failure. Thus, I wanna get it over with and if Failure, i can adjust myself ASAP. But believe me, even if she reject me, I'll still treat her as well.<br><br>So all experts, plse help me out and a million thanx !!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div></blockquote>she has already sent out signals to u either to get u to speed up the process or the to get u to back off the gas... cause if she can tell u that she rejected some guy liao and has a crush on somone and bothers to explain that it's just a crush... she might be hinting u that she can accept u... just let her know how u feel about her, there's nothing wrong about revealing one's feelings...</div>

I may also lose the time to open myself up to her and also know her better. But, if i do not say earlier, there could also be a possibility that some1 may beat me to it, and she may agree to "him" instead of me, due to my own procrastination ...<br><br>That's the dilemma i am in now ... to tell now, or later ? I know its a very subjective argument, but i hope to listen to all views before i decide my choice.

Everyone is unique - be it by character or physical appearance.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Yup - the start would be communicating on deeper level. It is pretty essential, not only a step closer to getting her, but rather a better foundation for good pals to form. Your gf has to be your best friend and the baby step to this would be talking on deeper levels. Keep communication on and stir interest in the talks. Spice things a little with hints of humor as well. In no time, she would be so comfortable with you that her possible barrier and resistance to you would be negated. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Cheers</div>
