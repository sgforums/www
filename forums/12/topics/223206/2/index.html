It happen when 1 of my closer friends fall sick (she got 2 weeks mc) (lets call her F) and her slacking buddy frequently taking MC every now and then (lets call her V)<br><br>soo both being alone, we suddenly began to hang out more with each other.<br><br>During that period of time, she's not that well also but still make herself to school. I was with her most of the time. Making sure she eat smth. Reminding her eat her medicine. Carrying her books for her... blah blah blah<br><br>ok... 1 week later<br><br>V is getting better... starting to hang arnd with both of them. She also recovered. (good friends seems to get sick together...) during this period of time, realise that she keep asking alot of personal question.<br><br>One particular one that i want to share...<br><br>her: can ask u smth Txxxxxx ... (another point that i noticed is that she called me that) (as in she usually call my name but during that period of time she called me by my nickname)<br><br>me: yea<br><br>her: heard from L(another person should take note of) that u use to have a gf... true or not...<br><br>me:yea<br><br>(then we talk bout my previous r/s all that)<br><br>me: wad bout u??<br><br>her: use to... broke up with him due to studies...<br><br>me: u still like him...<br><br>her: wad u think<br><br>me:no...<br><br>her: wad make u think soo...<br><br>me:no idea... i dont even know who that guy is... random guess...<br><br>her: well... i dont know... i stilll like him i think. he also same poly...<br><br>we were with V when all this took place... they wisper to each other bout something during that period of time... didnt manage to further probe the qn...<br><br>(hope i got it right...)<br><br>soo sorry... continue later... late for school will ask the question when i get back home tonight</div></blockquote>She still like him...no good.<br><br>Ok, let's say you are attached to her.
