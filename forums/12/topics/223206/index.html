(we took different elective).  Did ask her whether she's single or not and she says "yea".<br><br>However, recently borrowed her thumb drive to store our project work. Accidently open some of her private folders and saw some pic of a guy with her. Did ask one of my friend who use to be in the same sch with her bout the guy. They use to be together. Not sure bout now. The thing is, she just bought the thumb drive like 2 week ago. (i was there when she bought it) and soo fast got that kind of thing inside. Maybe im jealous. i donno.<br><br>even though i havent really make my feelings known to her, i was very obvious till ppl arnd me and her can feel it.<br><br>Wad should i do? </div></blockquote>she know ur intention la... she probably still love him alot... but jz go ahead n ask her out n get to know her more...</div>
