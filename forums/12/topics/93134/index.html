            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortuanately, 10 yrs or not... if an event is sufficiently traumatic and that person is at an age where he does not have the ability to comprehend and take control of the situation... it will leave a long lasting effect on the person.  No amount of trying to forget will work bec it has already worked in to the subconscious.<br><br>Yes, sometimes, time can help dilute the memory and pain but the fact that you are not just thinking about it <strong>but are actually having a physical reaction to the tots </strong>means that it has affected you far more than you actually think and relaise.<br><br>At times like these, you may just want to talk this out with a counselor who will help you sort out what went on and dilute the memories and potential guilt.<br><br>I am not ashame nor do I personally see it anything wrong seeing a counsellor,  I personally do not think it a sign of weakness.  As a matter of fact, its those who are brave enough to seek help that are the strong ones.  The weak ones are the ones that hide and think that they can sort it out themselves.<br><br>just like a tooth  ache... the sooner your treat it the better it is.  so might as well sorted out soon and you'll have tons of freedom for the rest of your life.<br><br></div>

Bury your guilt for the ignorant decision and the best u could do now is try to make amends and stop dwelling on it. Nobody is going to say u've made the wrong choice because there is no right or wrong in making the decision. Stop thinking bout those "if only..."s becoz they would never happen.<br><br>take care and if u'd really need a talk, speak to a counsellor. it would do u good. hope u'd get over it soon!</div>

You didn't understand that time and you were probably frightened then.<br><br>Panic attacks can sometimes feel like a heart attack , you get breathless and your chest hurts , your stomach feels like a butterfly and you want to vomit. Something could have triggered off your emotions like having the sensation of being cornered or trapped in some way, or a sense of helplessness. Ultimately you have to tell yourself , <strong> it is not  NEVER your fault </strong> that you have to chose...no one intended a child should chose who he should go with especially a young one who doesn't know.<br><br>Maybe you just need to talk to your dad about that incident frankly and honestly as you could. It will alleviate the guilt . don't leave it as unfinished business or else one day you might never get a chance to tell him how you felt at that moment. If all fails , see a counselor. However I strongly suggest you talk to your father first</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know the feeling of unfinished business , you never get a chance to say what you want to a person you love while he/she is still alive and it sticks.<br>I regretted not telling my granny I loved her while she was still alive. She suddenly passed away while I was on holiday with my parents. I was 10 years old then. She was a fierce woman , hardened by WW2 and I feared yet loved her lots. I was her favorite grandchild. When we came back , my uncle told us that he could not contact us for the funeral. None of us knew her time was up. She passed away peacefully in her sleep . That remained my greatest regret in life.<br></div>

You din know what divorce is all about.. moreover this is all between the adults.. Well.. they never think that this will affects their children too..Sometimes adults are selfish.. they only think for themselves.. but never the kids..<br><br>This happen 10 years ago.. its in the past.. right now your family is back together.. what's more important is now.. not the past.. Why panic? There's nothing to be afraid of.. all you need is to pull the family back as one.. Harmony is what you want.. You say hurt your dad.. but that's not totally your fault.. dun put the blame and burden yourself.. Kids are normally close to kids.. Of cos they wont choose their mum to their dad..<br><br>Cheer up... Nothing is cannot be solved unless you dun wan to!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Must have been hard on you man, just make sure the same incident doesnt happen again when you marry and have kids...and you'll be just fine <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I've never had such a big problem in my family but there was one incident that left me feeling weird till today...<br><br>While I was in sec 1, I caught my dad with porn. Softcore ones, very very softcore, all those 50-minute talk 5 minute action. That guy hid it BEHIND my bookshelf. No wonder he took the VCD player to his room when my mum was working night shift.<br><br>I was packing my room one day when I noticed a stack of cds stacked vertically behind the bookshelf. Instinctively I went to open them up. "Animal Instinct", "The lonely bride"..etc.. I still REMEMBER their names, omg. Then I previewed them on the computer, all 8 of them, there was nothing at first, just kissing around.. later part there  were VERY little pornographic scenes in it, involving only frontal nudity.  I put the stack back into place.<br><br>I was awoke one night to the sound of him creeping into my room and shifting my bookshelf. He said he left a book in my room.<br><br>Then I muttered "next time dont hide CDs behind the bookshelf"<br><br>He was stunned.  He said.. "it's my friend's CD, not mine. go back to sleep". He took the CDs out nevertheless...I think he threw them all away that night.<br><br>I didnt argue further. Next morning, I went on a hunt for the CDs again. They weren't behind the bookshelf, searched the whole house..just couldnt find them...Desperately wanting someone to know, I brought the matter up with my mum, who sided him and said they were "ordinary cds". Damn!<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">BUT I saw em myself!!! Mum, i EVEN WATCHED THEM!!!!! </span><br><br>She sided him all the way even though it was so fake!!!! I felt so wronged... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>For a week or so, I felt as if my parents didnt love me anymore..they were lying to me!!..they didnt believe me and I eyed them suspiciously for the whole week..but it wore off after a while (i got tired) and life went back to normal..<br><br>Till today I've never approached my dad regarding this issue but when I do think about it, it brings back a very very funny feeling....</div>
