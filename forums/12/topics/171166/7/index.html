So maybe you can consider joining them for a chit chat session. At least you will make new friends and won't spend the whole day moping around and thinking about the past.<br><br>Let the past be the past. I have a past and I know that it is hard to let go of it, but at least I have been trying hard. So I would like you to be able to say to yourself that you will be trying hard to forget it as well.<br><br>There are many more outings taking place here, just look around the forum and you will find some to join  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Pls help.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]My Story</span></strong><br><br>The relationship was like a fairy tale initially. But then, neglection, misunderstanding and disagreements set in...<br><br>Broke off twice. An on both occasions, third party was involved.<br><br>1st occasion, she went steady with another guy without letting me noe. I thought the breakup was just as simple as that but until my friend told me that she is in fact seeing another guy even before we broke up. However, I accepted her again.<br><br>2nd occasion, happens 6 mths later, this time she was  close with another guy and went out with him behind my back. However, I tried to accept her back but she told me the feelings are really gone for good.<br><br>Question 1: I cannot believe that if u (as in her) claim to love someone so dearly, how can u hold someone's hand and become a 2-timer? Are her words too cheap to believe?<br><br>Question 2: I did all I can when we patched back the first time round. Sincerity and hard work does not help to save the relationship. I dunno what else I can do to save the relationship?<br><br>Question 3: My love for her is genuinue and I can accept her flaws and even accept the fact that she 2 time me. I dunno what she wants from me? Even though she claims I can be the best boyfriend?<br><br>Question 4: How can I save this relationship cos I did hate her after the 2nd occasion and pester her non-stop by calling her and waiting for her to come home. End up we quarrelled and at some time, it was pretty ugly. I regretted my actions and now she does not even want to talk to me. What can I do? I cannot be blamed for what I did cos I am the victim...<br><br>Question 5: She grew from strength to strength and yet I am living in a pathetic world of my own. I am lost, very lost. What can I do?<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Dear AnimalArmy,<br><br>After reading your post it is obvious that she has a major problem staying faithful in the relationship that both of u shared. My question to u is why would you still want her back ? So that she can hurt u again for the 3rd time ??<br><br>Forgive me for being straight-forward, but have you ever thought of this, what if the 2 of you were to be married and she did the same thing ?? Imagine what that will do to you mentally ?? therefore it is best to move on while you can ..... you deserve someone much better.<br><br>these are jus my thoughts, what to do is up to you. Advise can be given by anyone, but it is you and you alone that makes all the choices in life.<br><br>No one can force you into doing something that you do not wish to do.<br><br>All the Best to u !!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
