Love doesn't work like your trainees in Army because Love follows an irregular flow and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]outcome doesn't equate to captial invested.</span></strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">I understand that. But I believe that LOVE can be nuture. When we r in love, we should be putting the effort to make it work out and not leave to one party to plan everything. I also see myself making the effort in this relationship.</span><br><br>When she decides to cheat on you WITHOUT you consciously realising it, you are a FOOL to accept a patch back. This is your first mistake. Forget about the latter episode because once a wrong footing, it became a wrong route altogether.<br><br><span style="color: red;">I agree I am the Biggest Fool by just patching back. But I believe that she was really in the state of confusion at that point of time.</span><br><br>And you are still so deluded about your side of Love, when in fact, she doesn't even give a damn, as Love probably never existed, as far as she is concerned.<br><br><span style="color: red;">That's the problem. How can someone who claims to love u can change the words so fast. Her words are not credibable.</span><br><br>I don't understand why must you keep emphasizing on the fact that you sacrifice your world to someone who doesn't love you and you wants her to know about this. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Does KNOWING how much hardship you went through make any difference to someone who doesn't even feel for you?</strong></span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I want her to feel touch and think back abt the past. I am not saying I am demanding something back from her. I want her to realise that my love for her is geninue.</span><br><br>Quit grouping all those metaphors and personification to conjure a tale-like story from this scenario, in order to justify a aimless waiting for someone who doesn't love you. She cheated you a second time and you still have thoughts of patching up?? Your Love is so gawd damn narcissistic and self absorbed... that you only want her to be with you AND choose to ignore the fact that emotionally, for her, it has vanished into a pall of smoke.<br><br><span style="color: red;">I know but dun tell me that's no way I can make her feelings come back? The purpose of setting up this thread is to tackle the hurdles and barriers that I have to patch back with her for just 1 last time.</span><br><br>You keep saying she is the one for you... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ARE YOU THE ONE FOR HER?? </strong></span><br><br><span style="color: red;">She claims I am the one for her in the past but then not now. I dunno what make her change her mind.</span><br><br>What you are doing is not out of Love nor faithfulness or whatever term you wish to call them - it's already beyond that when you start to pester her. From a position of a boyfriend, you are reduced to an irritant and you are still unable to get that message into your muddled head... that because this relationship is impossible, you have to release her back to the wilds.<br><br><span style="color: red;">I believe in giving her the personal space now. I never wanted to be an irritant.  I can get the message into my head but then I just want to wait and see what I can do.</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You cannot force someone to accept a Love she doesn't desire.<br><br>You are acting like a child when mummy doesn't want to buy you toy; this child would stubbornly kick a fuss and sit there, refusing to budge an inch. Ultimately when mummy walks off, the child has no choice but to run after mummy, fearing that she would abandon him.<br><br>You can choose not to move on and dwell in this karmic relationship for as long as you will. Meanwhile, you probably learn nothing in Love and at the same time, confirmed with her that her decision to leave you was paramount to her own happiness, which also implied that she made the right choice.<br><br><span style="color: red;">I understand what is LOVE. So I am letting her go now for the time being. I will attempt another time again. But I dunno how long and what I can do to ask her again? Pls advice.</span><br><br>You should learn to wake yourself up and not harbour on winning her back. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br><span style="color: red;">The more u hope, and if the outcome is undesirable, then I noe I will fall even harder. I am prolonging my recovery period. But for the woman I love, I am willingly to risk it again. No regrets.</span><br><br>Cheers[/b]</blockquote></div>

If Love is not about the sheer willingness to plough the field of your relationship, then what could it be? Waiting for it to decompose? I am not even talking about YOUR side of the story, about the length you went to work on the relationship... I am referring to her nonchalant attitude, which comes from the result of having a non-existence love for you... now.<br><br>You seemed to have this one way wood-like thinking, that things will forever remain the state it was, despite the inclusion of time factor. This is a form of naive thoughts that is probably one of the influences that kept you emotionally bounded by her.<br><br>You mean nothing will change in life?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Welcome to the real world - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>the only constant thing in life is changes itself.</strong></span><br><br>So what if she did mentioned that you are the one for her... how much she loves you... blar blar blar... yes, probably in the past, it could be. But now, it isn't and will never be anymore. She is in a state of confusion so you actually 'defended' her in that way to justify a patch? In reality, you are the one that is confused and doesn't want to let her go.<br><br>It's not about Love, its about yourself. You keep talking about your genuine love and want her to think about the past... YOU DON'T GET IT DO YOU? You LIVED in your past, while she is walking into the future. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>She DOESN'T WANT YOUR LOVE even if yours is genuine or what's not - because it is something that she doesn't want. </strong></span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">An Analogy:</span><br><br>I can sell you a wallet at $300 and tell you how limited edition, good quality, durable and well branded this wallet is... but if you fringin` don't need a wallet, no matter how I persuade you, you wouldn't part your cash. You may probably buy if I drop the price to about $10 dollars, but in your heart, despite being genuine limited... good quality... durable or well branded this wallet is... you will NOT appreciate it... as much as those you truly desire. Even if you drop the wallet into a murky drain, your cognitive dissonance will probably be minimal or zero.<br><br>'Oh well, its only 10 dollars...'<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> It is like your Love... worthless in her eyes, with you trying SO hard to give her some weak reason/s to accept this relationship again. Needs cannot be made artificially, it must be from within. (I cannot make you go hungry if you are full to the max).<br><br>You never wanted to be an irritant? BUT YOU HAVE BECOME NOW! Screw whether you have that intention or not... the fact is... you are! YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DO YOU? You don't even understand such simple thoughts, I doubt you understand anything about her. And I am quite sure you don't even know anything about her inner realm.<br><br>If you understand what is Love, you would have let her go. If you think that your attitude/behaviour is Love, you have SO much more to learn and all that you have learn in your relationship and those useless books you have read are basically nothing.<br><br>P.S: I scorn at people telling me about how faithful it is to wait for someone OR justify WAITING as a form of faithfulness. This is complete rubbish and delusional way to measure faithfulness. The truth is: it is packaged through this beautiful word to make foolishness appear noble. WORST, when you have a few people gathering together, saying, 'Hey, I also leh...' and start this buddy-buddy-who-wait-the-longest-must-be-the-most-faithful.<br><br>These people have disgrace and cheapen the name of Love when they have placed those scenario as true love... beside those true, fulfilling, content, mutually love and loved, passionate, powerful relationships. In MCsquare's tone: you are nowhere near it.<br><br>You CAN only be faithful, if you are in a relationship, that is to say, to practice monogamy, both physical and emotional. If you are not, you are merely a sad man/woman dwelling in self pity. There is so much 'I' in your post and you don't even bother about what is she thinking or what she truly wants. She has already made known to you now.... <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>YOU are NOT what she wants</strong></span>... then grow up and snap out of it... before your value falls below ten dollars.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

But then, neglection, misunderstanding and disagreements set in...<br><br>Broke off twice. An on both occasions, third party was involved.<br><br>1st occasion, she went steady with another guy without letting me noe. I thought the breakup was just as simple as that but until my friend told me that she is in fact seeing another guy even before we broke up. However, I accepted her again.<br><br>2nd occasion, happens 6 mths later, this time she was  close with another guy and went out with him behind my back. However, I tried to accept her back but she told me the feelings are really gone for good.<br><br>Question 1: I cannot believe that if u (as in her) claim to love someone so dearly, how can u hold someone's hand and become a 2-timer? Are her words too cheap to believe?<br><strong>ditch her. talk is cheap. her actions speaks louder than her words.</strong><br>Question 2: I did all I can when we patched back the first time round. Sincerity and hard work does not help to save the relationship. I dunno what else I can do to save the relationship?<br><strong>if those 2 cant help , maybe this perception might. she does not like you anymore and is just making use of you.</strong><br>Question 3: My love for her is genuinue and I can accept her flaws and even accept the fact that she 2 time me. I dunno what she wants from me? Even though she claims I can be the best boyfriend?<br><strong>like i said. talk is cheap. make use of you only. forget her</strong><br>Question 4: How can I save this relationship cos I did hate her after the 2nd occasion and pester her non-stop by calling her and waiting for her to come home. End up we quarrelled and at some time, it was pretty ugly. I regretted my actions and now she does not even want to talk to me. What can I do? I cannot be blamed for what I did cos I am the victim...<br><strong>she cant be bothered with you. so no matter what you do, nothing will make her talk to you until she decides to.</strong><br>Question 5: She grew from strength to strength and yet I am living in a pathetic world of my own. I am lost, very lost. What can I do?<br><strong>move on pal. forget her. if you can get a girlfriend before, you can get another de. move on. but before that, let her know about the break clean cut. </strong><br><br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi AnimalArmy,<br><br>I just hv a broken relationship recently...I know is tough for you during this period too. Let me share some bit of it.<br><br>By grieving over d lost of yr gf and hoping that she would come back will bear no fruit. One has to learn to accept the reality of life and that is part of the process of growing up.<br><br>You could have self-indulged yourself too much in the past and those sweet memories both of u had. It is good but that episode in your life is over.<br>Ask yourself. Do you really miss or love her now? Or you probably miss the feeling-of-being-with-her?<br><br>Pls bear in mind, whatever you do or try to win her back is meaningless to her. Her heart is no longer with you, she won't be bothered with anything related to u.<br><br>She has moved on, how abt you? You shld be a better person of today<br>than in the past. Show her what she has missed out - a great &amp; fun guy to be with.<br><br>We are blessed with a healthy body and stable livelihood. One has to treasure what they have today and make the best of it. You might think you are pitiful but look at those people who suffer from Tsunami or other part of the world who is worst off. We are already better off.<br><br>Take the opportunity at this time of the year to plan what you want to do in 2006. Think of at least one thing which is not for yourself but for the better world. Try it and have a fresh start in 2006.<br><br></div>

Sincerity and hard work does not help to save the relationship. I dunno what else I can do to save the relationship?<br><br>Question 4: How can I save this relationship cos I did hate her after the 2nd occasion and pester her non-stop by calling her and waiting for her to come home. End up we quarrelled and at some time, it was pretty ugly. I regretted my actions and now she does not even want to talk to me. What can I do?</div></blockquote>Every one of us has a file-box in our head to keep track of our relationships.<br><br>When the two of you broke up,<br><br>You put her into that file-box and you wrote down Â“CHEATER!Â”<br><br>She put you into her file-box as well and she wrote down Â“NOT SUITABLE!!Â”<br><br><strong>You seeÂ…in order to start afresh, both parties must be willing to EMPTY their file-box.</strong><br><br>The reason why so many people patch back and break up again is because they still see each other the same way.<br><br>You have already shown her that you are willing to change to win her back, but she kept leaving you again and again because she still sees you in the same way!<br><br>You are still the guy who in her mind is Â“UNSUITABLEÂ”.

Those are great as they teach you how you need to keep a relationship 50/50.<br><br>But these books don't tell you a truth.<br><br>She wants someone who is stronger than her.<br><br>She wants someone who has the strength to dominate her and lead her but chooses to keep the relationship 50/50.<br><br>Can you hate her for wanting the best?<br></div>
