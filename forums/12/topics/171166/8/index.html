I haf bottle my problems for months. I cannot take it anymore. Pls help.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]My Story</span></strong><br><br>The relationship was like a fairy tale initially. But then, neglection, misunderstanding and disagreements set in...<br><br>Broke off twice. An on both occasions, third party was involved.<br><br>1st occasion, she went steady with another guy without letting me noe. I thought the breakup was just as simple as that but until my friend told me that she is in fact seeing another guy even before we broke up. However, I accepted her again.<br><br>2nd occasion, happens 6 mths later, this time she was  close with another guy and went out with him behind my back. However, I tried to accept her back but she told me the feelings are really gone for good.<br><br>Question 1: I cannot believe that if u (as in her) claim to love someone so dearly, how can u hold someone's hand and become a 2-timer? Are her words too cheap to believe?<br><br>Question 2: I did all I can when we patched back the first time round. Sincerity and hard work does not help to save the relationship. I dunno what else I can do to save the relationship?<br><br>Question 3: My love for her is genuinue and I can accept her flaws and even accept the fact that she 2 time me. I dunno what she wants from me? Even though she claims I can be the best boyfriend?<br><br>Question 4: How can I save this relationship cos I did hate her after the 2nd occasion and pester her non-stop by calling her and waiting for her to come home. End up we quarrelled and at some time, it was pretty ugly. I regretted my actions and now she does not even want to talk to me. What can I do? I cannot be blamed for what I did cos I am the victim...<br><br>Question 5: She grew from strength to strength and yet I am living in a pathetic world of my own. I am lost, very lost. What can I do?<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>I think u can forget abt her and go look for another one. And she will nv ever go back to u..EVER..that's the word. Why? Her actions have proved everything . And she doesnt have any interest in you anymore. And stop pestering her becos u will only look like a weakling. Why would she want a weakling? Think abt it. The fact that she 2-timed you showed her interest in you has diminished and she has liked another guy..and the chances of u getting her back is like saying pigs can fly.<br><br>Im sorry for being harsh to you. But that's the reality out there and stop getting hurt by a gal..there are better ones out there. How many times do u have to be snubbed by her before u can get the message? Stop making any contact with her anymore. It's simply a waste of ur time and energy. Buck up your pride and dignity and never be insulted by her again. If u dun believe me u can try all u wan to win her back...but u will have to suffer a lot more anguish i tell u.<br><br>If she calls u back one day tell her u are busy with a gal and say u talk next time.<br><br>Remember there are better gals out there who should give u respect if they really like u.<br><br></div>

Its hard to find nice gals these days. I mean some may look like an angel but it actual fact, the heart is as rotten as a rotten apple. What's the point of keeping stressing on the bf. Sometimes, the gals say breakup because they are likely to be confused. Maybe at that moment, they feel that breaking up will solve the problem.<br><br>Like what dokono says, if u sense any of such signals from your gf, beware.</div>

It's whether the situation is reasonable. In this context when the gal insist of a breakup why should the guy call back and beg her ?<br><br>2 years of NS have not toughened us up? but in the face of gals guys become weak so the r/s can be saved? It's not what a man should do.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think we are in the same boat. You are not alone. My ex of 4.5 years also broke off with me twice and fell for other guy twice. Damn it man. She left me about 6 months ago. I am now working overseas so that I dont think of her so much. It really helps. The last time I spoke to her, she ask me to come back one day....I also duuno for what and I knew from her friends that she is getting engaged this coming June 06. Why she want me to come back...and can you all imagine that she is going to marry someone she knew for only less than a year...and 2 months ago she was still complaining to me about his current b/f...I can understand how you feel...but there is something I would like to advise you. You can still wait but I think you should open up your choices, dont be tele minded(just only focus on your ex)....get to know more girls and do more comparsion...maybe one day someone really good will come along...and I believe it will and if you are really fated together, your ex will come back to you otherwise you will be with someone who will really appreciate you...I have sort of 'stopped' my bleeding but the wound is still painful....I sometimes dreamt of my ex too....but I guess we have to let nature take its course......the ones that will come, will come....the ones that will leave, will leave.....and hope the following verses will help you whenever you think of your ex....thats what I do everytime she comes to my mind....and one more thing...keep yourself real busy....it really helps.....<br><br>&lt;&lt;<br><br>Jon: Still upset that she decided to cut me out completely. I did not do anything that bad. Any advice for a broken-hearted friend?<br>Jim: If you are convinced you didn't do anything bad, then it is her loss that she doesn't appreciate you enough. Also, you wouldn't want to be with someone who can't appreciate you as you are, right? So it's fine - really!<br><br>If you are nursing only an broken heart,<br>you are fortunate -<br>much more so than others nursing empty stomachs.<br><br>Bread and love.<br>One a material neccessity,<br>the other an emotional luxury.<br><br>Count your blessings<br>before you count<br>the pieces of your broken heart.<br><br>There is no time to despair (about youself),<br>when there is so much to repair (in this world).<br>Get over it and get on with it.<br><br>Be brave.<br>Be kind.<br>For yourself and everyone else.<br><br>I follow four dictates:<br>face it,<br>accept it,<br>deal with it,<br>then let it go.<br><br>Â– Chan Master Sheng Yen<br>Face it - because it's your consequences.<br>Accept it - because it's your responsibility.<br>Deal with it - because you should do something about it*.<br>Let it go - because you have changed, and so had the situation.<br><br>*by appropriate action, repentance and remedial action.<br><br>face it - not easy, takes courage, the pain and the agony, the suffering and the loss all not easy to face...<br><br>accept it - not easy either, takes courage. The anguish, the suffering, the sudden change and the pain not easy to accept... death is not easy to accept, but must accept nevertheless...<br><br>deal with it - not easy, takes plenty of courage, confidence and wisdom...<br><br>then let it go - not easy, takes plenty of courage too, wisdom and insight...<br><br>four simple lines - but extremely difficult for lay person to fulfill.<br><br>&gt;&gt;<br></div>
