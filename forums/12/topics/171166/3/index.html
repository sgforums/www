            <div class='col-md body'>1st sentence: Exactly.  If you accept her flaws, then if you wish to STILL make the decision to pursue &amp; forgive &amp; pester her to come back to you, then it's time to STOP making yourself out to be a victim, because you are NO longer 1.  You're going into this with your eyes wide open.<br><br>2nd para: No, it's Not normal, it's COMMON.  Usually, it's the people who want to portray themselves as victims do that.  I could be wrong, but anyway, I don't think it's fair to your ex when she isn't here to defend herself.  I got this done to me before, Not that I cheated, but due to other reasons.  Believe me, I was freaking FURIOUS when I found out.  Now, of course, I'm over it.  But I'm using it as an e.g. to tell you how it'll feel from the other side.<br><br>3rd para: I understand, but does Not mean I condone it.<br><br>4th para: Shame on you for going into this with eyes wide open &amp; making yourself out to be a victim.  You KNEW that there was a possibility, yet you continued to go ahead.  It's just a proverb which I used for your situation, I just can't recall the exact wording of that oft-used phrase.  I'm Not saying you're shameful in particular.  I'm just quoting a proverb to try &amp; help you see things.  By the way, it does Not necessarily show that you're committed etc, your persistence may be due to your unwillingness to accept the truth that she's moved on, &amp;/or plain stupidity.<br><br>5th para: I believe the other forumites have given you very good views &amp; opinions.  I myself have already give you my point of view.  Instead of whining about how you want her back, ask yourself if you're prepared to take her cheating.  If you can tolerate her constantly cheating on you, then go ahead &amp; pursue her again.  Even tell her that in future, No matter how many times she cheats on you, you'll forgive her.  If you can't be prepared to do/accept that, then what's the point of hurting yourself over &amp; over?  Wouldn't you agree that it's PLAIN STUPIDITY?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by AnimalArmy:</div><div class="quote_body">The answer is very simple.

This is your first mistake.
