I gave my best shot to change to be more understanding and accomadating. I became more than a bf and I think it is more than a husband role. And there she goes again the second time. Now I dunno who she is really after now. Stress and sad. I cannot imagine her holding and kissing another guy. ArgggHHHHHH!!!!!!</div>

Why?</span><br><br><span style="color: red;">I agree in treating her so well. I did a lot of things for her that I can put some guys to shame. I think she is just too pampered. And I hate gals who in times of needs they will look for u and when they are having a better life, they will simply discard. She simply forgotten the tough times we had together and now just becos she is a bit successful n becoming more chio, she feels that I am not good enuff for her. With her mentality being like that, no wonder her feelings can be gone for me.</span><br><br></div>
