              <p>Hello uncle 34, for your info, ANY CONSENSUAL SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH A GIRL ABOVE THE AGE OF 16 CANNOT BE CLASSIFIED RAPE.</p>
              <p>Do you know the difference between rape and consensual sex? Perhaps you live in a monastery and believe that rape can be proven as long as sexual intercourse happens before marriage. This is applicable only in Taleban regimes. Not here.</p>
              <p>16 is the age when a girl can give in to consensual sex and do not require parental approval. Anything below 16, the guy will be caned, EVEN IF the girl is willing ie the sex is consensual.</p>
              <p>so its 16, not 21 and we can clearly tell from the girl's account that she was a willing partner in the sex. Not only was she recognised by herself, her family including her mother who had flushed her foetus down the toilet, and her ex bf's mother, to be the girlfriend of the guy, she was even supposed to register marriage with him. Its just that he didnt turn up. So clearly this guy was in a pretty entrenched and long relationship with this fucker. They even stayed together gettit?? She is above 16.</p>
              <p>It wasn't some drugged out one night stand encounter from Double O in which she could claim she was not a willing party ie that it wasn't consensual.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>You are just worried for your daughter lah.</p>
              <p>Now that uncle 34 you know that 16 is actually the minimum age for consensual age, and not 21, make sure your daughter next time wears a chastity belt with a super hardy lock made in some Scandinavian country.</p>
              <p>Honestly at the rate of the sex happening nowadays, with girls in JC already doing it and feeling proud of it, its innocent to think that anything between 18 to 21 is considered illegal. Even more than 10 years ago, I remember my brother telling me how certain JCs have a reputation as having the "highest abortion rate" = CJC and "2nd highest abortion rate" is supposed to be hwa chong..and that was 10 years ago.</p>

              <p>The way you phrase it sound like she is a dman stupid women.Indeed the guy is bad without any doubt.Only a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>stupid women</strong></span> will not learn her lessons that fallen once on her.If she reported to the police the man will be charged as <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">RAPE</span></strong>.Probably you must be the one who follow her footstep.In regard some may find her look pretty but i just find it dumb to believe in a book which publish her silly looking face.May be i will wrote such a book in due time to earn a good living with those believing people around.</p>

              <p>Reporting rape in a relationship is another matter and not as straight-forward. It might go both ways.</p>

              <p>My conclusion for that lady author is she is a willing party to get involve in sex with her boyfren. No right to say she is stupid or bitch. But neither I can say she is innocent.</p>
              <p>It is only a book. Not sure wther real or not. Dun get work up over a book written by a female.</p>

It takes a bit of courage i would say, given the amount of "dirty linen" exposed. However i would have to say that whatever the lady went through is pretty normal. I know of worse. This reminded me about a friend who asked me to write my bio many years back. Maybe if i had written back then, i could be a mini celeb too. But i held back as i gave birth to my girl. Imagine she asking me about her parentage now, and she is 9 yrs. Also i had encouragement from people who have been through worse. In any case, i believe this lady had a good reason why to publish though i have not read her book. I have taken to "educate" or share my experiences on a personal note, with friends and even my girl. A matter of options. However 10 years on, as the past fades, nobody talks about it now. Even close friends who knew and were with me back then, they have chosen to keep their silence till today.</p></div>

Again nobody knows the actual on-goings in every story, though it takes two hand to clap. For myself, It was a grave mistake and everyone should be allowed to move on without excess baggages. When i walked out of the "black" chapter, i moved on as a new person. Even if we meet on the streets, we are still acquintances. :)</p></div>
