            <div class='col-md body'>I have this friend, and supposedly the both of us are besties. We've been hanging out with each other ever since poly days. Although we're supposed to be best friends, I've always felt that there is still a wall between us. Nevertheless, I've always tried to be a good friend by helping out whenever I can, listening to her rant, meeting up with her when she's got some free time in between her appointments etc.<br><br>Maybe the wall is there because even though she calls me her best friend, I have this feeling that im only her bestie because nearly no one else would do things like spontaneously meeting up with her so she can kill time before going for another appointment. It feels like a one-sided friendship.<br><br>For more than a year, problems have continuously appeared in my life one after another. For example, this year I injured my ankle and was confined to my home for two weeks. The only thing she did was to have short sms conversations with me (we don't have the habit of chatting on the phone) about twice a week, and it was just generic questions like "how are you" and "get well soon". I didn't want to feel disappointed, so I told myself she could be just busy with her uni exams and assignments.<br><br>She has problems and always talks to me about them. And so being the 'good friend' that I am, I always listen and try to help as much as I can, despite having my own problems. But lately, I feel myself reaching my limit. I can't go on forever just letting her rant to me and pretending my own problems are not there. I tried to remember the times when she helped me out too, but I'm so tired of giving that I cannot recall. Or maybe there was none. Yesterday, I tried to confide my problems to her, but was met with monosyllabic responses like "uh huh".. "oh dear".. and then she started ranting about her own problems again and this time she even sounded angry. I tried to make her see that maybe things were not as bad as she thought, then she started getting a little sarcastic.<br><br>She might have blown her fuse over her porblems lah, so ok fine its ok she was like that yesterday. I can try to accept it. But I feel that it's quite obvious that I'm not ok too. If she calls me her best friend, why doesn't she seem to care how I'm doing? I'm at a loss... don't know if I should reconsider this 5 yr old frenship. What am I doing wrongly? Am I too self-centred?</div>

Think bout it..<br><br>yea, like you, im kinda tired with friends... we care for them so much and yet they seems like never really care.... but hey, you care for them much cuz you have good heart... so keep it up and dont expect other ppl to think the same like you...some ppl just donno what to do. She still talk bout her probs right..?<br><br>But hey again.. which gal would purposely sms you to ask how are you ? i met lots of gal, and for what i know, gals who sms to you to ask how r u in what , twice a week? Sure would have something..<br><br>The last gal who alwasys ask me how am i in sms is my ex... now? even my best female friends doesnt do that. PLease dont be a jerk and only think bout yourself... if you wanna woo her, then do it.. why you wondering so much between friend and lover. Dont forget man, you only assuming things... have u really do some research or experiment if she really cares bout you? did you guys go out together and she doesnt mind dating with you?<br><br></div>
