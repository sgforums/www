              <p>you did not know that faithful love is a scared commodity nowadays? You cannot expect all guys to be so nice and committed to one girl all his lives and only think about her only.</p>

              <p>old aunties? lol.....making them sound like they're desperate.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I guess fantasy is something not unique to men only. After all, we see female adulterers on the rise. And females who are attached or married admire their fair share of male celebs too.</p>
              <p>So quit being naive. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>well i can say i am not the average guy that fit yr description. But i am  looking for a good strong hearted woman but may not necessarily be very good looking. Just average. I also do PCC to pictures on the internet but it doesnt distract me from finding good natured girls...</p>
              <p>in fact pcc to internet pictures is pretty normal.</p>
              <p>Its like men think in this way. They eat nasi goreng at on eplace  but want to go and try nasi goreng at other places. but does not mean the nasi goreng they always eat loses its value.</p>

              <p>u think u are the only one that feels subsituted meh.........i also
              have a gf that when one time we went to sentosa went gaga over one
              japanese guy (he is handsome) so no doubt abt it.....keep looking at
              him while i hug her ard the waist....</p>
              <p>watever lor too bad i
              not handsome or tall i just got a pleasant character..so she settled
              down for me only in this sense...haiz do you think everyone can be
              first choice meh...like that how nice the world can be, no devaluing of
              humans liao.</p>
              <p>also i got ask her when she graduate what she wanted to do, she said that she would depend on me.</p>
              <p>this again means that she is with me maybe 30% or 40% is because ......of material needs.</p>
              <p>so
              u think la....i feel good meh when i though about this.....but not all
              can be number one...someone needs to be the benchwarmer</p>

              <p>from a scientific point of view, humans are polygamous. (meaning we are wired biologically to look for as many partners as possible) from an evolution standpoint, the more partners you have, the better chance of survival for your genes. in fact, women are actually more polygamous than men.</p>
              <p>from a religious point of view... i don't know, direct all queries to heaven.</p>
              <p>from a philosophical point of view, lust may be different from true love. (this is a long topic)</p>
              <p>from a psychological point of view, chances are girls won't fall for those faithful nice guys, because seriously, they are mostly BORING.</p>
              <p>from a practical point of view, who cares? rich can already</p>
              <p>who to blame? we were built this way. </p>

              <p>recently i came across this thread in another forum called 'PCC material" or something like that and when i opened the thread, i was so shocked to see pictures of many good looking women. What shocked me more was the content and comments by the people. after reading them, i went to do some research on such behaviour and found out two cold theories</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">"men tend to PCC about <strong>other</strong> women even when in a rs or when they like someone"</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">"Men sometimes think of doing some other women when doing their girl"</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">are majority of men like that?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #339966;">But its like the thought of ppl pccing about some random chick or better looking person just really like terrible fir few reasons</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #339966;">1. I will feel like a substitute, he couldn't get her so he settled for me</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">This is generalization, those that don't masturbate anymore and has stopped the practice do not contribute to the thread, only the contributors still do. How many are those? They speak for themselves.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #339966;">Its your thoughts, you think too much into it. If someone fantasize of donating millions of dollars to the poor, is that person generous? Its only thoughts.<br></span></p>

              <p>Why dont u speak to your boyfriend / spouse, because you can't generalize from reading an article.</p>
              <p>Meaning, other men may be like that, but not necessarily him.</p>
              <p>It depends on individual.</p>
              <p>I once knew a friend who is so strict and rightous, he refused any form of porn. This is when we were young, 18 or so. He even dared to get into arguments and reported other friends who watched porn.</p>
              <p>Actually, I admire him.</p>
              <p>So dont generalize, and talk to your boyfriend / spouse.</p>
