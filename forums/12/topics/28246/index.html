The kinda rebound it gives you, is almost like the rebound a real drum gives you.<br><br>There are pads that you can buy from the Yamaha shop in PS. You don't really have to buy those 5-pc pad-sets, you can just buy a single pad the size of a regular dish-plate. Should cost you no more that $50-60.<br><br><a href="http://www.promark-stix.com/Products/Accessories/pads.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.promark-stix.com/Products/Accessories/pads.html</a> This is an example of how it looks like.<br><br>Feel free to ask any questions <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
