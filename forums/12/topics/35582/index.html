Remaining platonic that is. It's true that you should not leave your boyfriend because of another coming guy - because your present boyfriend is a choice you made - if better guys are coming and you leave, this is a vicious never-ending cycle. You knew this and suppress your attempt to start this cycle.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>By the way, trying to be responsible for your choice is not = to love. Your first and deadly mistake came from the engagement - you shouldn't even speak about engagement/marriage since there is this unresolved issue involving this possible potential. To make a hasty and rash decision is to hurt everyone in the end. Especially your present boyfriend, who was kept in the dark from everything.<br><br>I must admit one thing - that guy is pretty immature when he asked you to make a choice between him and your bf. I mean, seriously speaking: apart from friendship status, who is he to ask you to make a choice right? Even though the both of you like each other: but the thing is that he KNEW from the beginning that you are already attached. He made the choice to like you - that's his own problem. You too made the choice to love him - its your problem, but you did what you think was right. (apart from the engagement thingy). Then he? By avoiding?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>From the avoiding, we can see that right from the start he already had the intention to chase you because when he sees there is an opportunity to get you, he was rejected. If this intention wasn't an intention early in your friendship, even after being reject, he would have opt to remain as friends forever because the both of you knew each other so well - think wanna sacrifice a good friendship over nothing?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Ok enough of analysis; here's Cloud's piece of mind.<br><br>Two wrong doesn't make a right - you made the choice, you have to stick with it. Even though you chose to engage with him - you have discuss and improve certain aspects in the relation with your present bf, instead of thinking of an easy way - which is a change of bf. Do your duty as a gf in your relationships and let this little chapter close.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Feelings and liking is one major part in everyone's life. By acknowledging it quickly and know where to draw the line is very important. If he wants to avoid contact, etc - let him be. There is a great risk in trying to chase an attached woman - he took the risk and failed, therefore avoidance is taking place.<br><br>As for you: As his avoidance continues, this love will gradually diminish. It won't go off - but at least take the good time to calm your heated passion and irrational sense. The both of you need some period of time to ponder over life's priorities and each personal 'right' thing to do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Even when friendships returns next time in the future - lay down the ground rules and never attempt to across it.<br><br>Phrase of the day: To love someone, isn't always about being together as a couple.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess 2 yrs is not a short time, neither is it a long time, but can tell like you said, its not a crus.... so why.  To be fair, in matters of love, there aren't really right and wrong.. if you can get along better with someone, and for whatever reasons, grab that chance, why not.  ya..ya... people always say, if you can do that, who knows you may do it a 2nd time too.  But there in, ask yourself what was the reason behind this and how it started.  It happen to me too, while my g/f was away and she gave me the cold shoulder w/o a trace while she was on oversea assignment for 5 wks thinking I will be there (that's her assumption).  So she simply disappear until the trips end w/o a single call.  Guess what, I was with my classmate during her project days and night during this period, she busy with hers and me with mine.  Then the unthinkable happen as I found out as we both confessed to liking each other.  I found out base on her reaction and my behaviour.  I could not commit myself to the new found love as I felt responsible for my g/f despite the wks of silence.  We went on a cooling period (of course, miserable too), I guess that my case was just another one of those short lived one.  My girl friend then is my wife now.  Your case, be rational and think of it as a whole, is it worth it? If yes, believe in what you think.  One more thing, how long have you know your b/f? and how well you understand him compare this friend of yours... you would have your answer I believe... you can make the  choice counts and be free from your depression.<br>Another thing, be ware that cases like yours, getting along well with your friends is often better than yr b/f, why? think about that,  expectation of b/f and friends are also different too.  As you shift gear to a higher level in your relationship, you will find that things may begin to change too, what then, things may no longer seems to be what it used to be... we all changes.. but love does not.. think carefully about it.</div>
