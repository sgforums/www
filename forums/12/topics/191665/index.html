            <div class='col-md body'>Right now, it would seem to you that life seems to be in a big mess. So it would do you a whole lot of good to just stop for a short while and think about how you're going to get yourself out of this mess.<br><br>Tackle your problems one at a time. Whatever problems that can be tackled quickly in the short term should be tackled first. Your studies, for instance. Since you're already in poly, the best idea is to simply stay in it. If you believe that poly is tough, believe me, JC is much, much tougher. The environment there is far more regimented and you'll have much less time for yourself.<br><br>Instead, why not reflect on how you're going to improve on your studies? If you haven't been doing well, look at why you haven't been doing well. If it's due to insufficient studying, then you have to learn to prioritise and balance between all your different activities.<br><br>Next, your relationship. Ask yourself this: is it worth it to be in this relationship? Can you still see yourself with your boyfriend five years down the road? If you don't see the relationship heading anywhere, then I suggest just breaking it up. It's radical, but let's see it this way: there's no point in causing yourself continuous pain for the next few years just to delay the inevitable break-up. I would think that it's far better to break up now, get sad for a few days, and then get on with your own life.<br><br>And please don't think of suicide. It solves nothing, and all it does is bring pain to your family and friends - the very people whom you love. Do talk to a school counsellor or someone else you can trust to help you deal with your problems - there's not much anyone can really help you on an online forum.<br><br>Good luck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

'A' Level cert is much smaller than a diploma. and if u dun get at least 3 or 4 As in ur jc, u'll have a slim chance of getting into the uni.. because the competition is very fierce in the local uni.<br><br>so, think again. i advice u to take things one at a time and not rush into any decision of urs. stress u may be, but i hope u can be able to handle it with courage and determination, and then walk out of it stronger and wiser.<br><br>all the best.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

It should quickly brings about a psychological clash...<br><br>Remember the other time when we discussed about you enjoying being 'unhealthy'? It's sort of like an 'escape'... To compensate for your lost of control over life... A 'balance' which might otherwise quickly trip you over and be totally lost within your own life....<br><br>You've slowly lost sense of your 'self' in life... It provides you with the delusion that you can be away from your current 'position' in life... Like your mentioning of JC, it's probably also a subconscious decision to move away from your current track...<br><br>Remember when I mentioned that you could be a 'stray' like myself? But I forgot to tell you... You need not drown yourself within a life like that.. Yes, sometimes you can be really helpless against things... But understand that sometimes <span style="color: blue;">not</span> all things need to be solved at the same time at this point of your life... Give yourself more room to breathe and walk...<br><br>Currently you've also sort of under a certain 'spell' under my Devilism study... I would not go into the details for now, but just to let you understand that... 1. Nobody is casting that 'spell' on you... (It's self-induced...) 2. If you don't assume your spirits and a more concrete soul / character to defend yourself soon, you could soon be like a wandering ghost...<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Life can be a mess, but not as big as one in which you mess it up yourself...."</span></div>

Domo-kun, a strange monster-like creature born from an egg, is short, fuzzy and brown with beady black eyes and an open mouth revealing pointy teeth. He lives in an underground cave with Usajii, a wise old rabbit, who loves to watch TV and drink astringent tea (in Japanese, "Usagi" = rabbit and "Oyaji" = older man). The name "Domo" was acquired during the second episode of his show in which a TV announcer said, "Domo Konnichiwa" (roughly translatable as "Hello indeed!"). Domo's favorite food is seasoned beef with potatoes and he has a strong dislike for apples (an unexplained mystery in his DNA). Domo is known to pass gas repeatedly when nervous or in a bad mood.<br>Contents<br></blockquote><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domo-kun" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domo-kun</a></div>
