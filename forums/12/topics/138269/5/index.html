Im sure you can handle this terrible onus.<br><br>If you arent seeking attention and really asking this question out of innocence I would then suggest you go out during lunch time and buy something nice to wear for her. If you dont want to spend the money then go home and change and go pick her up in a cab and send her home so she can change as well. If thats beyond your budget as well then you can go in your office clothes. Either way the clothes you wear doesnt really matter cos your presence is enough for her.<br><br>I hope both of you have fun.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

But i will not do anything like that with her until i really confirm i love her very much.</div>
