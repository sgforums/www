We say others but we are all the same.<br><br>the difference is whether we are willing to take the risk, go beyond what we see and give the fella (usually the ugly one) a chance.<br><br>if looks bother you...it will always bother you.  dun deny it and think u can be a saint.  the reason why u are in a struggle becus her character, no matter how good does not give u a reason enuff to wanna accept her.  what scares me is your intention to change her.  Love is about accepting the person as a whole package....just as she does about you....<br><br>you do not love her.  What you love is her undivided attention, her dedication towards you.  Its all about YOU YOU YOU.<br><br>Love is about the other person.

I rejected her b4 but she never seems to give up so what can I do. I ask her b4 ok what if I am married one day to another girl? She says she will still wait for me er...this part touches my heart. And now i already like her liao. Already been dragging like that for abt 1.5 yrs already. If I tell her straight that it's impossible for us to be together then I will lose a friend who is always willing to lead me a listening ear.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> When I am happy or sad, she is always the first one in my mind now I wanna share my happiness with her...I don't even know if I love her or not...haizzzz</div>

No we not even into a relationship yet. I am a hot tempered guy and I scolded her too but she will keep quiet but later i apologized to her lor and she's smiling again. She is the one who will like hold my shoulder all these and soft talk to me when I am angry and it worked after that I am not angry anymore.<br>Quantities umm...she is soft hearted, she loves me much more than I love her, She is willing to do anything for me, she listens to me all these lor.<br><br>PS :we briefly talk abt a plan that we go overseas together this sept and see how. She seems delighted and wanting to go because I say "ok we go together like husband and wife". At least overseas, nobody knows us lor. we can start out there first so I can get used to it without my friends seeing then we come back to SG, we can continue our relationship mah. Isn't that nice ?</div>

Then dun bother so much about her looks, since you said she's not ugly. Since you said that you are not that handsome,right? What for you want a pretty girlfriend? Won't you be afraid that she might go for a better looking one?</div>
