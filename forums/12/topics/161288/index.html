            <div class='col-md body'>Hi.. no point crying over spilt milk now.. She has made it clear that things between you and her are over.. But that is not the end of the world. From how I read your post.. you were kinda direct to her when you asked her why did she wanna do it with you.. To a girl.. She will feel that you are treating her cheaply.<br><br>Don't you find that having sex when you are into a month of relationship is fast? It looks like she is<br>1) Unable to get over her ex bf.<br>2) You have done something that she is unhappy about<br><br>What ever the issue is now.. You should talk to her not in a persisting manner. In her mind, she is thinking that you are not suitable for her. But it is up to you to win her heart back. But if she insist on the same outcome, my advice is give it up and let go.<br><br>Tell her your feelings and let her tell you about hers. Who knows, you 2 may be good frens instead of a couple?<br><br>Cheers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tsubasa82:</div><div class="quote_body">Went on a date with a gal a month ago.

Perhaps it may only be liking or even using you as a substitute, but one truth remains: not ready for a relationship begins not after the sex part, rather, it existed all these while.<br><br>When one undergo an emotional turmoil from a failed relationship, there is a great tendency to seek emotional dependency from others. What happened is that we try to restore whatever damage our failed BGR has dealt to us, using other channels to redirect our emotional focus so that we could allow time to repair what is necessary. We want life as 'normal' as how we perceive what 'normal' means to us. You see people start hanging out with friends, indulge in new hobbies, bury themselves in books, work OT or even attempting to try out new Love partner to displace their past.<br><br>Sex probably provoked her thoughts deeper - about her own feelings. She might have gained certain thoughts that render her the inability to accept you into a relationship with her. Clouds of doubts began to disperse from her befuddled heart and she gradually began to understand more about herself. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This understanding is the reason of her rejection.</strong></span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
