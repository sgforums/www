                  since JC1. but..i think i hurt her so deep yesterday.and it's cuz
                  of my gf also. I was playing an online game yest with my best
                  friend...we were play 2 person team after my gf gone to bed and she
                  wasn't too happy aft she seen it. she ask me to tell her all about
                  this girl and after that i had no choice but to tell my best friend
                  never to bug me again n stop contacting me cuz my gf dont like
                  it.  But it was due to anger...she got pissed after that and
                  del all contact with me even my msn. my gf calmed down after
                  that...she said she was unhappy she felt that my best friend was
                  too clingy and perhaps she jealous a bit.  i felt strange cuz
                  today whole day my best friend never called me, we used to talk a
                  lot....but when i call her, she told me she is going to change her
                  hp num and don't want to see me again. this is a friend i truly
                  treasure..it is really hard to come by..but i ruined it. to make
                  matters worse, i suspect she likes me since she contacts me quite a
                  lot and also she got hurt after me telling her all that. i'm really
                  afraid she will do silly stuff. What should i do?? sad day for

              <p>Not only is your comment unhelpful to TS (well neither is mine) but it is offensive to people who do have a member of the opposite friend as a best friend. The least you could have done is ATTEMPT to explain why u think TS is stupid to have a 'ger bestfwen' =.='</p>

              wife or galfriend... asking your best fren to not bother and bugging u anymore bcuz gf dont like it is just so stupid..
                              
              Yea best fren r/s supposed to be very good. but hey. who wouldnt get angry and pissed off when your very best fren told u to stop bothering him and dont contact anymore and its for the gf's sake. LOL
                              
              I still think TS and his gf are such a fool. and TS dont have a place to kneel but to kneel to his gf. The gf might b jealous,. thats normal. but TS never stated if his gf wanted him to tell his best friend not to bother him anymore?
                              
              Worst part is his best friend might have liking him. How do i know this? Bcuz his best fren seems to call TS alot. But hey, only calling doesnt mean anything. Its jus to chat. But i never know and TS never say if his best friend always ask TS to go out shopping or watever shit that over the fren-limit.

              <p>FYI, I am 20 years old and for TEN (Half my lifespan) years i have had a female best friend. Relationships really comes and goes for both of us but our friendship has never faltered. Even as she is happily attached now, our relationships as best friends has never interrupted with anything in our lives.</p>
              <p><br>Oh yea and i DO think that best friends &gt; girl friends. No 1 is talking about wives/husbands here. That is a totally different situation and if the friendship is strong enough, it should be able to endure anything. If anything for your marriage the next happiest person other then the bride and groom SHOULD be the best friend! So unless you plan to spend your lifetime with your current gf (and i mean comon, how often does that happen at this early age?) best friend &gt; Girl friend.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if u read my previous post properly, i never mentioned anything about the TS and his best friend. I agree with you because i dont think that they are truly 'best friends' because if they can argue, drama and possibly break friendship over such a matter, what does that say about their relationship? If anything i think the girl likes him. I was just saying how your ignorant and trivial dismissal of the fact that oposite sex can be best friends is just stupid and baseless. Thats all.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>i think your best friend is a little petty also imo.</p>
              <p>changing her phone number just to avoid you...hmmm.. lucky she is not your girlfriend.</p>

              <p>uh the situation is like that. I have a best friend..female
              friend.. i know her for years already. I'm in army and i know her
              since JC1. but..i think i hurt her so deep yesterday.and it's cuz
              of my gf also. I was playing an online game yest with my best
              friend...we were play 2 person team after my gf gone to bed and she
              wasn't too happy aft she seen it. she ask me to tell her all about
              this girl and after that i had no choice but to tell my best friend
              never to bug me again n stop contacting me cuz my gf dont like
              it.  But it was due to anger...she got pissed after that and
              del all contact with me even my msn. my gf calmed down after
              that...she said she was unhappy she felt that my best friend was
              too clingy and perhaps she jealous a bit.  i felt strange cuz
              today whole day my best friend never called me, we used to talk a
              lot....but when i call her, she told me she is going to change her
              hp num and don't want to see me again. this is a friend i truly
              treasure..it is really hard to come by..but i ruined it. to make
              matters worse, i suspect she likes me since she contacts me quite a
              lot and also she got hurt after me telling her all that. i'm really
              afraid she will do silly stuff. What should i do?? sad day for
              me.</p>

              <p>don't mistake friendship as relationship.</p>
              <p>friends that last for years generally are true friends that goes a long way.</p>
              <p>although the following words that i'm about to type might not help you, but it's part of what i experiences...here goes nothing..</p>
              <p>from what you type, if you think you want ur current gf to be your wife-to-be if you're at the suitable age, think again.</p>
              <p>a selfish character will not last long.</p>
              <p>bottom line- my advice break up with your current gf, or if you think u want to maintain this relationship, tell her things that you need to tell so that you can at least have some amount of freedom..</p>
              <p>nobody shld ever break up all ties with their frens be it guys/gals..</p>
              <p>the other half who insist such measures, OUT!!</p>
              <p>you go send ur gal friend (best fren) an long email explaining your situation and your feelings (as a best fren and ask for her understanding.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i've got a gal fren who are considered selfish from my point of view, but it's just the way some gals are..so u either accept it as a fact, or find another gal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW: you can't be afraid of your gf, she got complete control of you..that's not a healthy relationship to begin with.</p>
