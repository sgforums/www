Asking herself y can't u spare a tot for her too. It will go rd and rd and will not stop.. and things will get worse in the end. I'm sure u dun want that to hap also rite?? I'm NOT (amended late, sorryz) trying to say that u shld give in all the way also, but I believe u show some signs of giving in and care for her, she will also understand and return u some mahz.. Isn't this a better way to work out? rather that the both of u. start to point fingers at each other. Okie.. maybe u may say she will take things for granted, but think of it this way. If u have done ur part I'm sure u can at least tell her that u already done ur best, and there are instances which u can relate to. Unlike now, u can only quarrel wif her. now u blame this she blame that. no point also rite?<br><br>she's also lost at this point of time... Suddenly she's bearing a lot of responsibilities.

There are things we tot will be so small and dun even give a wink at it. but still to the girls, ur wife in this case, they may be rather bothered by it coz they feel and see things differently abt the baby. To think they are carrying the child, the feel and think more for the child too.<br><br>hmm.. I suppose u muz be feeling rather stressed up coz we kept on telling u to do this and day to ur wife and child. Well, we perfectly understand ur situation too. We know that u want to buy better milk powder for the child, get better food for ur wife, and to let ur wife sleep on a better mattress and stuff like that. and she has been avoidind the problems and feelings in ur heart. Maybe just try to talk to her.. let her feel comfortable. coz she may be irritated rather easily at this stage. Make it a session for her to voice out her feelings, urself to share ur tots, and work out a good plan for the both of u, and the child. Maybe hard, but just try. I mean try comforting her and also coax her to say out how she feels, then ur turn. it's like walking u have to let a foot forward first before the other can move too. One at a time to speak. even then u may it wun work.. but say have u try?<br><br>This is chance for u to relief that plans and quaries that u have trap in u.. and also for her to let her heart out. I'm sure it will turn out good coz even if there's not final conclusion she will still understand ur position better and so do u abt her too.<br><br>anyway just a word of caution. I know u r looking for some $$$, we'll try to help u on that okie?? but no guarantees. On the other hand u have to watch out, coz if u work extra hours it will mean lesser time to speand wif her and may make her feel even loss, coz u r not there when she needs u. She may have develope the chan3 hou4 you1 yu1 zhen4. though not many pple gets it, but chances is ther. I'm sure u care for u wife a lot if not u wiun have wanted to stretch urself so much to give them a better living environment. So just a word of caution...<br><br>t|rEd:<br>can't agree more wif u.. well said well said think even better than wat I could do. And also thanx for helping me, correcting my small but vital error... just only saw it today and amended it liaoz.. Thanx.. And dun say I din give u space to let u breath horz.. I din steal the whole show this time.<br><br>Funny to hear that u r not feeling in the other post. when u r doing well here. thin u r also juz stressed up wif ur own stuff... life becomes hectic and hence less time and too tired to think and feel much.. Not to worryz... u r perfectly fine, at least sane in the eyes of a future psychologist.. he ehee..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

Understand wat u mean.. giving the same prob a different view.. and even then all the different angles will be used up, so it becomes harder and harder for u to come up wif something new each time, esp to many of the familiar probs that we see in the forum.. Know wat u mean by that. Dun worryz lahz. go out take a deep breath, take in some fresh air, breathe in some ammonia gas, have some esther... then u will feel better... and be more inspired.... Will be waiting for u here...<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br><br>[This message has been edited by Bear (edited 12 February 2001).]</div>
