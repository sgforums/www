Sometimes out of desperation she will take your advice literally and apply it, WHICH may result in something both you and her do not wants.<br><br>Being a simple listening ear is already good enough for her to whine and complain for she needed to let steam off. If she wants some answers or comments. You can then tell her to give you some time to think about it and get help.<br><br>Just don't assume her relationship with her current boyfriend is on the rocks and you think you may have a chance to get back to her. Really, you may suffer anxiety over nothing concrete. Just relax and do the best you can: listen to her and comfort her with simple 'oks' and 'orhs'.

The right one can allow you to call for about 4 hours for just 10 dollars. So i guess it's alright. Maybe I was exaggerating about the TV part.
