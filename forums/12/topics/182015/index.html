            <div class='col-md body'>My bf has a best friend who has a gf. Shes the playful type, but sometimes I get uncomfortable when she starts playing around with my bf. Almost every outing turns into a disaster because I'll end up feeling tremendously unhappy. And my bf hates it, but in the past when I've tried to just convey my emotions to him he brushes it off or just gives me an attitude. It would have been much more bearable if he didn't.<br>He's a good guy I guess, but I'm not sure how to secretly deal with this jealousy thing. I don't want to be possesive but I can't believe sometimes the things she gets away with. She says things on impulse and usually doesn't think, and I did tell her before not to say...talk abt his ex too much in front of me etc. When she did once it annoyed me and he got angry because I was annoyed. (huh.)<br>With his friends too he acts like I'm not there. He's not the same person with me, that I know is a common trait amongst boys.<br>But for now, how do I have a good day out with his friends without letting it completely destroy my mood?<br>I wonder, for the boys, is it that difficult to be nice to someone you love so that they can get over it. Please enlighten me, because what irks me is my lack of understanding for the situation and how I can overcome this and be nice again.</div>

If guys are sick of girls (no offence), or his gf, he will automatically breakup and go for another. No point holding on. Stand in your bf's shoes for example, he may think.

Shes the playful type, but sometimes I get uncomfortable when she starts playing around with my bf. Almost every outing turns into a disaster because I'll end up feeling tremendously unhappy. And my bf hates it, but in the past when I've tried to just convey my emotions to him he brushes it off or just gives me an attitude. It would have been much more bearable if he didn't.<br>He's a good guy I guess, but I'm not sure how to secretly deal with this jealousy thing. I don't want to be possesive but I can't believe sometimes the things she gets away with. She says things on impulse and usually doesn't think, and I did tell her before not to say...talk abt his ex too much in front of me etc. When she did once it annoyed me and he got angry because I was annoyed. (huh.)<br>With his friends too he acts like I'm not there. He's not the same person with me, that I know is a common trait amongst boys.<br>But for now, how do I have a good day out with his friends without letting it completely destroy my mood?<br>I wonder, for the boys, is it that difficult to be nice to someone you love so that they can get over it. Please enlighten me, because what irks me is my lack of understanding for the situation and how I can overcome this and be nice again.</div></blockquote>being jealous is natural. Part of love is balancing trust and jealousy. Love your partner jealously, but trust him/her even more. All the best =)</div>
