            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Kimosabe,<br><br>I think the problem lies in.....<br><br>The difference of maturity development level.<br><br>Your boyfriend,<br><br>Might be a little lagging behind.<br><br>(Esp since you said 'book out', so I assume he's a young man doing NS. This is understandable)<br><br>If your BF was mature, he wouldn't do that, he wouldn't make you feel uncomfortable by being too close with that other girl. It's pretty common sense, isn't it?<br><br>He would've paid special attention and care, alarm bells should be ringing in his head whenever this other confident girl was around, and especially with you also being around at the same time.<br><br>He failed the test.<br><br>Again, this might not say about him as a person as a whole, but could be just on this specific point, he showed he was not being very mature. Or shall I say, socially inexperienced/ low EQ.<br><br>Don't blame yourself and taking the problem into an internalized problem, like this is a problem with your emotions.<br><br>There is nothing wrong with your emotions.<br><br>There would be something wrong if you didn't feel this way.<br><br>You just reacted to a cause. You can modify your reactions to it, but then, you should ask yourself whether you should instead modify the cause. Which is, in this case, your boyfriend being not sensitive enough.<br><br>I would recommend for option two, modify the cause. I think you have a valid complain, there is a stronger case to modify the cause compared to modifying your reactions.<br><br>So,<br><br>Why not you talk to your BF and make him understand.<br><br>I think he will.<br><br>If not.......then see how...it's up to you whether you want to continue in such relationship where communication is difficult.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kimosabe, if you feel neglected, an injustice and feel the relationship is not getting anyway, why not do something for yourself. give yourself space and time to cool down and rebuild. not rebuild your relationship but to recount your mistake and correct them. so when the next one comes along, you hv a better beginning and hopefully one that will last a life time.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Kimosabe:</div><div class="quote_body">My bf has a best friend who has a gf. Shes the playful type, but sometimes I get uncomfortable when she starts playing around with my bf. Almost every outing turns into a disaster because I'll end up feeling tremendously unhappy. And my bf hates it, but in the past when I've tried to just convey my emotions to him he brushes it off or just gives me an attitude. It would have been much more bearable if he didn't.<br>He's a good guy I guess, but I'm not sure how to secretly deal with this jealousy thing. I don't want to be possesive but I can't believe sometimes the things she gets away with. She says things on impulse and usually doesn't think, and I did tell her before not to say...talk abt his ex too much in front of me etc. When she did once it annoyed me and he got angry because I was annoyed. (huh.)<br>With his friends too he acts like I'm not there. He's not the same person with me, that I know is a common trait amongst boys.<br>But for now, how do I have a good day out with his friends without letting it completely destroy my mood?<br>I wonder, for the boys, is it that difficult to be nice to someone you love so that they can get over it. Please enlighten me, because what irks me is my lack of understanding for the situation and how I can overcome this and be nice again.</div></blockquote>Kimosabe,<br><br>sounds like your bf is not very sensitive to your feelings... however what's new there? most guys don't have a clue wat their gf are feeling, why they react the way they do...<br><br>you mention you tried to convey your emotions to him. may i ask how did you do that?<br><br>my suggestions is to have a real sit down talk with him. tell him you do not hate his best friend, but it hurts when she talks about his ex. ask him how he'll feel if your friends keep talking about your ex.<br><br>Tell him what you need him to do. I've realise that we gals can wait till the cows come home, and guys will still fail to get the hints we are puting out there...<br>so ask yourself first, you have this problem now, what can he do to make it better (but be reasonable in your solutions, like telling him that he should stop hanging out with his best friend is a big no no)<br><br>if this problems real origin is your insercurities, then you must find a way to trust him. always remember, no matter how much his ex comes up in your conversations, always remember that he choose you in the end NOT HER.</div>

I just hope your bf can understand your heart pain and do the same for you.</div>

This is understandable)<br><br>If your BF was mature, he wouldn't do that, he wouldn't make you feel uncomfortable by being too close with that other girl. It's pretty common sense, isn't it?<br><br>He would've paid special attention and care, alarm bells should be ringing in his head whenever this other confident girl was around, and especially with you also being around at the same time.<br><br>He failed the test.<br><br>Again, this might not say about him as a person as a whole, but could be just on this specific point, he showed he was not being very mature.

How long have he been in NS...? Ending soon..? How long have you been running around with these problems with him...? How often he book out...?<br><br>What's your bf's horoscope? What's yours?<br><br>NS probably means he might have limited time... From what I've learnt, though things might not work out that fine during outings with his friends... They're generally quite ok if not nice being with him 1-1?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>1st thing we've got to get clear... He probably needs time with his friends as much as he needs time with you... Not that I'm not on your side girl... But I normally don't believe in "if he loves you then he should be giving in to you and watch his steps with other girls (friends)" craps(?)... I think you're in a love relationship with this guy... Who's also a living creature... And as much as you wish for him to respect you, you should also have a certain sense of respect for his life... His needs to have friends... Have time for himself, his friends.. Whatever... Ultimately it's about striking a balance in his life... BUT... You're HIS GF.... If I tell you TODAY that your bf's actually a COMPLETE A*SHOLE who DOESN'T even care about you... It would have made his life so much simplier now... Won't it...?<br><br>Just TOTALLY IGNORE YOU... GO OUT WITH HIS FRIENDS... SETTLED... WHY would he wanna bring you along if he knows that you could be so easily bothered by things..? In a DEVIL'S CONTEXT, THINGS ARE VERY SIMPLE... If you CANNOT HANDLE it, don't go for it... He could have just very well left you out while he go meet his friends...?<br><br>Coming back to YOU... Being HIS GF... SOMEONE IMPORTANT to him... Won't you also like to do something for your bf...? Not asking him to totally ignore your feelings, but instead to help him strike a balance in his life... Help him manage and handle.... I'm not sure how his life's really like in NS now, but there's quite a chance that he might be at least under some form of pressure in there... Believe me, if that's the case... Alternating between a NSF TENSION and CIVIL TENSION is never really a good feeling...<br><br>IMAGINE YOU and HIM on a BOAT... ROWING.... Things are SO PEACEFUL... Then comes a STORM... And perhaps some other sh|ts... Life is IN FACT very much like that...<br><br>A CLEARER PICTURE is simply that you're having a problem with his CLOSE BUDDY, and YET... Being a 'CLOSE BUDDY' she is.... You cannot simply expect him to shake her off nor accuse her like that...?<br><br>Right now, you might like to think of her as a THORN in your eyes... BUT... Perhaps you can also think about the MANY THORNS that might POP UP at later stages of your relationship with him....? And in life, many 'THORNS' simply cannot be pluck off like that... But better still, they might be neutralised in other ways... At least you put in your effort to see things in a different way... Perhaps even befriending her.... Least you try in a honest way... Having to command that form of respect and willingness to ease your bf's situation... Only then shall you be returned with the EQUAL FORM of RESPECT... Even if things don't work out...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Take this as a form of TEST for your relationship... I can imagine your bf's despair because he feels lousy... That your relationship with him can be so easily shaken by a <span style="font-style: italic;">simple test</span> as such... A sinking boat is never meant to be saved by just either of the parties within.... But a willing effort to make things work out together... Or just watch each other drown in time.... A desperate cry for help out in the sea can only be answered with echos.... If 2 parties would just watch while time does its destructions.....<br><br>Feel free to PM me?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

In fact, its nothing of the sort. Its just that when me and her sort of sit down and chat, she'll go on and on about things like "oh i love his mum! she always hug me one!" or "last time me and (the ex) etc etc etc" or if Im buying christmas pressies like last year with her for him it'll be like "no la, he don't like this one. Come, i choose for you." Its all very degrading, and I did try to sort of tell her in a very nice way its affecting me a little, and she sort of just looked at me with baby eyes and went like "HUH??"Imean, of course I don't HATE her its just that when she brims with confidence and spews out all this its only when he isn't around. I'm trying not to be paranoid abt things but its like sometimes Ifeel...Please I'm with him now, please try to like me and forget about the ex? Or at least not talk about her so much? At first at the very start, I took it graciously as I could. But I was pretty open minded back then. Until I began to realise how easily I let things go in the past, and how he thinks its okay to disappoint me. I don't expect him to please me all the time...but once in a while...would be nice if I wasn't that invisible...<br>As of now I'm thinking maybe its better if I stopped going out with them and yeap, sort of just "rebuild" as someone mentioned. (sry I'm replying I forgot who suggested that) I don't want to ruin any friendships or you know...make any of them "mian qiang" anything for me.</div>
