This course has core subjects where we need to do Practicum aka be a trainee teacher. The requirement of this subject is that we have to pass the pract and the assignments for the module before we can pass the module. I just had my pract for my 3rd year in a pri sch setting and I've failed it. I have come to terms that I have to repeat it next year this time. Now, I feel scared each day thinking about the pract causing nightmares. It's coz I kept feeling guilty that I had caused the children to not learn about the required stuff. I did not teach well enough for them to acquire the concepts. I am so stressed by what might happen to them after school reopens for them and when they go to Year 3 next year.... everything... I am so scared....<br><br>How do you walk out of your guilt when you had done something that you feel guilty of? </span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...in fact you don't walk away from your guilt. You will need to come to term with it and accept it. Then you will be able to find out what went wrong and what you can do to prevent it from happening again. So once you have figured out the solution to prevent your failure, only then you can live with your failure and release yourself from your guilty feelings.<br><br>Anyway, kids in Year 3 are still stupid and ignorant...so you can still instill some values in them as in...they are still upgradable. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

What is done cannot be undone and its too late to whether you did or did not teach well back than.. Coming to terms that you will need to retake your prac, is what you need to noe.. Since you know that you are guilty that you did not do well in your last prac which causes this "downfall", change your way of approach of teaching these kids..<br>You are not 100% responsible whether they have learn anything from you.. Its what you know and you teach to the best of your knowledge.. Don't be stress over it and do your best for the up coming prac.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Wow! Thank you guys for all the encouragement.<br><br>Yeah I know time can't reverse and that I should make up for it in the future time to be. Juz coming to terms with the fact that I had failed and had to repeat took me 4 weeks. Not that I'm self pitying or whining but it's always easier to withdraw then accept the facts I guess. haha...  and of course for now is to come to terms with the accepting that it's over and what's done cannot be undone and what can I do next time coz there's still a chance.<br><br>Oh yah, there was a teacher then... she was just not critical enough to point out my mistakes and then suddenly bomb the fact that I'd failed at the end of 3 weeks. Guess when grades are concern, harsh teachers are still better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  At least it worked for me.<br><br>Appreciated...... though it'll still take some time I guess for me to come to terms with it....</span></div>
