            <div class='col-md body'>alright so if he has the ability to return the $10. how about in the future? i've introduced him to come to my workplace to work before but he refused. don't really have any idea what his reason was. what if he borrows more the next time round? i don't really know how much he receives a week but he lives a lifestyle of eating fastfood at least 5 times a week and plays basketball during his free time. totally no source of income.imagine if a regular poly guy receives $50 per week. say $25 spent on fastfood the least. so the other $25 where is it going to? and i swear he spends alot on just food alone.<br><br>i've thought of it before. using the $10 as a form of insurance from him borrowing more from me. thanks blu_sky  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
