              <p>As I said before, if she got anymore things to hide from you, she would hide it from you. The reason is that she is very afraid of losing you, and as to why she is afraid of losing you, it is because of your current attitude to her.</p>
              <p>If you keep bringing up her past to her and questioning her, she will worry that you are looking for a reason to leave her, and due to that insecurity, she will do anything she can to keep you by her side.</p>
              <p>Please show her some faith and trust. If you think carefully, was she ever unfaithful to any of the fore-mentioned three men while her heart was still with them?</p>
              <p>The answer is no. It was only after she is apart from her husband both physically and mentally ( though not legally ), then she got involved with "A". It was only after "B" coaxed her, and she stayed away from "A", then did she got involved with "B".</p>
              <p>Now that she is involved with you, isn't she staying away from "B"? That speaks for a lot for her to a certain extent already.</p>
              <p>On a side note, I am going out for lunch already, I will be back only later...</p>

              <p>Bro Forbidden,</p>
              <p>Enjoy you lunch first. My gf is afraid of losing me but she did told me to break off because she dun want to see me thinking and getting depress because of her past. She did not know that her past will make me so bad and she would rather that she did not meet me and start off with me.</p>
              <p>The real story is that she was with "A" after "A" shows alot of concerns and care for her. She stupidly went to tell "A" about her relationship problems with her ex-husband when "A" asked her about it. "A" also mentioned that he and his GF just started for a couple of months. And his previous relationships are always not very stable, meaning most of his relationship last only 3-6 months then break off. "A" told her that he loves/likes her and she thought that the guy was going to change gf.</p>
              <p>After a month &amp; half she realised that "A" always got no time to accompany her and althought he mentioned that his gf and him in a "so so" relationship. He still got no time for my gf and always says that he is busy doing his own things. My gf knew that they will not have any future together so she painfully broke off with "A".  </p>
              <p>After that my gf got to know "B" after asking him to write a letter to a telco company regarding her phone line. Then they started chatting and she only wanted "B" as a friend then. She also verbally agreed with her ex-husband on the divorce during that time when she was still friends with "B" but have not approached the lawyer yet. She also stupidly went to tell "B" about her relationship problems with her ex-husband and "B" told her later that he likes her alot. "B" treated her very nicely even when they were friends and my gf mentioned to him not to treat her so nice because there will be no outcome between them and it will be best to just remain as friends.</p>
              <p>But "B" told her that he will not care about anything including his family objection if any and he just wanna be with her. He still continues to pester her and treat her nicely with lots of concerns (i also saw that in their old msn logs). My gf then decided that since someone loves and cares about her so much, why not give him a chance to let "B" love her. Just before they started, my gf told "B" that she used to be with "A" and "B" told her that she got conned seriously. "B" says that "A" is a playboy outside the office, only those people close to him knows about it. "B" also said that he do no not mind her with "A" before and he will continue to treat her well.</p>
              <p>Just 2-3 weeks after they started off, "B" family knew about them probably due to "A" sabotage and then the family asked "A" to sacked her from the company. "B" did not turned up for work that day hiding like a tortise. My gf tried to contact "B" for an explanation through msn, phones, e-mail but do not get any reply from him till now. My gf then check with the ex-colleague and they says that he was back for work the next day and still behaving happily. Check "B" facebook's profile can still see him happily talking nonsense with his friends just 2-3 weeks after that incident.</p>
              <p>After being sacked, her friends kept on telling her that althought her husband is bad, but still did not tekan her so jia lak until like those 2 idiots. So she tried to patch up with her ex-husband but after less than a week still cannot develop back the love (she claims totally no love). Then she just told him once and for all settle the divorce.</p>

              <p>When one is impoverished, malnourished WITHIN, one is inclined to always feel insecure and one seeks certainty, guarantee(s), promises - it comes in all forms and shapes.</p>
              <p>Sadly, such a stance would eventually kill love or even the chance of reconciling to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what is</span> and one starts feeling that either one is wrong or the other is rite or ......add on.</p>
              <p>the heavenly experience is for you to partake of if you so desire.Just watch the first ripple that emanates from within U. Or is yours a ripple-effect from another..... only you know.  the heart never lies, the mind does.</p>

              to him knows about it. "B" also said that he do no not mind her
              with "A" before and he will continue to treat her well.</p>
              <p>Just 2-3 weeks after they started off, "B" family knew about
              them probably due to "A" sabotage and then the family asked "A" to
              sacked her from the company. "B" did not turned up for work that
              day hiding like a tortise. My gf tried to contact "B" for an
              explanation through msn, phones, e-mail but do not get any reply
              from him till now. My gf then check with the ex-colleague and they
              says that he was back for work the next day and still behaving
              happily. Check "B" facebook's profile can still see him happily
              talking nonsense with his friends just 2-3 weeks after that
              incident.</p>
              <p>After being sacked, her friends kept on telling her that
              althought her husband is bad, but still did not tekan her so jia
              lak until like those 2 idiots. So she tried to patch up with her
              ex-husband but after less than a week still cannot develop back the
              love (she claims totally no love). Then she just told him once and
              for all settle the divorce.</p>

              <p>That is rather direct of her, but on your part, what is your decision?</p>
              <p>Would you want to do as she ask or would you want to continue this relationship?</p>
              <p>Although she asked to break up because she doesn't want to hurt you any further, the truth is that she is also badly hurt and doesn't want to be hurt any further.</p>
              <p>If you still desire to continue on with her, I shall very strongly suggest that you learn how to control what comes out of your mouth. If you think you are unable to do so, or you cannot continue your relationship with her, then put a stop to it. There is no point in hurting both yourself and her any further.</p>

              <p>Hi, I didn't read throught all of your previous threads but I think the gist of those are about the same as this one?</p>
              <p>Well, of course we've all established that her ex-husband, "A" and "B" aren't all that good.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, IMHO, your gf sounds like someone who is very erm... should I say vulnerable, in a not so good way, because she seems to allow it to happen and continue or for some reason never seems to learn from her own mistakes. If she is sensible enough (and I mean this with no offence), then she would not even have associated with "B", knowing that he is "A"'s brother. Maybe I am too "close minded" but as a gal, that would be what I would have done if I were in such a situation. Actually, the fact that she allowed herself to be together with "A" even though he already had a gf (their "so-so" relationship aside), well, I don't know what it says about her morals, obviously not many would think well of her. She got into what she got into with "A" and only later realised that he wouldn't have time to spend with her, how much time exactly is she expecting from someone whom she already know is attached? And pardon me to say that it's kind of naive to think that "A" would dump his gf to be with her (also should have considered the fact that his previous relationships all lasted so short).</p>
              <p>I do not understand how is it possible for her to say that she's afraid to lose you and yet said to break up now because she doesn't want to see you depressed because of her. It's just too contradicting. If she really spared a thought for your feelings and is really sincere about the relationship with you, why doesn't she reflect on her own attitude towards life, and think of what she can possibly do to further reassure or prove herself to you (besides all that swearing that she is a changed person) instead? Of course I know such things are easy to say, and my opinion is just as a 3rd party and outsider.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, sorry to say that I don't actually have a very good impression of your gf because of how she seems to put herself out there. She seems to make herself too available to men. And when I say too available, it doesn't necessarily have to mean for sex or relationships. I get the impression that she is someone who just needs to be emotionally dependant on men. She probably does not really understand what it really means to love someone when it seems that she doesn't even seem to love herself (ä¸�è‡ªçˆ±), which is a totally different meaning than selfishness, which I feel that this is what she is. If I were in your position I probably would not know how to trust her especially when she says things like she has changed, etc. From what you describe about her marriage, and then "A", she develops the idea about dropping the relationship so easily because it seems like it's the easiest way out? And now she's saying about breaking up to you also...</p>
              <p>If you feel that you cannot trust her, and if you are always going to be thinking about her past and find it difficult to accept, or you feel that you probably don't have the patience to give her the time to prove her sincerity (in which case I feel would be a long term thing), then yes, I too feel that there is no point that you continue with her. If you do decide that you want to still be with her, then what I can suggest is not to allow her access to your possessions (eg. finances) so easily until you feel more at ease and these problems gradually stop replaying in your head.</p>
              <p>I hope none of my words are offensive in anyway because I do not have such intentions and I apologise if you do feel offended. Nevertheless, good luck!</p>
              <p>On another note, I think it was quite rude of you to read through her MSN logs. It's an invasion of privacy and sometimes you'll never know if you come across something you wish you'd never seen =)</p>

              <p><span><span style="font-family: Tahoma;">I am
              back again with another thread..Actually I do not have much ppl to
              share my problems with including my frens or family so I will have
              to nag it out here..This is the full story of wat actually happens
              previously to my gf.<br> <br> Cut it short. my current gf is a divorcee which had all the
              procedures done properly in jul 2008. She was in a bad marriage
              with her ex husband (neglected her and also bad temper, scolded her
              in public) whom she rom in 2003 and had traditional wedding done in
              2005. She wanted to delay the traditional wedding to a later date
              because her ex and her used to have alot of quarrels even during
              dating time. But because her dad passes away back in 2005, the ex
              husband's mum wanted them to have the traditional wedding done
              within 100 days.. She was sadden by her dad's passing and given in
              after constant pestering by the ex husband's mum. My gf was also
              hoping that the husband will change after starting a family and
              stop his bad temper and behaviour.<br> <br> However, the ex husband habits did not change and got worst after
              marriage. Finally 2 years later after the marriage, she decided
              that she cannot tolerate him anymore and went on a cold war with
              him. She kept asking her ex-husband on how to settle their things
              but he just say do whatever you want. But she wanted to ask for a
              divorce back then but did not have the guts to ask, fearing that
              she will need to explain to alot of people on why she is the one
              first asking for a divorce. She wanted the ex-husband to open the
              mouth and agree on the divorce but he just kept dragging. During a
              period of 6 months which they are in cold war which she claim that
              she no longer loves the husband, she kept on asking for a proper
              settlement but the husband just kept on dragging.<br> <br> Just around 3 months before she when cold war with her ex-husband.
              An ex-colleague call "A" from her ex company installed msn for her
              saying for easy communications for work related matters. Then he
              asked her out for dinner 2 months before she went on cold war with
              her ex-husband using the reason "on company behalf". "A" asked her
              during that outing whether is she married and she said "yes". "A"
              also told her that his relationships are always not stable and he
              just started out with his current gf for a few months only. On the
              way back, "A" asked her on how is her relationship with her husband
              and she told him that they always quarrel on and off. They resumed
              talking like normal friends back in office for around 2 months
              after that dinner.<span> </span><br> <br> After that, she went on a cold war with her ex-husband (which I
              mentioned in paragraph 3 above) after a serious quarrel. "A" then
              asked her out again during that period for a drinking session and
              she told him that day that she and her husband is in a cold war.
              "A" then console her and also cares alot about her back in office
              after that drinking session. In a period of 2 months after that
              drinking session, they went out a couple of times for drinking and
              finally after 2 months. "A" told her that he loves her (she also
              fell in love with him) and she had sex with him. This went on for
              around 1 1/2 months until she decided to break off with him after
              knowing that they will not have any future together. Because "A"
              got no time to accompany her. (another story inside that office on
              the 2 paragraphs below which i did not know until i started 3
              months with my gf)<br> <br> My gf told me that she was separated for her ex husband for 6
              months and divorced back in mid 2008. I thought during that time it
              was an official separation and not some self-proclaimed separation
              (her defination of separation means no sex) which she claimed
              (before I started with her). I thought initially that those sexual
              incidents which i mentioned about that ex-colleague happened during
              an official separation period. I got over it after knowing the
              truth and she also mentioned that she had an abortion months just
              before getting the traditional wedding with her ex-husband. Her
              abortion was due to financially not stable during that time and she
              also fears of her unstable relationship with her ex husband.<br> <br> After 3 months with my gf, she told me that she hide something from
              me. Around 1 month after that relationship with that ex-colleague
              "A" ended. The brother of that ex-colleague "A" (let's name him
              "B") also came to chat with her and asked her out. She wanted "B"
              as a fren initially and told him that everything is not possible
              between them and told her not to treat her so nicely because she
              fears of being hurt again (after that ex-colleague "A") incident.
              "B" kept on treating her nicely and told her that he loves her and
              cannot live without her ("B" will choose to be with her even if his
              family objects). And then she decided to give "B" a chance to love
              her and she fell in love with "B" because nobody ever love her so
              much. Before starting with "B", she also told "B" that she used to
              have a relationship with his brother "A". "B" then told her that
              she was conned and his brother is a well-known playboy outside the
              office. My gf also had sex with "B" and they been together for 2
              weeks before "A" found out about them and told his family. The
              family then told "A" to sacked my gf from the company and my gf
              kept on calling, messaging, e-mail "B" for a proper explanation but
              he has not return any call or message.<br> <br> She and her ex-husband did agree verbally on divorce before she
              starts with "B" but did not sign any agreements yet.<br> <br> I've also seen her old msn logs with her mutual fren before she
              knew me and it says after tat incident was:
              (çœŸçš„å¥½ç´¯å¥½ç´¯ï¼�å¾ˆæƒ³æ‰¾ä¸€ä¸ªæ�¥ä¾�é� ã€‚ã€‚å�¯æ˜¯åŽŸæ�¥ä¸–ç•Œä¸�æ˜¯æˆ‘æƒ³è±¡é‚£æ ·å®Œç¾Žçš„å’¯ï¼�å…œäº†ä¸€å¤§åœˆåŽŸæ�¥åˆ°æœ€å�Žå…¨éƒ¨éƒ½æ˜¯å�‡çš„ã€‚ã€‚ã€‚æ‰€ä»¥æˆ‘å¼€å§‹è¶Šæ�¥è¶Šä¸�ç›¸ä¿¡å¾ˆå¤šä¸œè¥¿äº†ã€‚ã€‚å…¶å®žæˆ‘ä¹Ÿæ˜¯ä¸€ä¸ªæ™®é€šå¥³å­©å­�è€Œå·²ï¼Œéš¾é�“è¦�æ‰¾ä¸€ä¸ªçœŸçˆ±é‚£ä¹ˆéš¾å�—?
              æˆ‘ä»˜å‡ºçš„æˆ‘ä»Žæ²¡æœ‰è¦�æ±‚å›žæŠ¥è¿‡ï¼Œå�¯æ˜¯åˆ°æœ€å�Žæˆ‘ç»™äººå®¶å¼„å¾—å¤šä¹ˆæ®‹å�—ï¼Ÿåˆ«äººæŠŠæˆ‘å½“å‚»ç“œã€‚ã€‚)<br> <br> I knew that she know her mistakes and was dubed by those 2 fellows
              after seeing those msn logs but I can't stop worrying.<br> <br> After being sacked from the ex-company, my gf's frens kept on
              advising her that how those 2 guys ("A" &amp; "B") treated her and
              her ex-husband (althought bad temper and neglectance) still did
              love her and never did such things to her. She tried to patch back
              with her ex-husband but could not after just one week (no love for
              him anymore) and then they confirmed on the divorce and went to
              file the divorce procedures.<span> </span><br> <br> I've have been thinking alot for the past few months. This is my
              first serious relationship and it had to be that hard. I am
              thinking how come she is so messy and I kept on thinking of her bad
              things. She also has abit of financial loans to clear herself after
              all those divorce proceedings. She is not earning much either and
              is working currently on work permit so she does not have CPF
              either. Assuming I will have to get my own resale flat next time.
              She promised to save money and so far I've seen her saving but not
              alot.<span> </span><br> <br> Althought gf sweared to me many times that she will not do such
              things ever again, will shoot by thunder etc. If any problem
              happens between us she will make sure that we do not have any links
              before she can find someone else to take care of her. But I cannot
              stop asking her for assurance every now and then.<br> <br> I am also stressed by things like financially when I thought of the
              future. And also have to cope with her messy past. I am getting
              very stressed out but cannot find anyone to talk to.<br> <br> We had a quarrel recently about those things of her past and she
              cried. She wished that she did not know me back then and she will
              not have started with me. She says that she is sad for causing so
              much stress in me, she did not know that her past will make me
              think so much.<br></span></span></p>
