              <p>Good for her !!</p>
              <p>Her failed relationship is her own life experience she must endure , so that she may avoid similar pitfalls again in future.</p>
              <p>A smart woman like her will know what NOT to do again. She has changed, NOT for you, but for her own benefit.</p>
              <p>Aside from her past experience.. if you can actually put it behind you.... she is just another normal gal.</p>

              <p>Jojo gave a very good point, which I didn't realise too until now. You are using what she confides in you against her, and that is a very cruel thing to do.</p>
              <p>From what you have said thus far, I assume that you would still want to carry on your relationship with her. If that is the case, start having faith in her for a change. Be more than a listening ear to her, be the knight in shining armour which she wishes for, the one who will truly love and protect her.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hi, I didn't read throught all of your previous threads but I think the gist of those are about the same as this one?</p>
              <p>Well, of course we've all established that her ex-husband, "A" and "B" aren't all that good.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, IMHO, your gf sounds like someone who is very erm... should I say vulnerable, in a not so good way, because she seems to allow it to happen and continue or for some reason never seems to learn from her own mistakes. If she is sensible enough (and I mean this with no offence), then she would not even have associated with "B", knowing that he is "A"'s brother. Maybe I am too "close minded" but as a gal, that would be what I would have done if I were in such a situation. Actually, the fact that she allowed herself to be together with "A" even though he already had a gf (their "so-so" relationship aside), well, I don't know what it says about her morals, obviously not many would think well of her. She got into what she got into with "A" and only later realised that he wouldn't have time to spend with her, how much time exactly is she expecting from someone whom she already know is attached? And pardon me to say that it's kind of naive to think that "A" would dump his gf to be with her (also should have considered the fact that his previous relationships all lasted so short).</p>
              <p>I do not understand how is it possible for her to say that she's afraid to lose you and yet said to break up now because she doesn't want to see you depressed because of her. It's just too contradicting. If she really spared a thought for your feelings and is really sincere about the relationship with you, why doesn't she reflect on her own attitude towards life, and think of what she can possibly do to further reassure or prove herself to you (besides all that swearing that she is a changed person) instead? Of course I know such things are easy to say, and my opinion is just as a 3rd party and outsider.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, sorry to say that I don't actually have a very good impression of your gf because of how she seems to put herself out there. She seems to make herself too available to men. And when I say too available, it doesn't necessarily have to mean for sex or relationships. I get the impression that she is someone who just needs to be emotionally dependant on men. She probably does not really understand what it really means to love someone when it seems that she doesn't even seem to love herself (ä¸�è‡ªçˆ±), which is a totally different meaning than selfishness, which I feel that this is what she is. If I were in your position I probably would not know how to trust her especially when she says things like she has changed, etc. From what you describe about her marriage, and then "A", she develops the idea about dropping the relationship so easily because it seems like it's the easiest way out? And now she's saying about breaking up to you also...</p>
              <p>If you feel that you cannot trust her, and if you are always going to be thinking about her past and find it difficult to accept, or you feel that you probably don't have the patience to give her the time to prove her sincerity (in which case I feel would be a long term thing), then yes, I too feel that there is no point that you continue with her. If you do decide that you want to still be with her, then what I can suggest is not to allow her access to your possessions (eg. finances) so easily until you feel more at ease and these problems gradually stop replaying in your head.</p>
              <p>I hope none of my words are offensive in anyway because I do not have such intentions and I apologise if you do feel offended. Nevertheless, good luck!</p>
              <p>On another note, I think it was quite rude of you to read through her MSN logs. It's an invasion of privacy and sometimes you'll never know if you come across something you wish you'd never seen =)</p>

              <p><br>Spade, I like her because she is not fussy about things. She can continue using a worn and torn bag until i decide to buy one for her. She can also endure eating cheap stuffs and does not keep asking u to bring her go restaurants etc. We can joke around just like 2 jesters playing around.  </p>

              <p>I've stopped asking her stuffs and think lesser for the past 1 week and things seems better now.</p>
              <p>However, I need to clear some issues before I go.</p>
              <p>My gf also told me that she nearly got into relationships with a couple of married men she knew from the net after she was being sacked from that company. She told me that she was really really sad that time and she needed someone to care about her. Those guys kept on telling her that they have problems in the marriage so that is why they are there in some online dating sites. But my gf says that she had no intention to break off people's family, just that all the guys that care about her during then was all married. Those men also backed out in the end themselves. She decided not to get together with any of them after hearing advices from her friends and family. She told me that she knew she was really selfish and I asked her whether will she be sad if her future husband were to find another women outside. She told me that she will be very "sad" if her husband really does that and she will not have such thinking in the future. I do not know whether she got any moral issues or she is really sad that time thus causing her to think like that? Thanks.</p>

              <p>Has it ever occurred to u that u seem to be so lacking in security that u are doubting and wondering as to your so-called friend's intentions.</p>
              <p>Frankly, even if u were to marry her -  it won't go away. I would if i cannot cope with all these shitty thoughts. i wont blame her and i make a gracious exit and correct and unlearn my silly ways.</p>
              <p>I m not asking u to decide  - this is u and all i m asking is that u look at yourself and understand yourself.</p>
              <p>I always mention in my threads to so many here  and that is that beggarly love has nothing to offer, nothing to share - all the giving is only to get back or hoping to get back.</p>
              <p>The reason why so many relationships derail or become a cumbersome trip - is cos two persons lacking in self- love, et to know each other and confuse needs n expectations as love and sell themselves, delude themselves.</p>
              <p>If love causes misery to another - know this lah - it is not love but sth else masquerading as love.</p>
              <p>Jerry, if u are miserable - its unfair to make another also!</p>
