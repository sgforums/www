            <div class='col-md body'>Divorce will destroy the family unit. But do not blame urself for that coz the reason for this unfortunate incident is the wrongdoings of the husband. So the wife shouldnt feel bad for filing for a divorce n seeking maintenance. Furthermore, things can be done to mend the family (w/o the man-of-the-house of course) ties, assuming the wife gets the custody of the kids etc.. though great effort n time is required. However, such betrayal from a spouse should nv be condoned..</div>

And the betrayal is time after time... Do you think she should divorce?</div></blockquote>i think behind every sad story, which is divorce in this case, there must be a reason. Though as a guy, dun say that i am being MCP or siding with the husband. Firstly, what is the root of the prob? This can only be solve if the husband and wife sit down and talk. Maybe the wife had changed so much that she has become those "market aunties"- sorry, no offence. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>maybe they dont understand each other, and only hanging onto marriage because of children. There are lots of reasons, which non of us can understand unless the couple talk it out.<br><br>OF COURSE its wrong of the husband to go out and play, and even worse, supporting a mistress! In order for things to work out, first, ask the wife to hire a PI to take pictures of the affair. DO NOT let the husband know she has the evidence when they are trashing out. ONLY, i said ONLY show it to the lawyer when they are filing for divorce. As you know, guys like us, can sometimes bluff our way thru if we know you have evidence. We will try and make your heart soft, then........<br><br>Ask the wife to get a life, know the root of prob, and take evidence at the same time!@@  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
