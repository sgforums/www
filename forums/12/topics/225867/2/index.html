Altho i've been into relationship, it was extremely shallow, cuz we never met at all wen we went steady, we didn't even get to hold hands for god sake! We only exchange a few romantic words, that's all. Infact those words aren't romantic at all, you can easily say it to anyone including the president. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> So i dont have any experience at all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  I really wan a GF badly!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  I really envy those guys who are handsome. Cuz with their looks, going after a girl is alot simpler, and if their attitude is superb, their chancees of going after a cute girl successfully is almost close to a 100%. Whereas plain guys such as us, who have no looks, no skills, no money, and when we slug our guts out to go after a cute girl we liked, i think the chances of being successful is less than 35%....WHY IS IT SO UNFAIR!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
