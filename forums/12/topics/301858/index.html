            <div class='col-md body'>Ever thought of castrating her father? No? Ah well... all I'll say is methinks if you're really considering marrying her she has to be the most important thing in the world to you... are you more concerned about her wellbeing or your studies? I'm sure there'll be a way to sort it out such that you can still get the work done it'll just require perhaps a bit of extra effort and work on your part as well as hers. If it's a gamble between a chance of getting a lesser grade or a chance of her getting hurt which are you more willing to chance?<br><br>No right or wrong answer just something to think about  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Even staying at your house is not a long-term solution. Another way is to have her endure a bit while you complete your studies, or you could both go and apply for a flat first. This application could make her feel a bit better and give her some hope... The process of application could take quite long, and it would most likely be after your graduation. However, it would be good to calculate your finances, ie, your expected salary, her expected salary, and the expected monthly expenditure to see if you can afford it.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This topic was posted by TS late last night at 11.40pm and so far until now at this hour only garnered twenty-one responds (including mine) from the forumners. Now, I wonder why TS isn't responding to the forumners query yet or is he waiting for more responds to see how hot his topic will get? Frankly if TS is really concern he should be replying pretty soon to the questions posted by some forumners here (since he is on a part time job basis I am sure he HAS time to answer our questions right?) So, in this case I am wondering if this is a genuine situation or a makeup one just to get attention.<br><br>In any case let's not jump the gun by asking TS's gf to get a restraining order on her father or do anything that is overly drastic yet.<br><br>Now, TS said he is 24 years old already is the gf also the same age or over 21? If yes then why can't she move out on her own and rent a place of her own. At 24 or say even at 21 she should be working already. Renting a room shouldn't be a problem if she is working. Ok, assuming she is working as well as part time and don't earn much can she not share a room with a female friend first? I am sure at their age they would have friends, right?<br><br>Ok, let's assume they don't have that many friends but should have relatives right? And even if TS's gf is not close to the 'perverted' father's side relatives how about the mother's? Don't tell me she don't have a single soul to help her out on her plight.<br><br>Ok, assuming TS and the gf has exhausted all possibilities, worse come to worse, TS shift into her house to stay with her since TS's mother don't like her but given her situation I'm sure TS's mother will be quite obliging in helping a woman in real distress because she is living in a lion's den where the 'perverted' father might you know....her. No matter how another woman dislike another when come to this kind of situation I'm very very sure they will lend a helping hand.<br><br>So, unless TS start replying to our queries I don't think so we all should jump the gun and point fingers at the gf's 'perverted' father. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
