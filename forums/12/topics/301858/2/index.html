            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FocusPoint:</div><div class="quote_body">This topic was posted by TS late last night at 11.40pm and so far until now at this hour only garnered twenty-one responds (including mine) from the forumners. Now, I wonder why TS isn't responding to the forumners query yet or is he waiting for more responds to see how hot his topic will get? Frankly if TS is really concern he should be replying pretty soon to the questions posted by some forumners here (since he is on a part time job basis I am sure he HAS time to answer our questions right?) So, in this case I am wondering if this is a genuine situation or a makeup one just to get attention.<br><br>In any case let's not jump the gun by asking TS's gf to get a restraining order on her father or do anything that is overly drastic yet.<br><br>Now, TS said he is 24 years old already is the gf also the same age or over 21? If yes then why can't she move out on her own and rent a place of her own. At 24 or say even at 21 she should be working already. Renting a room shouldn't be a problem if she is working. Ok, assuming she is working as well as part time and don't earn much can she not share a room with a female friend first? I am sure at their age they would have friends, right?<br><br>Ok, let's assume they don't have that many friends but should have relatives right? And even if TS's gf is not close to the 'perverted' father's side relatives how about the mother's? Don't tell me she don't have a single soul to help her out on her plight.<br><br>Ok, assuming TS and the gf has exhausted all possibilities, worse come to worse, TS shift into her house to stay with her since TS's mother don't like her but given her situation I'm sure TS's mother will be quite obliging in helping a woman in real distress because she is living in a lion's den where the 'perverted' father might you know....her. No matter how another woman dislike another when come to this kind of situation I'm very very sure they will lend a helping hand.<br><br>So, unless TS start replying to our queries I don't think so we all should jump the gun and point fingers at the gf's 'perverted' father. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>Good rationalisation!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Cases often go unreported at the time because of the emotional effects of the abuse, so please, don't bullshit on that. stereotypes like that are one of the many things that make people scared to report abuse. the way you guys go on about the chinese how many people do you think would want to fall into a category you associate with them?<br><br>BTW, I was unable to get specific figures for sg, but like I said it is a consistent trend across developed nations globally, and your own government figures state that 54% of reported abusers were biological parents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dun worry, report to the police and den move your gf out of the flat. i agree with the responses before mine, rent a place or ask her to move into her relative's house. i think moving into a relative's house would be better since there would be more people to look after her and she would have a higher sense of security.<br>wow, didnt know that the stats were so scary... thanks for informing us! ^.^</div>
