Ever.<br><br>I've seen other guy friends sulk, cry and feign terminal illness to keep their girlfriend's past loves in the past.<br><br>While men are not particularly sensible or mature as a collective herd, I was puzzled by these extreme reactions.<br><br>Can't we leave the past in the past? Is it residual childishness, innate irrationality, insecurity, or just plain cluelessness that makes us act in this way?<br><br>The concept, I'm told, swings both ways, but I find that girls tend to be more rational when it comes to ex-es.<br><br>One of my friends who is in his early 30s says the concept of 'sloppy seconds' is a significant cause of angst for men. 'We don't like to be reminded that some other guy has been with our girl before us.'<br><br>A female friend in her early 30s says that usually a lot depends on how the previous relationships ended. 'If they broke up badly, it's unlikely that any old flames are left to be rekindled. But if it was due to circumstances beyond their control, then it's harder to say.'<br><br>She says she isn't as wary of old flames as she is of new ones.<br><br>'The fact that it's over already shows that there was some reason why it didn't work out and there's that level of reassurance there.<br><br>'But if they meet someone new, then the temptation is that much greater.'<br><br>This sounds sensible, which is probably why we men don't get it.<br><br>A friend, also in his early 30s, agrees that it isn't just irrational, testosterone-driven behaviour that drives men to despair when their girlfriends want to meet an ex 'just to catch up'.<br><br>'As guys, we know, or at least think we know, how other guys think and behave.<br><br>'That means we're instantly suspicious of the motives of these ex-boyfriends who just want to 'meet up and chat' with our girlfriends.'<br><br>That sounds a bit paranoid. But then again, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you.<br><br>But my friend also believes that, as a guy, it pays to be less of a control freak in any relationship. 'It never puts someone in a good light to appear insecure and possessive. It's better to let her do what she wants to do.<br><br>'If they want to do something and it makes them happy, why should we stop them? If someone is going to try anything funny, it could happen anytime, anywhere.'<br><br>Some of my male friends also agree that an individual's level of self-confidence, security and the strength of each relationship are all important factors in determining one's comfort level in such situations.<br><br>Personally, I think that if two people believe in each other, then things that have come before and things that are still to come will give way to what they have right now.<br><br>People nowadays have enough to grapple with on a day-to-day basis without having to fend off the ghosts of relationships from years gone by.<br><br>And besides, planning for a future together is almost always more fun than fretting about ancient history.<br><br></div>
