It's your in-laws, not your sister's right?<br><br>Why so eat-finish-rice-nothing-to-do?<br><br>If your sister don't get to see them at all, just ignore. It's not her in-laws anyway. Say that the invitation was from a computer-generated list or something. It shouldn't matter to your sister's wedding. It's her day and she can afford one or 2 people less.</div>

I found the ringleader to be an uncle who years ago disappeared overseas with his wife. And when they are back, cause the wife died, he demands so much from my father, to build him a house, and etc.<br><br>At least I expect him when I am getting married to ask how he can help, etc. Instead he plays this type of immature games.

My mom's side relatives came early to help out with everything.<br><br>I just don't get it. These people supposed to be my elders, are acting like young kids with brains as small as peas. My dad kept telling me to forgive and forget. From then on, I clearly opened my eyes, and know what really is kinship.

            <div class='col-md body'>the last poster is absolutely right, don't give a rat's ass to your petty in-laws, if your wife take their side, then leave her at home too. i'm lucky not to have such relatives, we just give and take...what goes around comes around. can't understand what's the real deal is about? so they are not referred by traditional salutations, fact is that they got the invitation. don't bother letting your sis know, why upset her? fancy calling others rude when there's intention to boycott over trival matters..</div>
