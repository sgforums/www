It is this kinda attitude that some guys take advantage of. Since you are not complaining and remains in silence, they will just think it is alright to do as they want to you, treat you badly, etc. It is time to stand up for your right. You are a human being as well, and everyone deserves to be treated better.<br><br>i.c.y</div></blockquote>love if blind i suppose.. sighh.. he's taking me for granted for sure..</div>
