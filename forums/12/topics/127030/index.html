I'm new to SGForums.com..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>I have some problems to share and would like to hear comments from all of you.. I'm going insane because of this.. Can't concentrate on anything..<br><br>I'm 20 this year.. I met up with my ex boyfriend (whom i was together with 5 years ago) about 3 months ago.. All along, the feelings were still there.. After the gathering with him that night, while chatting in MSN on the same night, he asked me what am i thinking about now.. So i just told him the truth that i was thinking about our past.. After a long conversation, he told me "We are possible?".. He added a question mark though.. And i agreed..<br><br>However, he wished to keep it a secret and it will just be a TRIAL.. He did told one of our friends and one of his cousin (whom i know too).. Everything began off so sweet.. Guess this is what every relationship goes through.. Things began to change.. He became very cold towards me.. He says hurting things like.. "Actually i don't quite like using the phone." "I am not free to meet up for dinner and so on." Well, we did have a big talk about this.. All that he said made me speechless.. He said "In the first place, i told you i am a bad guy and i am someone selfish. You said you can take it." "Anyway, we have never really started." Blah blah blah.. I took everything he said, and i had been holding on to this relationship just because i love him..<br><br>2 months had passed.. It's getting worse.. No phone calls no messages from him.. Maybe 1 in a day? Or when he wants me to go over and find him? Sighh.. He is going to NS soon.. And he said he wants to know more friends and girls.. It really hurts me though.. Now that  more and more people are aware of our relationship, they adviced me to give up and move on.. I had always been taking him as who he is.. As i believe, if you love someone, you should accept him for who he is..<br><br>Sometimes i do feel like giving up.. I feel tired.. But i can't bear to.. I can't concentrate on anything now.. My mind's full of him and only him.. I am at a lost.. I don't know what i should do..<br><br>People here in SGForums.com, please give me a helping hand.. Tell me what should i do.. Questions are welcomed to make things clearer.. Thanks a million..<br><br>Best Wishes,<br>PrincessR</div>

I mean this guy doesn't sounds serious about you... However... choose the path you want to undertake and don't complain about that ok? I guess that's the best way out... Whether you choose to wait and hold on for him or move on now is up to you to decide...So long as you don't regret it that will do  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
