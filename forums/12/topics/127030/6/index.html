            <div class='col-md body'>Hi PrincessR and Mek, not sure if my advice is good enough, just give my best.<br><br>The role for a guy in a relationship is to have a good and reliable shoulder which can carry out the responsibility and shoulder the burden as a relationship (and future family) provider. He should have a shoulder that is good enough for the girl to rely and rest on.<br><br>The role for a girl in a relationship is to have a good sight and spot those good and reliable shoulders where she can rest upon and carry on her role as a relationship (and future family) maker. She should have the sight to watch for pitfalls in a relationship or problems.<br><br>You see, people are social being, meaning, they usually fear loneliness. However, when you embrace loneliness as a friend, it is nothing to be too fearful of.<br><br>If love is blind, I pray that light will shine to show you the direction and the way. Be brave, when you thought that you are alone to face all those sorrow or hurt, the light will show you your true friends whom you can rely on in times of trouble.<br><br>All the best.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

Round without any ends.<br><br>History in LOVE will REPEAT, if you accept the same circumstances thrown to you. In very simple terms: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>if you always love the way you do, you will always get the love you get.</strong></span> (First Law of Love states: we are the ONES who chooses our partners, not the other way around).<br><br>This relationship have already ended ages ago - what you are doing is just delaying the inevitable. (One good friend thought I was too chim with this three words, so I will explain) Simply put, you are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>just delaying the ultimately outcome of your separation.</strong></span> Think about the bonds between you and your man as afflicted and incurable - There is NO way you two could get together in a decent relationship and go on - it has already decayed beyond proportion. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>You are deluding and feeding your mind with certain facts that fuel your decisions: you thought and feel that you can change him OR he will change eventually and you want to be involved when that happen.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The sad truth is that is wouldn't happen and when it happens, you wouldn't be in the picture.<br><br>Karmic relationship.<br><br>Second Law of Love states: <strong>No one but ourselves could make us stay in a bad relationship. </strong><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">1) he is afraid of commitment and responsibility..<br>2) he is realli enjoying the "single" status..<br>3) the most important thing is being happy.. </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> These are the fundemental qualities of a having a negative relationship. There are NO way anyone gonna have a fulfillfing relationship with such mindsets. No way. Love is such that you have to SACRIFICE your immaturity to welcome wisdom. Think about this: if he is really enjoying single status, why on earth would he still be accepting a woman into his life AND enters into a relationship with her? (Regardless of how he wants the relationship to be like... underground, ONS, and so on - it is technically STILL a relationship).<br><br>Blatantly obvious that he wants to be in the best of both worlds. To enjoy the fruits of what a relationship could offer without giving anything else in return.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>The above words like these come out so frequent, even people I know, that I smile the minute I hear their views: <strong>The mindsets of people who cannot commit.</strong> Simple as that. Happiness is but a fleeting emotion; only true love is everlasting.<br><br>And you want to change a man? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Scroll through all past AA posts - all my 4 years here... NONE... NONE OF THE WOMAN WHO HAVE POSTED HERE HAVE <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SUCCESSFULLY </strong></span>CHANGED THEIR 'BAD MAN' (Huai nan ren or HNR for short). We have people marrying a HNR, thinking that a marriage would change them.... never happened.<br><br>The only changes are transitory and REAL changes <strong>only </strong>happen when the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">HNR themselves enlighten from within</span>. (My dad is a real example. He never really change... My mum change to suit him - Buddhism taught her alot of things)<br><br>Is love, by itself as a solo component, justifiable to carry on your relationship? You want to disregard suitability as well? Future? Happiness? (You will definitely say there are many happy times, but when your tears soak more than you smile, this techinically doesn't count). Truth is not you cannot move... <strong>it's you DON'T WANT to move</strong>. Nobody will push you to leave your past and it wouldn't go away if you kept habouring at it. The web of your karmic relationship is far too formidable to go away naturally unless you exercise conscious effort to walk away from it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
