Indeed He is very sad cos all those babies are creations of God n belong to Him, thus nobody has the right to kill it. I do hope u think over carefully n please be responsible for your gf's emotion ok.<br><br>As we belong to the body of Christ, i encourage u to read your bible daily n understand the W.O.G. deeper n more clearly.<br><br>Do not anyhow take things easy ok.  i really feel sad for this beautiful baby. May this beautiful baby be in peace with God.</div></blockquote>I am not being anti christians or whatever so, but put yourself into the girl's shoes. You are only 17, going to start poly soon, and you found out that you are preg. You know that if your parents knew it, they will kill you. You cant keep the baby, cos you know that you dun have the means to support the baby, as you cant tell your parents, you are starting poly, your bf is going to start poly too, or going to NS. What will you do? Will you still teach about when the church teaches you? How about you go back to the church and ask them to support the child when itÂ’s born?<br><br>If you said why dun they ask the church for help? The church will surely told their parents, and after their parents scold them, what you think they will do? Ask them to get marry? You may said ya, that shall be the way. But what if they devoiced after a few years, what is going to happen to the child?<br><br>They are not trying to be irresponsible, but how are they going to support the child? Sometimes you have to think, by bringing the baby to earth, you might be destroying his whole life instead? When he/she grow up, what will he/she think? Why must my parents bring me to earth and suffer, when they are unable to support themselves?<br><br>And do you think that both of them will not be sad? ItÂ’s their flesh n blood, esp the mother.<br><br>I dun encourage pre-martial sex, cos the consequence after the act will be great. But I always tell my friends, or even younger friends, if you really want to have pre-martial sex, please use protection. Although it is not 100% foolproof as not having sex, its at least 99.98% safe. And the 0.02% who got preg after using condoms are those who dunno how to put in on when using, causing the condom to tear when scratch by their fingernails, thus it leak.<br><br>This is my point of view, there is no right or wrong.<br></div>

The pill not just prevent preg but protects the person from cancer and heart trouble and so on. That is because sex hormones are very bad for the human body but good for procreation, so evolution has allowed it. Hey, you only live once, your body tells you. Male hormone testosterone is also just as bad but no man in his right mond will want to get rid of ot because sex drive also goes down with it.<br><br>So 2 things, get the pill (there is also the morning after pill in case of emergency) and don't be too hard on people who wants to enjoy life just because you are a virgin.</div>

Coincidentally, he made me researched on it. Like i said i'm his part-time gynae. Hey don't get me wrong i don't have anything against people having sex as and when they like. Just don't make me pull out the "I told you so" card when shit happens. Being a virgin don't make me someone less superior. Theres still the knowledge of knowing what you're getting into before you actually do it.<br><br>As mentioned before, wanna fuxx around, then bear the consequences "lor".</div>

Fyi, I was made pregnant before marriage n in the midst of divorce proceeding. Was under alot of stress that i almost wanted to take my life n this unborn baby's life too. Dunno how i managed to overcome n keep this innocent baby plus went for counselling sessions till i got my life back in proper way. I almost went mad bursting with stress on top of the unwanted pregnancy n divorce proceedings. so ask yourself if the threadstarter case or mine is worse. arriage then u see whether u can think  like that or not. </div></blockquote></div>
