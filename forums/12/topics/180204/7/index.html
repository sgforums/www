            <div class='col-md body'>To the threadstarter,<br><br>since u n yr gf are christians, n u alr aborted this baby... i wonder how come ur church never teach u that abortion is MURDER. do u know that there is a book, called "Heaven is so Real.". in this book the author did reveal the warning somewhere in the book n the author was very stunned to see so many naked babies lying to each other in this room n asked God, "what is this", and He said those babies belonged to the mothers who aborted them on earth, As he spoke, the author sensed that He is very angry with those mothers who aborted. Indeed He is very sad cos all those babies are creations of God n belong to Him, thus nobody has the right to kill it. I do hope u think over carefully n please be responsible for your gf's emotion ok.<br><br>As we belong to the body of Christ, i encourage u to read your bible daily n understand the W.O.G. deeper n more clearly.<br><br>Do not anyhow take things easy ok.  i really feel sad for this beautiful baby.

No need for all the suffering and the risk that the baby does not convert. You willing to take the risk that the baby is born and then not convert and spend eternity in hell? So what is your problem?
