But guess not everybody is inclined to think about the long run effects. Who will care to think into the future? Solving the problem is the problem now. Future problems then solve them in the future.

Some women, thinking that abortion will solve problems, instead sink into depression. You should go and read the newspapers, or just go any couselling centre. There are classified cases over there.<br><br>It's your personal view on life. I think many people also had the same feeling. It's only after some experience that you will learn to enjoy life, learn to appreciate life. Just because you don't have one doesn't mean you should deprive another one of doing the same.<br><br>With or without abortion, she will still miss poly education for a period of time. The calendar has changed. With abortion, how can you be sure that she won't sink into a depression? Depression can be long. For all you know, she took 3 years to recover, totally missing poly education. Without abortion and assuming she will carry it to full term, she will start her education around October. From what I know, some polys do conduct October exercises, for people who missed the JAE or could not get into the poly. </div></blockquote>I have a partial agreement with this. I'm not against you for the abortion. But if you think and see it deem fit, hope you've properly talked and addressed the issue to your gf too. And that she's really ok and comfortable with it as a final choice. It's TRUE that the after maths of trauma is often FAR GREATER for a woman than us man. Pls watch her closely and take good care of her if abortion really happens...</div>
