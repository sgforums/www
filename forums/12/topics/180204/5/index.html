Sooner or later, they're going to find out about the pregnancy.<br><br>You can't hide things like this forever. Sooner or later they're going to ask about why she seems rather wane and listless in the days after the abortion procedure. Sooner or later, they're going to ask her "Hey, you seem troubled... what's on your mind?" and she may end up blurting out to them the full story after much persuasion. They may also come across the medical bills and Medisave statements in the mail. You're just going to delay the inevitable if you don't tell them now.<br><br>They may get angry now, but I imagine that they'll get much, much angrier later on if they find out (which is very likely) that she got pregnant and aborted their grandchild without consulting them. Bear that in mind: it's not only your child which you're thinking of aborting; it's their grandchild as well.<br><br>I know it's a tough choice. Be a man and face up to your responsibilities. . If it means that you have to face up to your parents and hers, then you're going to have to be responsible enough to do that. If she has to skip poly for several months, then she has to carry out that responsibility.<br><br>The two of you made the choice to commit 'that act' a few months ago. I'm not judging you based on your committing of that act. All I'm saying is that the least you can do now is to accept the responsibility of your actions by informing both your parents.<br><br>Forgive me for being so brutally direct, but that's the whole truth.<br><br>Because I can tell you for sure - abortion is not just about going to the doctor for a prescription and going to the pharmacy counter for the medications. There are a lot of other factors - both physical and psychological. It's not a decision to be taken lightly... which is why I still say you have to consult both sets of parents. If it means not going through the abortion, then so be it.</div>

Not trying to be difficult here. Just that this sentence don't make sense. I think majority of us would have agreed that a foetus is a life, and God knows if she has more than one. By aborting, you may be killing more than one. Just consider.<br><br>How can you be so sure that your gf is not having twins or triplets or more than that? How many lives if you want to kill if it is true? While I admit the rarity, you never know. You are 18 already, and I believe you have studied probability. Go calculate it. No matter how rare, it will still happen. It's only whether you want to take the gamble or not.<br><br>Again, seek adult advice, whether or not they are your parents. At least they would be able to analyze this whole situation with you in details, and offer some suggestions. If you insist on abortion after hearing them out, then go ahead. At least you have heard them explain.<br><br>Remember one thing though: Humans never regret until they have done something. You may not regret killing your own child/children now, but a few more years/decades down the road, you will see why.</div>

Some women, thinking that abortion will solve problems, instead sink into depression. You should go and read the newspapers, or just go any couselling centre. There are classified cases over there.<br><br>It's your personal view on life. I think many people also had the same feeling. It's only after some experience that you will learn to enjoy life, learn to appreciate life. Just because you don't have one doesn't mean you should deprive another one of doing the same.<br><br>With or without abortion, she will still miss poly education for a period of time. The calendar has changed. With abortion, how can you be sure that she won't sink into a depression? Depression can be long. For all you know, she took 3 years to recover, totally missing poly education. Without abortion and assuming she will carry it to full term, she will start her education around October. From what I know, some polys do conduct October exercises, for people who missed the JAE or could not get into the poly.</div>

For me, it is actually an easy way out, but it might bring up even more problems in the long run. So instead of running away, face the problem bravely and solve it for once and for all.</div>
