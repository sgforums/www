You don't even have money to do the abortion, and you want to raise the kid? Pay for the education? No, you don't want that. So I recommend just borrow some money somewhere and do the abortion. There has to be someone with some money for you. Or just borrow from your parents, say you need $300 to get some stuff. You and your gf add up there will be $600.</div></blockquote>he and gf add up become $600.. wah so easy liao..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> can abort ar! then no problems? how bout the baby? the pain and suffering you will cause to it? the regret and remorse and impact it will have on you next time forever? you think can just use a few hundred dollars and heck care about a living thing? if its me, i will give the baby up for adoption, at least my conscience is better.. im not totally shedding responsibility<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it is always the psychological effects, if you abort, you feel the guilt, if you give it up for abortion, you will also feel the guilt. the worse thing that can happen is if the child wants to know its biological parent, and then things dont turn out the way you want.. blame yourself for causing it to happen in the first place. this is your problem, people here have laid out solutions, it is time for you to make the decisions.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pls...both of you might already be physically mature to have sex and create babies, but it is obvious that both of you are not emotionally mature to deal with the consequences. So now is the time to get some adult assistance in this case, don't make decision rashly, which will destroy both of your future. Abortion is not an easy way out, it carries with it a long-term effect.<br><br>So even if her parents are psycho, you still have to face the music and tell them...don't think they won't find out just because she goes and abort...it is not as easy as that, especially if complications arise.<br><br>Let some adults who are more capable of dealing with this situation know about it as soon as possible.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At the end of it all, it's your decision and hers to make. The forumites have included, I believe, almost every single area of coverage to back you up on your decision. However, I think you do have to bear in mind that while it is easy to see things in the interim, it is difficult to see things 5, 6 yrs from now. What will things be like then? How will your decision now affect your lives? I strongly believe this is a question you and her have to ask yourselves, which I fear is beyond your age and maturity, no disrespect intended. That is why I say take the rest of the forumites adivce, go to the professionals, they are schemes and options avaliable or even facts which you are unaware of. Do we need to go to this extend? Of course, a life is at stake? Even if it is a lump of cells as some sceptics claim, it is still cells upon which life forms.</div>

So now is the time to get some adult assistance in this case, don't make decision rashly, which will destroy both of your future. Abortion is not an easy way out, it carries with it a long-term effect.<br><br>So even if her parents are psycho, you still have to face the music and tell them...don't think they won't find out just because she goes and abort...it is not as easy as that, especially if complications arise.<br><br>Let some adults who are more capable of dealing with this situation know about it as soon as possible. </div></blockquote>You tell your parents, people forever will know. if you keep quiet and abort the baby, no one will know except u 2. Besides you can't even afford the money then what makes you think that you can raise a kid. Abort lah save everybody's time..Just a kid right  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
