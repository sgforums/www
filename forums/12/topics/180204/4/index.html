            <div class='col-md body'>unless u can be financially stable to support her and the child else if she gives birth, she'd have to send ur child for adoption or other wise abort it. both ways are not good. so try not to think negative thoughts in abortion, be open minded. it's better to let the situation go now then trying to salvage it. keeping the child is only gonna make things worse in future given ur young age. u've fallen into this trouble, dun let it get worse than it already is.<br>another alternate way is to consult a close uncle or aunt. make him or her understand then together u break the news to ur parents with the support of ur relatives.<br>regarding the $$, u just gonna dare urself to ask around!</div>

Please get some adult assistance, don't take everything into your own hands. This involves consequences that will affect three lives.<br><br>Even if her parents will go crazy, they deserve to know. It is your responsibility to tell them and face the music. Dare to do, dare to face the consequences, as the saying goes. Once she aborts, she will be weak for days and if there are complications, her parents will find out for sure, and both of you will be in deeper shIt than this.</div>
