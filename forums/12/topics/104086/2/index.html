From facing God, to seeing (luckily not literally) 2 friends die, to reading about why being nice to girls will not net them, etc. I even started to score A's for my exams, and almost got into the top 15% (If not for my stupid elective that brought me down.)<br><br>Its really quite scary, if i compare myself Now, and Then. Sometimes i forget that i'm 20, and feel more like 27 or something.

Sometimes she leans on my shoulder, in which i do nothing because i have no feelings for her, also i don't know what to do.<br><br>And about a month ago, she started hugging both her hands on my left hand, which felt pleasantly good.
