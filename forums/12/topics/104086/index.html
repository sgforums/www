            <div class='col-md body'>I read in one of the earlier posts, a few weeks back, a quote by Yunhaier i believe.<br><br><strong>Girls will always think about the boys they could have had. Guys will always think about the girls that they never had.</strong><br><br>Because this is going to be a bit long, let me divide it into parts. Hope you all can help somewhat...<br><br>Part 1<br><br>Let me relate this to my situation, but first let me bring you to 2 years ago.<br><br>I thought I liked this girl, and cause I misinterpreted her actions, told her about it. It was a very bad call, and from that moment on we do talk, but not much anymore. But this is not the gist of it.<br><br>In less than a week, I also fell for another girl. Deep down I knew it was probably rebound or something like that, but I still did all the nice things I did, tried to be sweet and everything to her. Somehow she found out about it(Not a surprise). She called me at night, and confirmed that I like her by asking me straight.<br><br>We stay close together, and usually take the bus back. The day after the call, we took the bus back as usual, but at the stop when we usually stop, I asked her if sheÂ’s getting off, but she said sheÂ’s going shopping with the other girl that I like(they were sitting together).<br><br>Throughout the bus ride I think they were talking about me, and saying stuff like Â“Guys are like thatÂ” etc.<br><br>And when I alighted from the bus, I was deeply hurt. I knew she didnÂ’t like me, but she donÂ’t have to be like that right?<br><br>I didnÂ’t talk to the 2 girls for a whole semester, until I made peace with them at the beginning of the next. It was God that gave me the strength, I didnÂ’t want to lose such good friends too.<br><br>And in the 2 years that ensued, i must admit i have changed a lot. From facing God, to seeing (luckily not literally) 2 friends die, to reading about why being nice to girls will not net them, etc. I even started to score A's for my exams, and almost got into the top 15% (If not for my stupid elective that brought me down.)<br><br>Its really quite scary, if i compare myself Now, and Then. Sometimes i forget that i'm 20, and feel more like 27 or something. Must be this attachment job adding on to my years.<br><br>Here's the problem, for a few months now, this girl has been getting closer to me. Sometimes she leans on my shoulder, in which i do nothing because i have no feelings for her, also i don't know what to do.<br><br>And about a month ago, she started hugging both her hands on my left hand, which felt pleasantly good. When my other friends asked why she did it, she said something like Aaron was looking bored, i forgot.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Part 2<br><br>Now about 3 weeks ago, i was smsing her when somehow the topic related to how much she means to me.

Yea, dead. Its like nothing matters anymore. Live or die, don't care. I don't smile as much, and i keep telling others, there's no happiness in my life. I'm not sad either, sort of like neutral.<br><br>And about a week back, she smsed me a message like this "Do you think things will work out if we try?" And i smsed back with some rubbish answer like "All things will work out, somehow".<br><br>2 days later i smsed her the same question, and she quoted me back. Aargh.

"Is his spectacles nice?" (This is because i asked her out a month back to help me choose one.) And the guy replied something, but i forgot.

I don't even know how much she likes me.<br><br>And, i think she eventually started liking me because of the quote, and becaues i'm much more confident now, and surpassing her in grades as well.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well yeah that;s true. Its coz of the human unlimited desire thing (basic ecomic theory)  i supposed i have had many relationship possibilies in the past, and i let them all go. So there. i am relevant to the topic.<br><br>my turn. When i was in british school, when i recall, i had a girl who had a crush on me, but at the time i was not force/girl sensitive yet. So i treated her like dirt, hehe, bullied her and her brother. but overall she still did like me, coz after years of me being a 8th grader jerk/bully she still kept asking me along to her birthday party disco things.. lol. (btw sidetrack; this is further proof treating girls confidently badly gets u more girls)<br><br>But at the time i was young and brash. And now i am not there anymore, she has prolly gone off since the jakarta riots. And the flame has definitely died out..hehe maybe if she saw me NOW when i am slimmer and have biceps along with veiny arms. Well i dunno.<br><br>Another girl seemed to have liked me. My friends cousin i met at a xmas party. She kept talking to me and giving eye contact, i made her laugh and all that stuff. my cousin told me she likes me, but at the time, again, i was brash and foolish i didn't even bother taking the initiative. Just left without asking her number after the party.<br><br>Another girl also had a crush on me after our school play, when i was the lead and handsomely dressed as a kind of under-taker/agent smith dude. Anywayz, the play SUCKED, but i did well in it and looked good. Afterwards, my friend gave me a flower and said it was her friend who gave it (the friend apparently had a crush). I just smiled and moved on.<br><br>Now the thing is to learn from experience, while at the same time not to be so brash as to think ur the MOST STUNNING ATTRACTIVE MAN ON THE EARTH, otherwise u will be dissapointed when u don't attract anyone. So u gotta take initiative with girls and at the same time not EXPECT anything concrete.<br><br>Another girl i met at a friends' gathering sleepover thing. I believed she took to me instantly coz she kept talking to me, and asking about how many relationships i had, and kept what's the word.. u locals say it.. "disturbing me" or "Jee Siaow" me. Kept snatching my blanket and throwing things at me for no apparent reason. Her other friends said she had a crush on me. Again i just shut up and smiled, but on THIS occasion. I took initiative, kept in contact with her, added her to friendster. We'll see how we go, though i haven't seen her for half a year since that party. Occasionally i'll get the good luck for exams sms, or the testimonial just saying hi. Likewise i do that to her. But otherwise no plans. THe difficulty now is trying to get close. But i have made the 1st move already; smsed her "miss ya, wanna hang out sometime?" well next move is up to her. I will not be a wussy puppy desperate for her attention, i will remain PROUD and TALL and waiting for HER to make the move now, i am not expecting ANYTHING.<br></div>

GET ur FUCKING spectacles off and wear contacts as if u never ever had specs. This would help.<br><br>Secondly. Change ur attitude, adopt a "YUAAARGH! im here if SHE wants" attitude rather than a "*squek* will she like me will she? will she?" attitude.<br><br>I think after exams. The losers in relationships should meet up so we can motivate and spot each other to do well in relationships, as a loser myself i would need that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow. It's a bit hard to analysis this girl from what you've said. Did she have alot of boyfriends before? Is she the type that flirts? Is she the friendly type with guys? It'll be better if you give me more information.<br><br>But I can still tell you something, from what you've written here.<br><br>From the way she asked you the question, there might be the possibility that she has some interest in you. And your answer was terrific, by the way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>She wore the same spectacles as you? Well, you should tease her by saying, "If you wanna woo me, you'll have to do better than just getting a pair of similar spectacles!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> "  You're being funny, cocky, and interesting to her if you say it. What could be better than that!<br><br>Heard of the term, "ri you suo si, ye you suo meng"? In English, it means that, "You dream of what you think of." Because your mind is suddenly full of her, and you can't stop thinking about her, your sub-conscious reacts by rewarding you with a dream. Ask yourself, haven't you been daydreaming about being together with her and doing all the things that couples do?<br><br>You're right about the being nice part. I'll tell you about something that I've learnt two years ago as well:<br><br><strong>1) If you treat a girl like she's gold, she will BELIEVE that she is gold.
