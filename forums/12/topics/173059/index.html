She or he may in fact helped in by not wasting your time and effort. Imagine in the worst case, the person whom you like made full use of you and ask you to buy expensive things and waste your time and effort in the end dump you like trash. How would you feel? I went through the worst case before and trust me is painfull.<br><br>So I do not think what you have said is crap but in fact highlighted somethings which each of us fear. Rejection is not always bad if you can handle in a mature way.</div>

Its like part of a tormenting emotional cycle which happens to everyone.<br><br>I have been rejected 3 times and rejected only 1 girl before. But then, I still feel guilty rejecting that girl (since im not that good looking blah blah), and I feel even more sad if I'm rejected by the girl I like.<br><br>Nice thread, I wanna see more experiences of people posting here. And no, you dont deserve a slap, more likely a +1 since its such an interesting topic. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
