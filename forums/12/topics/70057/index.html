Anything more than self sufficient is a bonus that usually doesn't get the score.<br><br>Then again, financial aspect of a relationship depends heavily on the couple individually. Some couples feels the need to spend on entertainment, shopping, etc as part of the tools used to upkeep a relationship on a <strong>very frequent regular basis</strong>, therefore couple expenses are high. The word 'self sufficient' would therefore be much higher than another couple, say both devote themselves towards volunteering causes and keeping a rather simple love. (jian dan ai).
