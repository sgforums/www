It won't save her marriage (not worth saving either if it's of what you commented) but she can and has the rights to fight for higher alimony and child support from the ex-husband.

She was grateful for her good fortune but never thought that all will come crashing down when she had her second pregnancyÂ…<br><br>Her husband, for unknown reason, went into shock and could not accept it even though the second child is mutually agreed upon initially.  On her visit to her gynae, she and her husband were informed that it could be a rare case of non-developing fetus and to be given two more weeks for further observation by then an abortion will be done, should the growth be stagnant.  Her husband went ahead to Japan for business trip on the day of clinical appointment without offering to lend any support.  She was devastated when told that there is going to be no baby after all and has to go through with the abortive day surgery.<br><br>Thereafter their marriage went downhill without her knowing why as her husband became cold and distantÂ… He distanced himself so much that she could no longer bear it and moved out of the flat with her son.  It was 1 month later that she heard from his cousin that he had committed adultery and the business trip was in fact a rendezvous with a married Japanese woman. His lover is scheduled to move to Singapore to live with him.<br><br>She accepted her husbandÂ’s change of heart and without further delay, initiated the divorce to give way to the couple.  She declined her rightful matrimonial contribution from her husband as she knows that her husband does not earn much and has to do his part for his loverÂ’s lodging.<br><br>Subsequently, he wept pitifully at every stage of the divorce proceedingsÂ…Â…requesting my friend not to proceed further. He even said that the Nihon romance is over and will not resume even if he is divorced, as he is now sobered to know that his lover who has low moral values. My friend did not bulge in her decision because while he claimed that it is over, both he and his lover are still spotted often together round the island.  When questioned, he said it was on the ground that he is just helping her, a foreigner in Singapore.<br><br>During this period, he left his company scandalized, as his peers learnt quickly of what he has committed. He progresses well in his new company, since no one knows what he has done before.<br><br>My friend and her son are the ones who are paying for his error as she struggles with her house, job and her son.  Day in, day out, she rushed from childcare center to work, work to childcare center. Back home, she has to handle their meals and household chores. She refused to burden her family with what has happened to her. She carried all these out silently and can only weep into the darkness of the night after her son has gone to bed.<br><br>After the divorce, he completely complies with my friendÂ’s wishes and didnÂ’t bother to enquire after them, even though he knew about their pitiful plight.<br><br>Her son began asking for his daddy when he turned 3. Feeling guilty and tormented, she called his ex-husband and asked if he would like to visit his son. He agreed, and the boy delightedly took to his father.<br><br>He told my friend that he is equally pitiful as he wanders at a loss during the night and have had no one for company. He works long hours to numb his sorrow and guilt.<br><br>Upon hearing that and for the sake of her son, she took her son to his company premises and asked forgiveness from her ex-husband for her impulsiveness at filing divorce. Oh boy, was he furious when he learnt of this. He verbally slashed out at her and refused to meet them for fear that his peers in his new company will come to know what he has done.  He threatened my friend and left them waiting by the road side. He only showed his face and forced them home when he saw them leaving the premises for the coffee store nearby. Surprise of surprise, he reprimanded her ruthlessly when she suggested reversing the flat ownership and reinstating their marriage.<br><br>It was later that she realized with a few facts from his family that all he said is a pack of lies and it is just a clever plot played by him. He has been staying out, sleeping at his loverÂ’s place and he is not as pitiful as he seems. He is still dock out in his best personal clothes and grooming. He has changed new phones while my friend could not afford one.  He has cleverly strategized his moves to have my friend proceed with divorce while he acted the Â“goodÂ” guy who wants to salvage the marriageÂ… once the objective is attain, he finally showed his true colours and motives.<br><br>For such a shameless cad, I see the need to have justice done and his deed exposed. He is getting scot-free and enjoying the success of his career, his woman without paying a single cent for the family he has abandoned while my friend (with her toddler) is paying a high price for his sin.<br><br>He is working in a US-based leading EMS (electronics manufacturing services) provider (located in Changi South Lane) who bought over the local firm JIT Holdings back in Aug 2000. From what I last know, he is handling a project under Hewlett Packard.<br><br>Although he has good looks and seemingly goody-two-shoes image, he is rotten to the core Â…<br><br>Hey folks out there, if you happen to know who he is, be forewarnedÂ… donÂ’t be deceived by him.  Remember still water runs deepÂ…and I hope he will have his just retributions soon.<br><br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

I'm not sure if there is any point in addressing your doubts.  But I want to openly admit that this is written at the spur of "my emotional woes" as you have concluded.  I'm not sure whether you can understand but it is definitely a lasting emotional woe to deal with.... facing the little one cos' he never fail to ask me where his daddy is whenever I visit him and the heartbroken elderly parents on why this has happened. (based on your cue, I won't elaborate more else I'll be accused again of pulling more emotional stringthreads....)<br><br>I'm family to the guilty guy. The single mum is both my friend as well as in-law.  Objectively, we can say that he is pursuing what he wants, and what is important to him since it is his life.  Furthermore he has the right to make his choice.  This is ok, provided there is no downstream impact. Unfortunately for him, there is a marriage he has committed, a son he has brought to this world.  Admission of guilt, he did but the more crucial work of putting things right again, he didn't.  I know this sound heartless... but his reputation can go to drain for all that I care.  (sorry..I know this sound biased again).<br><br>No, pls don't say sorry for voicing out aloud what has "poked your thoughts".  I can understand your skepticism.  On the contrary, I'm very much flattered and humbled by the effort you have put in to analyze this case.<br><br>In any case, sharing this story online seems like a wrong impulsive move but nevertheless I want to selfishly admit that it has help to dispel the "emotional woes" bottled inside me.<br><br>Last, I would like to point out that genuinely "troubled" people who wrote in to "Aunt Agony" usually have "rationale" and "sensibility" either absent or last in queue in their mind which is WHY the rationality of advice as well as comments are sought after.</div>
