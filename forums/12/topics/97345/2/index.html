It is good you care enough to try to work to earn your own ticket. Good luck.<br><br>As for the question whether she loves you enough. Only time will tell. Only thing I am certain, if you love her enough, you will be willing to believe in this relationship. Maybe it will fail in the end. But if you do not believe, you will never know if it works out well for the two of you.</div>

How long have you two been togather? (I din really read thru your whole story) Anyway, if you've been togather with her within a year, it's normal for her n you to have reacted in such ways, i.e. "you feel hurt to see her reacted in those ways and can't bear to leave her behind n b alone to "suffer." n so n so...you noe yourself...<br><br>I was in the same situation as you b4, but juz that i wasn't going to one of the top uni. for studies.

I fell in love with my female best friend 2mth ago before I embark for 4years of undergraduate study abroad. Over a year, both of us has grown very emotionally attached to each other. We confided with each other everything, and even petted and had sex. In fact, she admitted that it was quite impossible to live a life without me.<br><br>She accepted me as her bf for two weeks before my departure, partly because she dont want to regret in her life for making a wrong pass at me. we broke up just before i left. During that brief two weeks, she still find it awkward to even hold my hand or vice versa, but we had no problem frenching. I asked her why she find it so awkward. She says she's not sure if she loves me, but she knows that she needs me in almost every aspect of her life. She ask me to give her more time to think thru, if she actually loves me. She tells me she's very confused yet always so glad to talk and see me. She's not sure if this is love. She needed more time to think thru, as she's in the midst of her A LEVELS now. Sigh.. to me, if u realise that u finally found a person that u cant afford to spend your life without, it must be that u love her. Sometimes I wonder if it's my hot temper that always stop her from totally accepting me. She asked me to wait for her answer till next valentine's day, after A levels. I wasnt convinced as it could be a convenient mean to reject me by sending an sms after I'm gone from Singapore. I told her I will believe if she actually strip in public. She refused to strip cuz it involves her dignity. I told her I wont believe her at all. Told her to "get out of my life!". She then actually strip which I stop in time. I only wanted to see how true her words mean, not her stripping. She still sends me away at the airport although i m suppose to check in at 4am and her class starts at 8am.<br><br>When I finally call her 4days after touching down, she told me she cried for 2 successive days, and ask me to call her 10min everyday. Her actions tell me that she loves me but she's too confused to recognise it.<br><br>My heart is aching cuz the deadline (feb14) is 4mth away (freaking long). what to do?</div></blockquote>i say 1st hor... sounds like me but is not me. im really quite shiok here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's plain miserable to act against my heart, but i must do it. letting her go is the best option for her. i'm not the right person for her, given my bad temper and other negative traits. i don't have the capacity and the ability to love her in the way she deems fit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i am not very sure. but from all the comments and wat u decided to do, i think u are a rather rash and impatient person. pple dun really think well when they are in those situation. prob it is best for u to go overseas to cool it and think about ur future for now. as wat some of them had said, u may even find someone there tat u may like. after ur studies, if u really still got feelings for this ger, u could meet her up and start everything afresh. dun think tat will be too late rite?<br>hope u will learn to control ur temper and all the best in ur studies. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>ps: first time giving such advice, so pardon me if i say anything bad.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> actually....all of these are just my opinon.</div>

Agreed.. I think, its really saddening..... If I am the girl, I will just leave you without turning back. Becoz, its not worth at all.. She's your GF's FRIEND! I think, she feels insecure too.. becoz, you can do that to her friend.. you can do the same thing to her. So, you are unsure of your feelings too. THEN WHY EXPECT OTHER PPLE TO GIVE you definite answer..... when you don even have a definite answer.<br><br>Just remain single la.. and leave the girl alone. You will just go round harming pple.<br><br>YOU ARE just absolutely IMMATURE!! BRAIN DEAD! RED NECK! A SS HOLE!<br></div>
