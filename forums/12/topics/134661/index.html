I guess she said that purely outta rashness..to take it to heart bahz. How old is your gf?

What is this ?<br><br>We had a big argument over this issue, maybe the advice i gave wasn't good enough. I told her not to worry about financial thingy. At most i support u for 1 week till pay day. After tht, she told me tht maybe its better for me to find a better gf. Keep blaming herself. i duno what to do man.
