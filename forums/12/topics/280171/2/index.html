It is not posessive but it means tat sometimes one will change their character or lifestyle because of love... And the meaning of love is not necessary BGR relationship... "TEARS IN HEAVEN" does not write about BGR relationship...<br><br>What I want to advise TS is :<br>I assume that the decision to be with her comes from yr heart... since it comes from yr heart, u should follow yr heart till the end... Unless, u dont love her, then, it is best for u to break up with her...<br><br></div>
