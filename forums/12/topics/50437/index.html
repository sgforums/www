And the thing is that his/her parents wouldn't hate you - its only a disliking for him/her to be with you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>When such scenarios happens - either you let this kills you or you rise to the occasion and prove them wrong. Since its only a relationship now and yet a marriage - you have ample time to work on yourself and improve. The more people point fingers at you - the more you could stand up and slap their comments back at them. (Provided if this is a serious and real relationship and you desire to go long term with him/her. If its a fling - think no need to go that extra round.) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
