            <div class='col-md body'>i think you have just replied your own question. She asked if it's all worth it and you know that you will stick it through with her. Can i caution you that hopefully it's not out of 'pity' for her situation that you are hanging on. It's a good time perhaps for you to be so certain that you really want to be with this person (and ask yourself 'why?') and if that's the conclusion you draw up, you'll know what to do.<br><br>perhaps her parents are not negative about you. it's their expectations. It does not mean you are not good enough for their daughter. It's just that maybe they had a hard life and wish that things will be better for her (and also for themselves). If you can accept them (and not feel that they are the cause of your problems but the ones who want the best for their child),  you'll just do what you can to understand why they feel this way and how you can alleviate their concerns. it may go a longer way then just buying makan whenever you go by, but be interested in them (take it slow though). Be sincere and it may help them realise that you be the best person to take care of her.<br><br>just some thoughts....</div>

Was angry with them. later i realise they may not have received that kind of love as well. Since they haven't, they cannot give. We cannot give what we do not receive. so i forgave them since it's not what they want, they don't even know what they are doing....</div>
