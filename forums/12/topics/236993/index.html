            <div class='col-md body'>er........ u just need to control your emotion better, don't let it take control of you, the reason why i was Pes E is due to the fact that i suffer from personality disorder and impulsive behavior, i practically snap at anything that gets in my way, even my parents, even when i was in NS, i was out of control to the fact that i could eat that person alive, the one time, that i snap so crazy is when i was being teased at school so much i can't stand it anymore, i grab a chair and almost slam it at one person, the person was holding on to the leg of the chair and so frighten. and luckily one of the classmate was grabbing me from the back, otherwise i would had, make sure that person land in the hospital, and there was one teacher, so don't ever let your emotion gain control over you, or you might just say things that will hurt other people feelings. It took me years to learn how to control my feeling better, and till now, i have to remind myself not to let the old demon overcome me.How old are you? if u are under 18, i would suggest that you pay a visit to child guidance clinic, seek professional help when young. I learn from the hard ways, being through hell when i was younger, i even went to detention barrack, still that didn't change me at all, till the day, i step out to the working society and the day, i meet my ex. And the break up was the wake up call for me to learn to control my emotions better</div>

Avoids occupational activities that involve significant interpersonal contact, because of fears of criticism, disapproval, or rejection.<br>2.      Is unwilling to get involved with people unless certain of being liked.<br>3.      Shows restraint within intimate relationships because of the fear of being shamed or ridiculed.<br>4.      Is preoccupied with being criticized or rejected in social situations.<br>5.      Is inhibited in new interpersonal situations because of feelings of inadequacy.<br>6.      Views self as socially inept, personally unappealing, or inferior to others.<br>7.      Is usually reluctant to take personal risks or to engage in any new activities because of potential embarrassment.<br><br>i tend to get over emotional and cannot act rationally, as in making rash decisions i will regret later on for example.<br>i am not aggressive in nature and most of the time my mood swings from normal to depress.<br>most of the time i just wish my world will just come to an end.<br><br></div>
