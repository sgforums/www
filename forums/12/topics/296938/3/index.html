This is especially true if you happen to have friends who congregate in groups (ie.you know and interact with them on a group basis rather than on an individual basis). As most people behaving that way tend to make friends on the basis of wanting to "fit in" to allay their insecurities rather than befriending others through a common interest/circumstance, such relationships normally wouldn't withstand the test of time. In truth, such people will be spending their lifetimes making friends in phases (ie.at school, work, etc) without keeping any substantial friends that actually last a lifetime. In all honesty, do you really need such friends?<br><br>Loneliness isn't a worthy reason to feed your insecurities methinks - instead of viewing yourself as an outcast, you should feel sorry for your insecure "friends" who seem to have numerous friends on the surface, but are ultimately the loneliest people around. Quality of friendships certainly far supercedes the quantity of friendships.<br><br>If it's loneliness you wish to address, do go and join some activities to interact with others as some have suggested. However, don't bank on such channels as viable avenues for you to make lifelong friends because, chances are, such "friends" (well, most by the law of averages) will become strangers in the distant future anyway.</div></blockquote> Wow, totally agree with the above! Especially the last para about addressing loneliness. Really, my personal experience also tells me not to bank on such channels to meet lifelong friends. But it's always better to expand one's social circles in the right areas, so that eventually you will meet a few who can be your lifelong friends.<br></div>

Scientific research has shown individuals having an exceptionally high IQ tend to exhibit a higher tendency to be loners simply because they are capable of comprehending higher-level thought processes (which would mean their interests would be pretty different from those of ordinary folks) that are beyond the grasp and interests of those who are less intelligent. By the law of averages, if you had an IQ of 135 and above, only 1 in a 100 people you meet will possess your IQ (or higher than yours) - naturally, the probability of you having something "common" with others to ignite a friendship will then decrease. Ultimately, if the reason behind your inability to connect with others boils down to this, then it really isn't so much of a social problem as you perceive it to be.<br><br>As a matter of fact, folks like Goethe, Einstein, Michaelangelo, Hitler were renowned loners...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You're not alone in being lonely (pardon the pun).  That being said, through bitter past experiences when I used to joke &amp; clown around only to be subsequently disrespected &amp; thought of as 'weird' behind my back, I have resolved to keep to myself as much as possible in my everyday life.  I will talk, but only in the course of my work, and on a social level, I keep away from my colleagues.  Weekends, I'll just indulge in solitary activities if my (non-colleaue) buddies are not free.  I have totally lost interest in even trying to become a part of this hypocritical society.<br><br>Perhaps we are born loners; we just have to cope with it the best we can.  Hope you can take some comfort in this, Meilin.</div>
