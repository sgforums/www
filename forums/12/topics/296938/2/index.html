You can try to take up classes that match your interest. You can do something out of the oridinary. Step out of your comfort zone and do something that you thought you could never have done. Life is full of wonders and opportunities.<br><br>Try join the CC, spend your time meaningfully by volunteerism, take up a new sport to sculpture your body, join an art class to refine your mind. There are so much things that you can choose to spend your weekend wisely and through these avenue, you  get to know more friends with common interests. From there onwards, you can slowly build your networks.<br><br>Other than pro-actively seeking out new friends, take some time out for yourself, to nuture yourself. I like to have some time enjoying reading a new book, have a mini-home spa treatment. There has to be a balance between work, social and yourself which is lacking in your current likestyle.<br><br>There is nothing wrong with you. You are just at a <strong>temporay</strong> standstill in your life. You have the capability to change alot of things. Stay happy yeh.<br><br></div>
