A dance club would be nice. from there u can meet new ppl<br><br>Everyone is getting busy with their life especially when they are working and they have gf/bf. Honestly if they are under these, u hardly able to meet them up cuz they prefer to be with their lover more than a fren.<br><br>Meet face-to-face is kinda hard too as u need to travel and most ppl are exhausted after working hour depending on their position and workload..ITs understandable ppl wont go out for Yamcha or anything on weekday nites.<br><br>I know you feel this but things will changed if u meet the special one. At that time, u will think meeting up a fren on weekend would b a little hard<br><br>As for me, my life is now my family, career and my gf.. Frens  really need to put aside before all these. Still meet up anyway but not that often as when i was single.<br><br>Try to join Modern-Dancing class, its fun. YOu can dance, exercise, know more ppl and the most important , you have fun</div>

Since you do visit sgFourm, can try coming to Single Club where they host lot of group activities.<br><br>Other then that, u can fill up your time with hobby or thing that u once wish to do but din have the money or time doing. Pick up a new sport too can help. It keep u happy, occupied and at the same time fit.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TO be lonely or not, it is depend on what you wan to do. If you do nothing, sure you will continue to be lonely. If you do something, pretty sure u will know whether you are lonely.<br><br>Everything takes effort to obtain something. Try to think of something that u want to do, search it, then join it.

But still, why choose to be lonely when u can be in the company of joy and fun. If your old gang can't made it, time to get more newer gangs, so that u have some to spare in the near future. At least till the day u walk down that aisle.</div>

This is especially true if you happen to have friends who congregate in groups (ie.you know and interact with them on a group basis rather than on an individual basis). As most people behaving that way tend to make friends on the basis of wanting to "fit in" to allay their insecurities rather than befriending others through a common interest/circumstance, such relationships normally wouldn't withstand the test of time. In truth, such people will be spending their lifetimes making friends in phases (ie.at school, work, etc) without keeping any substantial friends that actually last a lifetime. In all honesty, do you really need such friends?<br><br>Loneliness isn't a worthy reason to feed your insecurities methinks - instead of viewing yourself as an outcast, you should feel sorry for your insecure "friends" who seem to have numerous friends on the surface, but are ultimately the loneliest people around. Quality of friendships certainly far supercedes the quantity of friendships.<br><br>If it's loneliness you wish to address, do go and join some activities to interact with others as some have suggested. However, don't bank on such channels as viable avenues for you to make lifelong friends because, chances are, such "friends" (well, most by the law of averages) will become strangers in the distant future anyway.</div>
