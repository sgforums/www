              <p>Hello, imagine that you are in a new workplace and you are sharing a table with another person. However, the person likes to mumble to himself and sometime look at your computer screen ( not just a glance). I have once taken note of him mumbling continously for more than 5 minutes. In the initial stage, you were friendly to him but you realize that he like to keep on talking to you. Sometime i felt obligated to reply his question when i am not interested in continuing with the converstation as busy with work and may has no interest in some of conversation topic. He also purposely wait for people to go home together and somehow it irks me.</p>
              <p>Lately, you realize that he may be gossiping about you behind your back and create discord. I think it is because i have ignored him and display unfriendly attitude (it was not intentionally displayed but i was really frustrated with him invading my personal time and i want to focus on completing my task ).</p>
              <p>He could have talked to other  new colleagues but they are not sharing the same table and their backs are facing him.</p>
              <p>(i) I was reflecting on what went wrong. if you were me, what were you do to prevent making enemies with your fellow colleagues.</p>
              <p>(ii) I was wondering am i at fault too?</p>
              <p>(iii) he has created discord. what should i do?</p>

              <p>Are you a lady? In between you can always complain to your superior about this 'thirteen clock' and whether you can change seating arrangement etc and I am sure they will take action if they have your welfare at heart.</p>
              <p>And that is also why I favoured an office with cubicle. Trust me, for office with open tables, staffs always talk cork and gossip with one another instead of discussing real work issue, not to forget got no privacy and nonsense like your happening right now.</p>

              <p>Your manager is probably already aware of his behavior. All you need to do is speak to your manager in private and explain you are not comfortable with the seating arrangements.  </p>

              <p>I worked in an environment where there are many people. He had gossiped bad things about me and even to a supervisor. This is not conducive as i'm in a probation period. We have different managers.</p>
