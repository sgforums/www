Think about it this way, if someone goes after your own girlfriend, and she happened to be going out with him, how would you feel?<br><br>So, I would suggest that you befriend her instead and be steady not to let her know you're attracted to her. Try to be cocky and funny instead. Girls love it. And in time, if she happen to like you, good for you.<br><br>Note: During the times when you are her friend, don't do too many things for her, it WON'T work out for the better on your side. Trust me.<br><br>If there're any questions or suggestions, you may PM me or post it here.

Think about it this way, if someone goes after your own girlfriend, and she happened to be going out with him, how would you feel?<br><br>So, I would suggest that you befriend her instead and be steady not to let her know you're attracted to her. Try to be cocky and funny instead. Girls love it.
