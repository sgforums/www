The feeling of insecurity might be because of my inconfidence.<br><br>I guess, if the gal loves me, she will firmly reject the suiters. If both of us have confidence in this relationship, then the suiters would not in anyway affect our relationship. As simple as that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pls dont break up a couple. I have suffered when my ex did the same thing to me. Going out with another guy and leave me when I am preparing for my exam. I felt being betrayed just becos thatguy can bring her out and woo her behind my back. Put yourself in my shoe and feel how will you react if your girl is to betray you. Unless that girl end up the relationship with his current bf, or else, get prepare that she will betray you again. The prob is if she can betray her current bf for you, she will do it again and again. There is honey moon stage in a relationship before getting dull. Once the honey moon stage is over and before you know it, she may have leave you for another guy. Good luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You shouldn't intrude into their relationship. I think u should wait for them to break up or something... In the meantime, look for someone better in case they never break up and get married. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
