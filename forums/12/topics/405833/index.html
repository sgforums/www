              <p>Is it possible that your parent have a habit of sweeping/mopping the floor?so much so that it's not good to deprive them of their habit?meaning we as their children should not clean the house because it's their habit?if we do so then they will have nothing to do?my bro actually said that it's my father's habit to clean the house on weekend..and he doesnt do it so as to keep my father busy with something to do...i tell him he is just plain lazy because except for his room..i had never seen him keeping the floor clean...we live in 5RM so it's quite tedious to clean the house..</p>
              <p>i help my father as much as i can unless i am busy with work...and my bro?internet..bring gf into the room and treat like a hotel...habit..great..isn't it that little things people do can tell what kind a person they are?</p>
              <p>is he wrong to say that it's my father's habit?my dad doesnt have this kind of habit -.-</p>

              <p><br>TS, are u a gal or a guy?</p>
              <p>And is ur bro older or younger?</p>
              <p>If your parents choose to side and tolerate your brother's behavior...then there's probably nth much u can do.</p>
              <p>Your brother will not "wake up" becoz he's really comfortable now, since your parents are doing all these without complaints.</p>
              <p>You can try to talk him out of this and make him realise that he's being a gigantic asshole, but I don't think it'll work.</p>
              <p>So...tolerate lor.....help ur parents out as much as u can.</p>
