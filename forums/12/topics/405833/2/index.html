              <p>Even if you want to control your family, you can't. So don't paint yourself to be so high and mighty lah.</p>
              <p>Sure, you can suggest to your brother, have a chat, but if he doesn't care to listen to you, there's nothing you can do , except come here and rant about it.</p>
              <p>You can try talking to your parents, but you can't make them control your brother if they don't see the need to either.</p>
              <p>Your parents may have their own reason for allowing your brother do what he did with his gf.</p>
              <p>You only have a narrow view and cannot see the bigger picture. That's too bad.</p>
              <p>If your brother wants to get intimate with his gf, and your parents chased them out, they are just gonna do it some where else.</p>
              <p>Maybe in a sleazy hotel . Or if he is broke, they'd be doing it in a park, in the backseat of their vehicle, somewhere where he can get caught and put into lockup. Is that more embarrasing for your parents to bail him out of the police station , or is it better they let him do what he wants at home ??</p>
              <p>At home, your parents know who he's going it with, what kind of girl he is dating, at least your parents know he is not out there somewhere getting into more serious trouble.</p>
              <p>How your brother behaves is not your parent's main concern. It seems his behavior is affecting only you.</p>
              <p>If your parents mind, they'd have told him off themselves. If they don't and they choose to enable his behavior, then it's your parents' choice to let it become so.</p>
              <p>You on the other hand needs to back off and go mind your own business. OK ? Good.</p>

              <p>You only have a narrow view and cannot see the bigger picture.
              That's too bad.</p>
              <p>If your brother wants to get intimate with his gf, and your
              parents chased them out, they are just gonna do it some where
              else.</p>
              <p>Maybe in a sleazy hotel . Or if he is broke, they'd be doing it
              in a park, in the backseat of their vehicle, somewhere where he can
              get caught and put into lockup. Is that more embarrasing for your
              parents to bail him out of the police station , or is it better
              they let him do what he wants at home ??</p>
              <p>At home, your parents know who he's going it with, what kind of
              girl he is dating, at least your parents know he is not out there
              somewhere getting into more serious trouble.</p>
              <p>How your brother behaves is not your parent's main concern. It
              seems his behavior is affecting only you.</p>
              <p>If your parents mind, they'd have told him off themselves. If
              they don't and they choose to enable his behavior, then it's your
              parents' choice to let it become so.</p>
              <p>You on the other hand needs to back off and go mind your own
              business. OK ? Good.</p>

              <p>themoment86, give you my 2 cents worth as these situations are very touchy.</p>
              <p>1) Your parents are not doing anything so why should you. The victims are not voicing out opinion while you are very proactive doesn't make things better. As you are the only one in the family who is against your elder brother, you are at the losing end.</p>
              <p>2) Problem is not just with your brother but also with parents. Take things at small steps, to deal with your brother attitude, you need to fix your parents' attitude first, because they hold the ultimate power. No use wasting brain cells when your parents does not stand along the same line.</p>
              <p>3) Work your way to win parents favor. Parents likes to have balance and harmony. When you are very against your brother, they will stop you from breaking harmony. Instead of being proactive, have a passive attitude. Don't pinpoint, or nag, or help them with the chores. They may take you for granted. Your parents have brains and will surely know that at the end of the day it's all amount to teaching your brother correct value. wait until they complain, and then work your way to let them know about it. In a family, it is not about me and myself. It's about everyone contributing, and that's why we call them family and about cultivating right values.</p>
              <p>4) You have no rights. If you are in a traditional chinese family, know that as a girl and being youngest of the family does not entitle you the right to discipline someone above you. Unless you are the one with financial ability to support the family.</p>
