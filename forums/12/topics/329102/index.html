              This is my second job after i graduate from university. I got a job as an accountant in a sme and i been working around 4 month plus. I was given 2 book keeper to as my staff. 1 of the book keeper is around 24 yrs old. As it is my second job i try to be humble and gain as much experience as i can.
              
              We are doing OT for the past 1 month due to auditing at least up to 9 pm everynite. After work i drive the 24 yr old book keeper home as the other book keeper's husband will usually wait for her and also i live near to the 24 yr book keeper. 
              
              At first we just causally chat about work and stuff, i am a very quiet guy basically. After sometime she ask me about what kind of girl i like etc. She told me she become 110kg due to thyroid disorders and her height is 160cm. One day i JOKE about going to my friend's foreign bride agency and she give me a weird look saying sg girl not enough? I said i been ditch by a few girl before and she suddenly said she will not ditch any guy etc, i just keep mute.
              
              One night she suddenly said she is fond of me, i was shock and i said i am honor but now i do not wish to get in any relationship as i am currently doing my cpa. I guess i was too direct or anything but from that day she start to underperform in her work and she will throw tantrums like she has too much work on her hand. 
              
              The worst part is one day while i was having lunch with my colleague and the other book keeper, they told me i should not shit in the place i work and the other book keeper said the 24 yr old staff have been saying that i am a shallow guy that go for looks. I was real piss off i mean i am just average looking but i am 186cm and 72kg, why will i want a girl that is 160cm and 110kg. I have to admit first impression play a part.
              
              Sorry but this is really not a fat bashing thread, and i really just give her a drive home nothing else.

              <p>I'm hoping you didn't start this by flirting
                              with her, especially since it sounds like BK1 is terribly scorned. If you were just being nice by fetching her home and she
                              develops a crush, then that's understandable. But hey no matter what let's face it, rejection is tough pill to swallow for anyone. And there are crazy women out there who will raise hell over the dumbest things.</p>
              <p>Imho, that night when she asked you what sort of girl interests you, was the first sign of trouble. Should've seen it coming and kept a safe distance. Women ask that question when they're interested in a man so her declaration was inevitable, maybe you were the only guy in a long time to have paid her attention and done something nice.</p>
              <p>When BK2 told you not to shit where you eat, did you tell her BK1 declared her love for you? I don't understand. BK2 should be showing you sympathy instead.</p>
              <p>If I were you I'll consider 2 options.</p>
              <p>Sweep the matter under the rug, maintain a polite distance with BK1 from now on. By that, it means I will have a closed door meeting with her in a professional setting, tell her I am flattered by the attention but would like to focus on my work and I respect her too much as both a staff and a friend to make a relationship out of it. With that said, in the best interest of this company, I hope it will not affect our working relationship. If she is facing problems with her workload, let me know so I can take appropriate measures.</p>
              <p>Then I will never bring this up again, and just keep my personal life out of all conversation with BK1.</p>
              <p>Next ask BK2 to meet. Tell her there was a misunderstanding with BK1 and the matter has been clarified. No need to tell her what was clarified, just let her know you mean business and whatever it is, you act in the best interest of the company.</p>
              <p>Let it sink for the next 2 days, then on Wednesday, take the 2 women out for drinks or dinner after work. Say it is on you, a gesture of thanks for all the overtime work last month. Continue working with them and hope for the best. If BK1 is still acting like a brat, try having her transferred because I have done my part in trying to resolve the conflict.</p>
              <p>Option 2, save all that trouble and just have BK1 transferred. Sometimes you need to be cruel to be kind.</p>
              <p>And now that we all know an elephant has a crush on you, lucky bastard!</p>

              <p>This is my second job after i graduate from university. I got a job as an accountant in a sme and i been working around 4 month plus. I was given 2 book keeper to as my staff. 1 of the book keeper is around 24 yrs old. As it is my second job i try to be humble and gain as much experience as i can.</p>
              <p>We are doing OT for the past 1 month due to auditing at least up to 9 pm everynite. After work i drive the 24 yr old book keeper home as the other book keeper’s husband will usually wait for her and also i live near to the 24 yr book keeper.</p>
              <p>At first we just causally chat about work and stuff, i am a very quiet guy basically. After sometime she ask me about what kind of girl i like etc. She told me she become 110kg due to thyroid disorders and her height is 160cm. One day i <span>JOKE</span> about going to my friend’s foreign bride agency and she give me a weird look saying sg girl not enough? I said i been ditch by a few girl before and she suddenly said she will not ditch any guy etc, i just keep mute.</p>
              <p>One night she suddenly said she is fond of me, i was shock and i said i am honor but now i do not wish to get in any relationship as i am currently doing my cpa. I guess i was too direct or anything but from that day she start to underperform in her work and she will throw tantrums like she has too much work on her hand.</p>
              <p>The worst part is one day while i was having lunch with my colleague and the other book keeper, they told me i should not shit in the place i work and the other book keeper said the 24 yr old staff have been saying that i am a shallow guy that go for looks. I was real piss off i mean i am just average looking but i am 186cm and 72kg, why will i want a girl that is 160cm and 110kg. I have to admit first impression play a part.</p>
              <p>Sorry but this is really not a fat bashing thread, and i really just give her a drive home nothing else.</p>
