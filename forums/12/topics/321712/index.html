              Hmm i think it's a myth. I'm a cynical person and i think there's always something we want in return. Say for example u are nice to somebody. That's becuz u want that somebody to treat u better. Or maybe u love a dog very much. Maybe u would expect the dog to listen to u or to keep u company when u are lonely in exchange for the love and care u shower for the dog. 
              Or u love a person deeply. Then he/she did something that hurts u badly. Why would u feel hurt? Becuz u expect him/her not to hurt u since u love him/she so deeply. We always treat others by how we want others to treat us. 
              
              Perhaps it's just me but i truely find it hard to believe that humans are altruism creatures. Only humans...

              <p>What pple said are just their expression, everyone of us express our love differently ok. Like in your case, love means never say good bye. And as for me, love is just love, no percentage involved. And for some Ninjas, love like a farking bitch, sad.</p>

              <p>U never see newspaper meh, some give n give until they go bankrupt and the wife say this guy useless n run away with other guy. Communication is 2-way traffic, if the other keep quiet, u better also keep quiet.  So i think it should be 50/50 especially when comes to $. Love is when 2 person works towards a goal that both desire.  Without the same goal, it is just a matter of time they pack up n split.</p>

              <p>What pple said are just their expression, everyone of us express our love differently ok. Like in your case, love means never say good bye. And as for me, love is just love, no percentage involved. And for some Ninjas, love like a farking bitch, sad.</p>

              <p>It' is impossible to give 50% at the same time. This is because r/ship is a zero sum game. When you give, the other gain. So technically,  the person giving 50% is the a jerk!</p>

              <p>That brings us to the balanced nett return. Will you see a nett return at the end of the r/ship. I cannot answer that but my take is a resounding 'Yes'.  Although we do not end our life (naturally) together, the result of the r/ship will have a nett return.</p>
              <p>So what does it mean? It means that when you love someone, you give/give up/give in to him/her. You develop the all powerful FAITH that he/she will reciprocate in return. And when the day finally comes, either one will give more than the other, yet the one giving will be feel that he/she is receiving the same in return.</p>
              <p>To me, this is true for a pure and honest r/ship.</p>
