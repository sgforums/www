Well but if they do get insulted with your teasing... one thing is for sure.. she ain't a fun person to get along with. NEXT!!!!!!<br><br>yes.. its true not to always joke or hurt the confidence of a woman.. even very beautiful women have insecurities, and thats the problem with us! we're not securing them.<br><br>Example..<br><br>Women: Do i look good in this dress? ( Translation: Do i look fat in this dress? )<br>Men: Yes, you look fabulous (oh? just get on with it.. BUY IT ALREADY!)<br>Women: Oh? Really...<br><br>See whats happening? lets try this out instead...<br><br>Women: Do i look good in this dress?<br>Men: Yes! and you don't look fat in it too!<br>Women: Cut it out already!<br>Men: Well you DO look fabulous in it!<br><br>OR<br><br>if you know her very well... you could tell her<br><br>"i don't know about the rest... but your bottom looks great in that"<br><br>What do you think the woman is thinking now?<br><br>Well back to topic...<br><br>Most beautiful women think men are whimps.. we flock their houses with chocolates and diamonds.. they take your gifts and slam the door shut at you... it just gives the woman the impression that we're buying her love... i mean look.. we go to this girl.. give her chocolates... she'll fall all over you!? no way. unless you look like brad pitt. so now we know what the situation is like... do something about it! don't give in to the girl = you're not another whimp<br><br>Nowadays the men are becoming women and women becoming the men.<br><br>Men are pleasing the women... giving them dinners and stuff while the women wear black leather clothing all over with a whip in their hands.. controlling the relationship.. alot of you guys should know that  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> We shud show women that we are men! let them know that we are not desperate, we are in control with our emotions, we won't let anything change our decisions.</div>
