There are some indications she has some liking for u.<br><br>1st, she did not reject your invitation to go out. She did not break the date. She's giving u her time and chance to evaluate a possible romance.<br>2nd, she did not reject you holding her hand. But you made a mistake by trying to touch her. Let her touch u instead.<br>3rd, where did u kiss her? lips or face? If it's the lips u got a good chance dude. If u tried to kiss her but she turned the face around to let u kiss her cheeks, well...not so good.<br>4th, Can u be more specific by saying she doesnt show affection for u? She doesnt want to touch u or doesnt laugh at ur stupid jokes when instead, she looks bored when u are telling jokes using a Mark Lee's face?<br>5th, and stop calling her...it's a huge turn off for girls..at least in the beginning when u hardly know someone.</div>

There are some indications she has some liking for u.<br><br>1st, she did not reject your invitation to go out. She did not break the date. She's giving u her time and chance to evaluate a possible romance.<br>2nd, she did not reject you holding her hand. But you made a mistake by trying to touch her. Let her touch u instead.<br>3rd, where did u kiss her? lips or face? If it's the lips u got a good chance dude. If u tried to kiss her but she turned the face around to let u kiss her cheeks, well...not so good.<br>4th, Can u be more specific by saying she doesnt show affection for u? She doesnt want to touch u or doesnt laugh at ur stupid jokes when instead, she looks bored when u are telling jokes using a Mark Lee's face?<br>5th, and stop calling her...it's a huge turn off for girls..at least in the beginning when u hardly know someone.</div></blockquote>ans:<br>2.haha..the problem is how to let her touch me first?<br>3.of coz i kiss her on the lips,passionate kiss somemore,but the next time we met ,its like normal friends again ,lack of b/f g/f chemistry<br>4.she do laugh at my stilly jokes many times,but i seem to be running out of ideas<br>5.i did stop sms her for 2 days and finally she sms me to say she will leave work early,which means she wanted me to ask her out.The thing is she just refuse to say that she wants to meet me.</div>
