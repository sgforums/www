              <p>Just keep your options open. I dunno, but I don't think it is right to wish for other people's relationship to collapse so that you can get a way with her. I think the girl needs to be shot for leading you on. I don't know about the rest, but I think she is just trying to give you false hopes into waiting for her while she is enjoying herself with her current boyfriend.</p>

              <p>Just keep your options open. I dunno, but I don't think it is right to wish for other people's relationship to collapse so that you can get a way with her. I think the girl needs to be shot for leading you on. I don't know about the rest, but I think she is just trying to give you false hopes into waiting for her while she is enjoying herself with her current boyfriend.</p>
