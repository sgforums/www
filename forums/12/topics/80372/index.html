This incident is so trivial that u should have forgotten abt it once u stepped out of school. But instead it lingers in u long enuff to warrant a post.<br><br>Obviously the problem doesn't lie just on the girls. I bet most guys would be able to pull off the same stunt and get away with it. U profess that ur not very well liked so there has to be a reason. Anyway, be easy on others around you (esp the ladies) and learn to laff things off (things that dun shouldn't matter like this little incident). U'll find yourself alot happier and a more likeable person.<br><br></div>
