            <div class='col-md body'>hey guys. i just need an outlet to vent my frustrations, or rather insecurities.<br><br>I seem to have been bitten by the love bug. Girl A being my object of desire. Its been about 20 odd days that we've "gone out" meaning no declaration of love, just hanging out to see how things goes.<br><br>Things have turned out quite well. Or maybe as well as i would like to think. Some information that you guys may need. We split costs when we do go out,sometimes not evenly but i definitely don't lose out. When i fetch her home, i usually get a hug. But this week it became a hug and a kiss on the cheek. Sounds good so far huh? now comes the bad part.<br><br>The things is I feel really insecure when im not with her. One example is she parties quite hard. More often then me. And yesterday there was some halloween party that she went as a bunny( extremely low cut top revealing a lacy  bra). I really wonder why must she go to that extend to dress up? Is she trying to attract guys attention? like what for man. if shes serious about the thing going on between us.<br><br>I asked her during one of our time together about how does she view me. She said I'm a  "prospect". apparently she told me about other guys that were after her but said they were "disgusting", "desperate" or "no hope". But i cant imagine if there are more "prospect".<br><br>Quite disturbingly is that we have not held hands, even though we are quite close. And the fact that shes quite an open girl also bewilders me. The only time that she does so is if she see a foreign worker around then she will wrap her arms around mine. then she will let go once we pass them.<br><br>From the outside it seems like shes trying to potray a very "open, fun, heckcare" kind of girl but somehow when im with her shes very different. almost "angel-like" must have "boundary and all".<br><br>What im concern is is she trying to pull a fast one over me? just using me for the moment to to fill in her spare time? Or worst dating other guys behind my back to get the best and freshes catch of the day? I've really asked her all this questions before but she told me that shes not seeing any other guys.<br>Sigh when would the insecurity end.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Definately u will feel insecure. Just slowly make ur moves. Cause once she is yours..   u know others can only see. While u are the one..mmmm...mmmmm *smakcs his lips*  u know what i mean. So now u just gotta work harder in getting her.<br><br>I think u just gotta make her feel comfortable and secure. Be the MAN. And just let her do her stuffs while u are there.. she will come back to you again once she is dont with whatever she is doing. I think she is that kind . But at least she tries to be all angelic in front of you.. coming back to you and all. So thats not too bad. Just dun act like an @ss hole or intrude on her stuffs. Only do so when in private.<br><br>My ex is kinda like how u describe.Guys always checking her out , approaching her and the way she dances.. is like dancing on an invisible pole.. *thinks back* oh yeah...girls that know how to move their hips like that... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> anyways...  i let her have her fun. Cause in the end of the night/day she will still come back to me.N when u are around guys approach her , she dun really hiu them.. u know u got it takes to be her man.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey man. I think that your problem's a psychological one. If you feel so much for her, you have to make it known that you are all in. But if you are just going after her for fun (*coughsexcough*), then just treat her like dirt but enjoy the benefits that you reap. Regarding the other guys, she already told you that you are one of those 'prospects'. Isnt that a good thing? I mean, there might be other, but you are one of them! So take this opportunity to show her that you are the one for her. In a 'pick me, choose me, love me' kind of way.</div>
