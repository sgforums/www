Everyone has expectations for the person who they would want to be with. Ultimately, just be yourself and look for the girl who would love you... just for you. Being a good guy or nice guy, they way your girl friends would put it... its not a crime but just that they don't feel for you. Keep trying and don't give up! When you go NS, just take things easy whether be it in camp or with your stead if you have one by then.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think at this age the gers also searching for their identity. some dun even know what they want, how they suppose to commit to a relationship?<br><br>is just becoz that the guy got enlisted and got less time to accompany her, that cause her to divert her feelings to another guy who comes along.....<br><br>think its a blessing that i cant get a gf yet.<br>haha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey pal. Don't worry. This is something that most guys will go through. Good gals are all super popular and need to be "fight" over. That's why there's rejections. Anyway just to share with you. I have a friend who is super super confident of himself and got super high self esteem. Although he is a ok guy. But due to his characters, all my other friends dun like him cos he think he is always right and offend people at the same thime. Dun worry. Being rejected is normal. Don't take it too hard. Bottomline is, only go for the gals that you really love... going for someone just for the physical enjoyment or something to show off to others will lead to a breakup in no time. Cheers!
