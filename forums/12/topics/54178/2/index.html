This is something that most guys will go through. Good gals are all super popular and need to be "fight" over. That's why there's rejections. Anyway just to share with you. I have a friend who is super super confident of himself and got super high self esteem. Although he is a ok guy. But due to his characters, all my other friends dun like him cos he think he is always right and offend people at the same thime. Dun worry. Being rejected is normal. Don't take it too hard. Bottomline is, only go for the gals that you really love... going for someone just for the physical enjoyment or something to show off to others will lead to a breakup in no time. Cheers! [/quote]</div></blockquote>hmm.... i am not very egoistic but sometimes i always assume i am right even though i do not get the right facts up.....<br><br>damn.... offended a no of ppl with my this always-right-attitude.</div>
