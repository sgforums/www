The man cannot be lazy. How can you expect a woman to do the chasing? Then he might as well cut off his **** lol. And we hear many cases of the man still doing nature's job--to pursue the woman. He is born to do this. You have so many sperms fighting for one ovary. Pardon me for getting too scientific here.<br><br>Yes, both parties hold the rights to terminate r/s i do agree. They are free to do whatever they want. i  did not say that proposing to gf means you will get rejected. Proposing is the man's job, or rather, it used to be last time. That's my point. From chasing to proposing.<br><br>As for why the women who proposed but got rejected by their bf, there are many factors why the woman get rejected. These are their own individual problems. Some men may not feel like settling down. Some dun have money.  Some wanted to concentrate on career. So many reasons. But only the woman knows when is the right time to get married.</div>
