We've been thru a lot of things in these past 6 years. Things like deaths of close relatives, sickness, my NS life and much more drama. We have always been there for each other in times of need. The bond we share is remarkable. Everyone who knows abt us thinks that we will be together and ever, happily ever after. I thought so too...<br><br>Things got rocky recently. An idiot (A) tried to go after my ex, knowing that she's attached with a BF of 6 yrs. Stirred up plenty of shit, did not have the guts to admit to his mistakes, got his friend (B)to stand up for him. Is a very long story, I'll just cut everything short.<br><br>My ex broke up with me 2 mths ago. But 1 mth after that break up, we still behaved like a couple. I was trying to win back the confidence she had in me. Then 2 weeks ago, she called me and told me that we should draw a line, she needed to find herself back and think what she really wanted. I agreed. The next   day while I was with her, her HP rang. Caller ID showed "BB". I knew something was wrong so i questioned her. She finally admitted that she's attached now, with (B)! I was very heart broken, this is the first time in 6yrs she had ever lied to me.<br><br>The reason why we broke up is because she feels that I don't give her enough concern and love. And I've been a great disappointment to her, which is kinda true. I'm 24 this yr and I'm still studying for a diploma. She feels neglected and thinks that I'm not making effort for myself and her.<br><br>The problem now is, my friends have heard my story and are asking me to move on. But there's a part inside me that refuses to let go... I do not know if she really do love him. She did mentioned that she might be accepting this guy now cause she's been really hurt by me, but she also mentioned that at least she feels happy and treasured now.<br><br>I have so many plans of the future involving her. I do not know if she's really in love with him or not. Another concern is, even if she doesn't come back to me anymore, I do not wish to see her get hurt by this guy again. She's been hurt by me bad enough already. This guy is a hypocrite. Everyone know that. If u guys are interested, I'll go on to tell the story abt him.<br><br>Im really confused. Should I let go or not? I know from the bottom of my heart, that I really still love her very much. And she IS the one for me....<br><br>ps: sorry bout the super long story.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

I don't see why not you can't have a better gf in the future... You are still young, there's no need to go into self pity or self sympathy. There's so many wonderful years ahead of you... I can see that you really really adore this girl so all the more you should learn to let it go, if that's what she truly wants and if that's what is going to make her happier, you should learn to let it go. I mean that's what I would do if I were you, but I've been wrong before, I just want to say that love can't be forced. I'm sorry mate, I feel for you really, I know how painful it feels and I can't imagine you having to go through all of this.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>move on. but hold on. if she is indeed attached because of the need to feel treasured and cherished, there is a chance those feelings will fade. also since she doesnt know B that well as in long long well, there is also a chance that the bad side might repulse her. so move on, if in time should she become available again, and feelings are present, you can try to get her to be with you again by rekindling the flames. or if at anytime a better girl appears then go after her. of course the latter does not need to be made known to the former.<br><br>but for now, take it as a test of time. if she really is happy and attached for like a long time, then good luck to you. 6 years is not a short time.</div>

She is not the one for you because she doesn't love you anymore. She is trying to confuse you because she herself is confused also. But she is not confused because the guy has replaced you to become no.1 and you are no.2. And there is no way you can climb back to no.1 The only way is to get a new girl and go ahead with your plans and show ur ex(whenever the chance arises) about your new gf. Other than that, you dun give your ex any more attention.<br><br>So what if it's 6 years? It means nothing to her. The woman only cares abt her own feelings towards you and apparently she doesn't have much feelings for you as compared to before. She cheated on you. She is unfaithful and you still want to get married with her!? You shd count yourself damn lucky. If not you will be marrying someone who doesn't like you? Hello!?<br><br>Things did not get rocky recently. It had already begun a few years ago when you showered too much concern for her. She is trying to give you an excuse and throw smoke at you la. She became bored of you. That's why the new guy came along and she broke up with you 2 mths ago. At that time when she became bored of you, she has already started to look for a new guy already. Nice timing huh?<br><br>And she lied to you. You want to marry a liar?! What do you mean you treat her badly? I thought you said you din shower enough concern for her? Is that treating her badly? Again she's not the girl for you. To her, the new guy is the one for her.<br><br>Stop being confused any more. Ur own ego and love for her has been blinding you all the time.</div>

Time will heal yr heart, maybe after 1 or 2 years, you maybe find another girl much better than your ex. Good Luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tat gf stealer will get his retribution. karma. wad goes round comes round. i think even ur ex n u have broken up, u shdnt stop ur care n concern for her. let her know that u truly love her til the very day, and if she has a heart or feeling for u, she will come back. at the same time, stay strong. a bad break up is the worst thing one would ever want.</div>

I'm not the mushy wushy type, and I'm not good at expressing myself. Maybe that's the reason why she feels that that she's not treasured and loved.

She is not the one for you because she doesn't love you anymore. She is trying to confuse you because she herself is confused also. But she is not confused because the guy has replaced you to become no.1 and you are no.2. And there is no way you can climb back to no.1 The only way is to get a new girl and go ahead with your plans and show ur ex(whenever the chance arises) about your new gf. Other than that, you dun give your ex any more attention.<br><br>So what if it's 6 years? It means nothing to her. The woman only cares abt her own feelings towards you and apparently she doesn't have much feelings for you as compared to before. She cheated on you. She is unfaithful and you still want to get married with her!? You shd count yourself damn lucky. If not you will be marrying someone who doesn't like you? Hello!?<br><br>Things did not get rocky recently. It had already begun a few years ago when you showered too much concern for her. She is trying to give you an excuse and throw smoke at you la. She became bored of you. That's why the new guy came along and she broke up with you 2 mths ago. At that time when she became bored of you, she has already started to look for a new guy already. Nice timing huh?<br><br>And she lied to you. You want to marry a liar?! What do you mean you treat her badly? I thought you said you din shower enough concern for her? Is that treating her badly? Again she's not the girl for you. To her, the new guy is the one for her.<br><br>Stop being confused any more. Ur own ego and love for her has been blinding you all the time. </div></blockquote>She didn't exactly turned unfaithful. We did broke up, then she found herself a new guy. It's just that she chose to lie to me abt wanting to find herself rather than telling the truth abt having a new guy.</div>

You are just giving your girl excuse. She is not willing to stick through thick and thin with you. You called that the ONE for you? Whether it's one week or one year that they just  got together, the fact is that she found the guy to replace you. She did not find someone to cushion that fall. She did not even fall. You are the one who needs the cushioning and you are still protecting her.</div>

We've been thru a lot of things in these past 6 years. Things like deaths of close relatives, sickness, my NS life and much more drama. We have always been there for each other in times of need. The bond we share is remarkable. Everyone who knows abt us thinks that we will be together and ever, happily ever after. I thought so too...<br><br>Things got rocky recently. An idiot (A) tried to go after my ex, knowing that she's attached with a BF of 6 yrs. Stirred up plenty of shit, did not have the guts to admit to his mistakes, got his friend (B)to stand up for him. Is a very long story, I'll just cut everything short.<br><br>My ex broke up with me 2 mths ago. But 1 mth after that break up, we still behaved like a couple. I was trying to win back the confidence she had in me. Then 2 weeks ago, she called me and told me that we should draw a line, she needed to find herself back and think what she really wanted. I agreed. The next   day while I was with her, her HP rang. Caller ID showed "BB". I knew something was wrong so i questioned her. She finally admitted that she's attached now, with (B)! I was very heart broken, this is the first time in 6yrs she had ever lied to me.<br><br>The reason why we broke up is because she feels that I don't give her enough concern and love. And I've been a great disappointment to her, which is kinda true. I'm 24 this yr and I'm still studying for a diploma. She feels neglected and thinks that I'm not making effort for myself and her.<br><br>The problem now is, my friends have heard my story and are asking me to move on. But there's a part inside me that refuses to let go... I do not know if she really do love him. She did mentioned that she might be accepting this guy now cause she's been really hurt by me, but she also mentioned that at least she feels happy and treasured now.<br><br>I have so many plans of the future involving her. I do not know if she's really in love with him or not. Another concern is, even if she doesn't come back to me anymore, I do not wish to see her get hurt by this guy again. She's been hurt by me bad enough already. This guy is a hypocrite. Everyone know that. If u guys are interested, I'll go on to tell the story abt him.<br><br>Im really confused. Should I let go or not? I know from the bottom of my heart, that I really still love her very much. And she IS the one for me....<br><br>ps: sorry bout the super long story.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If a man is able to slip into her life effortlessly and managed to wreck so much havoc in your relationship, it probably means that your relationship isn't very stable as you previously thought it to be.
