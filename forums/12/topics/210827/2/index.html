We've been thru a lot of things in these past 6 years. Things like deaths of close relatives, sickness, my NS life and much more drama. We have always been there for each other in times of need. The bond we share is remarkable. Everyone who knows abt us thinks that we will be together and ever, happily ever after. I thought so too...<br><br>Things got rocky recently. An idiot (A) tried to go after my ex, knowing that she's attached with a BF of 6 yrs. Stirred up plenty of shit, did not have the guts to admit to his mistakes, got his friend (B)to stand up for him. Is a very long story, I'll just cut everything short.<br><br>My ex broke up with me 2 mths ago. But 1 mth after that break up, we still behaved like a couple. I was trying to win back the confidence she had in me. Then 2 weeks ago, she called me and told me that we should draw a line, she needed to find herself back and think what she really wanted. I agreed. The next   day while I was with her, her HP rang. Caller ID showed "BB". I knew something was wrong so i questioned her. She finally admitted that she's attached now, with (B)! I was very heart broken, this is the first time in 6yrs she had ever lied to me.<br><br>The reason why we broke up is because she feels that I don't give her enough concern and love. And I've been a great disappointment to her, which is kinda true. I'm 24 this yr and I'm still studying for a diploma. She feels neglected and thinks that I'm not making effort for myself and her.<br><br>The problem now is, my friends have heard my story and are asking me to move on. But there's a part inside me that refuses to let go... I do not know if she really do love him. She did mentioned that she might be accepting this guy now cause she's been really hurt by me, but she also mentioned that at least she feels happy and treasured now.<br><br>I have so many plans of the future involving her. I do not know if she's really in love with him or not. Another concern is, even if she doesn't come back to me anymore, I do not wish to see her get hurt by this guy again. She's been hurt by me bad enough already. This guy is a hypocrite. Everyone know that. If u guys are interested, I'll go on to tell the story abt him.<br><br>Im really confused. Should I let go or not? I know from the bottom of my heart, that I really still love her very much. And she IS the one for me....<br><br>ps: sorry bout the super long story.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> </div></blockquote>I also did my diploma in my 20s...nothing wrong with that...<br><br>if she cant understand that U need to put in effort to get ur diploma...then what about when U come out to work?same thing again mah...<br><br>if she wants to go....there are 1001 excuses for her to come up with...the point is that she made her decison and whether its for the best or for the worse...she will have to bear that responsibility...saying anything more about the new guy would just make U look like a sore loser...<br><br>U should move on.</div>

That's why high feelings will die after some time. It's like a kind of maintainence work you have to do to maintain high feelings. The chemistry, that is.<br><br></div>

In a relationship, both the guy's and the gal's feelings and character are critical factors to making a relationship work.  You cant have a committed and faithful men with a wife who is flirtatious and forever not at home, or a loyal wife with a philandering husband.  These relationships wont work.

But it's a very unstable form of love.  Possessiveness and jealousy may creep in. That's what so scary about infatuation.

From sitting around waiting to be chased to being proposed to get married, all along it's the guy doing all the work.<br><br>Feelings and character are two separate entities. If u have a partner who cheats on each other, it will not work either. For example, your gf can love you but she can still cheat. So it's her character problem. So u have to make sure during ur dating phase, u make sure she is the right one..if not u are gonna pay.<br><br>Yeah females do complain their own problems but most of the time it's the guys. And guys' hearts are broken most of the times because they are always rejected in some way or another.</div>
