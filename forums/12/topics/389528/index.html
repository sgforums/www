              <p>there is this girl <em>(the girl who i've mentioned in my previous thread)</em> who told me she don't intend to get into any r/s during her uni life, we shared the same thinking. btw, she told me way before i hint her i like her. if she told me that after
              i hint her then i'll agree that that was just her excuse to tell me
              she's not interested in me. but that's not the case. i've tried to hint her quite a couple of times that i like her but she doesn't seemed to take it seriously. anyway, she's evergreen.</p>
              <p>looks like i'm only going to take action after we graduate, which is 2.5 years from now. however, some of my friends said this is a foolish decision cus most probably she'll be attached by then since she's kinda cute and guys like cute girls. there are ought to be some guys who will try to woo her and eventually she might succumb to one of them during these few years in uni.</p>
              <p>my friends are telling me to do it now or i might never have the chance to do it again.</p>
              <p>once again, i'm troubled..</p>

              <p>Well, when oneÂ  loves someone or (does something) or purports to loveÂ  and once the reasons for loving - eg, nice face,Â feeling secure,Â feeling 'good' or sex or ...Â are fulfilled or changes take place (which is inÂ the nature of living) love would evaporate whenÂ the reasons for .... are no longer there or it is fulfilled. How to sustain when once is dealing iwth a human being who is subject to the vagaries of moods.emotions,situations ? Unless one is dealing with some 'thing' already dead. Can be used and put aside and be used again. Human being?</p>
              <p>However, if love was an end unto itself or the 'other' was loved or is being loved for no reasons -but one is simply sharing one's <em>state of being</em>. Being what? Being love, Being kind, Being .....Â  State of being emanates from within (intuitive heart) and state of mind is having conceptualized models and projecting it onto another or others. The latter state is divisive and excludes others when love isÂ  concerned. State of being is inclusive.</p>
              <p>As for fears - by that i imply the loss of the other's fulfilling one or the anxiety of 'being unfufilled in the future.Â  Love that is feaful is not love, but needs/expectations/insecurities masqureading as love.</p>
              <p>Most probably, one loves or assumes that one is loving but the need for reciprocation is a must. Also, the likelihood of jumping into a relationship is hastened cos of insecurity. One enslaves another and in turn is enslaved. Love that was initially freeing is suffocating and stultifying. Hence the misery and pain of love.</p>
              <p>Lest one forgets - love melts the ego. Ego n love can never co-exist. One has to go.</p>
              <p>As to which stays is telling of the quality of the .....</p>

              <p>I was in the exact same situation as you are, perhaps even slightly worse. Though there are many advices saying true 'love' is worth waiting for, my advice is, if she is not keen, dont wait. Unless she gave a very direct positive answer that she needs time, and hope you wait for her, then do so. If not, dont waste your time.</p>
              <p>I waited for this girl for 2 years, and just 1 day she comes and tell me she has already someone in mind. Once you hear that, i will guarantee that your heart will sink like there is no bottom. Its a gamble, and a really risky one. There is no 'confirm-chop' that after so long, her heart is still with you, even more so when its not be stable yet.</p>
              <p>And its not up to you to 'do it or not'. The holding hand is still hers. 2.5 years is neither long or short. Unless you are so into her that you can never forget about her, i would say just move on. Uni is the time to study too, dont get so troubled over such stuff.</p>

              <p>there is this girl <em>(the girl who i've mentioned in my
              previous thread)</em> who told me she don't intend to get into any
              r/s during her uni life, we shared the same thinking. btw, she told
              me way before i hint her i like her. if she told me that after i
              hint her then i'll agree that that was just her excuse to tell me
              she's not interested in me. but that's not the case. i've tried to
              hint her quite a couple of times that i like her but she doesn't
              seemed to take it seriously. anyway, she's evergreen.</p>
              <p>looks like i'm only going to take action after we graduate,
              which is 2.5 years from now. however, some of my friends said this
              is a foolish decision cus most probably she'll be attached by then
              since she's kinda cute and guys like cute girls. there are ought to
              be some guys who will try to woo her and eventually she might
              succumb to one of them during these few years in uni.</p>
