I don't think you can go on and blame ur mum for shielding/protecting/restricting her, because let's face it, ur sis is at an age where most teenagers are rebellious.<br><br>Its true what they say.

            <div class='col-md body'>Slapping her surely won't do... As you see her mother is backing her up, by doing that, you will only make your position unfavourable.<br>Help her most likely is impossible since your sister sounds like those stubborn type, if so, obviously she would not listen to you, let alone talking about her problems, only your parents can help her. Do you parents know about your sister situation in school, if not talk with your parents about it. Might encounter some difficulties if the 'prositute situtation' happen just recently.<br><br>If not, for me, I would pick a few actions (my brother last time also like that):<br><br>1) Hide/destroy/wadever things you or your family consider bad or give to a friend you trust to take care first. Let your sister poke as much as she like. As time goes and she find nothing to complain, she will eventually back off. Be careful though, she might change target to something else.<br>Note: To me, I think give a friend is a bad idea, cause normally I don't easily trust others. If not careful, might make your life outside miserable.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>2) Since she know your sg forum ID or check your computer, then make another sg forum account don't let her know your ID. Clear all your internet browsing history, so she can't check what website u visited or u do on the net.<br><br>3) Ignore her at all cost/if possible. Don't talk to her unnecessary, if really a must, make it short. Like that she will sense that you are really angry with her and she might refrain from interfering with your business.<br><br>4) Endure, never quarrel/fight with her. Nothing good will come out of it since your mother is backing her up. The more you fight with her and got scold by your mother, the more happy she is and naturally she will continue search your stuffs to make her happy. Ever heard before this quotation? "I learned my lesson never to fight with pigs; I get dirty, besides the pigs like it."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Yup, tolerate even if she tell your mother about you and stuff, just tell yourself "Ok, I lose this round cause i never cover up my 'secrets' properly, there will not be a next time", treat it like a game of hide and seek. You hide stuffs, she seek.<br><br>I used this tactics when the times my brother act like your sister, yea my mother also use to back my brother up. I also learned something when last time my mother used to scold me and we would quarrel about it.<br>The solution is keep quiet, let her finish what she say, don't interrupt, you interrupt she say you talk back and scold even longer. Surprising, it works. If I defend myself from my mum scolding it, the scolding can last to maximum up to 1hrs+ or worst up to the next day <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> , if never say anything it, it only last less than 20 mins. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Act good boy during this period of time, at the back you can be as naughty as you want, just cover it properly.<br><br>Main idea is cover your tracks properly. Keep your mouth close, don't talk   unnecessary. Be rational/cool at all times. All the problems will fly away <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> , though I sounds like trying to help people become a naughty boy and won't get caught.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>All these my past experiences and the most appopriate solutions that i can think of, may or may not work depends on individual, but worth a try.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

If not, tell her you feel wat she is doing is wrong. Like how will she feel if it was the other way round. Pretend to be her friend like dat. ...than see how. If it does not work, yeah than treat her like some invisble ghost. </div></blockquote>There is another thing: Shev is a guy, and he is dealing with a girl.
