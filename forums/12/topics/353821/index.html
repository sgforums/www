              <div id="post-2135554" class="postcolor">really need help... i signed up a photo package with a company ( i duno why i did that) for 4k and i really regretted like hell. I just gave in to their hardsell tactic... (yes it is my fault) and the next day i went down to request for a refund although i know on the T&amp;C stated clearly non refundable. Like what i expected, they refused to do so stating that i signed the T&amp;C. i'm at a loss now. What should I do. Since i signed the contract, can CASE still help? Any similar experiences? I did not use anything stated in the package yet. I just merely took all the photos back during the trial photoshoot. I wanted to discuss with them to settle amiacably eg, I will pay full for the trial instead of taking it free or sign up another package for a lower value but they refused kept insisting on T&amp;C. PLS HELP. can anyone advise? does the 3-day cooling period apply for this case? i read the website abt it and the terms they use is too "legal" to understand. Hope someone can help me. </div>

              <p><strong>Would consumers be able to cancel contracts under the Act? <br><br></strong>MTI has gazetted regulations to allow for cancellation of time share and direct sales contracts within a 3-day cooling off period (excluding Sat, Sun and public holidays). The cooling off period is specifically targeted at situations where the consumer is subjected to high-pressure sale tactics. During the cooling-off period, consumers should review their purchasing decision and, if they decide to cancel the contract, give the trader notice of cancellation in the manner provided under the Regulations. <br><br>In the event that the consumer encounters an unfair practice in the course of a time share or direct sales transaction, he would still be able to commence action under the Act and seek civil remedies. He may also exercise any other rights of action he may have under any other law, for example, contract or tort law. This is irrespective of whether the 3-day cooling off period has lapsed.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>i dare not let my bf / family know they will kill me i went there myself. I even tell them that i am financially strapped and signed w/o thinking and when I went home to see the photos carefully it was really not up to standard and i went back to compare it with other co i feel overcharged. No matter what i say oso no use. Basically when i went there, the person only replied T&amp;C say NON REFUNDABLE these 2 words during my half hr conversation there. But i saw a file with them saying "PENDING CANCELLATION" with a few customers' profile... so i thot got hope but in the end.... i'm waiting for the mgr who actually sold me this thing to call although hopes not high. Cry oso no use to them i think</p></div>
