              <p>follow what Stoat says, you can lodge claim with small claims tribunal</p>
              <p>yr case will fall under the consumer protection act, more specifically</p>
              <p><strong>"12.</strong> Taking advantage of a consumer by
              exerting undue pressure or undue influence on the consumer to enter
              into a transaction involving goods or services." under 2nd schedule</p>
              <p>I'm not sure what's the current duration of the cancellation period, but since you went back the next day, I'm quite sure you should fall within the time frame.</p>

              <div>really need help... i signed up a photo package with a company ( i duno why i did that) for 4k and i really regretted like hell. I just gave in to their hardsell tactic... (yes it is my fault) and the next day i went down to request for a refund although i know on the T&amp;C stated clearly non refundable. Like what i expected, they refused to do so stating that i signed the T&amp;C. i'm at a loss now. What should I do. Since i signed the contract, can CASE still help? Any similar experiences? I did not use anything stated in the package yet. I just merely took all the photos back during the trial photoshoot. I wanted to discuss with them to settle amiacably eg, I will pay full for the trial instead of taking it free or sign up another package for a lower value but they refused kept insisting on T&amp;C. PLS HELP. can anyone advise? does the 3-day cooling period apply for this case? i read the website abt it and the terms they use is too "legal" to understand. Hope someone can help me. &lt;!--IBF.ATTACHMENT_2135554--&gt;</div>

              <p>when the telemarketer called me i asked 101 qns and i really took it that it is trying to promote its company through word of mouth and strictly no selling of products or scam... i have heard of Naughty by nature who forces customers to sign up thats y i asked 101 qns and was assured 101% but it still happened. Its my stupidity! can i just go there tell them i want to pay in full ask them to void my instalment and swipe as full payment? I'm quite sure it won't go through as the limit won't be immediately restored but I'm abit afraid that they will sue me or refuse to let me go and stuff. They took my i/c to photocopy the other day too tell me it is for membership purposes although I didn't want to provide that time.</p>

              <p>i paid via credit card 12mths instalment. they covered their ass very well... in T&amp;C it says i signed under no duress that kind of thing. they will sure say they din force me to sign blah blah. i dun wan to go to extreme like to go court over this which will even cost me more i think.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>when the telemarketer called me i asked 101 qns and i really took it that it is trying to promote its company through word of mouth and strictly no selling of products or scam... i have heard of Naughty by nature who forces customers to sign up thats y i asked 101 qns and was assured 101% but it still happened.

              <p><br>In that case, then don't feel regret and allow your finances to run wild for THIS ONE TIME and go and enjoy whatever photo package you have paid for.</p>
              <p>And next time, don't entertain any telemarketers. Like me, I usually just put down the phone if I received any phone call from strangers....because I'm afraid...so I usually hang up the phone very very slowly.........until the phone handle make a klutz sound upon impact with the phone itself. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Is this a photography studio that offers makeover or something? If so I think I have heard similar complains before but cannot really recall where...(pardon me on this).

              <p><br>I think more likely you are still trying to save yourself.</p>
              <p>Even if you had suggested going to papers on the goodwill of saving alot of people from this scam, you are still trying to save your own skin but this time you tried to gather the support of many strangers to save your own skin.</p>
              <p>I don't think it's right if you want to do that, regardless of how "righteous" you want to make it sound like.</p>
              <p>People who don't know how to stop will only keep pushing themselves to become the very people that they had disliked.</p>
              <p>What difference do you have left when compared you with the people who had scammed you?</p>
              <p>You are also trying to scam a bunch of strangers by using them to stage a situation to save your own skin. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>I'm so disappointed with you.</p>
