(Can say a thousand of I love you, yet when you show them sincerely, its like saying a thousand of them in one shot). Your expectation is natural - we are expect our love to love us in equal. (It is called the Great Balance) But generally in reality, this Great Balance is seldom applicable.<br><br>You are the silent suffering type - you are dis-satisfied yet you do not wish to pressure and or enlighten her on your part. Probably you had tried to do something, but to your disappointment, its not working, therefore you decide to keep mum until you explode, like now.<br><br>There is a fine line difference between foolish tolerence and tolerence. We should accept our partner's short-coming gracefully and improve one another. This tolerence is what we constantly work for. Foolish Tolerence is to remain silent when issues are affecting the relationship. Without proper communication over a vast period of time - where the damage is, it is difficult to see and repair them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Please do not see love as a form of suffering (Astro mode: Possible Moon affliction with Saturn).<br><br>Thinking of breaking up yet unsure if it is the correct decision? Why not throw in a GENUINE chance for your relationship and adopt other ways of solving your crisis, if previous methods don't work. Of course, the main thing is to let her know what's wrong and see if she is willing to work <strong>together</strong> with you and bring the relationship into new heights - the so called Soul Talk Communication.<br><br>You want to make that break-up decision, however, if she wants to work for it, shouldn't you give her a chance to prove it as well? Of course, if she show half-heartedness, forget it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: The most important aspect in a relationship is when the other half willing to throw in genuine effort to make it work. All is possible with chance and the effort. I say, until after you gone through this phrase, before you can truly say 'I have no more regrets; I did what I can to save our relationship.'<br><br>Cheers</div>
