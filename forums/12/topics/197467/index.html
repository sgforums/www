            <div class='col-md body'>It's good that you bothered to start a topic on this, it shows that you care, at least. A little worry helps, just not too much. There's hope yet.<br><br>If you cannot concentrate on studying, try doing it in a group. Get people who actually study though, else it'll end up just being another fun outing.<br><br>Otherwise, like someone said earlier, do TYS / exercises. Reading is more boring than doing! And when you get stuck at an exercise, refer to notes and learn.<br><br>I'm sure you can do it, even if I failed to. Haha. -scuff-</div>

I can't let this carry on, there is not much time left for me.<br><br>And in sch, I still haven really fit into my class. Their thinking and my thinking are way too different.<br><br>What should I do to be able to consistently revise my studies?<br><br>PS : Each time I come here and post something, is during my free time or in between breaks while studying.</div></blockquote>it's june.... You still got time, better cram on those subjects that you really suck at. Those you can confirm can get As or Bs, leave them to revise later. Drink that chicken essence if it helps and it really helps if you revise with a buddy (make sure its a studying buddy, not a lets slack and play LAN buddy).<br><br>Also, it will help you set a goal. You aim to be in JC, get below 16. If not, aim for a staisfactory mark to your goal. 'O' level seems tough now, but just you wait till you see what's over head.<br><br>BTW, what's your school's best 'O' level? I remember I was so happy to get top 3 in my school but later learnt I ranked 172652 national average.... lol.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>do some self-hypnosis.<br>Look in to the mirror, concentrate, look into your own eyes in the mirror, tell yourself how important is your studies.(in the first place, you must really think that it's important).<br>And then try to take away things that will probably distract you, like take away all the recent magazines you bought, shut down your PC, make it like the only thing you can do is to read the books, you cant do anything else.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dead_Man_Inc,  alot of good advice given above. But i just want to say that O levels is not chicken feed and that you need to study hard to pass. People from RI, HCI also need to put in the effort in order to pass.<br><br>I'm glad that you know that you have to begin working hard right now. This is a good start. Keep it up, keep it up.<br><br>Now you need to translate that into action. I believe once you get into the groove of studying, you will feel much better. You will get through each day enjoying the satisfaction that comes from the knowledge that you have done something positive and productive. You will be solving the problem at hand (O levels) rather than letting it snowball and eventually overcome you. I tell you, the feeling is empowering. Guarantee you like this kind of feeling.<br><br>So continue to cultivate your motivation to study. Remember that your competitors are working hard and that the clock is always running down. As for how to study, I can only say that you have to discover for yourself what is best. Give yourself say TWO WEEKS to experiment what works for you. Then settle down into your favourite routine.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Things to consider:<br><br><strong>1) Study with good friends who work hard OR study alone</strong><br><br>Try both out and see which option produces better results. Your one and only measure of effectiveness should be the quality of your study at the end of the day.<br><br>Sometimes I study with friends because we help reinforce one another's knowledge. I find that very effective for some subjects. We spend abt 25% of the time on study breaks and having meals and 75% of the time with our faces buried in our notes or discussing our coursework. We study from morning 9am to about about 11pm at night.<br><br>Sometimes I study myself because that day I simply feel I need to be alone to concentrate. Normally the subject im working on that day requires alot of memory work.<br><br><strong>2) Study location. </strong><br><br>Where to go? Preferably not noisy places like macdonalds or possibly faraway places like the Changi airport. Find somewhere nearby that is quiet and peaceful. In school or in the vicinity of school or home. I alternate between school library and the voiddeck near my home.<br><br>Close to exam period, my library will be totally packed with students studying for exams and this gives me motivation to study as well. It also reminds me that i am not alone during those difficult times. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>When i study at the voiddeck it is because im too lazy to travel to school or i want to study alone that day.<br><br><strong>3) Study timing</strong><br><br>Whether more effective during the day or in the evening. Find out when you are most effective and allocate the time slot to subjects that require most attention.<br><br><strong>4) Study Plan</strong><br><br>No two ways about it. All things being equal, people who lay down a study plan do better than those who do not. A study plan allows you to have a sense of purpose when you wake up in the morning. No more uncertainty about how you are going to spend the day.<br><br>Right away you know what you need to study each day. No time wasted thinking about what you WANT to study because you know what you NEED to study already.<br><br></div>
