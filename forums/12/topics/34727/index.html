In that way, perhaps people will begin to think of the word stubborn as you being to persistence and refusing to budge and compromise on your own position.<br><br>We live with others on this small planet (or even smaller Singapore), so population density quite high and we really cant isolate ourselves and not interact.

It is good that they have the courage and are honest to tell you about your problem. it's good to be stubborn sometimes because sometimes it's also known as determination.. but too stubborn is not good because if you are too stubborn, you do everything your own way and you won't listen to other people's good points, this is where it starts to get bad.<br></div>
