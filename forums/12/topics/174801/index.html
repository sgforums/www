Even if you disown and disregard him as your bro, you'll never be able to change the fact that the same blood flows inside both of you.<br><br>Make is sound nastier, if she is such a B|tch, then be glad that she's no longer with you but your bro.<br><br>Sorry, I'm not the sympatic type but I am sure my words makes sense.
