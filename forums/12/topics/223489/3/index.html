Keep up the good work.</strong><br><br>like learning a computer software, language, or subject,<br>being a interesting person is also the same thing. you have to learn. <strong>- Trying my best.</strong><br><br>the learning process involves, observations, reflections, writing down ideas in paper, creating hypothesis, reading books on related topics to learn from others, practising conversing. and then u improve bit by bit. <strong>- Belive me, all the countless hours of training and hardwork, when you're on the battlefield, you go with your instints, though the training comes in use once in awhile.</strong><br><br>being quiet and boring is not a crime. there should not be any tinge of guilt or low self esteem in yourself. <strong>- Trying my best to switch that mentality.</strong><br><br>it is also not a big deal. humans must always be grateful in life especially when you have health, no need to worry about food and shelter everyday.<br>singaporeans are too greedy, always worrying about small issues of life and fail to appreciate the good things that they have. <strong>- I'm going to put it bluntly and simple, which human on earth does not greed? No offence, I know that some monks do too. If there isn't greed in you, you wouldn't have learnt to improve youself and typed the first few sentences as you just did. You just got used to it, that's all but still, there's greed.</strong><br><br>worry and cry over issues like friendship, love, lack of money, pride and facial issues. you all really need to grow up and see the world. extreme poverty and poverty is still quite common around the world. <strong>- Even poor folks need friends. Don't you agree?</strong><br><br>do you all know that about hundred of thousands of poor latin amercians have to illegal migrate to north america every year (not sure of figures) because they have not jobs in their countries. when they reach mexico and some countires without passort which were confiscated or they did not have it, they were bullied, hit and mistreated by some of the police. <strong>- Sorry to be rude, it's sad but that's their nation's problem, nothing to do with us and nothing to do with my current problem. </strong><br><br>i only learn about these after i watch from the discovery channel titled "no borders".  <strong>- Didn't catch that.</strong><br><br>that is the problem with cities people like singapore. worrying and complaining non bread and butter issues. that sadly to say is human nature. however, because it can be changed, i am here to educate you people. <strong>- So you want people to argue over bread and butter issues instead of emotional issues? Look who's the greedy one here? You? Changing people? Look, this is how wars usually break out, trying to change another nation's beliefs and stuff, why not compromise? I belive our modern generation is well imbued with education, if you could help it, just safe yourself the hassle. </strong></div>

Many a times while I'm alone, I've told myself that I've manage to conquer loneliness because I've conquered many things in life but nevertheless, I knew I was lying to myself... "<br><br>I've coped many a times with said "loneliness" myself. That was say, during my secondary school days? (I'm your age btw, prolly can see from your pov.)<br>It was hell. Trying to adjust, finding company who could fit your personality, interest whatsoever. 4 years man. I wonder how I managed that really.<br><br>Fortunately, I've dealt with my problem, and I hope you can deal with it yourself too.<br><br>To start it off, I threw my perspectives to a whole new shape altogether. Remember that you are unique and you don't have to be anything else just to fit in. Instead, take the lead. You have many many things in question really, "life long companion" "girlfriend", can seriously wait. you're (we're) only 20, no one knows what life holds for us.<br><br>If you don't like the way things are going, DO SOMETHING NEW. and EXCITE yourself. Pick up a hobby, sport, and be enthusiastic about it. Something you can be passionate about and find something in common with others.<br><br>Seriously it's gonna be a very long post if I go on, drop me a pm if you'd like. Till then, life's about fun. love's about sharing 2 balanced lives with one another, not "needing" it.<br><br>Cheers bro</div>
