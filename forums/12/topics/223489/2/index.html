            <div class='col-md body'>hey biteme..same situation here.Althought i can say ive got a bunch of good friends both in the army and sec sch etc.For me when im with my good friends i can act very stupid and spontaneous,but in front of strangers or others that im not so familiar with,im very subdued.So much to the point that one of my dumb sergeants asked if i got an attitude problem.U talk about loyalty to friends, basic manners and a sense of compromise..these are the traits i value very much too.But sadly to say not everyone does.In fact i can say im 99% like you,with the number of girls i know being countable in a single hand,and some people even used to think i was gay  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> .I used to think that this world isnt fair,but i have come to accept it and take things one at a time.Living everything to fate.
