            <div class='col-md body'>well i guess every1 feels the same at some pt of time in their lives . U may feel lonely n frens surrounding u r limited . So what if u hav lots of frens who r jus simply frens who come n go . Can u imagine u put in effort , time to try to maintain the frenship as time goes after u grad from sch n onli to find out the other party simply don care as well as u do ? I mean in life , there r alot ppl come n go , true frenship is something which comes hard n rare . So far in my own life i had alot of disappointment of frens who simply came n disappeared .<br><br>Mayb coming to forum is the 1st place u can open urself . Being invisible n talking behind a computer has its tranquil effect . Mayb u can join online games to widen ur social circles as well as to find another hobby ?</div>
