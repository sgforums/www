            <div class='col-md body'>Hey man, it's not either's fault. You had said that you did alot of things for her. Ask urself, do u feel wat u did for her is worth? When comes to love, it's always one party give more than the other, it's hardly equal...because u love her so much, u r willing to "suffer"? She had 15 failed r/s n yet she's wif u for 5 yrs. I feel she's very lucky to have u as her bf.<br><br>How old is she? It seems that she needs a lot of pampering...A couple should tell  their feelings towards each other e.g wat u lik n dun lik wat she does, etc. Give feedback, understand each other's needs n lastly compromise. A r/s never works on just one sided's hard work. Even a clap needs two hands...go n have nice talk wif her, finds out why she reacts tis n tat way. Then think of ur own side too. How long u could put up wif her tantrums, etc? If u think u could do it for ur rest of ur life, maybe it's time for u to leave her. I guess she will wake up n learn.<br><br>Good Luck ~<br><br></div>

Be careful you don't fall for a "lady-boy" or one of the "scam" girls. A nice office worker Thai girl is ok. Those you meet at the bars and massage parlors are no-nos.</div>

Anything more than that are usually reiterated lessons. Fifteen exes? That's probably akin to retaining PSLE for ten times.<br><br>Her negative nature truly reflects the glooming aspect of her love relationship - emitting and attracting negative influence and people.<br><br>It's true that after those 'ordeals' she might have evolved, but seriously, from what you have described, I see none of it.<br><br>Your fear and happiness isn't because you have lost her - but because you are afraid to be alone. Probably this is the quality that got connected on higher subconscious level - negativity beget negativity. You have forgotten what's is like to trend forward and fight for a better future, therefore you rather endure the nonsense thrown precariously at you, than to understand the essence of what's better for yourself to make you move on.<br><br>It really makes me wonder is that even love in the first place.<br><br>You will be surprised that people remained in unfulfilling relationship for all sorts of reasons. And when you question them about love, they are unable to find them. Like clicking on the search option to find a missing file; there are always zero returns, even though the computer appeared to be working.<br><br>Many people complained about not getting the returns even after selling their entire soul into the relationship. The ultimate question is WHY are YOU even thinking that hard work equate success in love? I have addressed this before in previous topics - if hard work equal automatic success in relationship, then the most hardworking person would have all the love in the world.<br><br>Logically, it doesn't work that way and it will never be.<br><br>Therefore you always pick calculated battles that will advance you to the next level in love. You address the root of problem and not do things that merely appease short term. The rotten core will eventually spread its poison to the heart of your relationship and kills it. Merely polishing the exterior doesn't do anything to save it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
