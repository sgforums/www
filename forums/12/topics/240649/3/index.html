For a man, career success is very important. There are many other important things also, like character, attitude, outlook, but career success and money must never be overlooked. If you have money, 80-90% of your problems are solved. If money is not important, there won't be ppl jumping off mrt tracks becoz they cant pay their debts.<br><br>No self respecting girl is going to stick with a guy who has nothing in life.</div>
