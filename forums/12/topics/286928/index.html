            <div class='col-md body'>I am posting on behalf of my girlfriend because she seemed stressed about this. It may be kind of long, so please bear with it.<br><br>She had 3 friends, N, D and K. N has no boyfriend. D and K had boyfriends. Somehow or other, K and D were cold to her because she spent time with me more than she spent time with them. They told her that she once told them that she would spend time with them and now that she is attached to me, she spends little time with them.<br><br>They are angry that she spends time with me and neglecting them. Another thing is that she is supposed to meet them two weeks ago. N could not make it and that left D K and her. She decided to meet me after my recovery period as I just came out from hospital. D and K were bringing their BFs along and she felt left out and because I was just released from the hospital, she came to see me. Because of this, they were angry.<br><br>She tries to sms or talk nicely to them but they try to tell her harsh things or tell her that things would get worse if they talk. K even said that friends would be more important than boyfriends and it should apply to my girlfriend too.<br><br>I wonder how to salvage the situation when her friends fail to see her side of the story and that they keep making harsh and sacarstic comments to her. She wants to go out with them to hopefully make things go better but I warned her that she would get the cold treatment from them and it would not bode well for her.<br><br>I hope there can be some suggestions on what to do because she is very stressed and pressurized by this issue. I tried to tell her to wait for them to cool down before messaging them again or even to talk things out.<br><br>What are your points of view? Any advice to give? Thank you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Get new friends lar.. That kind of friends, are fair weather friends. Its like, you have alot of money, these people friend friend you, when you no money, they would even not hesitate to spit on you. Real friends are people who standby you whether you got boyfriend or not, neglect neglect lor, they her parents ar? Wan your gf to greet them everytime she see them anot?<br><br>Don't give way to them, it only allows them to think they are higher social status than you and will only time to time show some f up attitude to keep ur self esteem low.<br><br>Show them that you don't need them, live a quality and fulfilling life with you and your girlfriend, spike them when they see you, don't do it purposely, just love each other more everyday. You can most propably expect 2 things to happen, either they do more stunts to you and your gf, or they come begging to be friends with you again.<br><br>This method has no disadvantages. It only serve to strengthen your r/s with your gf. Live for yourself, don't live for others.<br><br>*the above comments is a direct solution assuming you'r telling the truth based on your story.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There aren't a need to meet up with friends regularly but can remain in contact via msn or occasionally drop a sms to ask how their day. Very good friends do not have to be there everyday but could be there when they need help. Her F/s with them are not mutually strong in the first place and can't reach a mutual understanding from both parties<br><br>Nmd lah, if they are really friends and they do treasure the friendship. I'm sure that they will be fine. Human are werid de. After a while, then they discover that this friendship is important. Ask ur gf to continue life as normal. Occasionally send greeting sms and asking them how are they loh. If they still like that, then let them be lah. Probably, she is better off focusing her energy on something else.<br><br></div>
