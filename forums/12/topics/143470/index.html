            <div class='col-md body'>I remembered that sometimes ago I posted something which was about a lousy thread about being attitude and things like that.<br><br>Okay...here goes my story. This girl who joined my department for around 1 month.  Still a fresh graduate and started working since last July. My first impression of her was like...."All girls are almost the same" and why should I give her or the rest of the new comers a heck?<br><br>But slowly, things changed and my impression of her also changed. Went for a department gathering drinking session. Got the chance to talk to her for like an hour or 2. Found out some of her interest as in the kind of music and things like that. Well, her background and everything is about the same as I am.<br><br>Halfway through the drinking session, I was having a headache and wanted to leave early for him. And at the same time she too had the intention of going home early. So both of us walked to the nearest MRT. Although I wanted to hail a cab and send her home but she refused and said that train is good enough and its still early. So I just get on the same train as her but never sent her home.<br><br>I did give her a call when I reached my destination just to make sure that she is safe and sound home.  That was the least i could do.<br><br>Well, I don't know? Sudddenly I kept talking about her with my other male colleages and things like that. So I came up with the oldest trick and the lamest trick. To pretend that I sms the wrong person.<br><br>I SMS her...Hey John(One of my collueage) do not forget about the dinner tonight at 7 pm. And she replied, I am XXXX I think u got the wrong person.<br><br>And so I replied...ohhh sorry got the wrong person. I am XXXX.  And her replied was " Ohh so u meeting John for dinner ah? Enjoy your dinner ...<br><br>Well, the next day I saw her and she came to me and said Hello to me while i was walking to office. I was totally shocked and do not know what to say to her when I saw her and my heart was jumping soooo damn fast. And almost spill out about the sms thingy. Oh my god! Why am I behaving like this???<br><br>I tend to think too much about the following..<br><br>1- She is a grad I am not (Well...will be on in few months time)<br>2- What if the rest of the people knows?<br>3- What if her boss knows that I am after her?<br>4- What if she is just friendly?<br>5- What if she rejects me and we are still in the same office?<br>6- We are like kind of from different world?<br><br>Am I thinking too much? Sometimes the feeling of racing heart and the feeling of liking someone do not come that easily. As for me its been one whole year since I have felt this. So I do not know what should I really do about this right now man?<br><br>I remembered from the Fantastic 4 movie...the Invisible girl was telling the rubber man. "THE PROBLEM WITH YOU IS THAT YOU THINK TOO MUCH AND THERE IS NO ACTION FROM YOU"<br></div>
