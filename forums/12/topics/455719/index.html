              Hello i do not know what really happen to me. This started since last year when i am still working in the office last year. Where i started doing weird thing like using a pen to keep scratching on my both hand, unable to sleep well and having suicide thought. Soon i was out of job. After about two months of jobless. It got worst. I started to have suicide thought at certain night when i awoke from sleep after thinking of sad things... I went for some interview but were demoralised after days of waiting.
              
              I started to feel out of breath, agitated such as punching once at my living room wall, throwing sofa.
              
              I also told my dog not to be greedy, walking around as well as attempt to kick, throw sofa or lifting chair but i stop myself in time as I love my dog.
              
              I also get agitated when my dad call home to inform me of job opening. Which i told him i find a job myself and hang up without letting my dad finish speaking.
              
              I hide in my room and fear other knowing im at home on a weekdays. When my mom call out my name to talk or ask me a question. I get agitated sometime to the extent to make my mom sad and commented im unfillial... My mom is a sensitive person.
              
              I do not like to open my mouth on weekday when everyone is working.
              
              I am back to normal on weekend. But will still felt agitated when my family bring up issues to me being jobless. Or matter that deem me stupid. Such as when my brother reprimand me on placing slice of bread on top of small dining plate into the oven, and i would argue back and lead to quarrel over such small issues.
              
              Whenever i felt agitated, i felt the heat and shortness of breath.
              
              I do not know why i behave like this, it just happen.
              
              Im planning to get a referral letter to govt hospital specialist. But once i start seeing and diagnose with this, i will have to declare on jobs hunting and also to my nsmen until medical officer.
              
              Another worry about visiting specialist is financial problems. I know that each visits will cost over $100. And the medicines arent cheap too.
              
              And my family would be heartbroken if i am really suffering from this.

              <p>Look, psychiatry business is a sham. They try to make people think they are crazy so that they can boost more business for the big pharma companies that sell anti-depressant drugs.</p>
              <p>DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON PSYCHIATRIC MEDICINE AND CONSULTATION !</p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong with you. I can bet you for sure, anybody who has lost thier job or being jobless for months, will feel depressed. Its a normal human emotional behaviour.</p>
              <p>Symphathize with your situation. But you have to ask yourself, what are you goint to do to alleviate your situation?</p>
              <p>You should pick up a book about writing resume or interviews to improve your chances. Look up the job ads, apply via internet or newspaper. With all the time you have, you got to prepare yourself for interviews. Go out there and buy some nice office shirt and tie to make yourself presentable. You should also consider what job is key fit to you. Maybe you have been applying to jobs that don't fit you or you lack the experience. Or perhaps your job is not in big demand in spore due to outsourcing. So you have to seek the alternatives. Or maybe your asking salary is too high. Go analyse.</p>
              <p>In the mean time if you are free, you should spend some time in charitable work, go look up.</p>
              <p>I know its hard. I would if I am in your shoes but you will find a way out. This is all about hope.</p>

              <p>I can't say "don't feel that way" if you feel it. I can't say "don't think of suicide" if the thought comes in. I can't say "don't be sad" when you feel it.That is you. That is how you react to circumstances. That is how your current circumstances affect you.</p>
              <p>But there's one thing I ask you to do, and it would not cost you anything; and for sure won't have the side effects that anti-psychotic drugs have.:-) And your future employer, your family and friends, once they learn about it, will admire you instead than think bad of you.</p>
              <p>Ok, everytime you feel so down and hopeless, this is what you should do - THINK and say it if you must, and BELIEVE THIS statement:</p>
              <p>                              "THIS TOO SHALL PASS."</p>
              <p>Everything in this world passes, so you bet your troubles will pass.; especially if you don't stop doing something to be productive. To be productive does not mean one always has to have a job. You can be productive even without the job yet. It would help if you start reading inspirational stories that could make you think how you could turn your situation inot something inspirational as well, not only for you but for others too, who are in the same situation.</p>

              <p>Precisely awesome in most of the circumstances. Try attending yoga classes, go for meditation session, participate charitable works, like helping your family house work, physical exercises, community charitable works, shopping and other group activities would be helpful. Think compassionately, charitably and positively in you and others always...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The hundreds or thousands of dollars spent to get 'some therapy' is meaningless if you can't get rid off of the emotional cage you set it up in yourself. Listen: there are people who will hate us, and some things in life that add pressures to our lives, and the only thing you can counteract against such is to get out of that negative thinking of yours and find things to do. It can be doing housechores, a simple jog at the park, or <em>anything </em>that diverts you from being alone. You will slowly gain a different perspective if you know how to control yourself from dwelling too much into negativity.</p></div>

              <p>If you're going to spend money on psychiatric treatment, might as well spend the money on yoga lessons. Its cheaper.</p>
              <p>One thing about yoga lessons you need to know. The lessons would not do anything for you. They are for you to learn the practice. Practice daily at home. That's where you get the health benefits.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>By JALELAH ABU BAKER</strong></p>
              <p>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p>SELF-MUTILATION can become a lifelong habit for troubled young people, counsellors and psychiatrists have told The Straits Times.</p>
              <p>  They were speaking in the wake of a rise in cases spotted by THe Samaritans of Singapore.</p>
              <p>  Youngsters experiencing stress or personal problems sometimes hurt themselves by cutting their skin or burning parts of their bodies.</p>
              <p>  And the experts said this predisposition invariably becomes a deep-seated habit.</p>
              <p>  "I've never seen a case where the person 'completely stps' doing it," said Mr Mohd Yusof Ismail, chief executive of the Ain Society for troubled youth.</p>
              <p>  "They may stop for a while, but will start again when they face other problems or stress. But if the cuts are less deep, then there is improvement."</p>
              <p>  Mr Mohd Yusof, who has worked with young people for about 20 years, was one of eight experts who spoke to The Straits Times about the trend highlighted by the Samaritans of Singapore on Monday. The organisation said it had been receiving growing numbers of e-mail messages from young people who were harming themselves.</p>
              <p>  Some had cut, bit and even burned parts of their body - often in places where the wounds would not be easily spotted, such as the thighs, inner arms and hips.</p>
              <p>  Typically, the self-mutilation starts with cutting before progressing to burning or tattooing.</p>
              <p>  Trouble at home is often the trigger, said the experts, and the tendency can go hand-in-hand with other conditions such as eating disorders and depression.</p>
              <p>  Keeping sharp objects out of reach is only part of the solution, said Dr Carol Balhetchet, director of youth services at the Singapore Children 's Society.</p>
              <p>  "The problem is not outside in, but inside out," said the psychologist of 22 years.</p>
              <p>  "They feel they have no control of their lives. It is their way of releasing their emotional pain to something outward and physical."</p>
              <p>  Samaritans of Singapore does not track numbers of cases over the years, but a spokesman said it noticed an increase between last April and this March.</p>
              <p>  She added that the organisation tries to help individuals in ways that fit their personal needs.</p>
              <p>  "We may ask them to come in for counselling or refer them to the relevant organisation for more specific support."</p>
              <p>  While the experts interviewed by The Straits Times had not seem a significant rise in self-mutilation cases, they said there was a greater awareness of the issue among teachers, parents and even the young people themselves.</p>
              <p>  Child psychiatrist Brian Yeo said many of them are curable, as they are "still in touch with reality". He has treated youngsters who have gone on to beat the habit.</p>
              <p>  "Ultimately, it's stress-related," he said. "They learn alternative ways of stress relief."</p>
              <p>  But not all of them learn to cope with their emotions in a healthier way.</p>
              <p>  One 16-year-old girl, who started cutting herself with a penknife four years ago, told The Straits Times that it was "impossible" to stop once you start".</p>
              <p>  "The pain distracts me from the emotional strain and pain I go through," she said.</p>
              <p>  The teenager, who did not want to be named, said she does not get along with her parents, especially her mother. The family is receiving counselling.</p>
