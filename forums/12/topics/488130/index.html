              <p>How will you feel if you were me?</p>
              <p>When going out with my husband and my husband's buddies of 20 + years and their wives,</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">1) The wives don't talk to me unless I talk to them but usually is just Q &amp; A sessions. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> 2) One of my husband's buddy has a Bimbo wife (call him X), always dress up like she is a model and some high class chic. One day, as usual during an outing, she dressed up like she is some Miss Singapore Universe, my hubby's buddy ask my hubby to bring some ice cream for his bimbo wife. (Like what the hell ?! So are average girls ok with that??) </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> 3) This X, at times for whatever reason, will raise his voice at me. Got one time, when X and his Bimbo Wife sat in our car and as I saw that my seat was pushed too far back, I asked them are they ok, feel comfortable or not if not I adjust my seat, my husband said in a rude voice, 'no need' and then X added in another rude voice, ' no need la'. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> 4) One day, we go to pub to chill, after that, I casually asked my hubby whether we sitting in X's car, my hubby say, 'still sit in his car?' Then X raised his voice at me, 'No la, not sitting in my car !' (Cos X fetched us to the Pub in the first place so I thought he was going to fetch us back too). </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> 5) And that was not a once in a while thing, it was quite frequent whenever I attend the outing. Recently, when visiting another friend for his house warming, out of friendliness, I show X a friendly smile, X gave me a 'heck care' expression. When coming to evening, X suddenly raised his voice in a rude manner at me asking, 'how is the house?! ' </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> 6)  Bimbo wife has a daughter and so I exclaimed , 'Cute daughter' and Bimbo wife threw me a nasty look. That was not an isolated case. Even I don't talk, she also throw me  nasty looks at times. 
                              
                              I may not be able to mix with other wives but I seem to have more nasty encounter with X and his Bimbo wife. 
                              
                              When I told my hubby I do not want to go out with them anymore, it will upset him and he will throw tantrums. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Haiz, but really ....... how will an average married woman react?</span></p>

              Precisely.  Don't know is my EQ is too high or I am just plain stupid.  Until today, I recall I haven't even raised my voice  back at him to retaliate.

              I  guess I  should just avoid outings with them any more. 
              
               Today I  just told my hubby, it is  absolutely ok  that he go meet them himself and don't involve me  as I  really cannot click with those girls as well.  What for going out to a supposedly  happy outing and turn out like a bullying session. lol.... haiz.

                  One time two times maybe you can say I sensitive but it is OUT OF THE BLUE type one leh. Even I many times convince myself that I was being sensitive but it isn't ! If you were me, I very sure, you go out with them only one time you will don't feel like joining them anymore. I have been going out with them several times either closing one eye or forcing myself to get over those bad experience but I end up becoming ... err... bullied (?)
                  
                  So easy for you to say cos you not in the real situation.
                  
                  Enjoy activities? Sorry la, I get headaches at times due to the weird treatments, how to enjoy, you tell me.
              
              And what do you mean by 'they don't mean to' ? You mean they don't mean to give me nasty expression and don't mean to raise voice at me rudely ? Are you kidding me?
