            <div class='col-md body'>The thing is she might be attracted to you a bit which might explain the readiness to give you her email and phone number. Either that or she's one helluva flirt, so readily give guys she just met her number and email. Important thing is you stay calm and relax and not be such a cockster whenever she's around. Its true what they said, you're young and studies come first and all, but that doesn't mean you cant have someone to be there for you when your lonely or when she's lonely. Don't have to 'sound' her even if you feel confident. Just be normal friends and gradually if its meant to be, you two will end up together. You can be protective of her, nothing is wrong. Friends mah.. She has a problem, give a lending ear. She's crying, give a lending shoulder (don't take advantage of her hehe). Just relax, keep it cool, and things should be all right.. Hope this helps..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
