              <div id="post_message_235656"><blockquote class="postcontent restore "> <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Business Times - <strong>11 Jan 2012</strong></em></span></span><br> <br> <br> Firms hit by tightened foreign worker inflows <br> <br> Construction sector is still worst hit, with 70% of contractors seriously affected: survey <br> <br> By TEH SHI NING <br> <br> (SINGAPORE) Businesses are feeling the severe pinch of tightened foreign
                   worker inflows, a recent survey shows, even as there are renewed pleas 
                  for a review of policy changes aimed at reducing Singapore's reliance on
                   foreign manpower.<br> <br> Some 45 per cent of the 251 companies polled recently by the Singapore 
                  Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry reported 'serious' or 'very 
                  serious' business repercussions from shrunken foreign labour supply. <br> <br> Woes arising from foreign labour shortages stood out as the issue 
                  weighing companies down amid a wider economic slowdown, said SCCCI 
                  secretary-general Lim Sah Soon. He thinks it no surprise that more than 
                  half of those polled now hope for a review of the foreign worker policy 
                  at the upcoming Budget 2012.<br> <br> One suggestion is for targeted tightening - to allow more foreign hiring
                   in sectors which have found it impossible to hire locals for crucial 
                  jobs despite offering higher salaries. Others seek subsidised training 
                  for foreign workers, or low-cost job-matching portals to help them find 
                  'suitable and affordable local workers', SCCCI said.<br> <br> Such appeals are not confined to SCCCI's members. Preliminary results 
                  from the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) survey of members' 
                  expectations for this year's Budget yielded similar findings. Some 40 
                  per cent of those polled seek employment assistance and human resource 
                  issues. <br> <br> 'Manpower issues, coupled with recent changes in foreign worker policies
                   and labour laws, rank high on the list of business concerns,' said SBF 
                  chief executive Ho Meng Kit. 'In sectors like construction, hospitality 
                  and manufacturing, companies still face difficulty hiring locals. It 
                  does not help that foreign labour is becoming less accessible and 
                  affordable.'<br> <br> According to the SCCCI survey, the construction sector is still worst hit, with 70 per cent of contractors seriously affected.<br> <br> And demand for workers in this sector, at least, is unlikely to ease 
                  despite the slowing economy. For its public housing building programme 
                  alone, Singapore will need about 30,000 construction workers this year, 
                  up from 18,000 last year. Cumulative demand could rise to 45,000 in the 
                  next few years, National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan said in 
                  response to MP Arthur Fong in Parliament. An employer in the 
                  construction sector is allowed to hire seven work permit holders for 
                  every full-time local employee.<br> <br> Manufacturing too, has been badly hit by the lower quotas and higher 
                  levies too, if the 67 per cent of firms indicating so in SCCCI's survey 
                  is anything to go by.<br> <br> Even for the electronics sector, whose production has shrunk in recent 
                  months, Ronnie Wong, president of the Association of Electronic 
                  Industries in Singapore (AEIS) says that member companies involved in 
                  electronics manufacturing, precision machining, parts and components 
                  assembly estimate a 10-30 per cent drop in business due to the reduction
                   in foreign workers.<br> <br> Of the services firms polled by SCCCI, a smaller 36 per cent saw a 
                  significant negative impact on business from the foreign worker policy 
                  revisions. But Mr Lim points out the ones that are crucial to the 
                  tourism sector, such as hospitality and F&amp;B players, are by nature 
                  labour intensive and have been affected, with consequences for service 
                  standards too.<br> <br> Alan Goh of Katrina Holdings, which owns several Clarke Quay restaurants
                   and the BALIthai chain, says it is hard to quantify the impact on 
                  revenue but costs have risen by 20-25 per cent due to higher foreign 
                  worker levies. Several of his chefs, who lack the qualifications that 
                  more stringent criteria for pass renewals now demand, have left 
                  Singapore, landing him in the sub-optimal situation of relying on 
                  six-month trainees with no continuity.<br> <br> Mr Goh thinks more in-depth research needs to be devoted to study the 
                  manpower needs of each sector before such policies are effected. 'There 
                  is this widespread misconception that the services sector is unwilling 
                  to pay locals more, but the truth is that locals shun these jobs for 
                  other reasons,' he says.<br> <br> The SCCCI survey indicates that other than low pay and long work hours, 
                  local workers also tend to leave or shun SMEs for better job prospects 
                  in larger companies.<br> <br> All this seems to indicate that the manpower crunch has not eased 
                  despite a weakening economy. In fact, one reason for Singapore's 
                  projected slower growth of 1-3 per cent this year is the tightened 
                  inflow of foreign workers, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in his 
                  New Year's Message. <br> <br> 'Admitting fewer foreign workers also means forgoing business 
                  opportunities and accepting slower growth,' he said, adding that this is
                   why 'we must do our utmost to raise productivity, to make up in quality
                   what we will miss in quantity'.<br> <br> Companies affected by restricted access to foreign labour are not 
                  sitting on their hands and whining about it though, SCCCI's Mr Lim says.
                   Coping mechanisms include more automation of processes, engaging 
                  sub-contractors or hiring older workers and ex-convicts. <br> <br> Some business owners have also taken pay cuts and taken on more operational roles themselves, he says.<br> <br> But there is a limit to what can be done before companies 'squeeze blood
                   from their workers'. Businesses can adapt with computerisation and 
                  factory automation, but operators are still needed and local ones can be
                   elusive, says Yeo Cheong Guan, managing-director of Eng Bee Paper 
                  Merchant, who attributes a 15-20 per cent fall in business to the policy
                   revisions.<br> <br> Citigroup economist Kit Wei Zheng finds it interesting that so many 
                  firms still face worker shortages, given that the economy, excluding 
                  biomedical manufacturing, has contracted for three quarters now.<br> <br> But this lingering labour market tightness could be good news in that it
                   suggests a 'significant buffer before the economy as a whole sheds 
                  jobs', he says.<br> <br> 'At the end of the day, the margins of firms could be squeezed and some 
                  may have to relocate out of Singapore. Worker shortages may constrain 
                  the pace of recovery, when it comes. This will be painful but is the 
                  inevitable cost of restructuring,' says Mr Kit. </blockquote></div>

              <p>hey Karriex...</p>
              <p>maybe u should get your bf to come to singapore on a social visit pass first.</p>
              <p>bring all his certs and qualifications over, then start sending out his cv here.</p>
              <p>it would seem more convincing to prospective employers that he is currently here in singapore and that his job seeking is sincere and valid.</p>
              <p>in my opinion, unless he is extremely highly skilled, he is making himself have lower chances if he is still overseas.</p>
              <p>my friend went through this before, got her american bf to come to sg and start sending out cv, he secured a job within 3 weeks.</p>
              <p>oh by the way, he can only get working visa after securing a job, if u dont know...</p>
              <p>hope that helps! wish u luck!</p>

              <p>hey Karriex...</p>
              <p>maybe u should get your bf to come to singapore on a social

              <p>bring all his certs and qualifications over, then start
              sending out his cv here.</p>
              <p>it would seem more convincing to prospective employers that he
              is currently here in singapore and that his job seeking is sincere

              <p>in my opinion, unless he is extremely highly skilled, he is
              making himself have lower chances if he is still overseas.</p>
              <p>my friend went through this before, got her american bf to come
              to sg and start sending out cv, he secured a job within 3

              <p>oh by the way, he can only get working visa after securing a

              <p>BTW, thats how the domestic workers scheme started in Singapore.</p>
              <p>In the early '80, Fillipino girls were visiting Singapore on social visit passes. Once here they got jobs as domestic helpers (maids) and had a good time too.  They save their wage and returned home with more money than when they  came. The rest is history.</p>

              <p>whatever it is, but it IS getting difficult for companies to hire foreigners since the ministry of manpower has already started to cut down the approval % rate for applications to the employment cards.<br><br>lately, many companies have already lamented to the press that the MOM has been stricter than before due to governmental political pressure. e.g. last time, 9 in 10 applications are approved. now, only 3 in 10 applications are approved.</p>
