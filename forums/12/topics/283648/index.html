            <div class='col-md body'>But apart from being rushed by the HR person....now you have the time to think....what do you think now..? Which one do you like more...?<br><br>If you really like the second offer more...just try to tell and explain to the HR about your situation. Although the contract may have specifics about termination and resignation......if the HR manager is understanding, it's not a problem. The contract depends on them, whether they want to enforce or not. If they are understanding, they will let you go without penalty.<br><br>I have experienced something similar....company let me resign without strictly following the specifics in contract.<br><br>But now you also have to understand they have the upper hand...just try to explain and seek their understanding.<br><br>One thing is...if I am you, I will probably stick with permanent job than contract job.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>

Job market is like commodities, you sell yourself with whatever you have, the market will judge your value, mostly the one who give the highest price with good benefits lured you in. Then it all up to you to perform, do not worry about contract or permanent stuff, once you work smart and hard, people will notice you, very importantly is to look at thing professionally, you work, they paid, you no work, no body paid you, as simple as that. Be professional with the right approach to working, your value will rise as time goes by, by then, you may jump ship for better benefits and paid.<br><br>Under the employement Act, an employer cannot penalise anyone out of their employment/payroll, they are not the enforcer, that is why in the contract that you sign, there cannot be a penalty for cancellation. In reverse, ask yourself, what happen if the employer suddenly do not wish to hire you even if you signed the contract with them??. Same, you cannot do anything but just say, Damn!!!
