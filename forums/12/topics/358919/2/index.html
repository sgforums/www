              achieving.<br> I just want to play the computer each day and end life

              <p>it takes time for a guy to grow, maturity, looks, and everthing else</p>
              <p>14 to 19 years old is probably the most loser stage of a guy. there are so many things you yearn for but can't achieve cos you don't have the financial capability. There are many gals that you want to flirt with but they don't care about you because you are too young and kiddish looking</p>
              <p>Endure this difficult stage and work hard to achieve something. Academic achievement is one way of becoming successful, though it's not the only way. People are materialistic, once you are rich, successful or famous, tons of people will be flocking to you.</p>

              <p>U can consider getting a diploma in games design in instituitions such as Nanyang Polytechnic. They recently secured the deal to make Playstation games!!! Sounds fun to me, too bad I cant go study anymore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U 15 only... thats too young now, study hard for your O'Levels, get good results, then u can apply for that course I've mentioned if U like.</p>

              <p>i dont understand? do u not understand my PM?</p>
              <p>but unlike you, i understand that crying to myself or whining to others will only make me feel better. but it WILL NOT change the fact that this is my life.</p>
              <p>we cant tell you what to dream and what goals to set, how do we know what u are good at, what do u like? Learn to think positively lah, ur only 15! At least your good at NOTHING, now thats something u can be proud of from today onwards.</p>

              <p>Clone, know you are going to be beaten up and all you do is come here and whine. If you had bothered to study, you will surely be able to do better than that. Come here and whine and just get yourself wack since thats what you want to anyway by not bothering to study at all.</p>
