              <p><br>Actually have you ever suspect that your friends might be secretly jealous of you because you actually got more private time and space than them?</p>
              <p>You should be happy and have goals and dreams in life because you're not an Ah Kua like the gf who likes fanta.</p>
              <p>Cos Ah Kua like the gf who likes fanta don't deserve to have goals and dreams in the life.</p>
              <p>You should be happy, think about those unfortunate people like the gf who likes fanta.</p>
              <p>You will find your own goals and dreams in life as long as you don't go and practise the Ah Kua Sheng Gong.</p>
