              <p>Clone, know you are going to be beaten up and all you do is come here and whine. If you had bothered to study, you will surely be able to do better than that. Come here and whine and just get yourself wack since thats what you want to anyway by not bothering to study at all.</p>

              <p><br>Here's a view of things:</p>
              <p>In Singapore, teens tend to start dating around 15 to 17 years old. If a male teenager by the age of 18 doesnt' start to develope feelings for the opposite sex, then probably he will never ever start to develope any attraction to the opposite gender for the rest of his life.</p>
              <p>Studying is important but developing a logical mind is more important. Without a mature logical mind, whatever the student is studying is nonsense. Carrot and stick approach will only work on a logical mindset, not one that is irrational and confused. The late teens is the age when any life-long psychological problems will develope in a male teenager.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>My sincere advice to ts is to look for a teacher or tutor who can guide your studies and interest. Maybe a polytechnic tutor who has extensive contacts and professional knowledge is the best person to approach. Depending on subject, you may choose to give up the subject or change to a different subject combination. If the subject is maths, then please study hard and look for a good tutor. I would recommend Miss Loi as maths is an important subject in accounting, business studies and pure science and engineering.</p></div>

              <p>If you haven't read everything, please read from page 1 and also read his previous topic. Know whats hes like before you start giving comments. If you still feel what you say is appropriate for this guy then i have nothing to say.</p>
              <p>I've seen much younger kids with a MUCH MORE mature mindset than TS and hes not even bothering about this studies at all. All he does is whine all day with no effort spent on trying to solve any of the problems he raised.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, why do you mention sexual attraction when thats not the focus of this topic? Please read carefully</p>

              <p>where got 15 yo still have to get beaten up by parents just to get yourself to study? dunno what is self control meh..</p>
              <p>15 years old is not very old/mature yet..but should know better than to whine and complain here in SGF instead of trying to improve the current situation..</p>
              <p>he is the perfect example of scum, useless person, go ahead and wallow in self pity.</p>
