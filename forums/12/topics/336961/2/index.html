              <p>She is boring with u already. I used to have a gf when in ur time, didn't know she was a materialistic girl. Back in 1998, which products are popular in JPG wallet, pouch, Versace perfume Blue jeans etc, i bought her a perfume, Baby rose which she became my gf. After 7 mths, which was her B day, i actually caught her with other guy (Malay) while waiting for her at her blk. Ending guess u know it. We broke off as i have not much money as a kid to support her crave for shopping.</p>
              <p>During the last few mths, we seldom talk on phone like we used to. Maybe there is something she wanted but u can't give to her......</p>

              fucked up attitudes sometimes...but i understand tat we can't have
              romantic moments all the time...cause i noe...her parents dun allow
              BGR....i respect tat....and i dun take it to heart tat she doesn't
              hang out wit me more than her frens to prevent and suspicions and
              gossip which could lead to let her parents noe about it..My parents
              are okay wit me having a GF....and nowadays...she's been giving me
              tis type of attitude everytime i chat wit her on msn which is
              like..keep ignoring wad i'm saying and doesn't give a damn respect
              to wad i'm saying....and now...she's asking me...to give her
              sometime to let her tink whether I and her are meant to be
              together....i'm okay wit it...let her be and wait for her
