Everything has a timing and a place for it - since you randomly told her about it - you got to presume that you are <strong>merely</strong> expressing and not expecting.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You can't expect to win over a girl when you have not won her emotionally first. Being a good friend is nothing; you are not even a close friend.<br><br><strong>You can't be hanging in the air; trying to move on with life while sticking aroud the corner, hoping for a miracle.</strong> In love, you are bound to wound yourself. Longer you retain in that mode, longer you bleed without knowing.<br><br>P.S: In fact, I already knew you would slip into this mode; I read your birth chart remember? Libra Descendant will indirectly produce such effect - CloUdiSm Remix III state Libra Trap. Explain to you the next time I see you. Get hold of yourself because you are experiencing new emotions - learn to understand the dynamic of chase, expression and emotions. Grasp the hidden treasure beneath the idea and you will see why. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>/me pat pat<br><br>Cheers</div>
