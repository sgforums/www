              <p>I'm 21 and just returned to Singapore after graduating overseas. For the past 5-6 years i've played around alot. I flirt around alot, dated many girls, had many girlfriends/flings and slept around a fair bit too. Yeah, probably the typical guy most girls will call a jerk.</p>
              <p>Lately, i'm starting to get sick of all the booze and partying, and i've been looking for a steady girlfriend to sorta settle down with. Not exactly thinking of getting married, but seeking someone that I can click with and take care of (and vice versa).</p>
              <p>A while back, there was this girl that I really liked. She liked me too but she would not accept me as her partner because she said she cannot afford another heartbreak. I've tried countless of times to convince her that I'm serious but she would always end up crying and telling me to leave her alone as I will just end up breaking her heart. We're now over each other and we're good friends.</p>
              <p>I met another girl 2 weeks ago, and i'm kinda facing the same problem. My expectations are quite high and these 2 girls both fall in the pretty/smart/mature/understanding category and are great girls who are not easy to come by.</p>

              <p>I gotta agree with Jojo. By association it can be hard to woo certain girls, especially if u have a certain history. </p>
              <p>Damn, sometimes you only realise that the one that really loved u was the one. Sometimes its hard to go back to before as they have spent thier time and love on you and we took it for granted , that hurt will still remain and they wont just forget it so easily because they would have known you quite intimately to know what kind of person you really are , regardless of the fact that they use to like you.</p>
              <p>I think you may have better chances with the girl you just met few weeks ago. But then again, the girl that u liked before may be.. the one you really want. lol.</p>
              <p>Its quite a retarded situation that i think , when it reaches this point got no one to blame but urself la. damn..i also in this situation before n in the end have to accept the fact. But i think my karma better then u..</p>
              <p>i hope. hahaha.. anyways la. U 21... u really sure ? About all the calming down, the true love stuff. cause i thought like you when i was around 21 also.  haha look where am i now.</p>

              <p>Well the only way to get girls, not just those 2, to trust you again is to genuinely BE  sincere and trustworthy.  Not just in your mind, but in your heart too. And time'll do the rest to help you prove yourself.</p>

              <p>I'm 21 and just returned to Singapore after graduating overseas. For the past 5-6 years i've played around alot. I flirt around alot, dated many girls, had many girlfriends/flings and slept around a fair bit too. Yeah, probably the typical guy most girls will call a jerk.</p>
              <p>Lately, i'm starting to get sick of all the booze and partying, and i've been looking for a steady girlfriend to sorta settle down with. Not exactly thinking of getting married, but seeking someone that I can click with and take care of (and vice versa).</p>
              <p>A while back, there was this girl that I really liked. She liked me too but she would not accept me as her partner because she said she cannot afford another heartbreak. I've tried countless of times to convince her that I'm serious but she would always end up crying and telling me to leave her alone as I will just end up breaking her heart. We're now over each other and we're good friends.</p>
              <p>I met another girl 2 weeks ago, and i'm kinda facing the same problem. My expectations are quite high and these 2 girls both fall in the pretty/smart/mature/understanding category and are great girls who are not easy to come by.</p>

              <p>How can anyone get sick of booze. haha.</p>
              <p>Well the only way to get girls, not just those 2, to trust you again is to genuinely BE  sincere and trustworthy. Not just in your mind, but in your heart too. And time'll do the rest to help you prove yourself.</p>
              <p>I don't really mean to boast but I have no problem getting girls; wild ones and decent ones. I guess i'm kinda a flirt by nature and they know that too. The problem here is the girl assumes i'm a jerk, can't help liking me, but then restrains herself from getting too deep. It seems to me now that even the decent girls are just looking for a fling. A girl kisses me then tells me that she doesn't deserve me. Well, at least that's what she said.</p>

              <p>Both girls were from the outside circle. Somehow, they can still tell.</p>

              <p>I deferred from NS. Was the last batch to be able to go overseas provided you enter Uni before 17 and 6 months. Will go ns in March next year.</p>

              <p>lol BadzMaro u sure reply quick enough.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure, I might be wrong but somehow I feel its just that Singaporean girls are a little protective over their feelings, especially to guys like me who spent their teenage years overseas. Any girls can comment on this?</p>
              <p>The first girl I mentioned, we never got together, but we had sex and it was her first time too. A few days later, she told me she cannot fall for me. Sometimes I really don't understand how girls think. This current girl, a few nights ago she kissed me while crying then told me she doesn't deserve me.</p>
              <p>I'm so confused. Maybe you're right, its karma.</p>

              <p>That's understandable, I don't think you're boasting or being a BHB. After awhile of being a so-called flirt, you probably carry yourself in that way w/o realizing it. How about doing a self-check. Like the way you behave that's probably sending the message to girls that you're a flirt? Or you could try like 2 months of not hooking up with any girl, smth like a cold turkey method. I don't know if you get what I'm saying.</p>
              <p>Haha if its decent girls who look for flings, then beneath that exterior they're probably NOT that decent. really decent girls generally don't end up with flings but long term, steady relationships.</p>
