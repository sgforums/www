Because for a girl to give it up.. and actually come to decide to give it up to you , and  knowing full well ur character and chose not to be with u after it is just so..  Its so DEEP man.. DEEP!!! Fuk! Reminds me of someone. Anyways, In my opnion , u should go for that girl. Cause she really knows u well enough.</p>
              <p>For the second chick..  rebound guy ? RIght time right moment for a guy who do not want a serious relationship at that moment of tim. Tears , hugs n kisses. I wonder why she was crying. It wont be just because she thinsk she doesnt deserve u.Trust me man.. lol.</p>

              <p>K la.. honestly , i dun even know am i paying off my karma points. But i do admit that some stuffs.. what goes around comes around is quite true. And it sucks..  mega sucks.</p>
              <p>And not being reckless be it in our behaviour or in relationships. I admit.. i fuked up many times before. lol...  its like knowing love only when you have lost it. But fuk the past man.. we gotta look to the future!Learn from the mistakes, adapt to your goals and ur dream catch . And our character will determine the kind of girls we attract. Forcing ourselves to be someone else we are not also ... stress.</p>
              <p>But then again.. u 21. lol.. plenty of time to do lots of self-help-learning. hahaha and know how to repay karma points. Go church ? lol!</p>

              <p>Don't worry, you're still very young. Why rush into a relationship when you're going into NS next March? Honestly, a few months' commitment isn't considered a serious relationship.</p>
              <p>I understand what you're going through. I myself, studied in the States for 3 years and came back to Singapore for NS. While I was there since the age of 17, I experienced that in their culture, sex and commitment doesn't go together at all. A more appropriate association with sex would be partying, booze and skinny dipping. And I partied so hard I flunked my studies. Naturally, I came back to Singapore, had quite a number of short-term relationships, and a lot of fun with my friends. National service was what changed me...I began to accept authority, think about my future and understand the consequences of my actions. After NS, I went back to studies while working part-time and got my honours degree shortly after.. I'm proud of what I have achieved today through hard work, and have matured a lot through the years.</p>
              <p>Well, the morale of the story is, take your time! I feel that in order to appreciate love, one must learn to respect the opposite sex. You might desire to have a steady long-term relationship, but ask yourself, are you ready for it? If you have no intention to marry the girl, would it be fair to commit to a relationship and make her wait 2 years for you while you serve NS?</p>

              <p>you are too impatient sydney...</p>
              <p>to make a girl really fall in love with you takes time, years and not months...especially if she is the the other half you seek.</p>
              <p>a good guy friend mentioned this to me before 'make the girl fall in love with you instead of you wooing the girl'. I know this sounds contradicting, but it doesnt. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
