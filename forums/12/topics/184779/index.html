Find some activities and do it and the conversation will come along... hei hei..I'm not talking abt sex. Go for a cheap and enjoyable outing like go Ubin and cycle. pay 4 dollars for 2 person to get over to there and 10 dollars for cycling whole day in a double seat bicycle! U sure will enjoy the day and conversation will roll in and chemistry will spark! Any r/s needs effort..especially from both side.</div>

Maybe you don't really have to make this decision of whether to 'tong' at this point... Perhaps you hold this mentality that you should quickly get this matter over with then you can face your 'O' levels with everything else thrown behind... But wait...
