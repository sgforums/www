I seriously doubt anybody gonna support your choice to be a third party, make yourself miserable and ruin those who are involved, including yourself, in this triangular love affair.<br><br>If your man is sincere, he would abandon his current relationship to pursue one with you. Apparently, he chose the two timing option because it's non-committed.<br><br>Do you consider that as love? Or is it just very convenient way of doing things?<br><br>He isn't liable for any responsibility because the 'unwritten clause' in this sub rosa relationship is non-commitment. You are needed when there's a need for you to fill in his emotional chasm created by his current relationship. At the end of the day, he goes back to his woman WHOM he has the burden of responsibility over and you are kept away like a discarded toy.<br><br>Is that the way of love you seek?<br><br>He employed flippant words to retain your feelings; but does that amount to anything? Yeah, missing you... loving you... and all that typical sweet nothings that an inexperienced woman would fluster in love excitement - has that spur any initiative, actions or plans he has for you since actions speak louder than words and if he does love you, the former would materialise?<br><br>Nothing.<br><br>It seemed to me that you enjoyed his company and doesn't mind going out with him even that tantamount to be playing with fire.<br><br>Perhaps only when the fire sear you badly, would you then deter yourself from such foolishness that doesn't have an end to begin with.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
