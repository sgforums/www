            <div class='col-md body'>Lots of people have got the wrong point of view, so everything seems dark to them. Everything has two sides, one dark and the other bright. If we look only at the dark side of things, naturally we fall into pessimism. Nothing seems worthwhile to us. Dissatisfaction fills up our mind. This will lead to serious results.<br><br>This comes of our reading so much the works of those pessimistic authors. According to them, man is the puppet of Nature. We can do nothing, as we like. Fate always meddles with our conduct and works against us. Before this inexorable power we are helpless. Each struggle on our part only plunges us the deeper into the snare fate has set for us. Their theory is founded on a false philosophy and is only a poor guide to our life.<br><br>In this world we have success as well as failures. Our daily experiences show that in most cases industry and bravery do result in success. For those who lack will power or ability we can with a degree of certainly predicts their failure. It is not Nature but our own weakness, which is the cause of our misery. If we have only the will and the strength to sustain it, we can conquer anything. A brave and energetic man can achieve success in very unfavorable circumstances.<br><br>In everyone's life there comes a time of ultimate challenge, a time when every resource we have is tested. A time when life seems unfair. A time when our faiths, our values, our patience, our compassion, our ability to persist, are all pushed to our limits and beyond. Some people use such tests as opportunities to become better people; others allow these experiences of life to destroy them.<br><br>So we need not despair of success. This world is at least one in which justice in a measure prevails. Though its dark side is not to be neglected, we can always gain hope and strength from its bright side. Therefore take courage and do our work as hard as possible. We will be rewarded with brilliant success.<br></div>
