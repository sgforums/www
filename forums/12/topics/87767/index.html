Ask yourself this:<br><br>1) You controlled her till she can'ts stand you controlling her?<br>2) She finds that going out with her frens more enjoying?<br>3) Why is that she wants to go out withe her frens and not with you? What did you do with her/him when both parties are out together?<br><br>Maybe there are things when they go out, they do, they don find it comfortable with you around.. Advice is try knowing her friends and talk to her abt what she does outside.. It helps.</div>
