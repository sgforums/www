Not tell her, and you will never be accepted.</strong><br><br>Maybe you could start with telling her why you like her, and well, skim a bit on the mushy parts "I like you ever since i saw you etcs etcs", and the best way is to tell her that you feel that she makes a very good friend and wonder if it is possible if both of you can be more than friends.</div>
