            <div class='col-md body'>Encourage her when you see something good happens to her and grab that every chance there is. So will give her some light when she's in that dark tunnel. Constantly remind her that people ard her care for her and that you will definitely stand by her no matter what. And always spare her a listening ear so that you will know the root of her problem like what initiated her to be like what she is now. I guess it will take a lot of time, just be patient.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

This is a simple theory if you want to get into her mindsets. However, you are warned, in having to meddle with people having strong stigma of depression and despair (Under 48 Laws of power - you are advised to avoid). The reason is simple: if you cannot influence them to be optimistic, they will influence you instead, unless your fixed nature is strong.<br><br>Cheering her up is a simple task, like a helpful gesture. If you want her help her, you have to know the core of her mind and the events that contribute to the perpentual pessimism. Please note that this is no overnight thingy - in my experience, usually it takes intense brain-washing and psychological reinforcing to change. You will definitely need some form of stealth, skill and luck if you wish to succeed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

But apparently, your turning into one yourself.  So my advice is to go and find a way of not turning into one.  Once you find it, you can share it with her.</div>
