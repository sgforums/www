            <div class='col-md body'>hi everyone.. me had a gf who i went through with alot of ups and downs during my 4 yr relationship with her. during this 4 yrs, we broke up once in the 3rd year and now about 1 month ago.<br><br>i am insensitive to her feelings and dislike to show out my feelings to her in public. whereas she is a very insecure person..she is always worried that i will find anoter gal etc etc. although i love her alot.. i just  find it difficult to shower my love to her as i am "just like that"...i did try at times but after a few days i will revert back to my normal insensitive self.<br><br>there was one time where i would do anything just for her. be it fetching her from work at weird times(often eating into the little rest that i had)..always spending time with her and all possible things that u can think of EXCEPT giving flowers... u mention it i did it. BUT AFTER the 1st break up.. it all just burst. i felt very very hurt because i loved her so much. but yet she always had to threaten to break up with me during those 3 years. so one day i got tired of it n broke up with her.<br><br>after that..3 months and another "1 month relationship with another gal" ... my gf n me got back together. things went well until she started checking up on my emails n frenster account. she was always suspicious of me. and i feel that this trust is wat broke our relationship again. we often quarrelled about her checking my stuff. and she did some things that really made me consider if she was a "wifey" material. but never did i once tell her that i wanna break up although i grew tired of this relationship soon enough. so when the day she mentioned it again for the umpteenth time, i decided enuf was enuf n broke up.<br><br>she then went thru severe "counselling" by one of our gd fren who happens to be a very gd listener. he gave her his advises and she came back to me pleading to be reconciled. i stood firm with my decision and refused to be back together because i am tired of the relationship and wanna make frenz and socialise to which she doesnt like me to.<br><br>but her constant calls and cries made me give in. i am a very soft hearted person. i did tell her before that if she kept calling i would definitely give in which would be disastrous..because i could easily manipulate her into going to bed with me which i dun wish to because i love her truly.but we went to bed only when we were together.so now not together..so i dun wan her to come over. toldher that not to come over to tok to my mum because i dun wanna be together anymore.<br><br>but she came  to my house yesterday to haf a chat with my mum because she n my mum cant get along(and i told her that she n my mum have to get along if we are to be together). my mum is a tough nut..often believeing in horoscopes and such. also my gf herself doesnt do much except spend time in my room or on the com when she is here. so they had a few issues to thrash out. like hw my mum wants a gd daughter-in-law and not some lazy gal etcetc. i know that my mum is unreasonable but i do know that some things she says abt my gf makes sense also.<br><br>anyway..end of the day..after they thrashed things out..we got back together.. and she stayed over. we made love to each other as usual and today morning she went to work. while i was on my way to work..she msged me things asking me "if i took her back out of pity etc? if got another gal i like just tell her so that she will leave me alone etc etc" i replied that i just wanted to be alone and that i dunno wat i want. i also told her tat we made love and this was due to my own fault of succumbing to my own soft heartedness and my love for her. she was very sad that i took her back out of pity and love.<br><br>so once again we went our own ways.. and now i am so confused. because when i am alone.. i feel sad and face the prospect of losing the one i haf loved.. my only and first gf. also feel guilty of making love to her even though i wasnt sure of my feelings for her. i feel like a "bus 3rd".. when i am on my way hm or watever..or at hm.. i often feel happier when my gf dun contact me...i just feel numb and wanna be alone...<br><br>wats wrong with me?? or am ithe problem?? feel so sianz..</div>

She's insecure, maybe both of you need to have more in-depth talk on that. Tell her what you really feel, like what you've told us here.<br><br>Or perhaps you need some cooling off period. Take things easy, dun rush. Perhaps you may like to tell her that you need some space by yourself so that you can feel how much you miss her when she's not around. There's this saying in chinese "xiao bie sheng xin hun" (a little absence may create back more fire than that of newly wed's) Which is also to say absence make the heart grows fonder.<br><br>Tell her that you are still fond of her, just that you need the space to regain all that passion back. If after a period of cooling off and you think she's the one you cant pic living without even in future, then perhaps she's the one for you.<br><br>Cheers,<br><br>YouDonKnowMe</div>

When you've had your space, then you can focus more on your girlfriend later. I think your gf needs to understand that and you personally need to communicate to her this need for personal space and growth from time to time.<br><br>You will also need to tell her the importance of trust to you and HOW it's been affecting you.<br><br>And from what I've read, diffrence of lifestyle and socializing also seems to be the key? She doesnt like you to mingle around too much. Have a heart to heart talk (when you're ready &amp; she too) about what are the grounds that are acceptable for each other and what each other can compromise. Communication is the key and of cos to honour what each other have agreed on too.</div>

Can you accept her as she is? If you can't, I would rather advise you to get along with your life and to know other girls instead... Whatever you had, you either hold or let go... Sounds to me like nothing too much have been changed personally? She's still holding much traits you and your mum is unhappy with, and you have not lowered your expectation of her... And seems like the reason why your last patch back was a lousy one... You know it, she sensed it. Perhaps you could help her by 'pushing' her away from you too...? I see the situation being a bit tricky if not 'karmanic' as she tends to fall back to you and you simply just allow that to happen without good ground of amendment to the relationship...<br><br>It's even more funny when ya mentioned 'wife material'? It seems to me like when she is barely crossing the barrier between you and her, she has another ahead which is your mum....? Relationship foundation is weak. If you think 'marriage', I would tell you almost quite certainly that this is not the right relationship at the right time... Can you carry out appropriate changes? If not, I say don't bother?</div>
