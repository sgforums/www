              <p><br>I've seen many condos of friends and family, and my parents just bought my brother one. There is no condo I know where the bedroom is too small to put a single bed. In fact all the bedrooms can comfortably contain a queen size double bed.</p>
              <p>I think the one TS is living in a 2 bedroomer with storeroom or a studio apartment.</p>
              <p>TS please tell your parents to buy a 5 room HDB so that you can have your own room. This is ridiculous.</p>

              <p>I agree. If I have 2 kids who is old enough for at least one of them to be 13, there's no way I'll still be living in a place with only 2 bedrooms. And don't talk about poor or what. The fact that its a condo means that the parents are just die-die want to live in condo while compromising the basic personal development of their children (force the 13 yr old girl who prob already has menses or will be coming soon in the next year) to share a room with the brother.</p>
              <p>Any cosy 4-room HDB, which is actually quite big, on this island will solve this problem.</p>
              <p>Nowadays a 5-room resale HDB in a mature estate like Bishan costs more than suburban condos in not so good areas so it makes more sense to invest in HDB. The parents can always buy 4-room or 5 room HDB in Sembawang, Yishun or Boon Lay if they cannot afford districts like Bishan.</p>

              <p><br>It doesn't solve the problem because the reason she doesn't have her own room is NOT because one room is committed to be a study. Its NOT a case of 3 roomy bedrooms,and the parents die die want to have a study room so the kids are forced to share room.</p>
              <p>TS has said that the 3rd room is so small it can't even contain a bed! How small is that? This shows that its not even meant to be a bedroom. Have you guys ever gone to showflats before or gone househunting? Those kind of condos are called 2+1. That +1 is not meant to be a room. Its meant to be a small extra space that can be used as storeroom or small study where you squeeze in a small desk and thats it.</p>

              <p>I think TS is suay. I pity TS.</p>
              <p>Its true that its not the kids' rights, to have food, education, lodging, but its the privilege. Since there are parents who give birth to kids and dump them beside the lift, or in China they even murder the baby girls, drown them...But any good parent will want to give the best to their kids.</p>

              <p>China baby girls being murdered or thrown away.</p>
              <p>"Some of those girls are alive, they are just not registered," says Professor Zhai Zhenwu, of Beijing's People's University. "Some are abandoned, but many are aborted when the parents find out the foetus is a girl. <span style="font-family: sans-serif;">"This is a huge problem for China. We already have about 20 million boys who will never be able to marry because there aren't enough women."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif;">This goes to show how stupid China people are. They kill their baby girls while the boys will grow up and have not enough women to marry. This is the reason stupid civilisations get extinct.

              <p><br>The China govt is not interested in controlling its population. All its interested in now is storing up the world's natural resources like tin and copper and iron.</p>
              <p>China people are stupid, uncivilised and backwards. You can tell from how they spit everywhere, even in indoor restaurants (wtf) and their toilets in the international airports have no doors (wtf?). Even a caveman from 5000 years ago knew that you should kill the animal before you skin it. The China retards are also the no. 1 killer of endangered species in the world. Go to traffic.org and open your mind. The reason there are 1.5 billion of the retards in China is because they bred like rats and did not practise birth control. Another sign of their mental retardation.</p>
              <p>No wonder Google doesn't want to have a part to play in that retarded land of the barbarians.</p>

              <p>So the guys become gays, then no problem liao. <br><br>China is more receptive towards gays, as compared to Singapore. <br><br>There was even a documentary on two gays who got attached and even adopted a son in China.</p>

              <p><br>I'm glad that there are overseas Chinese (hua qiao) who despite their forefathers having left the retarded land 100 yrs ago, still show signs of the mental retardation. This shows that a small % of the gene pool still possess the recessive gene.</p>
              <p>One can tell how different the overseas Chinese in Singapore, Malaysia and HK are different from the Chinese stuck in the retarded land, who were still in the dark ages up until as recent as the late 90s when it finally opened its doors slowly to the world, but still in measured doses. In China, all information on the internet is censored by the communist govt, which is why Google pulled out, FB is banned there, which is why they have their own platform of products that are meant to copy FB, twitter, msn and google for its domestic use eg Baidu. All students enrolled in Chinese universities, from the villages ones to the top ones like TsingHua are put through propaganda brainwashing modules. Even the PSC scholars I know who chose to go to China came back and told us so.</p>
              <p>The retards who are still stuck in China, and whose ancestors didn't leave the retarded land in the1800s and 1900s unlike our ancestors, live a totally different life from the Hua Qiaos. Remember the Cultural Revolution and Tiananmen Square incident? Why do you think the China bumpkins you see now in Sinkie, are so different from the Malaysian Chinese, who are so much more similar to us?</p>
              <p>Have fun revelling in the recessive genes of the gene pool. You seem to do so with pride. You should probably leave SG and migrate to China, so that you can revel in putting poison in baby's milk and selling it to the world and thinking nothing of it, being known to produce low quality and cheap goods, and skinning cats and dogs alive, worse than cavemen 5000 yrs ago, and contribute to the murder of endangered tigers, rhinos and tortoises and turtles because of the provincial delusion that it'll revive your dying dicks. How typically retarded.</p>
