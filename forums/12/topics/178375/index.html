It's hard to say...? Afterall, you're the one who chose your wife.. And it's quite unlikely that she would change her attitude and character just like that... It would be nice if you can constantly talk to her to install a form of mentality in her... And also, she'll need to understand that the family would need a form of saving... So that in case anything goes wrong one day, things would not be so bad for the family...<br><br>I understand that your concern about your wife having the negative influence on your son... I think such things to an extent is just somehow inevitable... Of course, you would have to understand that you have a fair share in your son too... So while she behaves and such.. You have your own responsibility and ability to teach your son what you deem fit too...? Ultimately it's just up to your son to pick up whatever... Just like he might be influenced by the other people in his life... It seems that he should be more greatly affected by his mum when he is younger.. Can't help too much about that... As he grow up, he should be able to filter off things for himself...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi,<br>firstly, you need to bring your wife out to social activities such as some organised by CSC or etc. Let her mix with the people. Choose courses that allow her to mingle like cooking, dancing or even go with her to morning exercise which the CSC does on weekends.<br><br>with that build confidence, and once the tongue loosens, things are easier.<br>she will have chance to interact with other housewives with children and trust me, they will talk.<br><br>secondly, at start of year, perhaps you can sit down with her and work out some goals. Start with something for the child, like knowing how to read the mulitpication tables, and then for you, to learn something, and then her, and lastly for the family. From here, you can inject some of what you want. but not big items just small ones. and then review half-yearly, and inject more of for the whole family.<br><br>Do observe what she likes to do. for example, cooking, then you can enrol her as instructors in CSC or something, but one thing, don't just throw her there, be there with her and your child.<br><br>Lastly, praise your wife when she does something nice in front of your child. People like to be praised. but when your wife try to be difficult, try to speak to her in another way, but infront of child, so she knows she can't throw her temper. Say something like "see, mummy disagrees with this, but baby know right? for the family to move, we baby, mummy and daddy must move in this way, right?"<br><br>bottomline, this is a situation that has evolved over time, nothing can be changed overnight. Bring out your love and patience and make slow steps like building blocks to encourage yourselves. show your happiness and never never give up. what you have is a family that you as the head should never throw the towel in.<br><br>Rem, a bad day only lasts 24hrs. - my favourite line.<br><br>take care, and God Bless.<br><br>bye.</div>

I have moved up here more than 5 years ago and still liking it. The pay in HK is generally better and despite the higher cost of living, my experience and those of fellow Singaporeans are that we still manage to scrape more savings each month.<br><br>So far I have yet to know any HKers (among my friends) who haved moved to Singapore and likes it there. Not that Singapore is lousy, but we have to accept that it is very different.<br><br>From what you said, your wife is a caring person, willing to look after the baby full-time. I doubt she will just leave you on impulse. IMHO, give and take, consider moving to HK and start a fresh.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When someone is young, you have to guide them else they will be 'crooked'. Like my Uncle, he is poorly educated and have to do OT almost every day to make ends meet. His wife also never take care of her 2 sons much...end up it was my mum who took one of them for check-up as he got minor seizures since young. Meaning over a decade his own mum never bring him go doctor for check-up.<br><br>$ is important but i think upbringing of kids is more important. If the root is rotten, tell me how u have a good plant coming out. You can have all the $, but if ur son is someone whom u all cannot take care, cannot tame, cannot discipline and always get into trouble i think u all wun be happy.<br><br>You ought to thank your wife's dedication to jagar ur son so well.</div>
