              <p>I got a bf but because i'm fat.</p>
              <p>My bf didnt get to turn on by me. In fact, looking at my rolls of fat on my body. He got traumatised and never get erection.</p>
              <p>Instead, my bf went to porn and pcc to release his -_-</p>
              <p>I get very upset because i thought my bf stop and quit porn and pcc for me. And he had been lying to me he won't pcc and porn anymore because he have me.</p>
              <p>But end up, he didn't.</p>
              <p>What should i do? I'm terribly upset and depressed. I feel he broke the promises and trust. On the other hands, is it my fault for causing him like this?</p>
              <p>Maybe i should go on diet/liposuction and hopefully my body dont turn him off? Or should i just break up with him? Sigh i already sign HDB with him and made payment already.</p>
              <p>Why do things become like this? Do i deserve all these?</p>
              <p>I'm just sad. Please don't shoot me.</p>

              <p>Your bf just told u straight about the fat on your body? For one, this whole relationship needs both sides to work together for success.</p>
              <p>For the guy, like one of the above posters said, you dont expect yourself to be free/available every time he feels like doing also. I rather he watch porn and relieve himself than to go wreak havoc with other girls outside.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, for your well being and both sides' happiness, I recommend that you lose the excess weight and fat on you. Just don't go for liposuction/slimming pills/treatments, they won't keep your fat off for the long term. I can make things easy for you, but there are no shortcuts for long and lasting weight loss. Let me know by PM for help in this area.</p>
