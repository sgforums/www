As much as people do not dis your opinion off, so should you not dis em off. Respect two sides of view as much as you want them to respect yours.<br><br>I will say no more. Period.</div></blockquote>2 sides of a view? u can't have 2 sides when one side is focused on making life miserable for others. Justice is more important than having 2 sides of a view.<br><br>more importantly. If u dig deep into logic, anyone can see that the people against homosexuality here are just not giving out any intelligent logic to argue their cause.<br><br>Examples:<br><br>Assumption that anyone who argues for acceptance of homosexuality must be gay themselves. U see that sort of lazy or prejudiced assumption happening all the time, yourself included.<br><br>Saying that if a gay feels ashamed to be gay, he is not really gay. I've already elaborated on where the flaw in this logic lies. Read back in my earlier posts.<br><br>Assumption that its against nature to be homosexual. Homosexuality is so prevalent in nature that it is quite the opposite of what people think.<br><br>Assumption that everyone has considered gay thoughts. I beg to differ. I know of straight people who have never had gay thoughts. They just know and are secure in their sexuality so there is no gay thoughts. Having gay experiences are an entirely different matter though. For instance, we have the famous British WW2 prime minister winston churchill, who is so secure as a straight male that he could arrange to have a gay sexual experience in a very detached way: not because he was gay or entertained gay thoughts, but as an experience in life.<br><br>The problem with the "gay is wrong" crowd, they hold many assumptions built on their prejudices and ignorance about things and they hold fast to them, refusing to let go and be open to new and evolutionary thoughts.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey dude.it's very brave of you to openly admit such things,others keep it private and make matters worst.i must applaude firstly your courage to bring  up such an issue.firstly i would like to make it clear that i am in no position to give you any professional advice,i myself being just a junior college student. however this are my two cents worth and i hope that it helps.<br>firstly(again),having such thoughts or sudden impulses does NOT mean that you are gay.<br>i <span style="text-decoration: underline;">strongly</span> oppose one of the above replies that there is nothing to do about it,there is much that can be done,and please do something before things get worse.while growing up,we often face conflicts and confusion with ourself,and such often leads on to one questioning yourself on your sexuality and stuff like that.one possivle practical step is,when faced with such morbid thoughts,do NOT give in to negative issues that seem to flood your mind.STAND firmly in what you believe is right or wrong.<br>NO ONE can say what you are,YOU have to decide for yourself.I<br>F YOU WANNA BE NORMAL,THEN BELIEVE IN YOURSELF AND ACT ON IT.thoughts can kill,and dwelling on the situation may make it worse.talk to somebody,probably your parents or a counsellor,speaking to soemone is a direct route to being 'normal again'.again,i storngly advise you to seek professional help in this area.<br>releasing such thoughts is much more effective than trying to fight theideas alone.<br>keep believing that the person who put the ideas in your mind is a idiot and DO NOT believe what it says no matter what.belive in yourself and thats final.ending off,here are some  hotlines which you can make use of,the student's care service hotline at 62869905 or email scs_h01students.org.sg.SEEK HELLLLLP~~!!!!<br>i firmly believe that you can overcome this crisis,and you must believe in yourself too.God bless you dude.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>and we're starting to see the religious hypocrites come out.<br><br>1stly nobody is saying nothing can be done. on the contary, often counselling is needed to help a person gain acceptance of himself. This requires more work than simply trying to be "normal". It's easy to push everything into a closet and be normal, that is what people who strive to be normal do. Anyone who tells u that with counselling those thoughts can disappear and u can be "normal" is lying. This sort of counselling is no more than brainwashing, a conditioning that slowly forces u into a position where u deny having any homosexual feelings even though u do. If u think brainwashing is a better solution as opposed to learning to accept yourself for who u are, then by all means, do so. But I will just say that u're being fooled by the real idiots who would prefer you fit THEIR idea of what society should be, instead of being true to yourself and being who u ARE in society.<br><br>Seriously, the one piece of advice here which I can say they're right in giving is to choose wisely. They're telling u to choose wisely in the most cynical manner: to build their own cocooned society due to their own inability to accept gays and their own insecurity in their sexuality. Unlike them, I give this piece of advice to u sincerely hoping u can find and accept who u are inside, no matter whether u are straight, bi or gay. Remember the most important thing is to be true to yourself. I wouldn't want u to lead a gay lifestyle if u were straight, anymore than I would want u to be "straight" if u were gay. I'm afraid that not everyone here can see that. Ultimately they're too busy trying to force u to fit into their perceived social notions.</div>
