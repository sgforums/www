            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by HENG@:</div><div class="quote_body">I think this is one of the biggest misconceptions people have. If u are gay, u can sincerely "don't want to be gay" but at the end of the day u know what? U can try to be straight but u will just be living a lie. U're not who u are. The most important thing in life is always to be true to yourself, to who u are inside. If u're gay, the worst thing u could choose to do is to "try" and be straight. That is called denial, and its not only potentially psychologically harmful to one's well-being, it also opens up lots of scenarios for potential future hurt.<br><br>For eg:<br><br>a gay guy marries a woman in an effort to convince himself he is "straight". Say 5 years down the road, he has a kid. He likes the woman he is married to, but he doesn't love her. And then he meets a guy he really loves, and start a extra-marital affair with him. Think how devistating it will be for the wife to find out her husband has been closet gay all along. How bad it will be for the children. Especially since there is less incentive for him to stay faithful to her, since he dosen't like woman. All that hurt and pain not only for him, but for his wife, his children, his family, his wife's family, everybody. How cheap he feels everynight when he has to sleep with her in an attempt to be straight, the self loathing he ends up feeling for himself, hating himself for being "not normal", the disgust that floods inside him everytime he has sex with his wife just to try to convince himself he is "straight". And in the end he strays just because nobody can hide who they are forever. U can lie to yourself but the truth always comes out. And if u've been trying to hide it, it will only cause more damage when it finally sees the light of the day.<br><br>So u see, this is how denial can ruin lives, not just your own, but whoever u choose to cast in your own little "straight family" act. My advice is, we have enough of this sort of tragedy and sorrow in the world. And we don't need children from this sort of homes coming out hating gay people and spreading bigotry. So be wise, accept yourself for who u are, and don't listen to the other bigots if they try to tell u its "not normal" to be gay or that its a "disease" to be gay. If u ask me, bigotry is a much bigger social disease than being gay will every be. They're the ones who need to speak to counsellors.</div></blockquote>i probably didnt phrase my sentence right.....<br><br>firstly, i dun hate gays......secondly i do nt pick on dem....  thirdly i accept dat every human beings r unique individual......<br><br>but den lets face the truth okay?...this society is like this.....in singapore dere r bound to be discrimination against homosexuality.....juz look at my frenz....always make fun abt gays n lesbians with words dat r insulting.......<br><br>the thing is we should educate the younger generations abt homosexuality....not tell or pressurise or wad but tell dem dat it is actually ok if u r reallie a homosexual.....n i do think in today's society dere is a nid to change pple's perceptions abt homosexuality......</div>

Don't they realise he feels ashamed due to the social conditioning he received, and not because he's not gay?<br><br>If they truely used their brains to think, anyone can be made to feel guilty. I can take a chinese child, or take a young boy, and raise him in such a way that the chinese kid grows up feeling ashamed to be chinese, or the boy grows up feeling ashamed to be male. And u all know what? Just because they are ashamed of who they are, doesn't make them any less chinese, or any less male. The argument that one is not gay because one is ashamed to be gay is stupid and has not been given any through, intelligent thought at all. People can be gay and ashamed of that, if the social conditioning they received made them see being gay a "bad" thing. Gays can be ashamed of being gay. We call that "in denial". Seriously a lot of people here need to start thinking intelligently before they decide to post.<br><br>As for those who even argue from a Christian pt of view, last I looked it says all man are sinners and sinners shouldn't judge other sinners. These sly people use words like "plenty want to help you" and trick them with fake affectionate calls of "brother" when in reality deep inside they're just hypocrital pharisees. One'd be a fool to trust them.</div>

I can say <strong>you are gay for this matter because you (a guy) clearly demonstrated sexual interest in males by intitiating the act.</strong> Your problem is not whether you are gay, but that you can't stop imagining yourself engaging in any sex acts.

The argument that one is not gay because one is ashamed to be gay is stupid and has not been given any through, intelligent thought at all.

            <div class='col-md body'>1 thing I wish to add in to this thread...<br><br>May it be gay or lesbianism... It somehow relates a nature vs nurture question... Our environment... Our exposures... Beliefs... Biological build up...<br><br>A gay maybe a gay due to different facts or factors.. It's sometimes difficult to debate delibrately whether we should 'change' what is 'wrong' or accept what is 'right'...<br><br>A student who never listen to his teacher in class may be a student with poor attitude and refuses to pay attention to class... Another student who also never listen to his teacher in class may instead be a student with biological hearing problem...<br><br>I think both SAjNT and Heng@ holds a different perception of things.. And somehow held on quite strongly to their own beliefs... Which isn't anything really wrong...<br><br>A person who believes that he might be gay and curiosity allows him to explore further (normal growth thinking phase), might have his mentality set 'right' by explaining things to him and let him understand truly it's just an indirect way of questioning life and sexuality...<br><br>A person who is biologically born as a gay may have his sanity suppressed if people INSIST that something is 'wrong' with him... Causing him to try and act 'normal' if society pressure is strong or psychologically restrained or he feels that he's just born a 'freak' and there is little he can do about it...<br><br>All in all, alot of cases may even be in what we call the 'grey area'... Thus sometimes 'right' or 'wrong' is simply determined more by your own biological build up or the environment you cultivates in....</div>

They are the ones who start flame wars by spreading that sort of bigotted views around. Its certainly not constructive.<br><br>And as acceptance? If your friends know u're straight, and there is no chance of them with u, why should u ever get a butt slap? If there is only limited acceptance because u worry they might go too far with you, either your friends do not respect your sexuality, which is their fault as a person, its not a fault of homosexuals in general. In fact i know of much more cases of straight males who fall for gay women and vice versa, go out of their way to "convert" them, because they just don't know how to respect other people's sexuality.<br><br>More importantly, are u afraid that if they cross a line, u would be forced to face certain feelings that u do not want to think about? Is that also a factor in limited acceptance? Because that does seem quite plausable. And if your gay friends can't resist teasing u in that manner once in awhile, perhaps they sense u're not as secure as u really should be if u were really straight.<br><br>So ultimately it always comes back to the basics: People who have problems accepting homosexuality, are insecure about their own sexuality.</div>
