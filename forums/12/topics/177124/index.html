And there is no such thing as being normal. If u are here hoping people will talk u into believing you are straight, it won't happen. Because to force or deceive a gay person into thinking he or she is straight is reall just not normal.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The question u have to ask yourself, is that since the incident happened, do you still have gay thoughts, or that was just a one-of incident. If its the latter, then dont read too much into it, cos at that age, most people are still exploring with their sexuality and their identitiy, and it could be pretty confusing for some. Everyone has a past, and its important to move on. However, if you are still entertaining gay thoughts, as in attracting to males, then either u accept yourself for who you are, or change yourself to be more receptive in society. Its your life, and you and only you can make that decision</div>

But I speak with the hope that it gets to you. Homosexuality is a disease. Pretty much like a cancer growth in the body. Now nobody who is `nursing` a cancer, will say "Its my little teddy Bear, leave my cancer alone. I'll fight for a right. To erhm leave my cancer alone." Which is why I said you've taken the bravest step into pointing out the problem yourself.<br><br>Now as much as people hate cancer, so do i not condone homosexuality. Note, its not the person i'm against, but the problem. Cut off this disease at its root, like the chinese saying goes, Cut grass muz do away with the root, else it'll sprout again.<br><br>That will be my advise for now, till I hear from you again</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by hiphop2009:</div><div class="quote_body">anyway regarding the straight and gay thing.....dun worry if u find dat afterall u r a gay.....dere r many avenues for u to seek help if u sincerely do nt wan to be a gay n wan to be straight.....</div></blockquote>I think this is one of the biggest misconceptions people have. If u are gay, u can sincerely "don't want to be gay" but at the end of the day u know what? U can try to be straight but u will just be living a lie. U're not who u are. The most important thing in life is always to be true to yourself, to who u are inside. If u're gay, the worst thing u could choose to do is to "try" and be straight. That is called denial, and its not only potentially psychologically harmful to one's well-being, it also opens up lots of scenarios for potential future hurt.<br><br>For eg:<br><br>a gay guy marries a woman in an effort to convince himself he is "straight". Say 5 years down the road, he has a kid. He likes the woman he is married to, but he doesn't love her. And then he meets a guy he really loves, and start a extra-marital affair with him. Think how devistating it will be for the wife to find out her husband has been closet gay all along. How bad it will be for the children. Especially since there is less incentive for him to stay faithful to her, since he dosen't like woman. All that hurt and pain not only for him, but for his wife, his children, his family, his wife's family, everybody. How cheap he feels everynight when he has to sleep with her in an attempt to be straight, the self loathing he ends up feeling for himself, hating himself for being "not normal", the disgust that floods inside him everytime he has sex with his wife just to try to convince himself he is "straight". And in the end he strays just because nobody can hide who they are forever. U can lie to yourself but the truth always comes out. And if u've been trying to hide it, it will only cause more damage when it finally sees the light of the day.<br><br>So u see, this is how denial can ruin lives, not just your own, but whoever u choose to cast in your own little "straight family" act. My advice is, we have enough of this sort of tragedy and sorrow in the world. And we don't need children from this sort of homes coming out hating gay people and spreading bigotry. So be wise, accept yourself for who u are, and don't listen to the other bigots if they try to tell u its "not normal" to be gay or that its a "disease" to be gay. If u ask me, bigotry is a much bigger social disease than being gay will every be. They're the ones who need to speak to counsellors.</div>

But I'm very sure that you're not gay and won't even make it as an apprentice-gay even if you went to take the gay test and licence. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And thanks for your descriptive honesty here, as it will help you to think less often of it in your mind once you've typed it all out here. So feel better of yourself, you're doing a good job in helping yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As the usual sayings would go by advising you to hang out more often with your friends and get to know girls and such, but both of us know that this isn't going to work. So I'm going to give it to you straight and hard here ok? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>In order for your to go straight again and love girls and be able to face guys without feeling awkward, here's what I think you should do first before going out and hanging out with both guys and girls. I advise you to watch a lot of  lesbian pornography (No guys) and until you feel the desire to masturbate to those girls. Surfing pornography on the internet should helps too if you're bored and getting not enough response from those lesbian pornography (Bad film maybe?). You must make sure that you have the desire to masturbate towards girls...in whatever form of media that you responded to...and masturbate. Repeat this therapy for a week and you'll be a fine and straight guy again.<br><br>As the trauma, bad memories...well, there isn't a way for you to erase them off your brain cells. And you have to live with it for as long as you live...your soul will remembers it. But there is a way for you to temporarily erase it from your mind...remember that it is only temporarily and you gotta do this everything it came back to you and as time goes by, it won't come back that frequent to you.<br><br>Well, you gotta find a quiet time to do so for first timers. Firstly, close your eyes and think about that particular bad and shameful incident which you desperately want to forget about. Secondly, as soon as you felt bad and ashamed about it...immediately open your eyes and think of nothing. Think of nothing really means not thinking about anything nor having any thoughts or personal voice and outside noise interferring and disrupting you. So it is very important to find a quiet time to do this. Once you've done the secondly, you will know that you've temporarily erased it from your mind cos you won't think about it again until it comes back for you...and rest assured that it won't be soon. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Be particularly careful with this...as it can erase anything temporarily from your brain. So don't be thinking about any important stuffs and so on when you really have to use this method, cos there's no way anyone in this world can reverse this...not even me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Oh...and I certainly would like to use this space here to inform all those who have taken a peek at this post including those self-proclaimed honorable-male-pricks who are going to be one of them. Come to Aunt Agony forum ONLY when you're having a real problem or you genuinely want to offer advice to the people here. It's not easy for anyone to come here and pour out their real problems here even though having the benefits of being anonymous. So keep your silly, useless, self-arrogant, egotistical, pathetic, disgraceful attitude and one-liner to yourself and your own real life peers if you dare. I'm particularly disappointed by the number of people who comes in here to pick on, step on other people's wound and bad experience in order to give their selfish shell a good excuse to continue leeching oxygen from their own little forsaken world. Those people should be so ashamed for themselves and I'm sure if the people who brought them up knows about this, they will die from the disappointment that they've fed and raised. So good luck to them and their future problems as I won't have mercy on them. Maybe when their problems tored them apart (Not as cool and appealing as imagined), and when they're mentally left broken and helpless and spent...then they will realise that there is really such a thing called retribution. What goes around will definitely comes around and I can personally guarantee that.<br><br>By the way, all idiotic (unintelligent) post will still be ignored and my <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> and <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  are still free. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Good luck to lance_bi, hope you'll be a finer man when you've become straight. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi... My post is not as long as the others, but I'm sure you are nto a gay or lesbian. I'm presuming you are around sec.1 or sec.2 now... A lot of people at this age question their sexuality, but don't worry, usually it would pass. If until a few more years down the road, you still have that tendency.. well, accept it. But I agree with the above post, gays don't question whether they are gay or not. Honestly, in my class, there are some guys who openly umm, grab other boys' ....ummm... yeah.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
