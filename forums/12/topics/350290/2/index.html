              <p>Hmm i can't seem to see a problem with this situation. So you cant seem to fit in with this particular group of friends there can be hundreds of reasons why that is so and that is perfectly normal. The real problem is your premise that you MUST fit in with them or they're ostracizing you, thats probably the cause of your stress.</p>
              <p>Have you thought that maybe this group of friends doesn't suit you??</p>

              <p>Army is still a couple of years away. What sort of things you enjoy doing? Its rare not to be able to find some friends of similar interest. Even loners have been able to find fellow loners for company at times.</p>

              <p>Those are not your friends.</p>

              <p>Prioritize your friends. There are other people out there whom are more worthy. If they're treating you like shit, they're not friends. Acquaintances rather.</p>

              <p>Think WWJD....What would James (BOND) Do?</p>
              <p>James bond doesn't have friends, friends have James Bond. He is a chick magnet. Guys are jealous and they WANT to hang out with him but can't because he's just too awesome..</p>
              <p>The secret is..mix with girls, but don't become their friend. Flirt with them PLAYFULLY, not like an asshole. But then don't get too serious with them. Make good friends with a couple of female friends to balance out your manliness to show that you're not an asshole, but you can make friends with females too. Guys will become jealous, but it doesn't matter because you're the alpha male..</p>

Just because of my notti younger sister who unluckily is in th same school as me , i get to go out lesser wid them compared to my sec 1 and 2 , and we took different courses like geog and history , so we are splitted into different classes . And they are so "heartbroken" over being in different class , that they stopped interactin wid me . they only interact wid me , only to find out stuff , or to ask to eat together at fast foods restaurant after school . I didn't wanna tell them that , "You sux . I dun fancy frens like YOUR" so i always make up new excuses to avoid going out wid them tgt . Reasons like .. My mom got cook today .. My dad is not working .. I need to go wer and wer(places that they dun like) , either you go wid me , or next time then i go out wid ur . Going out wid them , always gets up to 20 bucks , when my pocket moni is only 5 bucks .-.- and i still need to pay for my OWN hp bill .. another 25 bucks . o.0Even going to th movies , i oso dun like going wid them any more . I now goes to th Movies wid my classmates , and i try not to hurt th feelins of my EX-frens .</p></div>

It can have a lot of effect because your upbringing will also determine your priorities in life, for example, maintaining your studies is important as compared to the lan gaming "low-lifestyle". I fully support your stance. I agree with <a href="../../../users/252033">Evident.37</a> 's response somehow because there is something about hanging with girls, they're more naturally friendly. Don't worry, things will pan out as you grow up more, and people similar to your personality traits would probably tend to be among the closer friends. Be kind and sincere. When you have lots of money, friends will amount to many, this is sad but true. You "chia" people lunch, dinner to make friends, also unfortunately true. No "chia" is no friends. If they reject your offer, don't worry, there will always be someone. You never need to join the in crowd. Join a church, there are always friendly people and friends around.</p></div>
