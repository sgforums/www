              <p>Some rich sgians saw a common ground with poor sgians, both of them are at the mercy of the government and the market.</p>
              <p>They may be rich, but they may not be able to move their assets... or such...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I suggest is to let her into your family for a trial period, not as a maid of course, but like a live in girlfriend. This may not be possible in certain families however but you need to give an impression that you are INTELLIGENT, INSIGHTFUL, PURPOSEFUL, instead of being egocentric and irresponsible adult.</p>
              <p>One strategy I used to woo my family to accept my gf is to tell them beforehand that my gf meets my criteria (i.e. talks well, not ugly, understanding of my financial situation, etc). And she becomes my gf (I hint to them that my gf may not be a perm gf if it fails my criteria), it is IMPERATIVE for everybody involve to cooperate if the whole thing has to work.</p>
              <p>Of course, I love my gf greatly, and I just lie all the criteria based of my 'overpositive evaluations' toned down to realistic levels.</p>

              <p>if theres a will, theres a way.</p>
              <p>i think if family objects, and you insist in marrying him/her.you'll just talk it out till your parents agree lor.</p>
              <p>those were the olden days, i know still there are such family doing things to their own child.but dont you think your family is also worried for your future?</p>

              <p>It's so easy for people to talk about it when they have never been place in such situations before.</p>
              <p>Maybe when the time comes, the right question to ask is "Are you in a position to make any decision or not first?"</p>
              <p>Many times, couples in such scenarios don't really have much of a choice in their given situations.</p>
              <p>So it would be polite for anyone not to discuss any further if they have not been in such situations before in their entire lives or simply watched too much movies or dramas.</p>
