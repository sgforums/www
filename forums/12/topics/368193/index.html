              <p>I remember when I was still a kid, I did not like to study. My father keep on forcing me to study saying craps like if you do not study and get a degree or at least a diploma, you will have no future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believed him and forced myself to study even though I hate it. I did well in O level and my result were good enough to get into any JC or Polytechnic that I want.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I chose to go polytechnic because I felt that JC was too tough, got no confidence of doing well in A level to go to uni after that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When I was in poly after the 1st year I felt that I have chosen the wrong course and I feel like quitting poly to go ns. I though that after ns I will chose to go pte sch to get my diploma but my father force me to continue studying using the same crap that if you don't at least get a diploma you will have no future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I forced myself to complete my diploma and enter ns. I was lucky to have a stay out unti work 8am to 5.30pm unit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My father took this opportunity to try to force me to take a part time degree. This time he use a new crap that when he was young his family was poor and he wanted to take a degree but couldn't as he had no money. I should be glad that he is willing to finance me to take a degree.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I told him I did not want to take a degree as I wanted to watch tv at night after my ns. I also told him that I don't want to spend so much time and money to take a degree as I am not confident of being able to find a good job even after I get a degree.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He scolded me saying that I have been addicted to tv since I was young and tv will ruin my future. He continued with new craps such as it was his money that I will spend if I take a degree so I don't need to be heartpain and he wanted me to take a degree so that he can boast to his relatives and friends that his son is smart can take a degree.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i refused to take a degree when I was in ns no matter what he say. I decide what I want to do in my life. I am no longer a puppet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After I ord I had a hard time finding a job due to me being a fresh graduate. I went for around 5 interview than get a job and even that job was a friend recommend me de. I am lucky that my friend helped to recommend me a job otherwise I maybe jobless until now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was very naive at that time. I believed in what my father said that as long as I have that paper I will have a good future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Until now I have worked 2 years already and changed a few jobs in the process.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i realise that my father and those adults only tell me half of the story. Yes you can be successful if you ahve that paper but they did not tell me that there is lots of office politics and hypocrities in the coporate world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He did not tell me that after taking that piece of paper I will have to try my luck at many interviews first before I manage to get a job and that job may not be what I want but I have to accept it because I have no other choice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He did not tell me that once I start working I will meet alot of hypocrities and that I will have to try to get along well with them otehrwise they will try to kick me out of the company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He did not tell me that I will need to polish the backside of my boss and collegue in order to survive in this world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He did not tell me that I must be able to apply what I study in school to my work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He did not tell me that I must be able to do well in my work, do lots of free OT and go back home late everyday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He did not tell me that I must be able to meet lots of targets.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He did not tell me that if I want to work long in the company and if I can't get along with my collegues than I will have to think of how to try to kick them out of the company or else it will be me who get kick out of the company.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He did not tell me that even if I get that piece of apper but I have lousy grades, during the interview the employer will chose the guy with the better grades than me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He did not tell me that piece of junk apper without working experience is just a junk piece of paper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He did not tell me that even if I had that piece of paper, the govt will bring in foreigners to fight for jobs with me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He did not tell me that even with that piece of paper, someone without that piece of paper who could speak better than me could get the job instead of me. A pretty lady who dress sexy during the interview can get the job instead of me even though she did not have that paper.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He did not tell me that even with that piece of paper and when the economy is bad like now, I will still not be able to find a job.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">When I was still a naive kid, all he told me was that as long as I get that piece of paper I will be able to get a good joba nd have a good career!</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">He made it sound so good and so easy but it was not such a case!</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">He painted such a good picture for me when I was a kid!</span></p>

              <p>Nothing in this world is easy. Paper qualifications is just something used to secure that interview to get a job. Without that and you won't even have interviews to try.</p>
              <p>Office politics are everywhere, didn't u learn anything in NS at all? Army politics are just as bad as offices in most cases.</p>
              <p>Alot of things requires experience to learn and not everything can be taught. I don't see much use to telling every young boy about the office politics etc they will face in future since its unavoidable and not something they will understand.</p>

              <p>It's not like his father want him to study hard, then next time can give him more money.</p>
              <p>But instead, his father is willing to finance him to take a degree, believing that he will lead a better life.</p>

              <p>this kind of thing no one will teach u wan. u will start to learn when u come out to the society and work, sometime u learn from your own experience and sometime u learn from other pple experience.</p>
              <p>there are also many old uncle and old aunty around, so when u encounter any problem. if u be polite and ask them for advice they might give u some pointer.</p>
              <p>better still if u can find a mentor and learn from him. </p>

              <p>Hey midlusionz, what happend to your compassionate talk in speaker's corner? as i can see, your still being a moron and a idiot who shoot his mouth off w/o thinking just like that time when you cause your tank to wipe. Do you ever spare a thought for the groupies that was with u?</p>
              <p>considering that he has been through working life and holding a job for the past 2 years, is he asking his parents to clear his way for him? i would assume that he is trying to imply that parents shldnt be too naive in thinking getting a cert is a one way trip to cushy stuff in life when the working life isn't what his father thought it out to be. Considering his father was telling him all this when he was a KID, you expect him, as a KID, not to believe? even if thats not his reason for posting this msg, i would lrn not to flame others unlike morons like you.  Before you teach others to lrn, lrn not to be a fucking loser first and wiped on heroics. </p>
