            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">Please give me advice. I really need help on this.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>I am 24 this year.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Currently I have a boyfriend of nearly 2 years. He is 28 years old but has no savings at all. He doesn't like to work, or rather doesn't like to work for people. He has this concept that you will never get rich or never get financial freedom or get out of the so called 'rat race' if you work for people as an employee. So his dreams and goals are to set up a business and be the richest man in the world with his pictures and stories all over the daily newspapers. All the while I support him with all my might and give him all my encouragement that I could. I am happy he has got such dreams and I believe he can do it if he puts in effort to fulfill his dreams. He has not been working for a year plus now and only survives on his bank savings of hundred plus. Although I have a job and I don't have to live on him and I have never asked for anything from him before, it seems like he is also doing nothing about his own life, a life that is without any savings and money. He keeps telling me that he has been hot on the balls everyday at home exploring the internet to search for his business inspirations. But when I asked him what ideas he has actually got from the internet, he told me he was having a rest for that day and was playing computer games at home, and said he needed more time. He is unable to tell me his progress and what he has done so far for his dreams.<br><br>He is also a person with a not-so-good temper, scolds and shouts at me sometimes over a small matter but usually will apologise after he cools down. I voice out this unhappiness and he promise me he will change but I have not yet seen any improvement so far.<br><br>He doesn't like my family and my friends. He said my parents didn't like him and my siblings were rude to him and that my family only cared about themselves. He said my friends showed attitude towards him. He firmly told me that after we got married, he would never want to have anything to do with my family and friends but he would not restrict my own interactions with them.<br><br>As a girl, I need stability and security for my future. Frankly speaking, I am not an unreasonable person and I have quite good temper and tolerance. I can easily tolerate with temperamental people, but surely not to the extent of being shouted at in public too frequently huh. My ties with my family and my friends are very important to me and I of course hope my future husband will treat them as importantly too.<br><br>Then, recently there is this guy who confesses that he likes me. He is my former colleague and everyone who has worked with him before knows he is a very diligent man, a very matured man, takes his job very seriously and has never one time slackened his responsibility at all. He is 26, got an average job, got much better temper, not as good looking as my current boyfriend and he is of bigger size and he smokes which my boyfriend doesn't. But overall. he is a very very nice guy, a person who can be trusted to be a good husband in future.<br><br>I am very at lost now... Should I take the risk and wait for my current boyfriend to succeed his dreams one day and no longer be a good-for-nothing like now, but for this I really don't know when he can make it and how long I will have to wait. Or should I go for the other guy who obviously has got better criteria now?<br><br>I am so at lost.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Can someone please give me an advice on who is good for me? Please tell me what to do.[color=green]</span>[/color]</div>

I would not make out comments on whether he'll make it one day, though SEEMINGLY very unlikely... Whether you want to stay with this bf of yours is all up to you... If might have some LOVE to gain, but PRICE to PAY as well.....<br><br>Regarding the 2nd guy.... I think it's only too early to tell if he would be suitable for you since both of you are currently not a pair... But this DECISION should be ANOTHER ISSUE altogether... IDEALLY after you've settled the issue of your bf....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i guess you still love yr bf at this moment. but tink for the long run, wat do u want from this relationship and where do you see it going.<br><br>imagine, 2 yrs down and he is still sitting around and pushing the mouse around on the table aimlessly. a few hunderds now won't last him long, at most till december <strong>2002</strong>. as a guy, i seriously can't face the world if pple found out that i'm literally living of my wife/gf. tink i'll have to drown myself to save face.<br><br>in order to start a family, there must be finiancial security. can he provide or are you going to become the sole bread winner and he the <span style="font-style: italic;">houseband</span>. if you can live wif tat, fine.<br><br>tink abt how he is treating you also. screaming and shouting at you? where is the sign of respect. this is juz the beginning. when you are married, he might even  start beating you, and you wanna end up getting a PPO? wat's the point?<br><br>unless he suddenly wakes up then i can see a point in carrying on this relation. love is love but sometimes you need some logic to carry on life. in an ideal world, you can juz choose to run away off into the sunset wif him and live happily ever after. sweet rite? welcome back to the non ideal world. we all need to work. the world revolves on money.<br><br>if you can't see the future wif him, then it's time to move on. it's no longer in jc where you are together juz becos you 'love' each other. it's not becos there's a better guy trying to jio you, but it's for yrself and yr future.<br><br><strong>FOR LOVE IS KNOWING WHEN TO WALK AWAY</strong><br><br>gd luck. choose wisely.<br></div>
