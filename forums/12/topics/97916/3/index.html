            <div class='col-md body'>Reasons for rejecting a guy:<br>1. Not the right time esp. when the girl is still studying cos  it is crucial to work hard to get a place in Uni. A r/s at this time will be too distracting. Very few can juggle both studies &amp; r/s esp. when sch. workload is heavy.<br><br>2. No chemistry. Some guys are not good at communicating.<br>U saw the show "For Love or Money'- Preston rejected the $1M girl Ali cos he don't feel comfortable with her.<br><br>3. Different family values, background, religion, race.<br><br>For reasons 2 &amp; 3- harder to overcome but 1- still got chance.<br><br>When a girl totally ignores or avoid u, then u better give up.<br>If she says no initially, she may change her mind if she is still on friendly terms with u.<br>How to win her is to be persistent but not pushy, be caring. U need not buy her expensive gifts but dun give only b/day card. It shows u are a cheapskate. Even frens give each other chocolates &amp; small presents.<br>Sometimes the girls want to test u.</div>
