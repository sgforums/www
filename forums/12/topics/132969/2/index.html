It occurred to me how my past views are echoed in these young people, whereas my own thoughts about love have changed.<br><br>I used to imagine that love will all be roses, that my bf will fetch me after classes (sometimes with roses in hand, of course <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> *giggles*), buys me soft toys, treats me to a meal at Denny's, candlelit dinner on V Day &amp; anniversaries, blah blah blah...  When there was a quarrel or argument, I'd get so upset &amp; break things off.  There was ONE difference, however, I was never 1 of those needy people <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  My 1st love once told me he was so lucky that I'd let him go out with his friends for boy's days out, etc...<br><br>I used to imagine that I'd marry a guy who's rich, driven, poised, (maybe a banker, or lawyer?) with a fancy car...  We'd work very hard together &amp; accumulate our wealth, then we'd enjoy holidays &amp; expensive meals, designer clothing, etc.  We zip around town in his fancy car.<br><br>I'm now 28 (fine, I'm NOT secretive about age, can?), &amp; after having relationships, I've realised what love, at least what works for me, is all about (to me also, it doesn't necessarily work for everybody).  I learnt about commitment, to give 100% in the relationship.  When there're problems, of course I get upset, but it isn't the end of the world, nor the end of the relationship.  I learnt Not to sweat the small stuff, &amp; when we argue (which is very seldom), 1 of us gives in pretty quickly, so that we don't stay upset for too long.<br><br>I learnt that the 1 for me doesn't necessarily need to be rich nor driven, as long as he spends time with me, &amp; he feels I'm perfect for him.  I learnt that I don't need candlelit meals for romance; dinners cooked by him are much more romantic, when I can hold him from the back whilst he's stirring in the ingredients, &amp; when he feeds me little morsels to taste.<br><br>I learnt that to spoil someone doesn't necessarily mean to buy little things for him now &amp; then, but to give him my attention, my time, my support &amp; my affection.  Hugs, kisses &amp; words of advice or just a listening ear are much better than a teddy bear soft toy.<br><br>I learnt how much he loves me, is also partly measured by how much he's willing to forgive me.........<br><br>I'm still learning everyday, &amp; I thank my guy for the lessons he taught me about love, forgiveness, tolerance &amp; being happy together.<br><br>Sorry for the long-winded blah blah blah, I'm just musing : )  Or day-dreaming, as he calls it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  And I do it when I'm happy : )<br><br>FeowFeow  </div></blockquote>fantastic feeling isn't it. the desire to love and to hold is reciprocated by your partner.<br><br>it is something that you only come across once, maybe twice, in one's life time. We read so much about the young people here pulling hairs of their head just to find practical measures just to please or rekindle the relationship with their gf/bf. what we learn from our age is all thing points to the maturity of the heart and mind.<br><br>just a rant.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Deportivo,<br><br>Yes, I agree to a great extent what you've mentioned below.  I would also like to add that it's also up to the individual.  Some young ones grow up still holding fast to the thoughts that they held during their youth, &amp; tt's probably sad, because they continue doing the same things, repeating the same errors, maybe?<br><br>Love, to me at least, isn't about taking desperate measures: the "Oh, I didn't change when you nagged at me 50 times in 6 months, but now that you want to leave me, I'll change within a day!" kinda thing happens so often, especially when I read the posts with people going, "How do I get her back?  I'm desperate!" etc...<br><br>From experience, I realise that those desperate measures don't last.  If a guy/girl really wanted to improve, he/she wouldn't have waited till you gave up on the relationship to try.  After awhile, they'll revert back to their old ways when they feel comfortable again.<br><br>Hence, I'm so appreciative of my guy, because he makes the effort, &amp; it makes it so easy for me to reciprocate his attention, support &amp; understanding.  Sometimes we do try to change &amp; improve, but when we fail, the other will always give a hug &amp; say, "I love you anyway for trying.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear c2on2,<br><br>Not everybody has the same needs &amp; wants in life.  When you were in primary school &amp; your teacher asked the class what they wanted to be when they grow up, some said policeman, some said doctor, some said scientist, right?<br><br>The same can be said of love &amp; relationships.  Some seek security, some seek comfort, some seek companionship, some seek fun, &amp; the list goes on.  When 2 people want different things out of a relationship, sometimes conflicts can happen.<br><br>I'm lucky to be able to find someone who has the same dreams &amp; is headed in the same direction as I am.  Perhaps 1 day, you'll find the same thing for yourself.  I didn't have this bliss in just 1 day, it was after broken hearts...  So don't give up hope nor be too despondent.  Trust me, 1 day the sun will shine.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by c2on2:</div><div class="quote_body">dear FeowFeow , ur love pespective and ur love life sure is sweet...<br>and envious.<br><br>mabbe u can read my thread and give me some advice / comments.<br><br>how i wish the gal that i love cherish the small little things which i had done for her and not keep on demanding that i do and change myself more to gain her acceptance and confidence in me.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote></div>
