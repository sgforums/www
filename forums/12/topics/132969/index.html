            <div class='col-md body'>Hi All,<br><br>I've read some things in this forum, as well as spoken to some younger people (including my nephew, who's 6 years younger than I).  It occurred to me how my past views are echoed in these young people, whereas my own thoughts about love have changed.<br><br>I used to imagine that love will all be roses, that my bf will fetch me after classes (sometimes with roses in hand, of course <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> *giggles*), buys me soft toys, treats me to a meal at Denny's, candlelit dinner on V Day &amp; anniversaries, blah blah blah...  When there was a quarrel or argument, I'd get so upset &amp; break things off.  There was ONE difference, however, I was never 1 of those needy people <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  My 1st love once told me he was so lucky that I'd let him go out with his friends for boy's days out, etc...<br><br>I used to imagine that I'd marry a guy who's rich, driven, poised, (maybe a banker, or lawyer?) with a fancy car...  We'd work very hard together &amp; accumulate our wealth, then we'd enjoy holidays &amp; expensive meals, designer clothing, etc.  We zip around town in his fancy car.<br><br>I'm now 28 (fine, I'm NOT secretive about age, can?), &amp; after having relationships, I've realised what love, at least what works for me, is all about (to me also, it doesn't necessarily work for everybody).  I learnt about commitment, to give 100% in the relationship.  When there're problems, of course I get upset, but it isn't the end of the world, nor the end of the relationship.  I learnt Not to sweat the small stuff, &amp; when we argue (which is very seldom), 1 of us gives in pretty quickly, so that we don't stay upset for too long.<br><br>I learnt that the 1 for me doesn't necessarily need to be rich nor driven, as long as he spends time with me, &amp; he feels I'm perfect for him.  I learnt that I don't need candlelit meals for romance; dinners cooked by him are much more romantic, when I can hold him from the back whilst he's stirring in the ingredients, &amp; when he feeds me little morsels to taste.<br><br>I learnt that to spoil someone doesn't necessarily mean to buy little things for him now &amp; then, but to give him my attention, my time, my support &amp; my affection.  Hugs, kisses &amp; words of advice or just a listening ear are much better than a teddy bear soft toy.<br><br>I learnt how much he loves me, is also partly measured by how much he's willing to forgive me.........<br><br>I'm still learning everyday, &amp; I thank my guy for the lessons he taught me about love, forgiveness, tolerance &amp; being happy together.<br><br>Sorry for the long-winded blah blah blah, I'm just musing : )  Or day-dreaming, as he calls it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  And I do it when I'm happy : )<br><br>FeowFeow</div>

It occurred to me how my past views are echoed in these young people, whereas my own thoughts about love have changed.<br><br>I used to imagine that love will all be roses, that my bf will fetch me after classes (sometimes with roses in hand, of course <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> *giggles*), buys me soft toys, treats me to a meal at Denny's, candlelit dinner on V Day &amp; anniversaries, blah blah blah...  When there was a quarrel or argument, I'd get so upset &amp; break things off.  There was ONE difference, however, I was never 1 of those needy people <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  My 1st love once told me he was so lucky that I'd let him go out with his friends for boy's days out, etc...<br><br>I used to imagine that I'd marry a guy who's rich, driven, poised, (maybe a banker, or lawyer?) with a fancy car...  We'd work very hard together &amp; accumulate our wealth, then we'd enjoy holidays &amp; expensive meals, designer clothing, etc.  We zip around town in his fancy car.<br><br>I'm now 28 (fine, I'm NOT secretive about age, can?), &amp; after having relationships, I've realised what love, at least what works for me, is all about (to me also, it doesn't necessarily work for everybody).  I learnt about commitment, to give 100% in the relationship.  When there're problems, of course I get upset, but it isn't the end of the world, nor the end of the relationship.  I learnt Not to sweat the small stuff, &amp; when we argue (which is very seldom), 1 of us gives in pretty quickly, so that we don't stay upset for too long.<br><br>I learnt that the 1 for me doesn't necessarily need to be rich nor driven, as long as he spends time with me, &amp; he feels I'm perfect for him.  I learnt that I don't need candlelit meals for romance; dinners cooked by him are much more romantic, when I can hold him from the back whilst he's stirring in the ingredients, &amp; when he feeds me little morsels to taste.<br><br>I learnt that to spoil someone doesn't necessarily mean to buy little things for him now &amp; then, but to give him my attention, my time, my support &amp; my affection.  Hugs, kisses &amp; words of advice or just a listening ear are much better than a teddy bear soft toy.<br><br>I learnt how much he loves me, is also partly measured by how much he's willing to forgive me.........<br><br>I'm still learning everyday, &amp; I thank my guy for the lessons he taught me about love, forgiveness, tolerance &amp; being happy together.<br><br>Sorry for the long-winded blah blah blah, I'm just musing : )  Or day-dreaming, as he calls it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  And I do it when I'm happy : )<br><br>FeowFeow  </div></blockquote>*Simple Bear filled with envy...<br><br>So sweet...cannt tahan...*tks a piece of chocolate and eat...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
