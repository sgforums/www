              <p>It is best you let her go. Meaning break up with your gf.</p>
              <p>You are bored with the "predictability" in this relationship.</p>
              <p>Many people get bored after a while. So what you are going through is very common, as this is your first gf.</p>
              <p>With predictability, comes stability. So you have to be able to give up the "stable" life you have now.</p>
              <p>You must be wondering why other people doesn't mind the life you have now. It's because they've experienced "unpredictability" in their life before, that's why they are able to "cherish" the monotonous life which you so want to leave.</p>
              <p>Leave this girl, let other guys who are ready for a stable relationship have her. It's unfair to her if you hold on the relationship for your own selfish reason.</p>
              <p>You need to go out there and explore first. Get this "curiousity" out of your system.</p>
              <p>Have fun. Regrets you will have a few, but without it you will not be able to cherish the good which will come later in your life.</p>

              <p>you should not meet your gf everyday, that is where the main problem lies.even if you have miss universe as your girlfriend, if you meet her everyday, you will be bored of her very quickly. unless you are married then it is a different case. and we all need our own space and time to do other things in our life. life is more than just working and meeting gf/bf.</p>
              <p>recommended to meet her for 2 or max 3 times a week for dating. not just meet to hang out. staying overnight at your gf place is also not good. stay in your parent's house. you can get back your freedom.</p>
              <p>why are you sending her to school everyday? is she in a wheelchair? she does not know her way to school? just meet her for dating. the rest of the time, let her do her own stuff and do not disturb her.</p>
              <p>why are you being intimate with other girls in the club? you are a cheater. since you do not love your girlfriend anymore, just break off with her. don't lie to her over and over again and cheat on her.</p>

              <p>1) i agree with you that you are bored with life..but life is something about choices that we make, I cannot teach you what I have been through but love is something you got to learn and experience it yourself.</p>
              <p>2) Lets change the story abit, your gf asked you to stop coming to her house, she lied to you that she is sleeping at home but in fact was out partying with guys and had one night stand with them..</p>
              <p>How would you feel if one day you saw your gf having sex with another guy behind the bushes near your house? Before you say it never happens, I got a friend whose gf did just that and he thought she was a good gal. She got pregant with another guy's baby and got the guts to force my friend to accept the baby was his. I was so mad at her that I slap her for what she is doing my friend and shouted at her for being so heartless for treating my friend as a dumping ground. She was so scared that she ran away.</p>
              <p>3) For first time relationship like yours is easier to stray cos you are not ready to settle down for one gal. Is tough so if you do not think you can just go on with your current life is best to let her go.</p>
              <p>4) My suggest is this, take one month away from her no contact, no meeting I seriously mean totally nothing at all with her. This will test yourself if you truly in love her or is time to leave her. If after 1 month  you cannot bear the heart pain and go back to her that means she meant something in your heart. If not you are ready to go.</p>
