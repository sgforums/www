I'm not sure if there are other causes, but I'm sure stress is a major contributor.<br><br>It will not go away simply because you remove them by plucking. You don't see white hairs on the elderly disappearing, do you? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Please don't bother so much about what your friends say! If their comments really bother you, you can go to a hair salon and dye it black or dark brown [presuming your school does not allow the dyeing of hair]. Alternatively you can do it at home, with a box of DIY hair dyeing stuff for less than $15.<br><br>Your wavy hair cannot be fixed unless you rebond it, but the frizzyness can be controlled with the use of SERUM. There are alot of brands of serum out there, such as St Ives. I think I bought mine at $15.<br><br>I have white hair too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> But I only pluck those that show up on the outside. Gonna dye 'em some other color after leaving JC. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The hair will be there permanently lah. The only thing you can do now is to control your level of stress and manage stress properly. Don't sleep too late also. Then the white hair will not come out so much.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what you can do is to use a fixed brand of shampoo and not switch just becoz the other has a special offer or something. Get something for 'damaged hair' type of shampoo. NOT guaranteed to work, but at least it helps to improve the hair quality.<br><br>it is hereditary, even if u don't believe it. it can be cause to recessive alleles in your genes. For example, it is possible for a child to have O blood type when his biological parents are both A type or B type. The reason for your premature hair whitening may be explained by this.<br><br>most importantly, you have to accept yourself for what you are, because we have no control over how we are going to look, how to digest your food, how we think [even], how many times your heart has to beat etc. Just as we have no control on how to stop our hair from whitening, and don't tell me hair dye. Loving and accepting yourself is more important than whether or not your peers accept you. Best wishes</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear BlueberryJam,<br><br>I have white hair too, and it started when I was abt 14-15 years old. The reason? I also dunnoe leh.....even till today. But the funny thing is my brothers (3 + me) all have white hair, its just that some have slightly more and the youngest one have a few only. I have checked with my parents, and i'm sure its not inherited from them cos they do not have them when young.<br><br>My is still not so bad, esp when I'm a guy (mid 20s now). I keep my hair short so it doesn't really look obvious, esp under sunlight. Tried plucking them when young, and of cos it does not work. So think u better stop.<br><br>If you are talking abt food, hey I'm, exactly like you, seldom eat vegetables...... but dun think this is the reason cos I got a female friend who's a vegetarian and has some white hair as well. Might be something to do wif MSG in the food also.<br><br>I do think a lot though, much of a thinker myself, thus guess this is the reason why I have white hair. I personally believe its one of the reason, though i cannot 100% be sure. Yes, so its important to think less, sleep well etc.<br><br>I understand that as a young girl, in fact gers of all age do want to look nice, and be good looking. I fully understand your agony, cos like you, friends keep laughing at me when I'm ard your age. But then as I was too lazy to do anything, I just leave it alone. Soon get use to all the remarks and felt its nothing. But then, sorry for beinf frank but I do understand that if a ger got white hair, then, the case will be slightly different from guy.<br><br>Why i say this u might say. Like I say again, dun meant to hurt you, just being frank, and to share. Help if possible but not too sure how to. There's a saying a ger's hair is a ger's life. In fact a lot of gers look good cos of shiny healthy hair, thus understand the part of wanting dark beautiful hair. If the ger got white hair, the easiest way is to keep it short. If wanted to keep longer hair, require a lot of trouble and effort. And of cos money involve.<br><br>I personally feel that if you would want to keep your hair longer (which I'm sure will make you look much lovelier), you have to constantly dye your hair yourself, at home maybe cos cheapest way. This is the easiest way out. Make it a habit like once in a mnth kind of dyeing lor, guess its not so bad.<br><br>I also saw before some chinese medicated shampoo which they claimed that after using for some time, your hair will turn black. This, I see b4, but never tried before so not too sure if it will work. Guess one negative point of such shampoo is the smell i guess. Not sure.<br><br>Really, I hope you will not be too troubled by this. But if you really choose to keep your hair longer, my suggestion are as above. Hope it helps.<br><br>Like I say earlier, I understand your agony, but there's really not much you and I can do abt it anyway. All the best to you, and hopefully u r able to find better solutions than what I had suggested.<br><br>Hey, I wanted to look good as well you know. Heh....so if you got very very good idea, or solutions, pls share with us. Take care Jammy!<br><br>Regards</div>
