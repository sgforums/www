              <p>Practically, nobody is all favourite unless he is a sucker-up to everyone. Tons of these kinda people in my school because there is too much importance placed on having friends. So just be yourself although that could DEFINITELY cost you some "friends". Or alternatively,  you could be a sucker up with no mind and policies and moral fibres of your own and look popular.</p>

              and not with your nonsense comments.</p>
              <p>Next time hor...make sure you see and double-check the name of
