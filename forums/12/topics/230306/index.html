All monetary issues shall be oversees by your sister. Your BIL is really too much. The money he lost is what many normal citizen might not be able to earn in his/her life time. The sum was huge!<br><br>If your BIL is said that he've lost all the money to stocks/shares, well, ask for the prove. Do every account to show that he really lost that amount of money. If he couldn't show his prove, then maybe it's another scam which have been planned for years. Your BIL could be cheating your sister's and your familys' money.<br><br>As for the 3rd party, I think maybe you should run a check on him. And BEWARE of the 3rd party, he might use the trick where many men would use. Men will try to attack a women when the security is low. This is like a trojan house implanted into your computer without you knowing. He might be using this to get close you sister.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by greenribbons:</div><div class="quote_body">I am on the verge of exasperation advising my sister and the situation is so sticky I do not know how to do so.<br><br>My sister got married just a month ago in Dec. Now she has moved out of her husband's home and is living on her own in a rented apartment.  In addition, she is now seeing this new guy. Our parents are aware of the situation that she is seeing someone else but are not aware that she has moved out on her own. They are very concerned about my sister but they are not sure what they should ask her to do.<br><br>The Condomimium<br>She and BIL bought a condominium jointly just before the wedding. However the transaction was not completed until recently. 2 weeks after the wedding when he had no choice because it was time to apply for the bank loan and my sister asked why the loan amount had increased by $100+k, BIL  spilled the beans on her that he had lost all the money which had been in his safekeeping in the warrants/options markets. This includes $30k given by his parents for buying the house and $50k of my sister's money which my sister had given to him for the purchase, in addition to a remaining $30k of his own money. The money was lost over the period of 2 years in which he threw in more and more cash in order to recoup back his losses. My sister loved and trusted him so much she had given the $50k to him as she did not want him to look bad in our parents eyes when they checked the transaction records, especially since we come from a well to do family while he is from an ordinary background. My parents had insisted on buying it on a % share basis and not on joint ownership which is a 50% share.<br><br>After the discovery, it was all downhill, problem after problem as not only the loan amount had to be adjusted but the bank refused to grant the loan in BIL's name as well citing bad records and litigation records. The loan had to eventually be taken fully in her name and the lodgement of the title deeds had to be changed resulting in addition stamp fees of thousands of dollars. In addition, the completion date was in jeopardy and on the day my sis left for her honeymoon, the lawyer rushed down to the airpot to get her signatures at the last minute. She was very harried and extremely stressed.<br><br>The condominium is now 100% in my sister's name and she is servicing the loan entirely on her own. While financially this is not a problem (the loan amount is very small still), emotionally, my sister remains very hurt and my mum rather disturbed about the situation. This is taking its toll on me.<br><br>The situation has hurt my sister deeply as she and BIL have a 8 year relationship. While they did split a few times over the 8 years, they decided to get married as he has always been sweet and giving to my sister and he gave his word that he is clean of shares when they got back together. My BIL was so involved in shares in university that he owed a quarter milllion bucks when he graduated and has been servicing the sum for some time. During their 8 years together, he promised not to go back to shares but each time, she found he did. Eventually after she left him and saw someone else, he asked her to come back marry him and promised he was clean of shares and had paid back everything as his Dad had struck 4D and given him some money to settle down. She went back.<br><br>My sister never expected that he would hide a secret so big for 2 whole years while they were preparing for the marriage. She also not expected that each time she asked (which was very frequently) he would tell her he was free of shares and the money was intact (even though he had withdrawn the $50k fixed deposit long before maturity. My sister told me he even assured her that he would withdraw the money and asked her not to go down to the bank on maturity day!). In addition, he would always swear that he would never touch the housing money because it was precious and for their new life.<br><br>BIL wants another chance but my sister is reluctant. He has gone from being frustrated, angry, upset to calm and giving now. Since she moved out, BIL is resigned to her no longer returning to his side and while he makes it a point to check on her daily via sms, make sure she eats and stuff, he is coping well with the situation because BIL is the sort who can take things easy (as evidenced by the fact that he was able to keep a difficult secret for 2 years and go through with the wedding even in deceit). He has accepted that my sister may never return but says he is concerned about the reliability of the 3rd party. My sister is messy and unsure what she can do now and I am not sure what I should ask her to do.<br><br>The 3rd Party<br>My sister knew this guy friend of hers long before a wedding but she had never been keen on him. A couple of weeks before her wedding, she met him for lunch to pass him an invite. Somehow, sparks flew and the guy courted her despite her impending marriage. My sister was clearly at fault to get caught up and go along with it. After the wedding, she found it difficult to let go. While the relationship at the point in time was not entirely that of friends, it was not to the point of sex. My sister made the decision to let go of him shortly into her marriage before she learned about the gambling problem because she felt it was not going to head anywhere. But in her darket hour she returned to the 3rd party when she broke down on the knowledge of BIL's deception. My sister is clearly at fault as well in having allowed her emotions run wild. However, the existence of the 3rd party has helped her most greatly in her most sorrowful hours.<br><br>This 3rd party is a very ordinary guy. Nothing special in my opinion. Works long hours with barely any free time due to nature of job and after work goes with friends to chill. I am concerned about his nite life habit but he has told my sis its cos he does not want to go back to the room and be alone (he is non local so lives alone and rents a simple room). I am questioning the integrity of this guy friend of hers given that he courted her despite the fact that she was getting married and asked her to walk out on the wedding. I do not know very much about him and I suspect my sister has still a lot to learn about him. I am worried for her and worried he will hurt her again in the further future should she choose a path with him.<br><br>He is taking care of her now as she moved into an apartment which is close to the apartment he lives in (my sis moved there cos its close to her workplace). In addition, their relationship has progressed beyond what it was. He wants to take care of her and eventually marry her. While I am not doubting his intentions to marry her, I am worried about the longer term, after the marriage, will there be skeletons in the closet? And will he let me sister down - perhaps find another girl given that I do not have high opinions of his integrity since he had the heart to be a 3rd party? Am I being too harsh?<br><br>I am at my wits end of how to help? Should she give her husband another chance, remembering that she has given him umteenth chances or should she let go and move on? And if she should let go, is this new guy worth it - given that he had the heart to chase her 1 week before she was getting married? Both guys are very good to her.</div></blockquote>Not up to you to decide at this point.</div>

Whether one finds superiority over the other (in your view), would be influenced by what values you (as the third party performing this balancing act) hold in higher regard, and equally, what negative traits you detest more - for example:<br><br>Weighing the positive:<br>BIL - long term relationship<br>New Guy - fresh start<br><br>Weighing the negative:<br>BIL - deceptive<br>New Guy - seemingly without morals or values (i.e. chasing before wedding)<br><br>Of course you would find that such positive/negative values tend to veto each other; above all, you should be guided by your own raw instinct, whilst taking into the account the feelings of your sister.<br><br>I would also add that long term relationships that have been broken by deception usually remain irrepairable - sometimes a fresh start is the only alternative; equally, something new may prove just as, or even worse than the preceding deception. It is for you to decide which holds greater truth.<br><br>Personally, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">based on my own values and beliefs</span>, I think your sister should stay with your BIL; she could prevent any future incidences by being more careful - it will be good reason for her to monitor their finances. I must admit that I feel that your sister, BIL and the new guy have more or less resigned to a number of conclusions:<br><br>1) Your sister has more feelings (emotionally) for the new guy<br>2) Your BIL recognises this; so does the new guy<br><br>However, because of this new guy's sudden foray and very probably destructive entry, it sounds all too fishy for me to think him as a man of integrity and good standing worthy of your sister. Your sister probably has a little girly crush on him, and that can very possibly be attributed to the fact she is bored with your BIL - the so called "X* year itch" (*X = numerical value, some people say 2, some people say 7).<br><br>Hence, my conclusion. I do not think your BIL is that great (in fact, I think he is no bloody good); rather, I think that the NG is absolute trouble - to the extent that your BIL is much better in comparison.<br><br>Good luck!</div>

We could undermine his integrity for courting a woman who is about to get married, but honestly, with regards to affairs of the heart, one could always argue that so long as he/she is not married, he/she is still available!  he might just be a guy who recognises what he wants and pursues them with much determination?<br><br>Methink, so long as he has a good track record, why not let time do the talking?   Dont over-worry for the mean time.  Of course, it will never harm to be more cautious.</div>
