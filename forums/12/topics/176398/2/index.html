Im sorry to say that u may have little chance of saving it once u made mistakes with gals.<br><br>1st, u said she knew u liked her. U cud have acted in a way that suggests that u are not interested in her. Talk to her other friends instead of her only.<br><br>Then u said u met up almost everyday. So whos the one making the appointments? U or her? Or is it a group outing? It's already hard to tell if a gal is interested in u in a one-on-one outing, let alone group outing.<br><br>U made a bad move by talking to her on MSN. U seem like u are too eager to strike a conversation with her dude. Play it cool. U seem despo. Don't talk to her everytime u see her online. And don't talk to her for so long in MSN. Don't act like u come online jus to talk to her.<br><br>U said u confessed ur feelings. Dude, bad move again. Don't act like u are so desperate for her even if u are inside. U confessed in the hope of getting her..but u know what? It turns her off! So next time u see a gal u like, dun ever confess to her. U have to see if she really likes u!<br><br>So what even if she ''says'' has a good impression of u? What she says may not be what she really means. She can have a good impression of many guys..but it does not mean she likes u!<br><br>Hey, here's what u can do:<br>Option 1: Don't go her friend's house.

            <div class='col-md body'>my friend said, if i dont want to give up. i had best leave her alone for some time, like 1month or so? then slowly start talking to her again. but must take it slow and easy. you think i can do it? you think this idea will work? this is a long term plan. short term plan i still dont know how. wahaha...<br>except that sat i go to her friend house, i will mix with the rest too. i will try and forget i like her and just treat her as a friend.<br><br>then for my birthday, if she dont ask me out, i shall not ask her out too.<br><br>valentine day...i think i should just forget about it too.<br><br>then see how? i will constantly update this thread.<br><br>just got the song she wanted so much. should i send her tonight? just send and not talk? haiz... when it comes to this kind of problems, my super indecisiveness shows all.</div>
