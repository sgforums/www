And worst there are numerous other suitors also courting her and currently I think she already has one in mind but is unknown who that guy is (in my circle of friends too sighz  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> )</div>

See it as experience.<br><br><strong>2) But if she tells you that she is uncomfortable with the attention youÂ’ve been giving her but is willing to give you more timeÂ…</strong><br><br>Start doing the right things. Give less attention to her. Quality over Quantity.<br><br>Give her time to wonder about you. DonÂ’t suffocate her.<br><br><strong>DonÂ’t suddenly act cool. </strong><br><br>She will know that you are trying to play some clumsy game and that will make you look stupid.<br><br>Nothing changes when you talk to her. Just give her less attention because you are going to be busy with other things in your life. Be busy!<br><br>But make each meeting with her count.<br><br>Good luck<br></div>

In fact u are actually decreasing ur chances.<br><br>Dun hold her hands, touch shoulder, legs or any part of the body at all.<br><br>Dun boast abt urself and ur own achievements.<br><br>Dun talk abt other gals in ur own conversations.

Insensitivity is often a BIG 'no no' especially towards a girl you've yet to establish a stable connection with... Your eagerness might have overlooked how she could be feeling over things and your actions.. She've got friends to face, probably questions to answer in regards to you... So long as you're not yet in a relationship with her, she'll be out battling all these alone... THINK about it...<br><br>An APOLOGY is when you feel SORRY for something.. Shouldn't be too quick to put as in "CAN YOU GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE...??"... APOLOGISE <strong>ONLY</strong> if you're SORRY to her....<br><br>What's the point of you 'apologising' to her when you don't even know why the heck are you doing it... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>
