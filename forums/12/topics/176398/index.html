The relationship is extremely raw and vulnerable, even to a scratch and is usually caused by Uranus transiting effect.<br><br>I recommend setting your pace slower, but not abandoning the initial drive completely because chances are, it will have adverse effect if you jam brake. In simple, don't pause and give her all the freewill and space, instead give allowance, but maintain your stand. In reality, this 'mistake' is pretty fatal because even if you succeeded in getting her, negative unseen effect will spill over into your BGR. You don't really experience this negativity head-on, rather, it is likely be a highest common factor that give rise to later conflicts and issues.<br><br>Go with the plan; meet up at your friend's house (and especially watch your body language: Don't be so eager - don't gaze, but maintain good friendship contact. Care physical distance - don't avoid, yet don't hang too close). Plan what you want to say to her. Here are some pointers to take note:<br><br>I) Don't get too emotional. Wild emotions are like untamed stallions - they are dangerous. Judging you from my perspective, you are probably someone who can't control emotions well, so don't get into a situation where you get all emotional and loses your position. You must control your stance properly if you hope to achieve anything.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]Appear professional even if you know nothing.</span></strong><br><br>II) Less of 'Me' and more of 'You' type of communication. Yes, I know you love her, etc - but it's all self absorbed. You must devise a way to allow her (even if it is only an illusion) to think that she has some freewill in making decisions and that the choice she make (which is you) is a good decision BECAUSE you made her feel that it it will be.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Basically, your 'hard selling' must succeed in persuading her.</strong></span><br><br>III) State timing to counter indecisiveness. If you sense that she is backing out with confusion, put time into the picture. (E.g. Yes, we understand that things are getting too fast, we shall give ourselves another 30 days to decide).<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Knowing how to sell is useless if you don't know how to close the deal. </strong></span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers   [/b]</blockquote>aunty yun the best sia. lol. give sooooo indepth stuff. i have a hard time understanding. but if it is so easy to understand, how useful can it get? haha. thanks. but the less of me and more of you type of communication...very hard. i cant get her to talk more about herself.<br><br>and decisions, so far when we go out, most of the decisions are made by her.</div>

Im sorry to say that u may have little chance of saving it once u made mistakes with gals.<br><br>1st, u said she knew u liked her. U cud have acted in a way that suggests that u are not interested in her. Talk to her other friends instead of her only.<br><br>Then u said u met up almost everyday. So whos the one making the appointments? U or her? Or is it a group outing? It's already hard to tell if a gal is interested in u in a one-on-one outing, let alone group outing.<br><br>U made a bad move by talking to her on MSN. U seem like u are too eager to strike a conversation with her dude. Play it cool. U seem despo. Don't talk to her everytime u see her online. And don't talk to her for so long in MSN. Don't act like u come online jus to talk to her.<br><br>U said u confessed ur feelings. Dude, bad move again. Don't act like u are so desperate for her even if u are inside. U confessed in the hope of getting her..but u know what? It turns her off! So next time u see a gal u like, dun ever confess to her. U have to see if she really likes u!<br><br>So what even if she ''says'' has a good impression of u? What she says may not be what she really means. She can have a good impression of many guys..but it does not mean she likes u!<br><br>Hey, here's what u can do:<br>Option 1: Don't go her friend's house. Don't act like u are so desperate to see her. Say u got plans. Don't give her a call or sms her. Don't talk to her online.<br>Don't do anything. Give her a chance to breathe.(Highly recommended)<br><br>Option 2: Go to her friend's house. Talk to her but make it a very brief conversation.  Then talk to other gals also. Talk to other people. Then leave the house early. Say u are busy and got to go. And same thing, dun contact her anymore.<br><br>Give her space!</div>
