            <div class='col-md body'>heys.. sorry to hijack this thread blade. sigh.. i have visited this forum for so long.. loved surfing around, lots of interesting stuff for me to comment, but nothing like this one. i m really close to tears. i can't help but dump my work aside and just post here. really my case is worse than yours.. im so glad that urs has ended so soon. for me.. i guess i have to really get over it. i guess all guys go thru this stage. what hurts most is that the sincerity/love is never reciprocated. your first love is gone. thats the case for me.. worst.. it has gone on since the start of last year.. i really really hate the position i m in now. maybe this is a rant, but it is a good place to rant. maybe just a warning to others too.. my story is really exactly like yours. crush, rush, but then with more rushing, confessing, braking, stupid apologies, attention giving. like u guys said, it seriously killed the seduction.<br><br>we probably started out the same. crush blah blah. already 5 months into the year. we did not spend much time with each other cos we have our own cliques after all, nor gone on dates, yet we still shared a lot of fun moments playing sports.. studying together outside of school hours. msn chats into the night. rumors aflying. but i guess i was exactly like you blade.. way too rushed. declared my feelings after that 5 months. at first it was really rejected.. she wanted friendship. but then she changed her mind, sent me such a mind-numbing email that she actually lied. i was in ecstacy really.. my best days yet. in just one week things took for the worst. sighhh.. she just started ignoring me cos maybe i was too possesive.. i wanted to show all my care and concern for her. just give her my all to show her. yet the stupid BOY in us overtakes us. i felt dumb. stupid. FELT SO SORRY to her although i did not know what i did wrong. then sent her yet another email that i would stop all these.. and i was sorry.. sorry.. blah blah blah. of course she remained cold and even read it only like a few days later.  guess that was the stupid jam brake i took. really dumb.. wish i did not let go of her. yet this feeling of regret is killing me. it has tortured me since that day. but wait.. the story is not even over.<br><br>overall, she just gave me mixed signals. BAD. mostly on her blog.  i was.. such a dumb arse thinking too much. i couldn't get over her at all. 5 months is not that a short period right? maybe 2 more months after that, i really wanted to set things straight. i asked.. and asked... only got half-hearted answers. i guess im a dumb$@#. the subtle rejections went on for maybe 5 more times. all these times i was really dedicated to her. but i might have seemed desperate. sigh. and yet her rejection to me was followed by more intense blogging directed to me about all kinds of stuff... stuff that would make me not give her up.. cos she had feelings for me.  everytime she gave me that kind of signal, i just felt 10x more dedicated to chase her.<br><br>i can't elaborate more. lets just say i told myself in my mind that i would never ever give her up maybe 10 times.. i was given mixed signals all the while.. been deluded whatever. all because of that mistake of not taking things slowly.. of chasing her. i believed i only needed sincerity. at that time of the year, people were already being steady. maybe that led to my belief. all i wanted was to be sincere, yet girls are like that.. they don't mean what they say. sigh. i oso did dumb things for her. far worse than stars sort of. besides Vdays.. bday presents.. i even did a stitch for her, wrote a 5 page long sincere letter to her. just describing everything that i felt. all that i felt thruout that one year. of course this happened this year. and then the crushing blow which i just REFUSE TO BELIEVE. she wrote that she was like never interested in me? that she never referred to me in her blog? im quite crushed now.. can't believe 1 year of futility just like that. to this day i just adore her. everything about her is beautiful, yet i have to see her everyday. it is really torturing my to put on a false front. on one hand i want to love her and not pester her like i surely would have by being aggressive. yet on the other hand i want to shout and scream at her for leading me on, or just go on my knees and ask for forgiveness (which maybe iis too rushed and dumb) for another chance. i really don't know.. its killing me... the past one year she SURELY must have known my feelings, yet now her heart is as hard as stone, as cold as ice. talks to me like a normal friend. but always giving my that secret peep off her eyes now and then. i don't know what to do. i don't believe that she has no interest at all.. i don't want to just stop things because i know things willl not happen naturally now. yet i don't want to hurt her. things are going fine for her. shes studying much harder now.. things are goign alright for her. she doesn't seem to need me. yet now i need her the most.. the most....<br><br>thru all these u all might think that i only think of myself. that is simply not the case at all. lets just say those periods of rejection was when she was at her lowest. i could really tell. i told myself over and over again that it was not about me but about us. i was over the idea of a glam relationship, for lust or whatever. i just wanted to give my love, share my life with someone. i wanted to really be with her and lift her up. yet things are the reverse now. i can't possible spill everything that has happened to me can i? why do girls seem fickle minded all the time.. why?!!<br><br>sorry.. this is aunt agony after all. may all guys in the world grow up learning from their experiences. glad for u blade.. hope u can get over her asap.. really lots of girls out there for you and me. but given my circumstances, now i only want one girl. i don't know when i can get that out of my head when it is being tested every single day. if i got a dollar for everytime i thought of her, i would like be a millionaire.<br><br>i guess its true.. nan ren bu huai, nu ren bu ai. bad guy not bad, women no love.<br><br>i WISH for a world in which only sincerity was all that mattered. i hate the superficiality of chasing girls.. putting on false fronts. i don't mind the effort put into girls, but really why can't things be simple? why do things have to be learnt the hard way?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, one way I find it useful is to try to like her in another way. Since is unable to like her as a gf why not like her as a good friend? I can still stay by her side, lend her my support when needed, stand by her when she is down, and still have fun chatting and going out with her. Though the level of closeness is not there, but it's still alot better than the cold barriers that she puts up to limit contacts with me when she knows that I'm still courting her.<br><br>Like what Dokono said to me a few pages back:<br>Let go, we have to let go. Even though how we hated to do it but we still have to face it sooner or later.</div>
