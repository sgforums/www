From what I see, there's no indication of attraction.<br><br>However, the point about her going down to Chinatown to buy herbs for you is a bit puzzling. Does she do that for her female friends as well? Or is she by nature, a helpful person?<br><br>Let me tell you that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">some</span> girls just wanna have guys as their <strong>good friends</strong>, not boyfriends. But guys always get the wrong idea, and blame them for giving the wrong impression. Actually, it's the guys' fault, because they're so 'into' BGR that they cannot accept friendship from the opposite gender.<br><br>If you want a more precise answer, ask a close female friend of yours to analyse your situation. She will definitely be able to tell you much more than I can. Why? Simply because I'm not a female  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
