            <div class='col-md body'>If abortion is to be considered a choice in such a situtation...<br><br>Where do we draw the line, finally? When is it okay to abort and not to abort? Is the fetus just a mere piece of tissue to be gotten rid of because it has the ability to affect one's style of life?<br><br>If abortion can be considered a way out of this, why not kill born babies that parents lack the ability to bring up? After all, medical technology has advanced to such a point that many aborted babies would have survived if they had been born at the point in the pregnancy, instead of aborted. But yet, will I'm sure killing a baby is something many would object to here, and is a repungant and discusting act, killing a baby of the same age in the womb remains for many a legal, and acceptable choice, even one which many fiercely fight for.<br><br>The truth is, abortion is a repungant and discusting act, the termination of in many causes, a perfectly normal and developing human that would end up like you or me. To draw up the argument that abortion would be prefered rather then to bring up the baby in an environment in which is taxing on the parents and child, is prehaps saying that many of the people from the low income and poor families, along with adopted children all around the world should have been exterminated long ago, as if their life held no value and should have been gotten rid off instead of being a burden to us.<br><br>To those who advocate abortion as freedom of choice, have you considered the implications of your stance? If we have the right to decide based on an ASSUMPTION of future hardships (nonsense considering that Singapore soceity has plenty of support for such cases), to terminate a human life, then where is the line drawn? What difference does a baby born make? When many of it's kin, indeed, many, have been aborted at the same, or older age?<br><br>Why end there? Why don't we have "mercy killings" for your ah kong and ah ma, since they no longer input into soceity and are just a burden to you, hinder your future finances, and make you "suffer"? Why not kill retarded and handicapped people? Why waste money and resources supporting such useless lives? This is the essence of abortion, the "freedom" of choice to literally play god and recklessly cheapen and regard human life as nothing more then a factor in our future, and uncertain, quality of life.<br><br>There really is no debate here. To abort a baby because of future finances or studies would be to justify me going over and cutting off your right arm because I think that you could outdo me in the exams, and hence impact on my future. Abortion in Singapore, especially for many of the reasons given, is simply weak, shallow, poorly-thought out and shows your discusting lack of concern for both mother and child.</div>

Why not follow this line of "think of yourself and no one else" reasoning to it's logical conclusion? Why stop at unborn babies? Why not legalize infantacide? Make it legal for parents to kill their young infants lah. After all, there is no real difference between a newborn infant and a partial birth abortion baby.<br><br>If you dare raise this line of reasoning, then you must concede and admit that infantacide is justifiable, as well as ethical. Do you dare propose that? Are you even human?<br><br>To even dare to raise this line of reasoning shows that you are a basal, shallow person who does not care if lives are scattered or ruined in the wake of your pursit of worthless pleasure as you would like to define it.<br><br><blockquote><strong>giving birth to a child if u really could not afford to is going to destroy both ur lives and also cause the child to suffer next time...</strong></blockquote>Excuse me, what is your defination of suffering that you dare to put up here? That the parents cannot afford to send the child to top JCs, that they have to give up their young partying ways (which they have to give up in ten years anyway) to take care of the child and miss on out education that would have gotten them a job that would allow them to earn a BMW? Tell me seriously, what is your defination of a suffering existence? Especially IN RELATIVELY AFFULENT SINGAPORE?<br><br>You so you can't afford the 5Cs because of your "unwanted" child (incredibly ironic conisdering 2 million couples around the world want a child badly and many times that number are aborted!). Is any of the 5Cs, Cash, Credit Card, Condo, Car, Country Club, worth destroying a human life over? Where do you draw the line in your selfish, inhuman reasonings? Is there no end to your perversity and depravity? Has materialism blinded you to the true innate value of human life as something to be treasured EVERYTIME, and not just as we feel like it.<br><br>How would you like it if soceity defined your worth as a human being based on their own whims and wane? That one moment you were allowed to exist but the next you are nothing more then a piece of tissue to be cut away and discarded due to some weak, selfish reasoning?<br><br>Raising an unborn child is suffering? Nobody said it would be easy, but then, to soft backboned people like you, I suppose giving up the materialistic and depraved Singaporean dream of getting an education and slogging at a job till you die is considered big suffering. (ever being to somalia? maybe your arguments would sell better there) but many, and most unintended parents who decided to have their child anyway can tell you that their children are worth every penny and hardship and are not pieces of tissue to be cut away for $400. I say this because I have many friends who were almost snuffed out in the womb as well.<br><br>Have you raised any point that is valid?<br><br>No.<br><br>You have only demostrated the inarticulatable dept of depravity and shallow, selfish materialism that is your character.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by KiMMi:</div><div class="quote_body">wad if u are raped... den he shoot inside... den u are pregnant with his kid? will u abort?</div></blockquote>By the way I am male, and very strongly against the notion of abortion even in serious eventualities such as rape.<br><br>A real man would never even consider cohercing his partner into abortion. Only cowards and creeps take advantage of the lady's fragile emotional state to get a way out.<br><br>Why is there a need for abortion in the event of rape? Is the child at fault? Should the child spill blood for the errors of another? Is is impossible to love such a child bore of crime? IS THERE ANY REDEMPTIVE VALUE in the death to heal the crime? Abortion is added insult to the lady on top of the violation that is rape. And as I said, even if you cannot love your child, there are 2 million couples worldwide who can. Abortion is totally needless, and robs everybody in the end.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong>wad if u noe.. ur baby is deformed? will u keep? or will u abort?<br><br>some of the points to consider b4 makin ur stand....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </strong></blockquote>Once again, it is prudent to know that should the infant be deformed, the body usually gets rid it by miscarrying (natural abortion). The truth is, only a very, very small number of births have serious defects. Most births are prefectly normal, and hence it's good to note that deformities is hardly a big pro argument for abortion.<br><br>Back to the topic, I still don't see why abortion is such a big option is this case. Modern technology means that most fetal deformities can be corrected or managed after birth. Just because a person isn't perfect does not mean you have to throw it away. Abortion should only be considered as a last ditch, and agonizing option, after all others have been used up, when there is immediate danger to the mother.<br><br>Abortion after all, is a radical procedure, and certainly not something we dispense daily for $400.</div>

What you are doing is risking her life and future. What if something bad happens? What if she never gets pregnant again? You clearly only think about yourself instead of her.<br><br></div>
