              Can someone give me some advise?
              
              Is like there is girl one year my junior amd I like her, but then she rejected me saying that she will only make me hurt as she don't know how to love someone. But I really love her amd wanna get into a relationship with her and if possible even marry her.
              
              Cos of that I'm very stressed up as i.don't know what to do, cos I know that she has a little feelings for me as she's been posting on Facebook, Twitter saying thing like, she can't love anyone. Also she's somewhat similar to me in the sense like family problems and relationship problem.
              
              Cos of this thing it is affecting me greatly I don't have the mood to eat or do anything proper. And just today, I took my stress out on my friends, just cos they said they're tired n can't do project.
              
              Someone please do help me, or I may end up losing all my friends. Is there any suggestion so that I can be together with her? I don't mind if I may end up getting hurt. I just wanna be with her. Cos I do understand how she feels as I'm similar to her

              <p>You guys need to stop putting the cart before the bull.</p>
              <p>Why do guys falls in love BEFORE she have any feelings for you ?</p>
              <p>Control your feelings .</p>
              <p>If you have good feelings for that girl... wait till she give you the ok first ,, the green light , then you start the " Head over heels, love her deep deep, want to marry her, want to spend the rest of the life with her, shes the one, I want her baby"... thoughts .</p>
              <p>Reserve these ideas AFTER both of you become a couple.</p>
              <p>And guys.. please... have some standard... not just run after ANY gals with a vagina ...</p>
              <p>There's a lot of friendly girls out there... but it doesnt mean she wants you inside her panties !!</p>
              <p>Desperado and acting all sad puppy is a HUGE TURN OFF for gals.</p>
              <p>So I repeat guys... HOLD YOUR HORSES... ask her permission.. if she say yes.... proceed..... if she say no.. NEXT!!</p>
              <p>And don't forget to thank her for being HONEST....</p>
              <p>STOP getting angry that she rejected you... she is being KIND when she tells you her true feeling... so you don't waste your time and efforts and unwanted disappointments.</p>

              <p>Regarding TS problem, there are 2 possibilities.</p>
              <p>1.  She likes you but do not want to commit into a relationship</p>
              <p>2. She dont like you. All the 'same as you' situation amounts to just being friendly.</p>
              <p>For Case #2, forget it, move on.</p>
              <p>For Case #1, you can continue to show your love, but do not overdo it until you become a pest to her. Give her some room. Watch her body language. Sometimes being persistence can win the girl. Sometimes she may change her mind. (Most of the time, she will not) But if she is really not into it, and you can feel it too, then, forget it, move on.</p>
