            <div class='col-md body'>when i was still young and in school i picked up 2 phones on seperate occasions. At that time i was like thread poster, didnt feel that picking up wat i found is wrong. I either sold it off or used it as mine.<br><br>I even considered myself lucky. However, nowadays I do the opposite. It got to do alot with your upbringing and how your parents teach u. In later years when I am a young adult I start to feel what I did was wrong and felt that they were a blemish on the record of my life.<br><br>It is as though when I die and stand before judgement by whatever god or religon i will feel immensely ashamed to remember that at the age of so and so i decided to cave in to greed and kept this phone or sold it for my benefit.<br><br>Since my self reflection, I have decided quietly to myself, "Never again". I was tested some time back, when then again I found another hp on the bus. it was a Nokia 6600. FYI, I having being holding on to my faithful Nokia 6510 for years.  Besides, it was almost the end of the month, I was "money dry".<br><br>The thought did flirt my mind to sell it off, but then I remembered my own vows and without hesitation, i flipped thru the phone book and called the owner's mom.<br><br>After I returned the phone to the owner's mom, I was very pleased with myself. You shd try it, when you have done a good deed. It made me feel that all the efforts were worth it. And it did make me feel like a human again</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ur thread had started off on a totally irrelevant pt of view.<br>by what you said, the fact that u came from an above average family may have led u to think that losing a phone is no big deal and u're actually more concerned about whether u r being treated fairly.<br>ever thought of returning the phone to the owner? or handing it to the police?<br>but going to a forum to solicit sympathies.. that's pretty off.<br>and gay mods are evil enough to feature it.. lol.</div>

I assumed that since noone in my family ever shown interest or needed in a phone, i promised him.<br><br>when i got back and told my parents about the hp. they were slightly disturbed by the fact that i didn't asked them first instead of promising my friend that phone. i told them that he wanted it and that they didn't shown any interest in that hp anyways, so i gave it to him.<br><br>i got very upset due to the fact how they managed this inccident. is it wrong to think of the world before my parents? they implied that no matter what, i should still seek them for their interest. i feel that being in a well average family with all the necessities and leisures covered, i feel no need that they needed anything more. whereas the outside world, who tends to be less fortunate needed the things we had. my friend may have shown interest in that phone and wanted it, but my parents downstruck values were still there, that they were utmost importance regardless anycase...<br><br>what an out-rage i feel....</div></blockquote>shame on you and your parents! you farking thief!<br>return that handphone to the owner and repent!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
