            <div class='col-md body'>Hey i got a friend who is a taxi driver. He told me that most of his fellow taxi driver friends  always hope that they can pick up handphones in their taxis.<br><br>This way, they can take and use it or sell it away to their friends... So bad advice to return a phone to the taxi driver if you happen to pick up one in his cab cos chances are he will keep it for himself. My friend's colleague another taxi driver once wanted to sell me a phone he pick up in his cab, a rather new model sonyericsson for $300 which he said he just "pick up"  So who can you trust? A friend's uncle was a mata now retired said that all those things that people return to them and nobody come and claim... What happen to them? You can make a guess... Even those xxx dvd that they raid what happen? you can also make a guess who watch them...<br><br>The thing is who can we trust?

Ever try this? http://www.evanwashere.com/StolenSidekick/<br><br><blockquote><br>The people in the pictures below have my friendÂ’s T-Mobile Sidekick.  Instead of doing the honorable thing when finding someoneÂ’s phone in a taxi, they instead kept it.<br><br>I have found 8 cell phones in the last couple years in taxis.  EVERY single one I have contacted the owner (by leaving a message on their voice mail or by answering their phone and telling their friends that I have the phone) and returned it promptly.  When people have found my phone, they have also in turn returned it.<br><br>When my friend realized that she had left the Sidekick in the taxi she asked me to immediately send a message to the phone saying that we would give a reward for the phone.  There was no response.  After a day of waiting, she had to go to the store and spend over $300 on a new Sidekick.  When she put her SIM card in, she saw that the person(s) that had taken the phone had not only signed on to AOL leaving their name and password in the phone, but they had taken pictures of themselves.<br><br>I immediately contacted the AOL name: Sashacristal8905 and requested that the Sidekick be returned.  I was immediately told that my Â“white assÂ” didnÂ’t deserve it back.  That she was not a Â“white bitchÂ” (my friend who is a blonde white girl had pics on the phone this person had obviously seen) stupid enough to return a phone she found.  After lots of threats, she said she and her boy would wait for me at:<br><br>Sashacristal8905: i got ball this is my adress 108 20 37 av corona come n do it iam give u the sidekick so I can hit you wit it<br><br>So, anyways..this is my story.  If you happen to know these people in the picture please let me know at: stolensidekick@gmail.com  I am not going to go to the address posted above, because a.) Not going to waste my time going to a probable fake address b.) If it is real, there will be a physical altercation and I would probably wind up arrested which would do no good to anyone.  IÂ’d rather just embarrass the thief as much as possible.  Teach them a lesson on the etiquette of returning peoples lost belongings. </blockquote>It has been resolved already, but its a good read, better than drama on TV <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
