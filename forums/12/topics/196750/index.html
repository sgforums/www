            <div class='col-md body'>yesterday i found a phone in the taxi. seeing that noone claimed it, it guessed it was lost and that it was mine. I was on the way to my friend's house. He saw the phone that i found and was very interested in it. I assumed that since noone in my family ever shown interest or needed in a phone, i promised him.<br><br>when i got back and told my parents about the hp. they were slightly disturbed by the fact that i didn't asked them first instead of promising my friend that phone. i told them that he wanted it and that they didn't shown any interest in that hp anyways, so i gave it to him.<br><br>i got very upset due to the fact how they managed this inccident. is it wrong to think of the world before my parents? they implied that no matter what, i should still seek them for their interest. i feel that being in a well average family with all the necessities and leisures covered, i feel no need that they needed anything more. whereas the outside world, who tends to be less fortunate needed the things we had. my friend may have shown interest in that phone and wanted it, but my parents downstruck values were still there, that they were utmost importance regardless anycase...<br><br>what an out-rage i feel....</div>
