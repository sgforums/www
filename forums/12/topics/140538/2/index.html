            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... Actually wanted to start a thread on this.. But since there's this topic here... Why not?<br><br>Personally. I feel that marriage is just a form of 'legal commitment'. And in the legal terms, women would have much more to benefit than men. So the whole thing works in such a way that once 'commited' to a marriage, it goes to show the 'devotion' and commitment a guy has for a woman.. Which of course.. Don't always have to be necessarily true in the sense...<br><br>It used to be a much more effective means because men used to be the sole bread-winner in the family. Hence the structure and meaning is there. Women while through that would earn a certain 'security' from it. More in terms of financial and commitment.<br><br>Today, as women becomes more indepedent... They no longer 'rely' on such a form of 'motivation'. Marriage only goes to show that the man is willing to 'sacrifice' for her in certain ways (because men has more to lose in marriage in legal terms). Whereas the women's part in a marriage is more of 'free-will'. (often a happily married woman would be more naturally commited to a marriage. Theoreotically speaking, so can a man.)<br><br>However, women have a higher tendency to commit to a 'family building' than men often. To breed, grow and gain satisfaction from it. Men on the other hand has a higher tendency to find 'means of satisfaction' all over the place. (not saying all men are like that.)<br><br>But due to cultural exposal and such... Various women's and men's thoughts and thinkings also begin to 'drift'... The extent, depending on individual's mentality...</div>

Ironically, you people are asking THE BENEFITS of a marriage when in actual fact, a marriage brings NOTHING but merely a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>recognition of the next phrase the couples' love has evolved</strong></span>, in which the ultimate quality of sacrifice makes much better sense and worth than in BGR, which has it's limit during test date phrase - the couple sacrifice much more, in all dimensions, in a marriage than BGR.<br><br>Tell you the truth, you can't see those so called 'benefits' because you are using different yardsticks to measure those intangibles. You are trying to equate the goodness of marriage via material/dollars sense, which completely makes no sense. The same way anyone could have tell you that love is completely redundant because even without it, technically speaking, you could still survive, breathe and live. Worst still, you could get hurt very badly, so why get involved at all?<br><br>Own the world, but loses its soul?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>Generally, there are three forms of marriage (sometimes, a mixture of two or even three):<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cirumstances</strong></span>: Forced by circumstances, a marriage happens without much choices. People generally marry because of reasons other than Love. Shot-gun marriage, eyeing on fortune, etc.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Biological/Chronological</strong></span>: People get married because it's the time to get married. Gently pushed by biological clock, people plan and get married when they feel that 'it's time' - whatever it means to them. Sometimes people get married because they are together 'too long' and felt that they needed to induce something to revive the stagnant love.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Spiritual</strong></span>: People get married because they want to spend the rest of their life together. Simple and truthful.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The following contrast you have shown above, merely shows the alternatives a couple could have without the marriage commitment. But then again, it makes <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>no sense </strong></span>to have something just for the SAKE of having. One good example is the babies example you quoted. Obviously, people can adopt - however, for people who truely love little ones, there is a VAST world of difference between their OWN child and adopted ones, especially since they could conceive naturally. What about house? Anyone can own a house - it's WHO you are living with that makes the difference. You can stay in any house of your dream...alone and you will feel worst than one staying in a 3-room flat with love and laughter.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What you are trying to do is measuring the intangibles through tangibles means</strong></span>, which I stress again, makes zero sense.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I don't blame you because you are not there yet. And because you have yet to reach that level, you are highly subjected to people who THOUGHT they are there, but sadly, nowhere near actually. These 'people' impart their negativity to you and you accepted their mindsets. Then again, but makes you think their view is the true meaning it holds?<br><br>P.S (Astro): Certain people's horoscope birthchart are more resilient to marriage (Esp. Saturn in 7th house). A powerful Uranus transition cum progression can trigger a divorce BUT that has to be promised by your birth chart in the first place. Some people do not have divorce aspects in their charts, instead, their charts shown a need to learn the areas of love and relationship through alot of cosmic learning. Through freewill, they might temporary break up or whatsoever, but the bonds never seemed to sever completely.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some marriage fails becoz BOTH hasnt really put much effort to each other...<br><br>Some fails becoz of misunderstanding (yap.. its true.. knew somebody that divorce just becoz the husband said the wife too naggy when its maybe just a woman's natural ways to talk... If a wife NEVER nag or complain, it maybe worst... means the wife don't even care about him at all... But the husband misread the situation and goes directly into divorce)....<br><br>Anyway... both husband n wife must willing to face lots of changes that they r goin to face... Dating itself wont be same from year to year.. let alone marry.. Anybody will get lots of more headache... Some more if other time going to have first child...<br><br>BOTH must have the strong "chemistry". Not just feeling comfortable to see each other... but also both have physical attraction on each other since the beginning when they were dating not just... "ooh.. ok.. ill TRY to see him/her A WHILE.. just see whether i can tahan, then i continue.. if cannot tahan.. then ill just go". This will never work as one side has already not into it.<br><br>Then.. after marriage... ALWAYS do things together or at least telling each other honestly what are they getting through.. with friends.. in office/work.. in overseas.. JUST BE HONEST.. DON't Lie!...  Then maybe need some level of trust.. and always try to do nice things to make each other happy... Don't take things for granted!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since like men can't keep their vow. I have came across too much of men cheating on their wife cases. I just don't understand why some women can tolerate and still cling on the relationship. Hoping that the husband will turn over a new leaf or for the sake of face? When men said 'I love you' to me, I really feel nothing. What is 'love' to them?</div>
