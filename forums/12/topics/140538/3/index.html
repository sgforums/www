Actually wanted to start a thread on this.. But since there's this topic here... Why not?<br><br>Personally. I feel that marriage is just a form of 'legal commitment'. And in the legal terms, women would have much more to benefit than men. So the whole thing works in such a way that once 'commited' to a marriage, it goes to show the 'devotion' and commitment a guy has for a woman.. Which of course.. Don't always have to be necessarily true in the sense...<br><br>It used to be a much more effective means because men used to be the sole bread-winner in the family. Hence the structure and meaning is there. Women while through that would earn a certain 'security' from it. More in terms of financial and commitment.<br><br>Today, as women becomes more indepedent... They no longer 'rely' on such a form of 'motivation'. Marriage only goes to show that the man is willing to 'sacrifice' for her in certain ways (because men has more to lose in marriage in legal terms). Whereas the women's part in a marriage is more of 'free-will'. (often a happily married woman would be more naturally commited to a marriage. Theoreotically speaking, so can a man.)<br><br>However, women have a higher tendency to commit to a 'family building' than men often. To breed, grow and gain satisfaction from it. Men on the other hand has a higher tendency to find 'means of satisfaction' all over the place. (not saying all men are like that.)<br><br>But due to cultural exposal and such... Various women's and men's thoughts and thinkings also begin to 'drift'... The extent, depending on individual's mentality...</div></blockquote></div>

You are right about people jumping into marriage recklessly and as I have mentioned the definition of marriage - it is THE recognition of the next phrase the couples' love has evolved. IF the couples' love is nowhere near that level, the fulfillment and overall marriage experience will be limited or negative.<br><br>Love cannot save the unwilling - divorce signify the malignant growth of either one unwilling partner through constant conflicts. And because you are unwilling, Love cannot retain you.

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that marriage has lost it's significance.<br>1) People nowadays are very individualistic. The union of 2 people is to forgo part of own ideology and to embrace a new selfless mentality that marriage entails. Unfortunately, this concept is not fully understood by one or both parties.<br>2) The existence of Woman's Charter that results in a lopsided contract of marriage.(P.S- On the other hand, women keep stressing on gender equality which if thats the case, Woman's Charter shd be abolished as not to create double standards right??). Men will experience the devastating effects when women exercise this right when marriage FAILS!)<br>3) IN this society of eroded values, more women are having affairs than before and generally I feel that the man will lose out more in terms of their ego and chauvinism if his wife really betray him. (P.S- No maintanence for man hor!)<br>MOre to add on but guess the above factors are enough to justify the imbalance and pointlessness of marriage..</div>
