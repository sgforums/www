If you can do small things together, it means there are common grounds and probably goals.<br><br>Take for example, when your child were small. There was the common goal to care and nurture your child. Like all parents, I bet both of you are easily kept busy with many little things, like fetching the kids back, ensuring their meals are taken, making them sleep at 10pm, giving them a hug every morning, etc... These would have gone on for years and years. I am pretty sure how you acted then on the child bearing and rearing has also a certain impact on her perception on you until now.<br><br>Now that your children are old, that goal is becoming obsolete. So you must find another big common goal and which both of you can do the little things together again. It's gonna be tough because it's a 11 year accumulated problem. Find interest in life again for both of you!<br><br>Also, don't be a perfect husband and I don't mean be a bad one, just be a good one because it gives space for each other.<br><br>Also, your answers to all the posted suggestions says you aren't exactly open. I sense a certain unwillingness and weakness to try and try. What has been tried and failed before does not mean will not work. The approach to any problems make a big difference.<br><br>E.g. Our children is one of best tool you can use to heal a family relationship. If you have shown lots of love to your children, your children will surely try to help you back if you pour your sorrows to them. So instead of talking your problems directly to your wife, you can talk through your children.<br><br>Lastly, I give you this quote from a very great father and grandfather Stephen Covey "Seek First To Understand, Then Be Understood."<br></div>
