              <p>Seriously to TS, if you are not comfortable to him being friendly with you, just tell him so. It might just be what he deems as normal friendliness and you are reading too much into his actions.</p>
              <p>Btw, I don't go around telling ppl I'm married or talk about my husband unless they ask or unless I want to make a point.</p>

              <p>Alamak. I am female but I don't bring my personal life into the office too. No photos of husband/friends/pets on my desk. It's all work stuff.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I like to keep my private and work life seperate.</p>
              <p>Seriously to TS, if you are not comfortable to him being friendly with you, just tell him so. It might just be what he deems as normal friendliness and you are reading too much into his actions.</p>
              <p>Btw, I don't go around telling ppl I'm married or talk about my husband unless they ask or unless I want to make a point.</p>

              <p><br>At first you wear the ring to show peeple ' See! I just got married and I am soo happy!'</p>
