And don't you know that guys are always so selfish.? and the point that you hinted out that some of the guys doesn't have job still got g.friend.. well, consider them lucky. But still, a guy with work is much more stable. afterall, would you girls want a guy with no money at all? i guess this is something which will changed your mind.<br><br>I'm not standing at the guy's side. Doesn't he know how lucky it was for a girl to SMS him, asking whether they could still be together or not. And not many people in this world got the chance to be together again though. So to that guy, don't feel proud of yourself .<br><br>And lastly, let's hope that you (the guy) could treasure things again.<br><br></div>
