            <div class='col-md body'>You might want to go look for family counsellor to help your parents understand each other. mostly men stray because they have sexual relieve which their partner cant meet. or maybe because they dont feel anything for each other anymore. whatever it is, it's best left for a family counsellor to decide what to do since they have alot of experience.</div>
