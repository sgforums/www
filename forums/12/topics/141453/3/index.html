I know she's the obedient type, almost everywhere she goes besides school, she goes with her father. Her father is damn strict wth her. She goes straight home after school everyday. She's also always keeps herself busy. I know she's very sensitive, she used to cry over little things like being punished by the teacher.<br><br>I like her, I don't mind leaving her alone but I can't stand the thought of her being hugged and touched by some other guy... I always SMS her, she usually replies... unless if I ask her out or something about relationship, she won't reply. I know this isn't a good time. Her exam is round the corner. I can see from her MSN nick that she seems to have some love problems. I don't know if its caused by me. I hope its caused me, then at least I know I mean something to her. I haven't seen her for months. I know just by SMSing and calling, it won't help me get close to her...since I dun even see her... but knowing her personality... she probably won't have the mood to get into a relationship with some other guy... at least with obstacles such as her father, exams... and me.... She wouldn't have the mood to... she very mild and timid type.<br><br>My aim isn't to woo her over now because I know it isn't a right time, especially since exam is coming. My aim is to stop her from getting into anotheer relationship. I know I am selfish. But I can't lose her to other guys... I spend half my life liking her already... She don't have to accept me...but I won't let her accept other guys...then perphaps someday, she'll realised...I wil never go away...<br><br>I know I am damn selfish... I rather both of us remain single our whole life then let someone else get her... else I will really go crazy...</div></blockquote>sorry kid it's just ur part of wishful thinking. she may not even like you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I am just voicing out what many want to say... but dun dare it... its always like that... when you dun voice out something people will complain... but when you voice out something deep within...people hate you for it.... for example...in my opinion...spouse is more important than parents.... NS is redundant.... and ...many other things....and people hate me for feeling that way? Is it way to feel your own way? and not go with the flow?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the more you force her, the more she would want to run away. anyway just ask her whether she likes you. btw parents are more important then spouses; you can have another wife, but not another father or mother. take care and good luck.</div>
