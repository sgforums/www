            <div class='col-md body'>But I don't know how to do it... I really want to do it the normal way... be her friend first... then slowly get closely... but the thing is... she won't say anything when I ask her out... I don't know... if she doesn't want to... or because she can't...<br><br>It seems that everyway she goes... she goes with her father... except school... you never see her hanging out with friends for fun... and if you happen to see her on the street... she's with her father... I seen it myself...most of my friend seen it too... I can't stand it... I don't know...whats hindering her, her or her father...</div>
