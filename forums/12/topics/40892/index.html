People DO change... Just part of Life....<br><br>Advice for you... Try to expand your social circle while seeing what you can do to keep these close friends of yours... You mentioned that there're FOUR of them...? Can't really be that ALL 4 of them try to keep a distance away from you yup...? Try to build up some rapport there...?</div>
