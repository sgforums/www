Who wack me first, who suffer the bruises and please i did not retaliate at all n in the end i got punish too. F<br><br>The teacher prefer to ignore what the hell is going on until i cried. Even when i cried she just ask what happen say stop throwing things at him and then continue on which the lesson while the boys keep throwing things at me.<br><br>Okay these happen like 10yrs ago in primary school so the system might chg i do  not know.</div></blockquote>The 'hack care' system has tried to change but never successful.</div>
