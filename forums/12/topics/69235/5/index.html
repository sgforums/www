I'll buy for you"...something like that..Becoz we(he) noe that you like this thing, n so....in order to try to make you happy...he'' ll say that he'll buy for you...but rem...he's not a rich guy...in NS...pathetic pay..allowance, i mean,,maybe he's trying to save up? Though he might say that he'll buy this and that for you n that makes you happy...but (dunno if other guys think this way or not..at least for me) to buy something you like..and with that kinda allowance...have to think thru quite hard whether it's worth buying or not...or maybe shld i save up n buy something else more meaningful n useful for you on a special event? Dun get too disappointed when he failed his promises...coz we guys also dun like to fail our promises..but sometimes things ain't going smoothly...<br>But cheers up...maybe later he'll give you a surprise? *Dun hold high hopes though*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>anyway...v-day's not big deal...as a matter of fact..wat's so special abt this v-day?till now i still dunno how v-day comes abt..y muz it be on the 14th Feb? In my opinion, v-day's juz a way florists and other trades earn more money by increasing prices of flowers,etc...in fact..v-day isnt that special as there're so many people celebrating..not a special day but a common day though...any day is a v-day as long as you couple are happy..y follow the crowd? Y not set you n your partner a v-day for yourself? It'll be even more special.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>Btw...buying flowers/gifts on the 14thFeb is really a waste of $$$...all prices increases...might as well save those $$$ n spend a wonderful day with these $$$ later?</div></blockquote>there was once when the king banned marriage but a priest secretly married couples to each other and tis priest is called Valentine... later he was conferred on the title of St Valentine. that;s how valentine's day came about. but dunno why it is 14/2 though...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, loving someone is 1 thing, accepting their faults and another thing... be patience with each other, and put urself in his/her shoes...<br><br>Coco, ur bf is in NS, there's still many stages eg when he comes out to work... working life can be more stressful for guys especially he has to take care almost everything (if he's responsible enough). An loving &amp; understanding gf is the best ... i always felt loved thru' my gf's support. When i was in NS, and really was tired to go out on weekends, she said she understand and hope after my NS, things can improve and she will wait till then... such words really touched me alot... another case was... i offered to carry handbag for her, she rejected, saying she know guy carry gals handbag quite "ma lu" lor. U see... she thinks of me and my pride... Naturally, i will love and treat her well... it's a 2 way thing...<br><br>if ur bf cannot go to u, then u can go visit him ... why must make things differentiate between a guy and gal such a big gap? "guy must do this do that, gal cannot... " if like that, then i would think, u not ready for any relationship...</div>
