(it's not that he doesn't have the money btw)<br><br>then last time he proposed and got promise me on v-day he'll appear at my doorstep with a bouquet of red roses to bring me out to celebrate. now that v-day is drawing near, he starts to make other plans instead. instead he wanna me to go look for him at his house instead. imagine a gal going to a guy's hse and bring him out on v-day instead!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  when i sorta reminded him about this previous plan, he said he'll need to re-consider.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>why is it that he din fulfill whaever he has said to me. did he say them just for fun? but he looked serious when he said them to me. it's not that i crave after these things. it wont have mattered if he never said about buying them for me or doing something for me. but he did say and when his words never materialised, that's when it mattered and hurt.<br><br>shd i be disappointed and upset with him? or shd i forget it since the things he promised me are not cannot-do-without-with things. when i tried to talk to him about keeping his word, he in return tink i very materialistic and keep wanting him to buy stuff for me. but the point is that i never budged him to buy or do those stuff for me! he volunteered...!<br><br>very sad now....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></div>

I can tell you truthfully that I found it but one wrong move will cause me to lose it all.<br><br>Over time, you and your bf will truly understand what each other is looking for in a relationship.  From what you described above, it still seems abit like honeymoon period.  Beyond that, its really up to the 2 of you to make things work.<br><br>Its a really tough journey, but the rewards that you earn at the end of this journey can never be taken away by anybody else. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
