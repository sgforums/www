            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes i juz feel that it' s not becoz we guys make empty promises...yes...we do tell you girls that "you like this? I'll buy for you"...something like that..Becoz we(he) noe that you like this thing, n so....in order to try to make you happy...he'' ll say that he'll buy for you...but rem...he's not a rich guy...in NS...pathetic pay..allowance, i mean,,maybe he's trying to save up? Though he might say that he'll buy this and that for you n that makes you happy...but (dunno if other guys think this way or not..at least for me) to buy something you like..and with that kinda allowance...have to think thru quite hard whether it's worth buying or not...or maybe shld i save up n buy something else more meaningful n useful for you on a special event? Dun get too disappointed when he failed his promises...coz we guys also dun like to fail our promises..but sometimes things ain't going smoothly...<br>But cheers up...maybe later he'll give you a surprise? *Dun hold high hopes though*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>anyway...v-day's not big deal...as a matter of fact..wat's so special abt this v-day?till now i still dunno how v-day comes abt..y muz it be on the 14th Feb? In my opinion, v-day's juz a way florists and other trades earn more money by increasing prices of flowers,etc...in fact..v-day isnt that special as there're so many people celebrating..not a special day but a common day though...any day is a v-day as long as you couple are happy..y follow the crowd? Y not set you n your partner a v-day for yourself? It'll be even more special.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>Btw...buying flowers/gifts on the 14thFeb is really a waste of $$$...all prices increases...might as well save those $$$ n spend a wonderful day with these $$$ later?</div>
