I wouldn't count NS as 'that' mature yet.  I've gone through it lah.  I'm 24 already.  Must experience the real world 1st than can say move up another level.</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The link between love maturity and personal maturity is minimal. How enlightened one person is regarding matters of heart do not always equate to an older person. There are many other people whom I know that older than me, but when it comes to matters of the heart, it's pretty much like 16-18 years old way of looking at love if you measure age as part of love's growing up.<br><br>When we grow older - we are more practical towards affairs of love. That's about it. Your basis love personality remains the same unless you are evolved through experience and enlightenment.<br><br>P.S: You will be surprise on how some people in their late 20s and 30s, behaving damn `fringing childish in their own love. It's not about the kiddy-like action that determines your maturity - its your attitude.<br><br>Cheers</div>

Same went for me too.<br><br>For that past year, we could only communicate via phone and icq.  Its not easy to communicate if you can't talk face to face.  We had lots of miscomm and misunderstandings because of that.  We quarreled, we argued, we nearly ended it all.<br><br>But both of us waited the past year before we could meet again.<br><br>Eventually, we got together again when I came back.  She had waited for me all this time.  For me, only for me.  I'm sure you know how that feels.<br><br>I'll end the story here, i think its enough.</div>
