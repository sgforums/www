              <p>Yes...its possible to have a male best friend....if you are uncomfortable with them spending too much time together, talk nicely to your wife...tell her your concerns...why don't you go hangout with them in pubs ?</p>
              <p>I also have a best friend that is female and married....although we didn't meet that regularly as in your situation....</p>

              <p>Hey man, if i ever meet you, i would slap you so hard all your teeth will fall off on the spot.</p>
              <p>Wow you must be super nice guy of the year and now you're shitting in your pants worrying if you wife is cheating on you.</p>
              <p>Is it possible for a male to have a female best friend and vice versa? Yes and no. Put it this way, i've slept with every female i was close with in the past. Nothing to be proud about but it happens.</p>
              <p>Do these 3 things now if you don't want to win loser of the year</p>
              <p>1) Get paternity test</p>
              <p>2) Get a PI </p>
              <p>3) Act like nothing has happened. Be prepared for the worst but remain super calm and composed (can you?). Once you get the test results and PI's report in your favor, then drop it hard on her.</p>
              <p>If both results / report turns out to be nothing, then i suggest you 'join' in their activities. See what the wife says. That way you can tell if she has something to hide or not.</p>

              <p>My god. Bro. Bro. Bro.</p>
              <p>I highly suggest to you, to put down everything, take a week long vacation by yourself. Head to somewhere beautiful and isolated. Off your phone, leave your kids with your parents, spend this lovely long time away together with your own soul.</p>
              <p>Everyday, ask yourself this question: "What do I really want from this life"</p>
              <p>Be the most selfish person in the world, "What would I pursue and want and protect for the rest of my life?"</p>
              <p>Forget the past, focus in the present, and come out with a future that you want.</p>
              <p>Now if in that future exists the current situation you are in and you are perfectly okay with it, stick to it no matter what happens.</p>
              <p>But if the future you picture doesn't involve such a scenario then you will have take measures, make moves that ensure your future is different from what's happening right now.</p>
              <p>The only thing you can really change in this world, is yourself. You can't change the world no matter how hard you try. And probably you won't have the luxury of time to do that either.</p>
              <p>So at the very least, why don't you live a life in which you can be happy? Isn't that a much more brighter future to be in?</p>
              <p>Times have changed. Or rather, the Singapore society and cultural norms have evolved. If you married a lady who has a guy best friend, you know that she will always treasure that relationship and remain close friends with that guy. You chose to marry her in lieu knowledge of that fact, in hopes that she might be more distanced from him cause of marriage, but that's just an assumption on your part.</p>
              <p>Never, ever, assume someone else will change for you. Even if she or he says so :( </p>
              <p>Words are cheap. Action is temporary. And time shows the truth, whether you like it or not.</p>
              <p>Now that the truth is in your face, you can choose to live with your initial decision, or make a new decision in which you will lead a more gratifying life.</p>
              <p>Go out there, meet new people, start on new hobbies, get your mind off thinking about her.</p>
              <p>And lastly, there's one thing I would like you to do for yourself:</p>
              <p>Please learn to love yourself. As nothing, I repeat, absolutely nothing, is as important to you as your own soul. That's the only thing you were born with, and the only thing that will accompany you when you die. So please, love yourself.</p>
              <p>If you need a friend to talk to in real life or online or whatever, message me.</p>
              <p>You are not alone.</p>
