              <p><strong>I also hope that couples can be happy together, the feeling is so wonderful.</strong></p>
              <p>But when one of the partner err, most of the time, there is no salvage.</p>

              <p>when your kid did something wrong i think u will forgive them no matter how big is the mistake</p>
              <p>home is a place we talk about love</p>
              <p>as for your wife i think u know her more then anyone of us here</p>
              <p>in marriage nobody can tell you that thing wont go wrong</p>
              <p>when problem arise fix it and move on and u still have a family</p>
              <p>well, i'm not saying that the other opinions here are wrong</p>
              <p>as the end of the day u have to ask yourself what u want in life</p>
              <p>if u want your ego more then go ahead and chase away your wife</p>
              <p>if your face is more important then go ahead and file for a divorce even your wife is willing to come home and accepting to your term.</p>
              <p>u have to decide what u want and dont let all the opinions here affect u</p>

              <p>Went to Japan with my wife and kids during the school holiday for a one week tour. Had quite an enjoyable time.  The kid's were really happy. It's been quite sometime since we have such a good family time.  That one week was probably the happiest time I have for quite a while. My wife seems happy too.  </p>
              <p>She started work with new company yesterday.  In fact she joined that guy friends company.  So now they're colleagues. I'm not that comfortable with this coz it means that they will spend more time together.</p>

              </span></p><p style="display: inline !important;">e last time we quarell,  she stormed off and didn't come home for 5days. We had a good talk after that and things were quite fine since.  That's probably one of the reasons we had an enjoyable time in Japan. Things were looking fine until she told me she's joining his company. </p>

              <p>Sorry but it sounds really fishy.</p>
              <p>You might want to consider PI services if you think there is more. However, is divorce an option for you or if things are really awry, do you want to still save the marriage?</p>

              <p>Speaking from a woman's point of view. This is totally crossing the line.</p>
              <p>I doubt she will accept it if you did the same thing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Have you considered going for marriage counseuling? Maybe a professional 3rd party telling her that her actions has crossed the line be easier to accept.</p>

              <p>Before marriage they were already best friends and often go out together. I know that was ok with it because I trusted her  and knew her character anf lifestyle.  After marriage,  she carried on like that for many years and I was still ok until these 1-2<span style="background-color: #ffffff; font-family: sans-serif; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">
              </span></p><p style="display: inline !important;"> years when they go out more often and  spent much more time together,  especially those overseas trips. she started to pay less attention to my feelings and get angry easily when I asked her more about what she did and where she went. I sstill love her and I still want this marriage to work anf last., not only for the children but also because we were very happy together and it's not easy to forget those good times. I just hope she will come to her senses and realize what hurts she has caused me. I am willing to change to start again with her...</p>

              <p>oh gosh. when women get angry easily, it means they will start to think about someone else. anyway, women are simple. just stop doing things that will piss her off. like stop being insecure. marriage is about trust. give her the care and concern when she needs it. when she starts getting irritated, move back a little and give her space. just need to find the perfect balance. once you balance the scales, everything will go smoothly.</p>
              <p>also, women are very typical. whenever they have quarrels or disagreements with their partners, they always find someone to confide in. obviously when you and her have arguements, she will find that best friend of hers. it is from there that women will start to develop mixed feelings for another person. even if this is so, do not mention it to her at all. no human likes to be accused be it real or fake. just behave normally. there goes a saying, where when u try to grip sand, the tighter you grip the sand, the more it falls away, vice versa. everything is about balance. the real problem you should be focusing on is searching for her balance. every woman has a different equilibrium. some prefer to be gripped more tightly than others. what type of woman is she?</p>
              <p>ultimate rule of thumb, no assumptions. give her the respect of trust.</p>

              <p>also when women begin to confide in you more, you know you are on the right track. be a good listener. a damn good husband is a damn good listener. most women also prefer men to simply just listen. giving advice is not recommended. although some may prefer more advice than others.</p>
              <p>the logic is because, when women confide in you, they begin to see you as someone they can rely on, someone who can comfort them. if they confide in someone else, it means that they see that person as someone they can rely on and comfort them. women often confuse that with love. thats where the nasty things begin. so reduce that and make it so that she confides lesser in her best friend, and confide more in you. and to do so is to prove to her you are a better listener than that best friend of hers.</p>
