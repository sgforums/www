              <p>eh, nowadays monthly rental is $5k-6k leh.</p>
              <p>and usually, the landlord will require a 6 months deposit. so thats at least $30k.</p>
              <p>not to forget that you need to renovate the stall, and buy materials. wiring, signboards, equipments. at least 10k.</p>
              <p>last but not least, you will need around half a year to build up a customer base, therefore you need to budget for 6 months worth of losses. daily materials and salary (for self and employee) $10k for 6 months at least.</p>
              <p>vehicle? $80k?</p>
              <p>excluding vehicle, you would need at least $50k +++ to even start a simple hawker business.</p>
              <p>NEA nowadays seldom issue out new rental units, which nea charges at a couple of hundreds monthly. most of the stalls you see outside are own and managed by private companies or individuals, thus the high rental.</p>
              <p>and the rich hawkers you see must either be landlords, franchise owners, recipient of cheap rentals or are simply very talented in cooking. :)</p>

              <p>I do not think sex is the main concern now lol.</p>
              <p>Starting a business is not easy, according to many entrepreneurs I am in contact with, 70% of business fail before their first year. The problem for him is of course capital, he has not worked, he has no source of income and probably has no considerable amount of savings, he may need to borrow money for capital and it is very difficult to do that if you do not have good education (blame the perception by society).</p>
              <p>Unless you have special talents (DJ or something unusual), it is a good shot to return back to education path. If you have good amount of $$$, go for private education, they tend to be relaxed in terms of application standard and within 2-3 years, you can get university degree.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, it is the military. Or unusual jobs such as busking (surprisingly good pay, I watched one documentary in TV5 about a person quitting his job (clerical office work) to busk on the street because he earns more that way).</p>
