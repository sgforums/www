            <div class='col-md body'>Hello everyone! I got this problem with my friends.Ok here it goes.......<br><br>Everytime when its recess time, my friends would ask me to help them buy food and drinks for them, daily without fail. When i replied " erh i want to eat first can?",   they say "Very fast one! Buy liao straight away come up ! Very fast! Buy liao then eat larhs! Very fast one!" Then if i never buy for them, some of them would get angry or upset with me.<br>So as to preserve my friendship with them, i would sometimes "sacrifice" my eating and buy a small lunch, just a burger instead, since eating a burger can be done in class and is faster, compared with a plate of rice. But i will suffer from hunger pangs later on during the afternoon. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> This doesn't happen anymore during this year, the event happened last year.<br><br>Then today came this, my this particular friend wanted me to buy a drink for him. I told him "dont want larh, bell ring liao, and teacher's coming"........he said "Nvm larhs. Very fast derz! Just go down buy for me pls! Dont care about the teacher!" actually he didn't ask at a friendly tone. He used the tone that people used when talking to their maid. I kinda felt like being used, so i refused to buy for him.... Because of that, he got angry with me and said " CCB larh! Knn! I go buy myself larh CB! Later i come back class i beat u! Knn! " Then he gave me a stern look.

Eh FYI, i didn't tell you this. For that "him" can do this method. But for that group of friends, buay sai! They are pai kias! Altho they are PKs, they treat me very well now. They never act PK at all, only joking with me and playing also. Sometimes they ask me help them i dont mind, because they ask politely. As for "him", he didn't even ask politely and expects me to help him. He didn't even care if i would get caught by teachers for bringing sweet drinks into the class. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  Ofcuz, i ignored him. Heck care him. He CB , he CB alone. Dont implement me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>And if you shout and scold the PKs and you expect them to change their attitude towards you, IMPOSSIBLE. What you will get is some bruises. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I got this problem with my friends.Ok here it goes.......<br><br>Everytime when its recess time, my friends would ask me to help them buy food and drinks for them, daily without fail. When i replied " erh i want to eat first can?",   they say "Very fast one! Buy liao straight away come up ! Very fast! Buy liao then eat larhs! Very fast one!" Then if i never buy for them, some of them would get angry or upset with me.<br>So as to preserve my friendship with them, i would sometimes "sacrifice" my eating and buy a small lunch, just a burger instead, since eating a burger can be done in class and is faster, compared with a plate of rice. But i will suffer from hunger pangs later on during the afternoon. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> This doesn't happen anymore during this year, the event happened last year.<br><br>Then today came this, my this particular friend wanted me to buy a drink for him. I told him "dont want larh, bell ring liao, and teacher's coming"........he said "Nvm larhs. Very fast derz! Just go down buy for me pls! Dont care about the teacher!" actually he didn't ask at a friendly tone. He used the tone that people used when talking to their maid. I kinda felt like being used, so i refused to buy for him.... Because of that, he got angry with me and said " CCB larh! Knn! I go buy myself larh CB! Later i come back class i beat u! Knn! " Then he gave me a stern look.

Then subsequently I REALLY F*CKED him JIALAK JIALAK... I mean close friend or not, better know his own limit... Moreover a FRIEND shouldn't behave like that...
