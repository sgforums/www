YOU ARE.<br><br>Since you said you told me you are compatible for me, my bf is not compatible for me, not to split us apart so that you have a chance, rather, you did that in accordance with horoscope.

I gave out a laugh upon reading it. What makes you think that i will bother to remember your zodiac sign even if you had told me? You obviously had thought too highly of yourself. Or overrated your standing in my mind?<br><br>I said there is no mention of zodiac sign, and you said we did not have coffee. We can argue until the cow comes home. These battles of words, are really your words against my words.<br><br>But at least for now, we have established some facts. You had admitted to saying that you are more compatible to me than my bf is when analysing my problems with me during my confusion stage of my relationship. and in accordance with you, your this statement is based on zodiac sign.<br><br>How about this? Care to share with us your zodiac sign? if your zodiac sign is VERY compatible to geminians (so as to warrant you to make that comparison), you will have substantiated your that zodiac excuse of saying that you are more compatible to me than my bf is in some ways.<br><br>However, if your zodiac sign is not VERY compatible, then we know who is lying.<br><br>Fair?<br><br>For authenticity purpose, you may want to substantiate your zodiac sign in one way or another, for example, showing us your old posts which stated that? or show your birthdate to a trustworthy person.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>As you claim you know, what handphone do i hold? how many sms can it contain?<br><br>I do not want to argue with you anymore.  if you dont dare to answer, but instead choose to bark around like a sore loser when i remain silence after this, it is obvious you are guilty!</div>
