If I tell you my bf is someone who always abuse me, someone who ignores me, etc your usual response would be to tell me to leave him right? You would say such guy is incompatible with me. Why can't one give this kinda advice? It is based on common sense lolz.<br><br>And as for saying he is more compatible with her, did he merely use that as an example? I did read what he said, and from what I understand he is probably saying that horoscope cannot be used as a 100% accurate guidelines to determining whether a r/s can work out or not? So he said, just as compatible as me and you to tell her that horoscope is not really that reliable, i can say i am compatible with you, maybe that is true, maybe it is not, who knows?</div>
