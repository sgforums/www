Or overrated your standing in my mind?<br><br>I said there is no mention of zodiac sign, and you said we did not have coffee.  We can argue until the cow comes home.  These battles of words, are really your words against my words.<br><br>But at least for now, we have established some facts.  You had admitted to saying that you are more compatible to me than my bf is when analysing my problems with me during my confusion stage of my relationship. and in accordance with you, your this statement is based on zodiac sign.<br><br>How about this?  Care to share with us your zodiac sign?  if your zodiac sign is VERY compatible to geminians (so as to warrant you to make that comparison), you will have substantiated your that zodiac excuse of saying that you are more compatible to me than my bf is in some ways.<br><br>However, if your zodiac sign is not VERY compatible, then we know who is lying.<br><br>Fair?<br><br>For authenticity purpose, you may want to substantiate your zodiac sign in one way or another, for example, showing us your old posts which stated that?  or show your birthdate to a trustworthy person.</div></blockquote>At this point of time, I can't be a neutral party any more.<br><br>Just who is the person behind this nick?</div>

If they have found out outside during the discussion that devil is really in wrong, then they can create a thread to tell others about it. But right now, when there is no concrete evidence, what do you want to warn people about? Something that might not even exist?</div>
