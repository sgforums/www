I would then suggest that you and Alex refrain from posting anymore. Because unless you go one step to show the proof, your accussations against Devil can never be confirmed as true. At most, you can only raise awareness that this could have happened, which you and Alex have already done. But if your intention is to see Devil be removed as MOD, then you will need to provide evidence not even to the rest here but maybe to someone like FireIce or even Jason.<br><br>Even if your allegations against him are proven true, I do not know whether it has any bearing on him being moderator since different people have different expectations of AA moderator and the one person who's opinion really matters is probably Jason.</div>

If you don't want to meet up, I think the next possible alternative I can think of is that you call me and tell me that it's you who have been posting and not alex. My PM is available. Of course there might be speculation that it might not even be the the actual bee_gal I am speaking to, but I will verify the number with Devil, before I post anything. And if Devil is speaking the truth that he is innocent, he would need bee_gal's statement to prove him right and would logically verify the correct mobile number with me.<br><br>Would that be fine with you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
