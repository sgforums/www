If you do not personally know the EGO and character of this Alex guy, you won't know... <strong>And if you have not yet know to what extent I've helped to advise Bee_gal to find out MORE about Alex in order to reach for her decision</strong>, you'll understand why this Alex guy is so angry... </span><br><br>which clearly shows that you did exerted lots of time and effort on her, online, phone or personal meetings. which none of us know about till the TS brought this up.<br><br>I think the pertinent question here did you influenced her to leave him, and i think the answer is yes.<br><strong>And if you have not yet know to what extent I've helped to advise Bee_gal to find out MORE about Alex in order to reach for her decision</strong><br><br>this line itself is very dammning evidence of that.<br><br>you also posted this<br><strong><br>The truth is it's VERY UNLIKELY that I was the one who asked Bee_gal to break up with her bf.
