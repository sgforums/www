            <div class='col-md body'>I dun side with anyone. Who the hell is devil anyway?<br><br>My view is simple. Like anything.. r/s is a game.. fairplay.. competition.. watever. If u r the better den ur other competitor, then u deserve to get ur prize. Simple as tt.<br><br>I lost a girl once to another guy before. I know the feeling. Initially was very bitter n hated tt fella. But after awhile i realised, why blame others for when i should blame myself for not being good enough. I even normalised ties n became friends. Anyway, tt girl was kinda like 2-timing us so we both booted her out.<br><br>Basically, in any competition there's a winner n loser. For the loser, the earlier n faster u wake up ur idea, identify ur mistakes, work on it.. the earlier n most successful u can mount a counter-measure or move on n get a better catch n not repeat ur mistakes.<br><br>Sometimes emotions cloud logic n reason.<br><br>Anyway, i reach a point tt i dun place r/s the most impt thing in the world. There r so many things in life to appreciate n pursue den to be shackled by one other person, esply if tt person is unappreciative.</div>
