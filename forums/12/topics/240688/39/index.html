She shud know she shud not trust someone fully, not 100% because one, devil is just someone she just got to know. why didnt she just discuss this issue wif her bf and not go out to meet someone who is of a total stranger altogether? she shud understand the risk involved before going out to meet him, but she still went.<br><br>so that is her decision and also action, and i believe she has a certain role to play as well in this whole thing. advice can be given, but it is up to the individual to carefully consider it before following it.</div></blockquote>Of course i am responsible for my own action.  Afterall i didnt suffer any harm at all.  My bf and i did not break up.  Advices from devil nor other forumites didnt cause us to break up.   Like i said, i am not a young teenager gal who had not seen the world.  And we are not here to blame anyone for offering advice that we are not compatible and 'try to break us up'.<br><br>What brought my bf to start this thread, just in case the same tactic, is used on others.<br><br>step 1: gal is confused having problem with bf<br>step 2: moderator who is there for 6 years as others have mentioned, who have been giving very sound advice therefore built his credibility.

And persistently call her and ask her out for dates.<br><br>Given a confused person, especially young confused gals, will they be able to see through it and not fall prey?<br><br>His objective is here to warn others.<br><br></div>
