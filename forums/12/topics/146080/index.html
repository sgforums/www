A relationship will not dissolve into thin air at the blink of an eye.<br><br>If u want to really recover, cut off contact with him, of course tats extreme. Participate in more social activities to keep yrself busy during the day. Open yr feelings to close friends and family. Cry to relieve the stress at night.
