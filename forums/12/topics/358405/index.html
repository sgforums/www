              <p><br>The gf should express her displeasure to her bf regarding his actions, regardless of the inevitable quarrel that might erupt.</p>
              <p>The gf should kick up a big fuss about it and instill HORROR if not TERROR directly straight into the heart of her bf, so that next time he will at least cold sweat and pee on his pants when he has any further thoughts of fooling around behind his gf's back.</p>
              <p>Bf usually tends to be unfaithful and run wild like some stray animals mating with another stray animals is because their gf is too relaxed, afraid to confront her bf, too timid to fight for her rights in the relationship, doesn't even know what she should do, living in fear of branded for being possessive, want to act gracious but actually doesn't have the grace in her, naive thinking that her bf will crawl back to her love for no good explainable reasons at all, overly confident of her impractical and lazy-to-further-maintained-beauty, aimlessly following what others have advised (becos other gf doesn't kick up a fuss, so she shouldn't do that too), dumb and stupid, have absolutely no control or influence over her bf.</p>
              <p>So girls...Mercy is your weakness in the relationship and Forgiveness is your reward to your bf in your relationship. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>U should just approach the girl who he asked the contact from and tell her that ur his gf, then ask her would she still go out with this kind of guy who ask for other girls' contact when he is attached.</p>

              <p>If you the gf also goes around collecting other guys numbers.. then yes you are unreasonable to be upset with your bf and you really shouldn't confront him about it.</p>
              <p>But if the above is not true.</p>
              <p>Then yes. you should confront him.. and let him know that what he did is very hurtful and damaging to the relationship.</p>
              <p>The trust has been broken.</p>
              <p>If he complains you are being too "clingy" or controlling.. then simply inform him that , you should just do the same, collecting other guys contact.. and go out with them.</p>
              <p>"Do unto others what yu want other to do unto you" simple logic.</p>
              <p>Mutual respect is very important in a relationship. Without it.. the relationship will not last. Since it won't last.. then might as well just end it now.</p>
