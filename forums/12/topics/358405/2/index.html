              <p>Opps, my net connection went down yesterday so i could put in the 2nd half of my comments.. =(</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1.) Depends. Are you in an exclusive relationship? If no,  then its to be expected from the guy. Though any girl wouldn't be happy to see someone they like go hit on another girl and vise versa, so i'd say the guy lacks sensitivity. If yes, then try to find out why. Communication is important but try not to do it in a accusing tone. Anyway, either way, i'd say the guy's insensitive.</p>
              <p>2.) Ah.. the typical recipie for a big fight. As i said on top, communication is important for a healthy relationship. Communicate that you do not like it in a 'do not care' tone and it'll only show more of the guy's intention as this may have been his way of seeing you be jealous. He'd either -</p>
              <p>A. Continue to do the same thing if he's really dumb / Not that into you / Just plain insensitive. In this case, i'd recommend to seek greener pastures.</p>
              <p>B. He'd realize it doesn't work and give up on this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Guys have an different view to clubbing as opposed to girls. Most guys go clubbing just to pick up / hook up. Most girls are just there to have a great time. So, it very much boils down on HOW are you feeling right now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On a side note, how old are you and your boyfriend?</p>

              <p>And what is the thing you don't like? Him hitting on girls? Clubbing? Making you jealous? Only you know it yourself.</p>
              <p>Well.. it is said that men are from Mars and women from Venus. That's why each side is looking at each other on opposites sides of the river called relationship. Man need sex to be able trust and be close with the woman, and the woman needs to trust and be close to have sex with the man. Such is the complexity of male-female dynamics..</p>

              <p>Actually , I think TS should just let the matter go.</p>
              <p>Since he is interested in that girl.</p>
              <p>TS should ask herself... why is she being a third wheel ?</p>
              <p>Let him go so that he may pursue his dream girl.</p>
              <p>TS hang on to relationship .. is only get in their way.</p>

              <p><br>i beg to differ.</p>
              <p>being together in a r/s is to get to know each other more before concluding whether he/she is the one.</p>
              <p>white lies.. i strongly believe that some things are better kept unsaid, as truth hurts.  Always have to consider the other's feelings.  Some white lies are meant to be good.</p>
