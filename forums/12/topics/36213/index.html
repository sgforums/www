Don't sink into emotional mode that will only make things worst. You have know the situations from his lips - not from someone else. Calm down and perhaps you can write down all the question you would like to ask him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Many a times when relationships turned soured, we often failed to see the hidden lesson behind. Seriously speaking - if this bf of yours is born out of lies and deceits; do you think he makes a decent bf anyway? It is not even a question of his character - it is a question on where does this relationship belong in his heart. That low?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Communication is very important - you have to talk to him as soon as possible and remember its *MUST* be face to face and not SMS/Phone/Emails/etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just share a story with you....<br><br>someone I knew, had often been assigned oversea, and I was told that he often flirt and find pros during his assignment.  Some time, he called it entertainment, leaving his g/f behind in SG, poor, pretty but very innocent and trusting g/f of his... never believe anything and still trust him the way she used to be.... this thing had gone for long time.<br><br>Even before he started to work while studying in Australia, he was like that too, but not as bad... then he was with another g/f who found out from her friends in Australia... broke up with him.<br>despite all this happening, this friend of mine is now happily married with kid.  However, no one had ever told his wife what he did? I am not drawing any parallel from this scenerio, but its really you and him to trash out the difference, if you trust him the way his wife did w/o knowing any of his doing?  if you ask me, I think the wife is dead dead dumb, but there again, who are we to say, as he had changed overtime  and is more hard working earn $$ for the family...  only U.. can...for your own</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree with what you said, if that's me, but again, not every one is like that, my bro-in-law is one dumb guy who does not believe so even though he does not flirt.  so U see, to dif ppl, dif thing.  But I also know some of my friend are out for real fun only since its opportunity... No comments...  Its their choice.  I experienced that too but fall short of doing anything as my moral and principal kept hunting me down making me feel very.. very... very .. guilty if I do so...  I just can't have the courage to do so... but to some, its so easy, just like putting on another set of clothes......<br><br>Think it out carefully, its not easy even though should you decide to forgive him, and even end up just like my friend who is happily married now, the torns in your memory, are you really willing to let go and move on with live? will you at the slightly moment, jump on your nerves if you find something fishy, regardless whether the problem is with him or yourself.... think carefully about.  there again, you might have forgotten say 10 yrs down the road... just like my wife....  She used to be so jealous of the attention I got during our early days of courtship, phoine calls, outing, sharing session, helping girl friends (casual and close friends) with their BGR problem... and had been fuming all along even until the those few years after marriage.... but now, she don't even bother and give a denm as she, I presume don't even have time to worry about girls around me.</div>

Nor how true the words of the 'someone' whom had tell you about your cheating bf are....<br><br>But I guess I know one thing's probably for sure... You tends to THINK and WORRY too much... Overseas trips or not, this is not gonna be very healthy for your love relationship with him...<br><br>IF you really MUST KNOW what are the chances that your bf's CHEATING on you, I can do a ANALYTICAL PREDICTION (note, this is just a PREDICTION based on PROBABILITY... It in NO SENSE reflects the ACTUAL REALITY...) for you.... But your 'problem' you should still have to overcome... For your OWN GOOD....</div>
