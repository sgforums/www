            <div class='col-md body'>Hi I am quite troubled recently but no one can share my problem with me.<br><br>I am currently employed in a new position and within 1 mth, by chance of luck, my COO appreciated my abilities and actually promoted me.  I am now busy taking over new duties and responsibilities from the manager who would be leaving soon.<br><br>However, last week, i received a call from a famous foreign bank who invited me for an interview.  I went out of curiousity, not expecting anything out of it...however, i went through 3 rounds of interviews and finally is gonna be meeting up with the final BIG boss.<br><br>Now my problem is if I were offered this position, which most likely would be the case, should I accept or not??  Why I am hesitant is because that foreign bank is extremely well known for their politics and unless i decide not to ever join the banking sector again, such politics are unavoidable.<br><br>And another factor is that i feel very bad in resigning after my COO has promoted me and think so highly of me...(altho he has yet to adjust my pay).<br><br>I am also worried that I will have less time for my kids...however, i think as long as i am doing a decent job, I will need a certain level of commitment and will definitely have less time for my kids.<br><br>Pls tell me what should I do??? Should I stay or go??<br><br>In addition, a point to note is one very accurate fengshui master ever told me that I will do better in Banking sector, which is not my current job/industry.<br><br>Pls help me!!!!  Urgent!!!</div>

I think is 50-50...very hard to distinguish between the two.<br>- both are similiar except that i think more new skills set will be available for learning at the bank.  Another difference would be the industry..<br>- pay?  he mentioned after my confirmation, he will adjust.  However the trend here is that they dun pay handsomely well...the bank is willing to pay pretty well <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>- interviewer told me politics is very bad there<br>- long hours as well but i guess everywhere is long hours right?  unless it is govt sector and small pte ltds we are talking about<br>- interest: bank 'cos got an Econs degree which is not so relevant to current industry<br><br>So having answered the questions, is my choice quite obvious??  i  still have no idea...can anyone tell me which way to go??<br></div>

Whether u r willing to work in such an environment, whether u think u can adapt. Coz ultimately...working environment plays a major part.<br><br>It would be great if u can get a clearer picture of the working environment and the politics there.<br><br>Ask employees/ ex-employees. Ask ur interviewer(s) specific questions, like, what's ur direct superior's management style like? what's the corporate culture like? How would the appraisal be made? Any peer appraisal? Do u have individual/ or group targets u have to meet by competing with others? How do different departments work together? ..etc..........Bad politics don't just happen, it comes from certain foundation....n u can't ask the big boss (ur next interviewer) about the politics too directly n too much about it.

Whether u r willing to work in such an environment, whether u think u can adapt. Coz ultimately...working environment plays a major part.<br><br>It would be great if u can get a clearer picture of the working environment and the politics there.<br><br>Ask employees/ ex-employees. Ask ur interviewer(s) specific questions, like, what's ur direct superior's management style like? what's the corporate culture like? How would the appraisal be made? Any peer appraisal? Do u have individual/ or group targets u have to meet by competing with others? How do different departments work together? ..etc..........Bad politics don't just happen, it comes from certain foundation....n u can't ask the big boss (ur next interviewer) about the politics too directly n too much about it. But u definitely can ask those foundation questions n as a result get urself a clearer picture.<br><br>If u don't like the picture u get, don't force urself.</div></blockquote>thks for ur detailed reply. i really appreciated it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To answer ur questions,<br>direct superior's management style - leave staff on their own. a lot of independence.  as long as assignments done well and completed in time, u won't hear very much from him<br><br>corporate culture - was told to be very political<br><br>appraisal? - not sure.  Any peer appraisal?- No<br><br>individual/ or group targets u have to meet by competing with others? - No<br><br>How do different departments work together? - myself will work with IT dept primarily for systems testings, system design, system implementations.  Myself will also have to work with pte bankers for training, 1st level system end user support, gathering of feedback, ideas, etc.<br><br>u can't ask the big boss - why not??  sorry, very innocent for this...<br><br>Hope to hear more from you.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
