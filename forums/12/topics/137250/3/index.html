            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.. I understand the dilemma that you are in. 6 months back, I had to make a tough career choice too. I was earning very well at Citigroup Private Bank in Singapore, my pay was very much more than what my peers were getting, the perks were good and I have never thought of quitting. Then one day, a Singapore property developer offered me the chance to work in Beijing. The pay was not fantastic, and I had to pay for accomodation out of my own pay. I also have to leave my family and friends for most part of the year. For almost a month, I couldn't make a decision. I literally was tossing a coin everyday. In the end, guess what, I choose the Beijing job. I figured that being able to work in a foreign city is a lifetime opportunity. Moreover, I am not even near 30. There would be opportunities for me to return to the banking sector if I ever decide to do so. But what really swayed me to accept the Beijing job was that I figured that my ascend in Citigroup is limited. The imported angmos would always be above me and they always first to claim the credits and I had always first take any blame.</div>
