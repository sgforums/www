There are many factors as mentioned by many others who have replied. So far, from what i see u are keen on the offer even though there mayb tons of politics there.<br><br>May i ask that in ur current situation, are the living conditions for ur family ok? Are ur kids happy?<br><br>I think u may need to discuss this with ur family and ur immediate boss and seek their opinions b4 finally making a decision as its going to affect them afterall.</div>
