Who are you to declare that gays are going against the so called "laws of nature"? You created human beings is it?? Being a gay is a choice. If ppl want to be a gay that is their problem and their suffering. Who are you to go all the way and try to convert them just becos you have some kind of biasness against homosexuals? I think you should wake up. Why should people conform to your idea on what you like society to be? there is nothing wrong in making a personal choice, you should not force/impose your thinking on other people.</div>

He tried to convert his gay friend because he does not like gays. What kind of logic is that? Are you suggesting that you enjoy doing or being someone against your wishes??

I have 2 friends who are gay, and I respect their decision. Some of my friends are also effeminate. Im okay with that. Its nothing wrong. I mean, have they actually caused destruction or brought about unhappiness to someone because of being a homosexual? No right? so its ok to be one. Its just that some ppl with "Holier than thou" attitude really pisses me off and I cant stand that. So thats why I rebutt. Not that im supporting gays, but Im being fair here.</div>
