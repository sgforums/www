            <div class='col-md body'>You do not need to get to know more westerners to improve your oral. Speaking to a friend who can speak english fluently is more than enough. Through this, it can help to boost up your courage and self esteem when speaking and your friend can correct your language mistakes.<br><br>Or another method is to read out from books in front of the mirror and see if you are weaker in your ability to pronounce words properly or your lack of vocabularies. Reading books is a good hobby too. You get to learn more words and become expressive, and maybe, help you in daily conversations too.<br><br>All the best and have more confidence. You should not run away due to your English speaking. And by the way, do you speak other languages besides english? Maybe you can communicate through your mother tongue if you are more comfortable, be proud of your heritage and culture!!<br></div>

As far as I can understand, you are still not up to scratch. Next, even native English speakers do stammer and stutter when speaking, especially on unfamiliar words and phrases. Do read out loud to yourself to perfect intonation and diction especially before a presentation. Join Toastmasters International to get some tips on public speaking. If you do have some physical malformation of your vocals, please seek a speech therapist or surgeon as soon as possible.</div>

Visiting a speech therapist is not such a bad idea. Go ahead with it, he/she may help you improve your linguistic abilities and help overcome your stammer. In addition, he/she can help you see if there are any speech disorders and refer you to the proper channels for further treatment if necessary.<br><br>2. Regardless of what the government says, you do NOT need Westerners (or the more euphemistically-termed 'native speakers') to help you speak proper English. You need to overcome your shyness of talking to your peers. If they are indeed your friends, they will understand your situation and help you overcome it. Practice through having proper conversations with them and eventually you may see an improvement.<br><br>For that matter, you can always try to talk to yourself in the mirror every morning as you dress up. In doing so, it helps you identify any weaknesses you may have in the way you speak (eg. whether you slouch or talk too fast). In time, this should help to build up your confidence in speech.<br><br>I wish you all the best.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you can easily learn great master communication skills and converse easily and confidently with anybody, if you only want to and believe you can.<br><br>there is a yellow and blue book called , you can ask for it at any major bookstore. it has a 100 facts on conversing to anyone, carrying yourself, making an impact, body language, and many tips to do or avoid, based on sub conscious psychology.<br><br>conversation skills are critical in getting great relationships, be it with your workmates, friends, or lovers. how good a communicator you are affects you getting hired, promoted, remembered, and being widely WELL-LIKED.<br><br>if all your friends mainly speak chinese or bad english, i guess you can try talking to those who got A1 for english instead. (like me...) and read more good books.<br><br>i hope you do great in life, its all yours for the taking. why be mediocre? admitting this and wishing to improve is the first good step.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your paranoia of not being able to speak proper english has developed into a form of social anxiety. Be careful. While developing proper communication skills and confidence can be a solution from ur paranoia, shrinking away from conversations and speeches is another serious problem which require much attention too. The latter are signs of social anxiety and you might want to consult a counsellor about it.</div>
