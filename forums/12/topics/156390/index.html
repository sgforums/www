He is undergoing a transition where he needs to think about 'something' and this 'something' doesn't have a direct answer, more than it requires a decision (Especially worst if your bf is a Taurus, Leo, Scorpio, Aquarius).<br><br>The reason why he stalls time and not letting you know is because he knows that this matter, whatever it may be, will place the relationship in new position, likely to be for ill. He thinks because he tries to accommodate his conscience, heart and mind... which resulted in serious conflict that render him the inability to say anything.<br><br>There is a battle within, struggling to find an answer or to accept a solution which fit the best of both worlds.<br><br>But there isn't.<br><br>The battle rages on.<br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> To handle this, don't ASK him what happen; induce him to come out from his reclusive mental retreat through gradual verbal leading. He doesn't know what is he thinking about... you draw him out by dropping questions. But don't go about trashing things and interrogate him as if he murdered someone - you can begin the ball rolling first by relating and sharing your opinion of the relationship yourself. This will create a mood to talk about things and psychologically lure him into having an emotional talk with you.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Before you can open the hearts of others, you got to open yourself first.</strong></span> Then you can pop a few question of... 'Is it because I always neglect you...', etc. Leave the most critical questions last (E.g. you fell for someone else?).<br><br>Always check body language when you speak to him. You could zero in on issue which you think could be the source of his torment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Help your guy on this 'transition' period, and maybe your relationship will become stronger than before.<br><br>Anyway, it is not healthy to give an ultimum(wrong spelling) on relationship, emotions are not a black-and-white contract or agreement in life. You are giving yourself pressure and if he knows about it, it will further put the r/s into jeopardy. If you really do love him, be patient and be there when he finally needs to open up and talks about it.</div>

If he really does, it could be bad news.<br><br>Why not try a different approach? If you're sincere and wishes the relationship  would go on, allow him to figure things out. Far too often when a problem comes up, we don't even know where it came from. Give your bf his space, give him comfort, love and support. He most probably have a lot of other problems including his studies, family all bundled up together, making him very confused.<br><br>Cliche as it sounds, it's a lot of give and take. If you're there for him during his troubled times, even if he says nothing, I can assure you he IS happy that you're there for him. Given enough time, he'll talk.<br><br>Maintaining a loving relationship relies a lot on communication. And when i mean communication, i mean talking to each other with a problem solving approach - with a heart to mend the lines; not bitching and bitching and complaining and lamenting.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

People like him doesnt open up to what he is thinking. Its really hard to communicate in this way, thats a asian people speciality, keeping quiet. Thats maybe whats different from the mars venus book. its would be good if theres a book that write about how asian boy and girls think.<br><br>it must be really tiring for you to keep guessing what he is thinking man.<br><br>He does belong to the cave, just wanna hide from the problem.<br><br>From what I guess, he just afraid to make a decision that he will regret after that, and at the same time he didnt know how to improve the situation. I guess he may be feeling kinda confused but doesnt know how to say it out. Maybe you 2 do need time alone and think it through. whether is there any future if he continue to not speak about problems and keep hiding in his cave. quite tiring.</div>
