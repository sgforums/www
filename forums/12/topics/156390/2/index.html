An Aries not behaving like an Aries throughout his life, although he/she is still an Aries, is because in our birth chart, actually, all 12 signs of zodiac are involved and as well as 9 planets and 2 luminaries (Sun &amp; Moon). Each of these things gives an astrological influence over a person, based on its position on your birth chart, whether it creates a stress/harmonious influence.<br><br>For example; yunhaier's a Leo (Sun Sign), however<br><br>My Moon Sign lies in sign of Aries<br>Venus lies in Sign of Virgo<br>Mercury lies in Sign of Virgo<br>Mars lies in Sign of Scorpio<br>Jupiter lies in Sign of Capricorn<br>Saturn lies in Sign of Scorpio<br>Neptune lies in Sign of Sagittarius<br>Pluto lies in Sign of Libra<br><br>So obviously, even without other consideration, a person's Sun Sign will not determine every single personality and characteristic because there are many, many other factors. Some people feel that certain signs are more like them, instead of their Sun Sign, because there have prominent planets/positioning/aspects within the birth chart that are much more influential.<br><br>P.S: In fact, Astrology is the closest discipline to understanding how Love works, something that other field of Science has little answer for (Psychology does as well, but not to that full extend).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I will share with you this article:<br><br>The word "astrology" comes ultimately from two Greek words - "astron" meaning "star" and "logos" meaning "discourse." Merriam-Webster defines it as "1. Practical astronomy. 2. The pseudo science which treats of the influences of the stars upon human affairs, and of foretelling terrestrial events by their positions and aspects."<br><br>Now, Merriam-Webster makes good dictionaries and the definition is a good one except for one word "pseudo." That word is defined in the same dictionary as "sham; feigned; spurious."<br><br>Let's tackle this problem right away because you're going to hear the same thing from some of your relatives and friends.<br><br>From the time of the Industrial Revolution, with its technological focus on man, it has been regarded as smart and fashionable to think of anything that was not materialistic in outlook as "sham; feigned; spurious." Science would answer all man's questions and cure all his problems. Well, it hasn't happened and it never will.<br><br>It is true that astrology is not as much of a slave of the "scientific method" as physics and chemistry are. It is also true that astrology has more than its fair share of quacks and charlatans and that there were many dark years when astrology was in disrepute. It was during those years that Merriam Webster and others casually referred to astrology as being "pseudo," as if there wasn't even another side to the story.<br><br>All that has changed, however, and it is certain that dictionaries will delete the prejudicial "pseudo" from the definition in forthcoming editions. Let's look at the facts.<br><br>The respected science of astronomy was at one time a branch of astrology, which was broken down into four divisions:<br><br>Natural Astrology: The study of the motion of the heavenly bodies and their effects upon earth such as earthquakes) weather, etc.<br>Judicial Astrology: Nations and governments as they are affected by celestial bodies.<br>Genethliacal Astrology: Pertaining to birth or "genesis."<br>Horary Astrology: Applying astrology to some specific question of the moment - of the "hour" ("hora" is Latin for "hour")<br>Natural Astrology became Astronomy while Judicial and Horary Astrology have become specialities of certain astrologers. Genethliacal has blossomed into the more popular and easier-to-pronounce "Natal Astrology". This course covers all branches but concentrates on Natal.<br><br>Astronomy isn't the only science connected with astrology. Hippocrates, the founder of medical science and author of the famous physicians' oath, was an astrologer. Copernicus learned his basic science at an astrology school founded by the King of Poland. Ptolemy and Sir Isaac Newton were astrologers. Mark Twain estimated the period in which his own death might occur by astrology, and it did.<br><br>In our day there has been a tremendous rebirth of interest in - and corresponding respect for - astrology. Our space program verified many of the cosmobiological claims of astrology. The discovery of electro-magnetic forces within the human body and the same forces in the atmosphere have revived "respectable" scientific theories that there may be a connection between the forces in our bodies and the influences of the heavenly bodies. After all, our bodies are 80% water. If the moon can influence the water in the ocean, why not in our bodies? Sunspots cause changes in the weather, why not in us? The sun warms vast bodies of water and, as we all know, the human body is mostly water.<br><br>It has recently been determined that an electric charge sent into a human cell will be emitted in a distinct wave pattern. Each human cell is 80% water. They are all being continuously exposed to electric waves from outer space as well as the moon and the sun. Current research shows that a cancerous cell emits a different wave pattern than a healthy cell!<br><br>A two year study by the: police, hospitals and the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, observed human reactions to the phases of the moon. Part of the report states: "Crime against the person seem to increase as the night of the Full Moon draws near. People whose anti-social behavior has psychotic roots (firebugs, kleptomaniacs and homicidal alcoholics) seem to go on a rampage as the Moon turns full, and remember the moon is only refracting sunlight to the earth when we are on the dark side of the sun. They calm down when the Moon begins to crescent."<br><br>A Northwestern University professor performed an extremely interesting and now well known experiment showing the moon's influence on oysters. Dr. Frank Brown, a biologist, transferred a shipment of oysters from New Haven, Conn. to Evanston, III., where he immersed them in a tank of sea water. For two weeks they opened and closed their shells in rhythm with the tides at New Haven. Then a strange thing happened, in spite of the fact that the nearest ocean was 500 miles away, the oysters began to open and close in time to the tides that would have existed if there were an ocean in Illinois. Since there were no actual tides in Illinois, it was clear that the moon, itself caused the oysters to react in this manner. It is not in the province of astrology to explain why this happened. The astrologer says that the moon had an effect upon the oysters and that is all. The moon is just one of the celestial bodies, and oysters are living organisms.<br><br>Astrology is gaining worldwide acceptance and from all indications this new found interest in the Astrological method will continue to increase. Surprisingly, much of this new found interest is among Europeans who once would have mocked the notion that celestial bodies influence human affairs.<br><br>The study of the stars as a guide to behavior, personality and a way of life is receiving its most serious appraisal since it was swept off the shelf of respectable divisions of learning, during the first few hundred years A.D. Not long ago, Astrology was strictly a study for the untutored and anyone with a lot of spare time on their hands. Now, however, it has attracted many educated people and it is even a subject of university debate.<br><br>Most striking is that thousands of well educated Frenchmen, Germans and other Europeans regularly consult Astrologers or cast their own horoscopes without displaying the least bit of sheepishness about admitting it. France's president, Georges Pompidou readily confessed at a recent press conference that he follows the prophecies of his country's most renouned Astrologer, Madame Solei, with deep interest. At least one prominent French politician is reliably said to consult his Astrologer before making important public speeches.<br><br>That the various parts of the universe as well as earth itself influence human behavior is among mankind's oldest beliefs. Until nearly the middle of the 17th Century, it easily commanded as much prestige as the natural sciences. From the time of Sir Isaac Newton, however, the rapid development of natural science coupled with its pretensions of possessing the exclusive key to "truth" condemned Astrology to 500 years of intellectual stagnancy. Yet, we feel that Astrology has answers which the physical sciences do not. This is a direct cause of the now obvious limitations of these physical sciences. They evidently do not answer all the questions which perplex man. Astrology, more than any other science, explains the basic nature of the Universe and man's part in it. The questions Why? and What For? can effectively be answered only through Astrology. No other science seeks to explain the nature of human life in such a realistic way. Astrology is easily the most powerful tool for measuring any man's character and emotional constitution.<br><br>It is high time that man should realize what a tremendous help Astrology can be to create a better understanding among men whether at the individual level, the industrial level or most importantly at the international political level where we find the horrible seeds of genocide. It is our intention in this course to help to spread the true value of Astrology. We can train and unite competent Astrologers throughout the world and together we can reduce the elements causing riots, ware, revolutions, and other major and minor unfortunate misunderstandings among men. We can do this because Astrology teaches us not only to analyze ourselves but also to understand the behavior of our fellow man in its entirety. Let us now look at the basic principles behind Astrology. We are establishing Astro centers, birth information centers which will not only guide man and woman in this profound phase of love and life but also educate them to avoid abnormal births; to understand their offspring and one another as parts of an ever changing universe. (If you are interested in this program let us know with a short note and we will consider you for this special area). Our students are located all over the World and we intend to have centers at all locations sponsored financed and guided by our school and its alumni. The centers will also guide its clients in marriage and all other major life decisions and relations of humans to humans.<br><br>Cheers</div>

Talked to my bf recently on what is the problem becos he thinks we are working things out, but I don't see how we are doing it (we met up for dinner and movie once each). He still sms me almost daily, becos he wants to stay in touch (???).<br><br>Just last week, I had a "lost" mind, and avoid him for a day. It got him very upset and miserable that he i didnt answer nor reply his calls &amp; smses. Finally he emailed me, venting his misery (though he said there was another email, which he didnt send).<br><br>On that, i decided to talk to him and try to figure out the problem together. Though he didnt say much, I gathered that he is pressured that his career is getting nowhere and that time is working against him. He also mentioned that he hates it when i ignore his calls/smses as it will caused his imgination run wild (like am i out with some other guy or such). Anyway, he said that he is going away for a 3-wk business trip soon and we shall see how things turn out. He said we could still keep in touch while he is away... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Saw him yesterday again, for a moive. He seems quite distanced. So i asked him after the movie if he is happy to see me. He told me he is, otherwise he wun want to meet me. But then his behaviour during the movie or on the way home seems otherwise.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Is it me that is over-reacting or things are truely turning bad?<br><br></div>

Talked to my bf recently on what is the problem becos he thinks we are working things out, but I don't see how we are doing it (we met up for dinner and movie once each). He still sms me almost daily, becos he wants to stay in touch (???).<br><br>Just last week, I had a "lost" mind, and avoid him for a day. It got him very upset and miserable that he i didnt answer nor reply his calls &amp; smses. Finally he emailed me, venting his misery (though he said there was another email, which he didnt send).<br><br>On that, i decided to talk to him and try to figure out the problem together. Though he didnt say much, I gathered that he is pressured that his career is getting nowhere and that time is working against him. He also mentioned that he hates it when i ignore his calls/smses as it will caused his imgination run wild (like am i out with some other guy or such). Anyway, he said that he is going away for a 3-wk business trip soon and we shall see how things turn out. He said we could still keep in touch while he is away... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Saw him yesterday again, for a moive. He seems quite distanced. So i asked him after the movie if he is happy to see me. He told me he is, otherwise he wun want to meet me. But then his behaviour during the movie or on the way home seems otherwise.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Is it me that is over-reacting or things are truely turning bad?  </div></blockquote>looks like ur r/s cannot stand the test of time... but dun b too bother what we type. the answer lies in urself.. u and him. i dun mean both of u. u and him.<br><br>u went for a movie, but u should hv spent quality time talking to each other instead, to clear misunderstanding n get more involve in caring for each another. no it dun mean letting him into ur pants or another.<br><br></div>
