My verdict will be clear rom his next reply.<br><br><span style="color: red;">What is most interesting is: Aquarius find Expressing(emphasis) LOVE most illogical....but LOVE itself is very real to them.<br>To translate 'that' into action is just as difficult as a human's ability to comprehend what a foreign language is to him/her. </span><br><br></div></blockquote>ok to me. love is complicated, differs from being to being, illogical, yet is a very important part in our life. i am aquarius. lol. no i dont see love as work. maybe i no think of it so far. will write down more when i feeling better. now migraine.<br><br>i came up with this topic because<br>1 day i went to a dessert stall. i ordered mixed fruit cocktail or something like that. but the husband go serve me a bowl of jelly and ice. so the wife nagged at him la. then told him to go open a can of fruit cocktail. but the man didnt open properly and started using his hands to open the lid. so his wife again scolded him for using his hands to open the lid. then she kept scolding him to be careful and stuff like this. all this while the husband was shaking his head.<br><br>then i was there thinking. obviously the wife loves her husband, by telling him to take care when opening the can. but yet she chose to nag at him. and he is there shaking his head.<br><br>then came my thoughts, we know we love someone, yet sometimes we dont know how to express our love. if we were to nag our love like the lady, her husband will not actually get her love and concern. so we should talk it out in a nice gentle way. but how often do we remember to do this? perhaps in the beginning of the r/s we will be nice sweet gentle. but after long we will actually forget how to express our love and concern.<br><br>then i thought we all know how to express our other emotions like hatred, anger, happiness, sadness. yet why is it we find it so hard to express love in a way that the other party gets the message?<br><br>ya lor . so i post here.<br><br>in life , the hardest emotion/feeling to express is love.</div>
