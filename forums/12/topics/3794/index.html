            <div class='col-md body'>Hello raingal,<br><br>Yes life can be depressing at times, I been through that stage, and seriously its no joke. I might be a few yrs younger than u, but i can frankly tell you that i been through much more depressing stage as well. Maybe sharing of life experiences helps. Btw, you already took the 1st step out, that is to let others help u. I just hope my advise do helps a little.<br><br>Since you already realise yr problem, that is you dun do anything now, yr future will be forever miserable or depressing. Also, i see taht u realise that you should get a job too, but mind if i ask why don't you do so? I mean, at least a job provides you with the basic needs, it takes up most of yr times so you don't have much time pondering over other things. And yes, no nee dto envy yr friends, they work for it, you can too. Just start now, maybe you'll be some1 also in 5 yrs times, no1 knows what gonna happen. Its never too late unless u dun try. May i know what's yr reason for not wanting to work? Do you know that there are actually many pple ard who wants a job now but can't get cos of economy downfall. So 1st of all, I believe you should get a job as it will take a part of yr depression away.<br><br>Yup, its natural that yr parents will be upset. I mean, who wouldn't, when they see their own children can't get alone. Dunnoe if u see the point, if you start working, the immediate benefits u get is as below:<br><br>1)you will spend less time at home, then less time for conflict with brother (i presume u all live together)<br>2)your parent will worry one thing less for you.<br>3)maybe you will meet yr Mr. Right at yr new workplace  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  who knows? even if no mr. right, sure will make some more friends who can listen to u, live!<br>4)your current lifestyle will make a U-turn for sure<br><br>And yah, actually do u realise u know yr own problems well but u r just grumbling abt them and not doing anything. If you dunnoe yr problem, then its very hard to tackle it, but since you know yr problems quite well, i guess u can start taking some actions.<br><br>Oh yah, also, dun just drink water, you will only end up getting gastrics!!! then will have to spend more money to see doctor only or buy medicines. At least have yr basic meals or at least grab a bite! Then u wun end up so miserable. i dun have gastric but seen b4 friends who have....... ermmmmm very jia lat one i must say.<br><br>I wished i can help more, but guess all i can do is advise you. Yes, you are down, but you are not out yet. U took the 1st step forward, now is the time for 2nd. Oh yah, just in case u really start looking for a job, ermmmm dun be disheartened if got reject cos now not easy to find one, but at least try   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Really wishing you all the best! Do update us how r u getting on every now and then okie?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Regards<br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well...  life is only depressing when u chose to have one . You LIVE not EXIST.<br>Instead of posting a topic of telling us how depress you are, why not get out of your door and find a "medicine" to cure your depression?<br><br>If you carry on slacking at home, then you will still be the one with no objectives in life , and see people affording to buy condos... driving cars.... and much much more.<br><br>You chose to be what you want in life. No one can force you to be living life in depression.</div>

Go to the park, jog a few laps.  When you have done that, then get out some nice clothes and go out.  send some resume or get a part-time job.  Important thing is to do something to will help in seeking happiness.</div>
