            <div class='col-md body'>Anyways whether you're into guitar , drums , bass , piano/keyboard , you can really take your mind off by composing riffs , solos , songs on your instrument of choice. Record previews of your song and send it to your friends and ask for their comments and then try to improve on your composition based on their comments.<br><br>And if you can't have a girlfriend then let your instrument be your girlfriend...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Is time to forget her and face the challages ahead if not you will repeat the same cycle of thinking she will come back to you again..<br><br>If you can finish the first step of forgetting her congras to you finally becoming more mature in life.<br><br>Next step is to built up your character and improve your own strength and  personality.</div>
