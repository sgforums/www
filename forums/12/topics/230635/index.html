If a girl suddenly walk up to you and tells her name and class, and say "i wanna make friends with you!", surely you will get frightened right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly I sensed that u r quite low self esteem... How are u going to give the gal a sense of security... U must have a thick face but do it in a smart way.. For example finding out most of her from her friend. now gal like to play psycological game nowsday... They always pretend that she not interested in a guy but actually just waiting for u to she her out or be her BF.. As for she give u no but don't relpy or reply unhappily than forget about it... there are plenty of gals around ... Keep in mind if u not a prince in the eye of the gal here there alway a play... Go taiwan , just speaking english on the train u be a weel respected among high school gal... I suggest that u be tough and confidence as alot thing will be achieveable....</div>

So what's the favourite colour of all women on this planet? Or the favourite food of all women?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Look, you just need to do what you deem fit as ultimately, it's you who will have to live with the consequences of your own actions - if you're going to fail, at least fail knowing that's a method you believe to have been the best(you don't get a second shot at everything in life, mind!).<br><br>Just be yourself - acting "confident" may fool her for the instant, but it certainly isn't going to work in the long term. So why not show the true you and let her decide if she accepts you for what you're?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
