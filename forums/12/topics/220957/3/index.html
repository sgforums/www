Emotions cannot be controlled . If we all could chose who we love or like , then there are no such things as divorce or heartbreaks.<br><br>I am just assuming here - she said 10 years . Well I doubt she is 40 ...who knows how old she was when she started going out with one guy? If she had restricted herself to one guy all the time since perhaps her teenage years , I think that is admirable but extremely unhealthy in terms of maturing and getting to know other people .<br><br>Do you really want her to get married and regret not seeing the world ? Regret is the precursor to resentment ....and resentment builds in relationships to destroy them . Better to have a look around and then decide maybe the first guy she is with is the best for her ...rather than to wonder what it might have been and then resenting her husband after she marries and ending up in some bitter twisted Divorce and hurting others  ( maybe her  own future kids)   .<br><br>Wake up . This is not a session of judgement - she is in a dilemma and laying out her problems for the world to give an opinion on . Just show her abit of respect will ya? </div></blockquote>You are right.<br><br>We do not have the right to judge her. We can't really blame her.<br><br>We can only blame on her low feelings towards the boyfriend. We can only blame her actions for still carrying on her relationship with the boyfriend even though she has lost her love for him. We can only blame her stupid mistakes for starting and continuing communication with the guy even though she is attached.

We can only blame the boyfriend for being the standby guy/husband/mate. We can only blame the boyfriend for being too boring.

It began to develop until we're really quite good buddies.  Of course, deep down inside I have a strong and deep liking and you may call it, love or concern, for him and his well-being and everything about him.

And my strong feeling for my schoolmate still remained.  And my bf even proposed to me this year when I felt the most insecure about the relationship. But I felt very guilty that I liked someone above him, so I wanted to do what I thought was right, which was to be faithful to such a good bf. So I accepted the proposal.  Of course, very soon, I got back those strong feelings for my school friend. And me and my bf almost broke up.  But we made up and I was really determined to forget this guy.

I pity your bf, he has done his very best for the sake of both of you but is your choice to leave him.<br><br>Let him go, at least give him a chance to find someone who truly love him from the bottom of her heart.<br><br>Thats the last gift you can give him.</div>

After all, he thought "oh marriage would solve everything." Really? What a huge mistake! Honestly, at that moment the boyfriend should have just taken a break from her. But he can't, because like all mad puppies in love, he continued to dig in, which is understandable.<br><br>What she should have done is really initiate a period of separation from the boyfriend and think for herself who she really wants. Instead, she went the opposite way and initiated contact with the crush. I thought she wanted to really forget the guy? She really has no determination or self-discipline. She gave herself the excuse of wanting to be friends. You can't. It is because she has lost her love after 9 years or earlier and someone came along, replacing the boyfriend, which means it is the boyfriend's fault for not being nice enough? for being p-whipped? And she is not satisfied with the relationship already. It did not just happen overnight. It took a lot of years to lose the love and the boyfriend is well, now, just a friend.<br><br>And there is no way of recovering lost love. She has to be partly blamed for this mess because she leads the guy on even though she is feeling guilty. She is marrying the guy because she is feeling guilty, not because she loves him! It is a crime for deceiveing someone. What do they say on wedding vows? On the other hand, to be fair, the guy made mistakes by trying too hard to please her. In my book, she is out of my door already, not to mention marrying and buying her a mansion?<br><br>In other words, if she doesn't love him, she should not have continued the relationship. Being nice to the guy because you are guilty will not make you or the guy feel happy.<br><br>doko<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gartheven2000:</div><div class="quote_body">Especially to people who share the general view of Yunhaier,fymk,mix metal etc...<br><br>Goodness....this world is worth living in because there're still people treating others decently. Now that we're talking abt love, why dun you look to the wiser old couples who still have a strong marriage and hear their words of wisdom? Most will tell you that love is ultimately more commitment than natural feelings.<br><br>When you first choose a partner amongst singles, you should choose someone compatible, with whom there is mutual natural attraction. That IS the time to choose. And at this point, feelings do play a significant role, since you have to decide amongst a few compatible ones. But the longer you are in an r/s, the more commitment and responsibility plays a role (9yrs!!!!).<br><br>We realise nature gives us a desire for sex, but our human dignity compels us to share it only with our spouse. It is people who lack commitment but follow their feelings blindly that are responsible for the divorce and heartache in society.<br><br>I feel posters who urge the TS to "follow her feelings" AND at the same time feel that outsiders cannot judge her according to a common sense interpretation of her tale are utterly wrong.<br><br>(A) She should either come to her senses and repent of her action and what she has become, and learn to love her bf again.<br><br>or<br><br>(B) refuse to change herself and break up wif bf in the least painful way to him. That would be to admit that she is totally in the wrong and she is not worthy of his love at all. (WHICH IS THE TRUTH) and of cos find out later on that without commitment, there is no everlasting marital happiness.<br><br></div></blockquote>I understand what you are trying to say, but as I say the TS is here for advise so lets stick to giving her that and leave out all the harsh remarks about the things she has done ...... She knows that what she has done is hurtful to her current boyfriend like what most of you have said..... But who are we to tell her what to do or what is the right thing to do ?? We have no right to that, its her life and she should be the one to make that choice ...... so if we can't provide her with good advise lets not say anything .........</div>

Somemore so many years of relationship and yet you still can fall in love with other guy.. So I asked you to wake up yr idea, is it the right way????</div>

Its is true that her developing feelings for her classmate is wrong when she is still with this boyfriend but at least she has told her boyfriend about it ......... I think the only thing that she should not have done is to accept her boyfriends proposal before she sort out her feelings for both guys invloved ......<br><br></div>
