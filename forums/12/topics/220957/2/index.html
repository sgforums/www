We have already made plans to get married next year.  Sad to say, last year, I began to have a crush for a school mate.  Well, I thought it was a mere crush.  It began to develop until we're really quite good buddies.  Of course, deep down inside I have a strong and deep liking and you may call it, love or concern, for him and his well-being and everything about him. Well, I confessed to my bf last yr and he was very nice about it.  He booked a wedding package to show me his sincerity in loving me.  But apparently it din work.  And my strong feeling for my schoolmate still remained.  And my bf even proposed to me this year when I felt the most insecure about the relationship. But I felt very guilty that I liked someone above him, so I wanted to do what I thought was right, which was to be faithful to such a good bf. So I accepted the proposal.  Of course, very soon, I got back those strong feelings for my school friend. And me and my bf almost broke up.  But we made up and I was really determined to forget this guy.  But yet I wanted to keep the good friendship we've built up.  The irony is that the more we build up the friendship, the more I liked him and the less I loved my bf. Now me and my bf are even planning to buy a flat! I mean things are happening way too fast and I just don't want to hurt my bf again.  He's really a very good guy.  Everybody loves him.  And they say i'm a fool if I dun marry him.  I know he's a good guy but I've just kind of lost my first love for him.  In fact I feel very very happy with this school friend.  The more complex thing is, this schoolfriend himself is attached.  And I hate to destroy ppl's relationship.  But I really like him, though I dunno if he likes me in that sense anot.  I know you guys may feel very disgusted reading this.  I am disgusted with myself too. I just dunno how to get a hold of myself.  And I've reached this stage that I dun even know if I should carry on with my wedding plans or should I remain single and hope that a miracle happens between me and my schoolfriend, meaning he'll like me as well and we'll both be in a available situation for each other.</div></blockquote>If you think you can't handle it, why don't you just break off as much communication as possible with that school mate of yours?<br><br>At the same moment, I think it's seriously time for you to review your relationship with your bf. Have both of you ROMed btw?<br><br>Or is it a time for you to review your life? What you want in life?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't take things for granted. Once you lose him, you will never be able to replace the regrets in your heart. Since you know you can't resist and fight the urge of your 'scandal', the more you should distant yourself so as to save yourself and your bf. That is if you want to salvage your current relationship. 10yrs is long and it is understandable that the feeling of first love may not be there anymore but think about the memories you had together. Think about the sacrifices he had made, you had made, the promises you made, the times both of you had together. All these are irreplaceable.<br><br>Love is something that is never over night. Love at first sight? Not love at all. It only builds up over time. If you can't be professional about your friendship with your 'scandal' then its best to distant away. If you don't want, then break up with your current bf and go after this new guy. And pray that after 10 yrs with this guy, you have no regrets about your decision 10 years ago and you are still deeply in love with this new guy.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would not rush into marriage if I felt that way , so what if it is 10 years courtship and he is a nice guy? He might not be the RIGHT guy . Yah some will say it is bad but it is your future. If you cannot see your current bf as someone you can stay with for a whole lifetime , I suggest you tell him to wait . He might be the RIGHT guy but it may not be the RIGHT time.<br><br>Don't rush into marriage now - like someone said be fair to him and be fair to yourself -rather than to deal with a divorce later on in time</div>

If emotions can be control then the world will not be what it is now. Please put ourselves in her shoes before we start to judge her. Who are we to say what is right or what is wrong ??
