            <div class='col-md body'>i share her story with all u guys but no real name included.<br><br>My friend, Sumini is living together with her husband's mother under the same roof. She is homemaker and takes care of her kids by herself. (her mum in law not willing to help her.)<br><br>One fine morning, she finished washing her own side's clothes and is about to hang them up outside. she is disappointed to see her mum-in-law taking up too much space -- for eg the long skirt, it can be hang, using the hanger. instead she hang the long length of skirt on the bamboo to make sure it is hers. she got exploded herself with anger. the day before, her husband was feeling stress at work and in end he bumped his head himself on the bed for no reason. She wanted to help him but she felt helpless. that's how she increases with anger.<br><br>in end, his family started thinking that it is a wife's fault on the account of the past incidents. His wife often quarrels with his mum over the clothes and traditional practices. BUT they can't communicate due to the languages ( his mum knows chinese and know nothing abt english and for her, vice versa), The problem often solved with the help of his younger sister and sometimes hubby. in end, they instead thinks she is trying to cover herself up. very upsetting... of cos, her hubby n young sister is not there to witness. often 2 of them at home only..<br><br>To end the unhappiness, she do think of moving out to a new home. she got the same response from him -- his pay is low - earning 1.2k and support to feed 2 kids and his wife. one way out is that he can move out to mum place as her mum is treating him ver well. he just dun wanna it as he got his pride n 'face'.  instead, he ask ker to support what he decides n where he stays... i felt it is old fashion thinking.<br><br>i suggest to her that he need professional help. he also dislikes to get help as he thinks he can solve himself.

Ok...<br><br><strong><br>To end the unhappiness, she do think of moving out to a new home. she got the same response from him -- his pay is low - earning 1.2k and support to feed 2 kids and his wife. one way out is that he can move out to mum place as her mum is treating him ver well. he just dun wanna it as he got his pride n 'face'.  instead, he ask ker to support what he decides n where he stays... i felt it is old fashion thinking. </strong><br><br>I don't really agree with you on this one... 1st thing I would like to put CLEAR into your mind...

Just as she's hoping that her husband should be more sensitive to her, I think it's only FAIR enough if she starts to be SENSITIVE enough to how her husband feels about the whole matters and perhaps a bit more sensitive to the people around her (that one I won't know for sure...)...<br><br><strong><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> [b]Yes, it is her ..who else lah.. me pure Singaporean...

In this case, like the proposal she've suggested is not so easy in carrying out... (not from his husband, the actor's point at least...) Alot of other things could end up winding into the situation if it gets anymore complicated.... And in the case where if it would be finally carried out.... Consequences would come in....<br><br>Talk about being sensitive...? Her husband's a human too...? So is his mum... His sisters... Carrying out such an act won't it be like siding his wife and not siding the mum in his mother's eyes...? It's not about being TRADITION and OLD-FASHION in thoughts...? It's about BEING SENSITIVE.... Not only to his wife... But to his mum's feelings too... Afterall, who's the one responsible for WHO HE IS today...? I can ALMOST ASSURE you that his mum's efforts probably couldn't be overlooked... And also, I can assure you that this is NOT about being TRADITIONAL... If he can just IGNORE his mum today, he can as easily ignore his wife (your friend) and his children in the future to come....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> sighz....we are living in 21st century, not back to old generationsÂ¡K  everyone got to move on and keep an open eye / mind to the everyday changes.. </strong><br><br>MOVING ON is sometimes easier said than done... Everybody stands in a DIFFERENT position with a DIFFERENT background... Let's say I can take just 8 mins to walk a 100m... Of course it won't be so difficult for me...

There're probably other ways to work things out... Why can she think of working things out between her and her hubby BUT NOT between her and her in-law...?
