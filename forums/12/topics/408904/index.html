              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>recently i've been really irritated by some of my church band mates. I'll start off by describing the issue i have about 1 of them 1st.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this guy is the drummer and a talented one. As a bassist myself, i should be playing along with him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He keeps commenting my playing isn't gd enough, however, i received comments that are vice versa.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I admit that i'm not really tht gd as compared to my influences but i seriously doubt this drummer's comments as I know he's someone who's very critical and bitches on anything and everything.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I find it hard to accept his comments cause he only knows how to say something is wrong and not good but doesn't know or incapable of telling me why it's wrong or what can be done to improve. I find this like just having hot air coming out from him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>don't get me wrong here, i'm not someone who can't accept being criticised. I have a close fren who do comment on my playing but he also tells me why it's not gd and what can be done. To me, this is constructive criticism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i would really need advise on how to handle this as i don't wish to have this brew into anything bad but also wish to get him to shut up somehow.</p>

              <p>Maybe that drummer is one of those who thinks very highly of himself, and think music is his expertise. So, he starts to criticise, but don't give supporting reasons. These people you just ignore will do, you can shoot him back if you want =) </p>
              <p>He's just going his rounds of doing baseless claims on you. </p>

              <p>Then u ask him for constructive criticsm. Like seriously.</p>
              <p>Tell him u are not a mind reader.  Then if he insists on just being an ass, you remind him the reason why you are all here as a band. Not just a band. A church band.</p>
              <p>I mean no doubt, talented musicians tend to want perfection. But perfection comes with practice and communications especially in a band. Given that talent is a key component here. And it does get frustrated when there is  a lack of synergy. But it would equally be as cruel to tell another he got no talent. But this aint a rock band. Many musicians ... I am talking in church,  forget why the are up there in the first place. Not to perform per se to your fans. But to express the music that is tied to the scriptures  the message  .. in simple, gloryfying your God.</p>
              <p>As a musician, you must be able to comprehend another's  limit ma. If he thinks he is so talented, I am sure its not a problem for him to slow down a bit or alter certain beats to your rythm right? You tell him that.</p>
              <p>And those that are in the praise and worship are either volunteers, touched or something to do God's work, or just have musical skills and was asked to be part of the group.</p>
              <p>So which one is he ?</p>
              <p>And no doubt there definately be issues like this in most churches, hell.. in almost any kind of group. lol . If reason doesnt work with him, you try being more bible. If all else fails.. just ignore his ass.</p>
              <p>If he insist on being like that, he will leave himself one. lol</p>
              <p>Just give him some room to wiggle around. Dont corner him too much when you confront him. Cause I am sure your intention is to have everyone be in synergy.</p>

              <p>I wouldn't exactly call it an issue. Nobody likes it man, you aren't the only one. I hate it myself. I don't like to be insulted for no reason, especially by friends. Unless you manage to achieve perfect harmony in your own soul, idiots like that will definitely get to you somehow. You say that he's the kind who bitches a lot, i think it's obvious he just wants attention and is insecure about himself, hence he takes it out on others.</p>
              <p>But hey, chill yeah? Empty vessals always make the most noise. Next time if he runs his mouth off just scold him back. People like that damn good at talking shit, but the moment they are faced with some form of confrontation or adversity, they CONFIRM cower down.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>recently i've been really irritated by some of my church band mates. I'll start off by describing the issue i have about 1 of them 1st.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this guy is the drummer and a talented one. As a bassist myself, i should be playing along with him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He keeps commenting my playing isn't gd enough, however, i received comments that are vice versa.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I admit that i'm not really tht gd as compared to my influences but i seriously doubt this drummer's comments as I know he's someone who's very critical and bitches on anything and everything.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I find it hard to accept his comments cause he only knows how to say something is wrong and not good but doesn't know or incapable of telling me why it's wrong or what can be done to improve. I find this like just having hot air coming out from him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>don't get me wrong here, i'm not someone who can't accept being criticised. I have a close fren who do comment on my playing but he also tells me why it's not gd and what can be done. To me, this is constructive criticism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i would really need advise on how to handle this as i don't wish to have this brew into anything bad but also wish to get him to shut up somehow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks in advance,</p>

              <p><br>Why don't you assured this drummer that you will do better next time?</p>
              <p>Ask him to pray for you too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The important question here is, Why do you choose to play for your church? You can also ask him the same question and observe his answer for yourself.</p>
              <p>Either way, there is so much both of you can learn from each other.</p>

              <p><br>I play the electric guitar, I should know better. The most simplest instrument to play is the drum. Don't need much skill, only need to practice and know how to go for the beat. Here is the hierarchy of importance in the band:</p>

              <p>Then u ask him for constructive criticsm. Like seriously.</p>
              <p>Tell him u are not a mind reader.  Then if he insists on just being an ass, you remind him the reason why you are all here as a band. Not just a band. A church band.</p>
              <p>I mean no doubt, talented musicians tend to want perfection. But perfection comes with practice and communications especially in a band. Given that talent is a key component here. And it does get frustrated when there is  a lack of synergy. But it would equally be as cruel to tell another he got no talent. But this aint a rock band. Many musicians ... I am talking in church,  forget why the are up there in the first place. Not to perform per se to your fans. But to express the music that is tied to the scriptures  the message  .. in simple, gloryfying your God.</p>
              <p>As a musician, you must be able to comprehend another's  limit ma. If he thinks he is so talented, I am sure its not a problem for him to slow down a bit or alter certain beats to your rythm right? You tell him that.</p>
              <p>And those that are in the praise and worship are either volunteers, touched or something to do God's work, or just have musical skills and was asked to be part of the group.</p>
              <p>So which one is he ?</p>
              <p>And no doubt there definately be issues like this in most churches, hell.. in almost any kind of group. lol . If reason doesnt work with him, you try being more bible. If all else fails.. just ignore his ass.</p>
              <p>If he insist on being like that, he will leave himself one. lol</p>
              <p>Just give him some room to wiggle around. Dont corner him too much when you confront him. Cause I am sure your intention is to have everyone be in synergy.</p>

              <p>Hmm...he probably had something in mind but was afraid to say it out because he might be wrong. Try to get him to sit down and listen to you playing and have him to pinpoint out what he thinks are mistakes. If he doesn't agree or can't be bothered, then just ask him to stop whining about your play.</p>
              <p>Cheer up. Some of those popular musicians also held full-time jobs before they got famous, and you never know when your turn would be. Just keep doing what you love.</p>

              <p>Then i ask you yesterday the philippines SWAT botch up rescue of the 13 hong kong tourist, in your judgement was incompetent? Don't need a genuis to see that. 7 hostages killed, fat SWAT police failed to break through the window and gave the hostage taker ample time to kill his victims.
