              <p>I know the drum is easier because my electric guitar music
              teacher also teaches the drum as well. He told me so. You don't
              need to be a specialist to tell that it is easier. It is common
              sense.</p>
              <p>Then i ask you yesterday the philippines SWAT botch up rescue of
              the 13 hong kong tourist, in your judgement was incompetent? Don't
              need a genuis to see that. 7 hostages killed, fat SWAT police
              failed to break through the window and gave the hostage taker ample
              time to kill his victims. You need to be an army commando to tell
              that it was an incompetent operation?</p>

              <p>Not everything that a teacher says is correct. I learnt the drum before, and gave up because of the technical difficulties. I have also learnt the guitar before, but I too gave up because of some constraints that I have encountered. He can say it is easier because your teacher might have picked up faster, thus easier for him. </p>
              <p>Both instruments are equally as demanding. It really depends. Can I say it is also common sense that walking is easy too? Just because we have been walking for years, does not mean its easy. If lack of training and practicing, walking can be the most difficult thing to do. </p>
              <p>I won't comment much on the swat police, as I hold a rather bias view in that. </p>
              <p>I'm not trying to tell you which instrument is harder, which instrument is easier. But I would just like to highlight to you that different instruments have their own advantage and disadvantage, what is easier to do on one instrument does not apply to all instruments. If any professional drummers seen what you have said, I think they must have regretted their years of practicing and perfecting the drumming techniques. </p>

              <p>I still say drums are easier to learn but hard to practice. Why? Because anybody who buy a drum set at home would know that they can't practice on it without having the neighbours complain about the noise. So most drummers have to resort to practice on the wall or table instead.</p>
              <p>Electric guitar you can practice without putting on the Amps.</p>

              <p>Hmm...he probably had something in mind but was afraid to say it out because he might be wrong. Try to get him to sit down and listen to you playing and have him to pinpoint out what he thinks are mistakes. If he doesn't agree or can't be bothered, then just ask him to stop whining about your play.</p>
              <p>Cheer up. Some of those popular musicians also held full-time jobs before they got famous, and you never know when your turn would be. Just keep doing what you love.</p>

                              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>recently i've been really irritated by some of my church band
              mates. I'll start off by describing the issue i have about 1 of
              them 1st.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this guy is the drummer and a talented one. As a bassist myself,
              i should be playing along with him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He keeps commenting my playing isn't gd enough, however, i
              received comments that are vice versa.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I admit that i'm not really tht gd as compared to my influences
              but i seriously doubt this drummer's comments as I know he's
              someone who's very critical and bitches on anything and
              everything.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I find it hard to accept his comments cause he only knows how to
              say something is wrong and not good but doesn't know or incapable
              of telling me why it's wrong or what can be done to improve. I find
              this like just having hot air coming out from him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>don't get me wrong here, i'm not someone who can't accept being
              criticised. I have a close fren who do comment on my playing but he
              also tells me why it's not gd and what can be done. To me, this is
              constructive criticism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i would really need advise on how to handle this as i don't wish
              to have this brew into anything bad but also wish to get him to
              shut up somehow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks in advance,</p>
