Things do happen for a reason. If breakup happens, be glad tt it happened earlier ,not later. Broken relationships show tt things arent meant to be. Look forward to a new one... Try to learn lessons from it. take heart n march on. Time waits for no man. Dun be too hollowed into ur sadness. Try to think of something gd tt happen to u everyday, be it very small , like an act of kindness from a stranger or friend.....</div>
