              <p>my mom expects me to be home at 10pm, if more thn that my phone will be ringing non stop. when i go out with frends, she will probe me for hell lot of times who am i going out with. recently, i was tellin her that after my prom nite i have post prom activites over at a pub or smth, she said i cant go.</p>
              <p>i mean i dun get the rationale behind all this shit. if i am a 14 or 16 yr old kid well, that kind of treatment i still can try to accept. but i mean here i m a 18 year old guy, n there ur tryin to probe into my social life, i noe she cares abt me, but i believe this is just getting to restrictive. Im the only child btw, but come on, i nid to have frens isnt it? and its not that i go out every nite to party,just once in a ablue moon, even some of my female frens have that kind of freedom. i dun understand my parents, or maybe to be exact, my mom. she just wans to control everything. even the way i spent money, she will probe on what i spent on, check my wallet when im asleep( pretend), check my bag. etc. this i just way too much. i cant stand it animore.</p>

              <p>TS's mom is hard to handle, not the understanding type like 7-11. Seeing the dominant position she has at home, she's the type who always think she is right, not matter wat you say.</p>
              <p>You can try talking to her out of it, but i doubt it'll be useful, she won't listen.</p>
              <p>I don't think you can get any freedom until you start working in the society, cos her best weapon against you is the financial support.</p>
              <p>you hav 2 options, either suck thumb and suffer, or REBEL gradually and subtly, if not u'll nver learn how to be independant</p>
