              <p>here some details abt me, 18 year old guy, just finish A levels, waiting for ns.</p>
              <p>my mom expects me to be home at 10pm, if more thn that my phone will be ringing non stop. when i go out with frends, she will probe me for hell lot of times who am i going out with. recently, i was tellin her that after my prom nite i have post prom activites over at a pub or smth, she said i cant go.</p>
              <p>i mean i dun get the rationale behind all this shit. if i am a 14 or 16 yr old kid well, that kind of treatment i still can try to accept. but i mean here i m a 18 year old guy, n there ur tryin to probe into my social life, i noe she cares abt me, but i believe this is just getting to restrictive. Im the only child btw, but come on, i nid to have frens isnt it? and its not that i go out every nite to party,just once in a ablue moon, even some of my female frens have that kind of freedom. i dun understand my parents, or maybe to be exact, my mom. she just wans to control everything. even the way i spent money, she will probe on what i spent on, check my wallet when im asleep( pretend), check my bag. etc. this i just way too much. i cant stand it animore.</p>
              <p>guys i nid ur help, ani suggestion to get me out of this shit?</p>

              your future wife will have a lot to deal from the way mommy is behaving.....your mommy will be fighting control over you, i guess you will have to live with her....poor thing, sandwich between two women.....
              
              show some independence, off the damn phone but don't return home too late....get the old man to help lay down the law lah.....display some spite, that will spook her off a little....

              <p>just talk to your mum nicely. i guess it would be hard to start the conversation about your freedom,but just look for opportunities.</p>
              <p>your mum probably didnt realised that you have grown up. most mothers will treat their children as young boys or girls.try showing your mature side, let her know you can take care of yourself ,and others as well.</p>
              <p>she's your mother, know that she love and care for you. love her and respect her too, having a close relationship also helps.</p>

              <p>hi bro i was in the same situation as you few yrs back. i used to have to lie i had revision class even to play soccer. show your mom some independence like working and paying your bills like handphone and stuff. i am now free in anyway you would want to be and my mom and i are much closer. of cos i know my limits too and i won't raise no matter what. best is prove through actions and your mom will grow out of it. trust me it will work, and all the best for your A levels.</p>

              <p>i noe how you feel. still undergoing that....and i am actually still trying to resolve it. i used to be all submissive and all but recently i blew up, cos i really cldnt take it anymore, esp where it concerned my gf. i thot of leaving home and everything, like taking bank loans to pay for my education. but i cant leave my sibling and dad at home like that. its not their fault for my suffering and i cant bear to leave them behind either.</p>
              <p>but i was reading some psycological bk to explain why they behave like tt. i guess ur mom is a housewife? like mine. they dont have much things to do, they tend to think too much and they jus want to find fault with a lot of ppl. no one ever tells them they are wrong, esp when the other family members are very easygoing. so i guess someone wld have to take tt first step. which wld be me. i mean, u cant grow up, and let ur mother decide who you want to marry and what house and car brand u shld buy and so on. the extent of filial piety shouldnt include these.</p>
              <p>but i dont really want to quarrel w her anymore either. i am looking for a peaceful way to settle this. so like you....i'm looking for a way. will let u noe if i do. cheers bro.</p>

              <p>hey,</p>
              <p>Dun worry about it. Everyone been through this phase of life. It just the matter of time and intensity your mom is probing into your life. You are 18 but to your mom, you are only a kid. We are always a kid in our mom's eye even the day we have our own family.</p>
              <p><br>Whatever you do, DO NOT shout back and retord to negative feedback. Coz it will make you more childish and definitely an argument. Like what ppl had said, talk to your mom. If you are the only child or the oldest child, maybe it will need some time. Maybe you can speak to your dad or your aunt to speak to your mother.</p>
              <p>Anyway, you are going to army soon. How long more can your mother probe into you. Let say till 22, 24, or even after you finish uni. After that will she still do this? I dun think so. You will actually miss their probing i guess. And trust me, army will make you think of your home and your mom more. Haha!</p>
              <p>Something i learnt in the army and i think it helps. Try to get out of this shit, dun compare your life with other ppl! haha</p>
