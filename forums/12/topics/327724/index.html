              <p>Been in this relationship for 6+ years. Both of us cant bear to let go, but he is not confident to carry on as well. For the past 2 months, we have been running in circles - trying to let go and trying to carry on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the beginning, we were happy and things were rosy. However, unhappiness built up from a few serious quarrels and many small issues. Things become boring, but I am contented, thinking that we will end up together no matter wat, trusting in him, in me, in us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Things started to go wiry 2 months back due to his work stress and some other fundamental issues between us. And yes, it has dragged for 2 months and mushroomed into a bigger problem. He started to wonder if we will be happy together as we are of different wavelength (meaning we don't share the same jokes). Worst of all, he has a female colleague whom he can really click with and I made him realise that she has feelings for him. He cant helped comparing me with her and his feelings for her has developed as well. Due to circumstances, he knows that it is impossible for them, but he can't help thinking to try out with her. It makes it harder as he sees her everyday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have asked him to give us a chance till end of this year. Can this extinguished flame be rekindled? Is his feeling for me dormant somewhere and I will be able to find it back?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or should I just let go this relationship of 6 years? He told me that he still feel regretful when we last decided to let go (which was last thur).</p>

              <p>since he has already expressed his indecisiveness with regards to your r/s, why not take this as a break and take a step back to reevaluate yourself and him ?</p>

              <p>this i cannot tell you... </p>
              <p>you have to think of the answer for yourself...</p>
              <p>whether is it worth to give yourself and him another 6 mths to try it out and have no regrets ? </p>
              <p>or whether is it good to let go now and spend some time with yourself and your family and friends and check out how's life without him ?</p>
              <p>sometimes taking a step back might result in moving forward. Yes there are risks and uncertainties involved. </p>

              <p>Sigh. I guess no one has the answer.</p>
              <p>There was actually once in the past 2 months that he set his mind to quit his job so that he will stop thinking about the girl. It was my stupid idea to tell him not to quit and put us to the test.</p>
              <p>I can tell that he is trying too. Like I have asked for him to take leave for us to spend time together and he has agreed. So, maybe there's hope still. The evil hearted me is hoping that he will want to quit again, but the chance is slim cuz he is doing well there.</p>

              <p>The love is not strong enough, espeically on his side, so easily swayed by new blosom flower. I think he is not even right to fall in Love in the first place when he cannot even withstand the test of time, that is why, relationship should not last so long, typically within 2-3 years a couple should get marry, and begin another new chapter in life, if not very boring and mostly, for guys with flowering heart, he will be very easily tempted for another gal when another one come along. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, its ok, you are not overly committed yet, but to my 6 senses, you stand only 20% of rekindle and the percent is getting smaller as the months goes by. take care. The next time you fall in Love, learn and be ready.</p>

              <p>I left out an event which happened...</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Last Monday:</span></p>
              <p>He decided to talk to the girl and told her that it is impossible between them, even though the girl did not express her feelings to him openly. It was then that he knows for certain of her feelings (my prediction was right) and she too agreed that it is impossible for them to be together. I met up with him after that and we decided to try again.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sunday:</span></p>
              <p>He confessed to me that he had dinner with her alone on Wednesday after working OT. Even though he tells himself not to have anything to do with her outside work, he just can't help asking her to join him for dinner. At the dinner, he confessed to her that the feeling is mutual but he is still trying out with me instead.</p>
              <p>Up till now, he is still giving us a chance though he has no confident as he will think about trying out with her. And having that thought makes him feel guilty towards me.</p>
              <p>We have been meeting up and will be taking leave on Friday to spend time alone.</p>
              <p>Is it possible for us to ever get through this and have a happily ever after ending?</p>

              <p>I left out an event which happened...</p>

              Monday:</span></p>
              <p>He decided to talk to the girl and told her that it is
              impossible between them, even though the girl did not express her
              feelings to him openly. It was then that he knows for certain of
              her feelings (my prediction was right) and she too agreed that it
              is impossible for them to be together. I met up with him after that
              and we decided to try again.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sunday:</span></p>
              <p>He confessed to me that he had dinner with her alone on
              Wednesday after working OT. Even though he tells himself not to
              have anything to do with her outside work, he just can't help
              asking her to join him for dinner. At the dinner, he confessed to
              her that the feeling is mutual but he is still trying out with
              me instead.</p>
              <p>Up till now, he is still giving us a chance though he has no
              confident as he will think about trying out with her. And having
              that thought makes him feel guilty towards me.</p>
              <p>We have been meeting up and will be taking leave on Friday to
              spend time alone.</p>
              <p>Is it possible for us to ever get through this and
              have a happily ever after ending?</p>

              <p>As long as he still harbors some hope that it might work out with the other girl, he will never be able to dedicate 100% of himself to trying to work out the relationship with you. In a way, he is also trying to see whether it will work out with the other girl.</p>
              <p>So as long as he has feelings for the other girl, I am afraid it is not going to work out...</p>

              <p>Well, just try your best..at least both of you are honest with one another. Just tell him if one day, he feels that his feelings for the girl kept growing until he has no place for you in his heart anymore, tell you as soon as possible so that you can move on.</p>

              <p>Been in this relationship for 6+ years. Both of us cant
                      bear to let go, but he is not confident to carry on as well.
                      For the past 2 months, we have been running in circles - trying to
                      let go and trying to carry on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the beginning, we were happy and things were rosy. However,
                      unhappiness built up from a few serious quarrels and many small
                      issues. Things become boring, but I am contented, thinking that we
                      will end up together no matter wat, trusting in him, in me, in
                      us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Things started to go wiry 2 months back due to his work stress
                      and some other fundamental issues between us. And yes, it has
                      dragged for 2 months and mushroomed into a bigger problem. He
                      started to wonder if we will be happy together as we are of
                      different wavelength (meaning we don't share the same jokes). Worst
                      of all, he has a female colleague whom he can really
                      click with and I made him realise that she has feelings
                      for him. He cant helped comparing me with her and his feelings for
                      her has developed as well. Due to circumstances, he knows that it
                      is impossible for them, but he can't help thinking to try out with
                      her. It makes it harder as he sees her everyday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have asked him to give us a chance till end of this year. Can
                      this extinguished flame be rekindled? Is his feeling for me
                      dormant somewhere and I will be able to find it back?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or should I just let go this relationship of 6 years? He told me
                      that he still feel regretful when we last decided to let go (which
                      was last thur).</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> A three-nation research on divorce and separation was done last year and it was noted that an accumulation of daily trivial affairs are cited as the main cause of the failure in marriage and relationship. <br><br>Hence, those who had victory in marriage would have mastered interpersonal skills that allowed them to manage and compromise annoying daily issues that builds up over time, which maliciously seeks to oxidize and decay the core foundation of the very Love one have constructed.<br><br>People might envy such lengthy relationship, but the measure of relationship must always be qualitative and how relative it is to our personal growth, and not mere quantitative figures of how long the couple has been together or absolute assumption that a relationship gets better with age or ultimately leads to marriage and happily ever after. <br><br>Like the once-glorious Tang dynasty, which too crumble eventually; is there a reason so attractive that this ailing six years relationship is still relevant, in both of your reality, by being together?  <br><br>Your six-year affair would amount to nothing, if the relationship is basically inane, mechanical and obligatory. A kiss is but mere touching of lips if the emotional component is missing. For one’s happiness in Love does not depend entirely on who you are with, but rather, the true rationale of breathing the relationship must be certain and burned into staunch conviction into our love beliefs. <br><br>The longer the relationship… the longer the race… the easier it is to be eliminated by stress and deranged circumstances.<br><br>Testing your relationship artificially is an immature way in problem-solving. Your relationship is already ‘constantly being tested’ via Love cosmic lessons – your artificial interference only suggest additional plunging of blades into the back of your relationship and damaging it further. It does not, unfortunately, improve your situations, other than bringing it closer to death. </p>
              <p>Examine your relationship in-depth first and decide if there’s still a reason for the relationship to continue. Same goes for your man. Take one problem at a time. Tackle the immediate issues first - the decision with regards to the other woman, if he should quit his job, etc. Then seek to work out the internal comms, expectation and behaviour within the relationship as your second concern. Finally, you can preview and reiterate critical values and beliefs, once you have re-establish foothold onto your Love, so as to ensure longevity of your relationship. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
