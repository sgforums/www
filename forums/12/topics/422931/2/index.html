              <p>he also did the same thing when I was in SG</p>
              <p>you have the same thought with me...I think he goes to geylang regularly.  I can see it from the way he forced me to do that...although I was disagree and struggled...he didn't care.  This is similar to what a man do with a prostitute...dont care about the prostitute's feeling as long as he satisfied</p>
              <p>i think i wont see him anymore</p>

              <p>i think he came from China mainland as his characteristics is very typical to someone who come from China mainland.  Maybe he and his family migrated to Singapore long long time ago.  Besides, he doesnt have western name.</p>
              <p>He is very introvert...not communicative.  He hide some information from me.  I used to ask for his family pics but he didn't give it to me.  I think he will absolutely be angry if i ask to see his NRIC</p>
              <p>It's hard to forget him as he meets 85% of my criteria...T.T  but time will heal lah</p>
              <p>you said that most singaporean men would do the blouse thing ??? OMG</p>

              <p>He only wants you for sex.</p>
              <p>From what you say he's not after a serious relationship.</p>
              <p>Since you won't sleep with him, of course he ignores you. Just move on.</p>
              <p>I think most Singaporean men are respectful of women, unless you give him cues or lead him on to try his luck. Then again, I think that is typical of men anywhere.</p>
              <p>Or you couldn hv been giving him mixed signals when you say no but your actions say yes.</p>

              <p>I also think the same...probably he had "official" gf since he doesnt support my intention to work and stay permanently in SG</p>
              <p>"Official" means the girl he gets from his parents...matchmaker-thing.  As his family is still very traditional and ask him to get married soon ...probably their parents introduce him to a girl ... yeah u know lah</p>
              <p>I have a good networking in SG and at that time finally I got a "spy" who is at the same office with him.  the spy is a friend of my friend. </p>
              <p>When I told the spy his name...the spy said none with that name in his office...I was quite shocked.  Then I showed his pic and finally the spy can recognized.  The spy said he often see him at office but doesnt know his name....but the spy has a friend who is in the same departments with him so can gather some info</p>
              <p>the infos are: he is single and available...hardworking guy...but his behaviour is quite weird...very unpopular at office.</p>
              <p>And you know when I said to him that I have a friend who is at the same office with him ?</p>
              <p>He said : "it is impossible your friend knows me....your friend must be wrong...none knows me at office "</p>
              <p>?????? weird huh</p>

              <p>pardon me for saying this, 99% of men from such social websites are all sourcing for sex and remaining 1% are gay. Surely you dont know about such risks!! If you are serious about looking for boyfriend, go to healthy foroums such as this one and identify your right man.</p>
              <p>Never ever make friends via social websites. It is very rare, almost imposssible to find a decent long term normal guy via these webbsites. .</p>
              <p>Am i right  to say that you are actually asking here whether he is the right husband for you if you were to give in his sex demand?</p>

              <p>I have a good networking in SG and at that time finally I got a "spy" who is at the same office with him.  the spy is a friend of my friend. </p>
              <p>When I told the spy his name...the spy said none with that name in his office...I was quite shocked.  Then I showed his pic and finally the spy can recognized.  The spy said he often see him at office but doesnt know his name....but the spy has a friend who is in the same departments with him so can gather some info</p>
              <p>the infos are: he is single and available...hardworking guy...but his behaviour is quite weird...very unpopular at office.</p>
              <p>And you know when I said to him that I have a friend who is at the same office with him ?</p>
              <p>He said : "it is impossible your friend knows me....your friend must be wrong...none knows me at office "</p>
