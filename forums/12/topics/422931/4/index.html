              <p>let me tell you something...his career is good...a unit manager of a well-known MNC in Singapore.  A very hardworker... work almost 24/7...no time for socializing...no friends at all...always busy and alone all the time.  If you see his career profile, you would find a mature guy with good career.  </p>
              <p>but at the other side.....at the relationship and social side...he acts as if he were teen or early 20's.  maybe he is lack of socializing ... most of his time is spent @his office.  he himself told me that he has no friend...always alone all the time.  My spy also said the same thing.  A lonely pathetic guy</p>
              <p>When I was with him in SG...he was curious when I got  a phone call from my SG friend.  He asked mecuriously ..who is calling.  When I replied...my friend...he stunned and said : " I thought you dont know anyone in SG besides me</p>
              <p> He thought that I dont have any friends in Singapore</p>

              <p>@angel7030: Unless you got a love scale, it is rather hard to judge whether who loves whom more. It is easier to judge whether you love him or not rather than he loves you or not.</p>

              <p>@angel7030: Unless you got a love scale, it is rather hard to judge whether who loves whom more. It is easier to judge whether you love him or not rather than he loves you or not.</p>
