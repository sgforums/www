              <p>I am Indonesian Chinese.  I live in Indo</p>
              <p>Last year I met a SG
                                      guy at a dating website.  Actually it was a coincidance because I
                                      wasn't intend to seek a guy there.  Just curious with that
                                      website...registered without picture.  After that, I didn't login to
                                      that website for a long time....when I logged in..I got a  message from
                                      a guy (he didnt put his picture as well).  I replied to that message
                                      giving my email address for a further chat.  I was glad to have more
                                      new friend at that time.  no feeling for him.</p>
              <p>My first opinion
                                      was...this guy is very formal...very nerd...coz his language is very
                                      formal.  I felt like corresponding with a business partner....LOL....I
                                      thought our friendship would last longer...coz he was so boring.  But
                                      he did constant effort to make me attracted...and he suceeded after 4
                                      months. There was a chemistry between us although we didn't know each
                                      faces.  Then we exchange our pics...and I was surprised he is good
                                      looking.  His physical appearance meets my criteria about man.</p>
              <p>he
                                      goes to indo regularly and finally he came to my town. I was very happy
                                      with our first dating  but I felt lil bit uncomfortable coz he kissed
                                      me too much.  I didn't say myself as a conservative lady but i need
                                      more time to make myself comfortable with physical touching such as
                                      kissing, touching, etc....because it was our first meeting</p>
              <p>then,
                                      he came again 2 months later.  It was getting worse coz he opened my
                                      blouse and kissed my breast. Although I struggled, he didn't care and
                                      keep insisted.   I was disagree..I am very uncomfortable with
                                      that.  When he asked me whether I like it or not...of course I answered
                                      no. I told him that I prefer not too many physical touching coz for me
                                      love is respect, understanding, trust, and support each other through
                                      the bad and good times.  Kissing and hugging are OKlah...but no more
                                      than that</p>
              <p>He was angry to me after hearing my explanation. 
                                      He said how can i have such a logical definition for love ?  for him
                                      love is feeling...feeling to hug, to kiss, to touch.</p>
              <p>Our
                                      relationship was getting cold.  He didn't contact me at all. He was
                                      totally changed...like a stranger for me.  When I tried to speak to him
                                      about this matter ( coz I thought we had to discuss more for any other
                                      different point of view to get win win solution)...he said he didn't
                                      want to talk about it anymore.  he left a problem unfinished</p>
              <p>Then
                                      I went to Singapore for job hunting.  I didn't tell him about my job
                                      hunting at first...just told him that I would have a long holiday in
                                      Singapore.       </p>
              <p>Again...he did the same things to me when i
                                      was in SG..opened my blouse to kiss my breast.  Although I
                                      struggled...he didnt care.  Even it  was getting worse...he tried to
                                      push my vagina with his finger (I still wore pants)...and after that he
                                      tried to open my pants but luckily I could stop him.</p>
              <p>when he knew
                                      about my job hunting....he was disagree and told me that I'd
                                      better to stay in indo.  Then I was angry and said "why everyone must
                                      always have the same thought with you?".  My sentence made him angry
                                      and again ....he left problem unfinished</p>
              <p>I was tired with his ego
                                      and didn't made any effort to make up like before.  And he didn't
                                      contact me as well....so 3 weeks after that I decided to end our
                                      relationship although I still love him.  I sent him an email coz I
                                      didn't want to speak or meet him.  He replied 2 days later...only
                                      saying "thank you and gud luck"</p>
              <p>He never hold my hands if we were
                                      at public places in Singapore.  So we looked like a "regular" friends
                                      only.  He forgot my birthday and never come to my place in Singapore
                                      after I have got roommate coz  I think he know he couldn't do that
                                      (kiss breast ,etc)</p>
              <p>I used to spy his house.  I found his car at
                                      the carkpark and I saw the door were open.  he had spare time but he
                                      didnt want to meet me.</p>
              <p>He changed a lot after I was disagree with him about sex</p>
              <p>Is sex very important in a relationship, SG guy??????</p>

              my advise... if the other party just want sex, then breakup lah... it won't go into a lasting relationship, stop being stupid and starts being wise...

              This part can don't read but if you bored, continue reading... I also dump alot of girls after I realize all they want is sex with me... I am so disappointed. I want to give my virginity only to the girl I married but they all cannot wait, keep putting their hands into my pants the first time i meet with them, i tried to run but some pushed me into their hotel room and proceed to rape me... sometimes i manage to run away but sometimes the girl too strong and raped me successfully... sometimes i so scared if i get pregnant... end of story...

              <p>i'm sure there are many nice chinese guys in indo, u know...gd upbringing, gd career and money etc. Perhaps the person u knew all along is a pervert, not interested in you at all.</p>
              <p>Just move on. He's not worth your time. Sex is important in a marriage but not to the extent where in a r/s, just because you reject him and he shuts you off. That means he's not genuine about you at all.</p>

              <p>I am Indonesian Chinese.  I live in Indo</p>
              <p>Last year I met a SG guy at a dating website.  Actually it
              was a coincidance because I wasn't intend to seek a guy
              there.  Just curious with that website...registered without
              picture.  After that, I didn't login to that website for a
              long time....when I logged in..I got a  message from a guy (he
              didnt put his picture as well).  I replied to that message
              giving my email address for a further chat.  I was glad to
              have more new friend at that time.  no feeling for him.</p>
              <p>My first opinion was...this guy is very formal...very nerd...coz
              his language is very formal.  I felt like corresponding with a
              business partner....LOL....I thought our friendship would last
              longer...coz he was so boring.  But he did constant effort to
              make me attracted...and he suceeded after 4 months. There was a
              chemistry between us although we didn't know each faces.  Then
              we exchange our pics...and I was surprised he is good
              looking.  His physical appearance meets my criteria about
              man.</p>
              <p>he goes to indo regularly and finally he came to my town. I was
              very happy with our first dating  but I felt lil bit
              uncomfortable coz he kissed me too much.  I didn't say myself
              as a conservative lady but i need more time to make myself
              comfortable with physical touching such as kissing, touching,
              etc....because it was our first meeting</p>
              <p>then, he came again 2 months later.  It was getting worse
              coz he opened my blouse and kissed my breast. Although I struggled,
              he didn't care and keep insisted.   I was disagree..I am very
              uncomfortable with that.  When he asked me whether I like it
              or not...of course I answered no. I told him that I prefer not too
              many physical touching coz for me love is respect, understanding,
              trust, and support each other through the bad and good times. 
              Kissing and hugging are OKlah...but no more than that</p>
              <p>He was angry to me after hearing my explanation.  He said
              how can i have such a logical definition for love ?  for him
              love is feeling...feeling to hug, to kiss, to touch.</p>
              <p>Our relationship was getting cold.  He didn't contact me at
              all. He was totally changed...like a stranger for me.  When I
              tried to speak to him about this matter ( coz I thought we had to
              discuss more for any other different point of view to get win win
              solution)...he said he didn't want to talk about it anymore. 
              he left a problem unfinished</p>
              <p>Then I went to Singapore for job hunting.  I didn't tell
              him about my job hunting at first...just told him that I would have
              a long holiday in
              Singapore.       </p>
              <p>Again...he did the same things to me when i was in SG..opened my
              blouse to kiss my breast.  Although I struggled...he didnt
              care.  Even it  was getting worse...he tried to push my
              vagina with his finger (I still wore pants)...and after that he
              tried to open my pants but luckily I could stop him.</p>
              <p>when he knew about my job hunting....he was disagree and told me
              that I'd better to stay in indo.  Then I was angry and said
              "why everyone must always have the same thought with you?". 
              My sentence made him angry and again ....he left problem
              unfinished</p>
              <p>I was tired with his ego and didn't made any effort to make up
              like before.  And he didn't contact me as well....so 3 weeks
              after that I decided to end our relationship although I still love
              him.  I sent him an email coz I didn't want to speak or meet
              him.  He replied 2 days later...only saying "thank you and gud
              luck"</p>
              <p>He never hold my hands if we were at public places in
              Singapore.  So we looked like a "regular" friends only. 
              He forgot my birthday and never come to my place in Singapore after
              I have got roommate coz  I think he know he couldn't do that
              (kiss breast ,etc)</p>
              <p>I used to spy his house.  I found his car at the carkpark
              and I saw the door were open.  he had spare time but he didnt
              want to meet me.</p>
              <p>He changed a lot after I was disagree with him about sex</p>
              <p>Is sex very important in a relationship, SG guy??????</p>

              <p>sex is lust, not love. </p>
              <p>Love does not always need sex. </p>
              <p>Sex does not always need love. </p>
              <p>To love someone, it's a very different thing. Pure love has nothing to do with sex. </p>
              <p>Most time, sex is just lustful physical attraction and attachment, nothing more.</p>
              <p>The purest kind of love is like the love of a mother for a child, a dog for his master, the will to care for someone who is dying or handicap since birth and the sacrifice of someone who would allow himself to be hurt or harm just to save someone else's life. The love that requires no repayment of any sort, even if being betrayed,can still love, is the true kind of love.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This would be a good example of pure love:</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGO3xzHTtqI&amp;feature=related">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGO3xzHTtqI&amp;amp;feature=related</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The purest kind of love between a man and a woman without the need of sex is very very hard to find in this world. </p>
              <p>It's a waste of time and energy to cry over stupid, childish human desires, those things do not have any lasting fulfillment whatsoever. Don't waste your time. </p>
              <p>If a girl becomes pragnant because of giving in to such lustful desires, she will only regret because most time, the man will just run away to find other enjoyment. It happens too many times and yet people still fall into such trap. </p>
              <p>One indonesian maid in Singapore killed herself when her boyfriend finds another girlfriend after getting her pragnant and refused to take responsibility for the outcome.  </p>
              <p> By the way, age has nothing to do with maturity, even if one is 60 years old.</p>

              <p>actually many miss the point that its a natural behaviour for a guy regardless of race language and age. a typical guy would not go in such extent unless got consent from the ger. i am not sure if the guy is mentally stable. TS have to judge that yourself. i think TS dont really love this guy. TS mentioned this "I didn't say myself
                                      as a conservative lady". I am sorry if this sounds offensive. This is my point of view.</p>

              <p><br>maybe he isnt singaporean but a permanent resident of singapore or a malaysian chinese perhaps.most singaporean guys would do the blouse thing.most would date u go for dinner watch a movie..meet yer folks etc etc .,,,just like any decent guy.to see if he is a singaporean....ask to see his identity card which should be pink in colour as only sporeans are issued that pink identity card according to law.</p>
              <p>perhaps he just watched too much violent anime films and wants to imitate them with u which is kinda sick.</p>
              <p>he never held yer hands in public???and he held u in his arms like it was the last days on the planet??dump him n get a better guy.looks like its lust n not love...in which case u might as well get a rubber dummy or a robot for a future husband.</p>
              <p>just dump him.....u have like 5 million more men in singapore some are nice..some are monsters from hell..some are robots too....many variety...just like fish in d ocean.</p>

              <p>I am Indonesian Chinese.  I live in Indo</p>
              <p>Last year I met a SG guy at a dating website.  Actually it was a coincidance because I wasn't intend to seek a guy there.  Just curious with that website...registered without picture.  After that, I didn't login to that website for a long time....when I logged in..I got a  message from a guy (he didnt put his picture as well).  I replied to that message giving my email address for a further chat.  I was glad to have more new friend at that time.  no feeling for him.</p>
              <p>My first opinion was...this guy is very formal...very nerd...coz his language is very formal.  I felt like corresponding with a business partner....LOL....I thought our friendship would last longer...coz he was so boring.  But he did constant effort to make me attracted...and he suceeded after 4 months. There was a chemistry between us although we didn't know each faces.  Then we exchange our pics...and I was surprised he is good looking.  His physical appearance meets my criteria about man.</p>
              <p>he goes to indo regularly and finally he came to my town. I was very happy with our first dating  but I felt lil bit uncomfortable coz he kissed me too much.  I didn't say myself as a conservative lady but i need more time to make myself comfortable with physical touching such as kissing, touching, etc....because it was our first meeting</p>
              <p>then, he came again 2 months later.  It was getting worse coz he opened my blouse and kissed my breast. Although I struggled, he didn't care and keep insisted.   I was disagree..I am very uncomfortable with that.  When he asked me whether I like it or not...of course I answered no. I told him that I prefer not too many physical touching coz for me love is respect, understanding, trust, and support each other through the bad and good times.  Kissing and hugging are OKlah...but no more than that</p>
              <p>He was angry to me after hearing my explanation.  He said how can i have such a logical definition for love ?  for him love is feeling...feeling to hug, to kiss, to touch.</p>
              <p>Our relationship was getting cold.  He didn't contact me at all. He was totally changed...like a stranger for me.  When I tried to speak to him about this matter ( coz I thought we had to discuss more for any other different point of view to get win win solution)...he said he didn't want to talk about it anymore.  he left a problem unfinished</p>
              <p>Then I went to Singapore for job hunting.  I didn't tell him about my job hunting at first...just told him that I would have a long holiday in Singapore.       </p>
              <p>Again...he did the same things to me when i was in SG..opened my blouse to kiss my breast.  Although I struggled...he didnt care.  Even it  was getting worse...he tried to push my vagina with his finger (I still wore pants)...and after that he tried to open my pants but luckily I could stop him.</p>
              <p>when he knew about my job hunting....he was disagree and told me that I'd better to stay in indo.  Then I was angry and said "why everyone must always have the same thought with you?".  My sentence made him angry and again ....he left problem unfinished</p>
              <p>I was tired with his ego and didn't made any effort to make up like before.  And he didn't contact me as well....so 3 weeks after that I decided to end our relationship although I still love him.  I sent him an email coz I didn't want to speak or meet him.  He replied 2 days later...only saying "thank you and gud luck"</p>
              <p>He never hold my hands if we were at public places in Singapore.  So we looked like a "regular" friends only.  He forgot my birthday and never come to my place in Singapore after I have got roommate coz  I think he know he couldn't do that (kiss breast ,etc)</p>
              <p>I used to spy his house.  I found his car at the carkpark and I saw the door were open.  he had spare time but he didnt want to meet me.</p>
              <p>He changed a lot after I was disagree with him about sex</p>
              <p>Is sex very important in a relationship, SG guy??????</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>actually many miss the point that its a natural behaviour for a
              guy regardless of race language and age. a typical guy would not go
              in such extent unless got consent from the ger. i am not sure if
              the guy is mentally stable. TS have to judge that yourself. i think
              TS dont really love this guy. TS mentioned this "I didn't say
              myself as a conservative lady". I am sorry if this sounds
              offensive. This is my point of view.</p>

              <p><br> maybe he isnt singaporean but a permanent resident of singapore or
              a malaysian chinese perhaps.most singaporean guys would do the
              blouse thing.most would date u go for dinner watch a movie..meet
              yer folks etc etc .,,,just like any decent guy.to see if he is a
              singaporean....ask to see his identity card which should be pink in
              colour as only sporeans are issued that pink identity card
              according to law.</p>
              <p>perhaps he just watched too much violent anime films and wants
              to imitate them with u which is kinda sick.</p>
              <p>he never held yer hands in public???and he held u in his arms
              like it was the last days on the planet??dump him n get a better
              guy.looks like its lust n not love...in which case u might as well
              get a rubber dummy or a robot for a future husband.</p>
              <p>just dump him.....u have like 5 million more men in singapore
              some are nice..some are monsters from hell..some are robots
              too....many variety...just like fish in d ocean.</p>

              <p>i think he came from China mainland as his characteristics is very typical to someone who come from China mainland.  Maybe he and his family migrated to Singapore long long time ago.  Besides, he doesnt have western name.</p>
              <p>He is very introvert...not communicative.  He hide some information from me.  I used to ask for his family pics but he didn't give it to me.  I think he will absolutely be angry if i ask to see his NRIC</p>
              <p>It's hard to forget him as he meets 85% of my criteria...T.T  but time will heal lah</p>
              <p>you said that most singaporean men would do the blouse thing ??? OMG</p>
