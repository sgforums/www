              <p>I also think the same...probably he had "official" gf since he
                  doesnt support my intention to work and stay permanently in SG</p>
              <p>"Official" means the girl he gets from his
                  parents...matchmaker-thing.  As his family is still very
                  traditional and ask him to get married soon ...probably their
                  parents introduce him to a girl ... yeah u know lah</p>
              <p>I have a good networking in SG and at that time finally I got a
                  "spy" who is at the same office with him.  the spy is a friend
                  of my friend. </p>
              <p>When I told the spy his name...the spy said none with that name
                  in his office...I was quite shocked.  Then I showed his pic
                  and finally the spy can recognized.  The spy said he often see
                  him at office but doesnt know his name....but the spy has a friend
                  who is in the same departments with him so can gather some info</p>
              <p>the infos are: he is single and available...hardworking
                  guy...but his behaviour is quite weird...very unpopular at
                  office.</p>
              <p>And you know when I said to him that I have a friend who is at
                  the same office with him ?</p>
              <p>He said : "it is impossible your friend knows me....your friend
                  must be wrong...none knows me at office "</p>

              <p>woah this guy is one strange person. hiding so many things.</p>
              <p>yeah most relationships in sg involve sex in the equation. i'm saying this without relation to race or religion. i mean what the hell, the relationship im in, involves sex too. the problem with this guy you met is that he wants to make it a no.1 requirement before anything else. sex is supposed to be part of a r/s, not taking priority in it. otherwise its just going to be quite meaningless. it's a good thing you didn't sleep with him cos you felt uncomfortable. i guess that's 1 good thing that came out of this whole thing?</p>

              <p>If the guy only wants sex, please dump him immediately.</p>
              <p>This part can don’t read but if you bored, continue reading… I
              also dump alot of girls after I realize all they want is sex with
              me… I am so disappointed. I want to give my virginity only to the
              girl I married but they all cannot wait, keep putting their hands
              into my pants the first time i meet with them, i tried to run but
              some pushed me into their hotel room and proceed to rape me…
              sometimes i manage to run away but sometimes the girl too strong
              and raped me successfully… sometimes i so scared if i get pregnant…
              end of story…</p>

              <p>There are times on the internet, when clicking the reply button does not make much difference.</p>
              <p>I actually find it repulsive, when so many people bother to reply a single thread, yet none of them profess to have any real-life story to share.</p>
              <p>Come on! Show some balls, men and women, and... what's left?</p>
              <p>Maybe it's just the uncle in me. I am at a age now where I look back at my past relationships, and I was glad that I did not screw my ex. I merely quarreled with her over the phone, next day make up and then listen to her sweet nothings as we discussed tutorial assignments, and then we imagine that tomorrow might be a better day. She has totally no fashion sense, yet, how amusing when on a particular day, totally uncalled for, she wears something that is even more uglier than what she normally wears. Now, to make it better, the ugly blouse she has, is the one which she bought for me as a qin-luu zhuang. Two lovebirds, wearing ugly matching outfits, taking the train together, and the people opposite knowing for sure that we are a pair. Isn't this wonderful!?</p>
              <p>Yet on the day when she left me, I did not need a second reminder that look, this is it. Whether as a dating couple, or as best f*** buddies ... everytime I bump into her on the street, I shiver my arse out when I count my lucky stars that I did not get her.</p>
              <p>Now, why would a reasonable guy ... on any counts of 3, want to make love to a woman before thinking twice? Because it's the woman who wants it.</p>
              <p>But the clever and sneaky thing about women.. which all men knows, and all women denies, is that they will never own their mistakes. Even if they got purposely themselves drunk and f***ed, still, they will wake up in the hotel room, and cry to the guy saying "Look what u did to me". The point is, if the woman wants you, man, you are done for.</p>
              <p>If she does not want you, end of story. She'll rant on and on about "why is sex important in a relationship", and tomorrow she'll still give it to him.</p>
              <p>I swear to you, this is what happens.</p>
              <p>It is amazing that there are so many sympathisers for the women race. Yet none for the men.</p>

              <p>i think he came from China mainland as his characteristics is very typical to someone who come from China mainland.  Maybe he and his family migrated to Singapore long long time ago.  Besides, he doesnt have western name.</p>
              <p>He is very introvert...not communicative.  He hide some information from me.  I used to ask for his family pics but he didn't give it to me.  I think he will absolutely be angry if i ask to see his NRIC</p>

              <p>There are times on the internet, when clicking the reply button does not make much difference.</p>
              <p>I actually find it repulsive, when so many people bother to reply a single thread, yet none of them profess to have any real-life story to share.</p>
              <p>Come on! Show some balls, men and women, and... what's left?</p>
              <p>Maybe it's just the uncle in me. I am at a age now where I look back at my past relationships, and I was glad that I did not screw my ex. I merely quarreled with her over the phone, next day make up and then listen to her sweet nothings as we discussed tutorial assignments, and then we imagine that tomorrow might be a better day. She has totally no fashion sense, yet, how amusing when on a particular day, totally uncalled for, she wears something that is even more uglier than what she normally wears. Now, to make it better, the ugly blouse she has, is the one which she bought for me as a qin-luu zhuang. Two lovebirds, wearing ugly matching outfits, taking the train together, and the people opposite knowing for sure that we are a pair. Isn't this wonderful!?</p>
              <p>Yet on the day when she left me, I did not need a second reminder that look, this is it. Whether as a dating couple, or as best f*** buddies ... everytime I bump into her on the street, I shiver my arse out when I count my lucky stars that I did not get her.</p>
              <p>Now, why would a reasonable guy ... on any counts of 3, want to make love to a woman before thinking twice? Because it's the woman who wants it.</p>
              <p>But the clever and sneaky thing about women.. which all men knows, and all women denies, is that they will never own their mistakes. Even if they got purposely themselves drunk and f***ed, still, they will wake up in the hotel room, and cry to the guy saying "Look what u did to me". The point is, if the woman wants you, man, you are done for.</p>
              <p>If she does not want you, end of story. She'll rant on and on about "why is sex important in a relationship", and tomorrow she'll still give it to him.</p>
              <p>I swear to you, this is what happens.</p>
              <p>It is amazing that there are so many sympathisers for the women race. Yet none for the men.</p>

              <p>I was quite surprised when you told us his age, because I was thinking that this guy must be in his teens or his 20s, because he seems to be really "on" about sex, which I think is more popular among younger men. In my opinion older men knows how to properly position themselves better.</p>
              <p>I think he did that because he feels he "knows" you after the long distance relationship, so it is not purely a first date for him. But yes I think he should have respected your wishes and not pressurize you.</p>
              <p>It seems you are also disappointed with him in some areas....such as him being secretive about certain things....maybe you need some time to check this out and then you can decide on your own.</p>
              <p>First I think it is important he acknowledge you and treat you as his girlfriend. If he doesnt want to hold hands with you, doesnt want you to come and settle here, and doesnt want to mention his family, well.........let me ask you this....does he acknowledge you as his girlfriend to his friends ? If this is also a "no", then, you do not exist as a girlfirend at all, and you are something kept secret at a side for him. If this happens then you are just an internet sex buddy for him.</p>
              <p>Anyways, if this is confirmed (he keep refusing to acknowledge you as a girlfriend to his family and friends), then you need to cut loss.......and next time dont go to some casual websites. It's better to go to matchmaking websites, the serious matchmaking websites which have people inside who look for marriage. Those people inside would be serious and would be real.</p>

              even more uglier than what she normally wears. Now, to make it
              better, the ugly blouse she has, is the one which she bought for me
              as a qin-luu zhuang. Two lovebirds, wearing ugly matching outfits,
              taking the train together, and the people opposite knowing for sure
              that we are a pair. Isn't this wonderful!?</p>
              <p>Yet on the day when she left me, I did not need a second
              reminder that look, this is it. Whether as a dating couple, or as
              best f*** buddies ... everytime I bump into her on the street, I
              shiver my arse out when I count my lucky stars that I did not get
              her.</p>
              <p>Now, why would a reasonable guy ... on any counts of 3, want to
              make love to a woman before thinking twice? Because it's the woman
              who wants it.</p>
              <p>But the clever and sneaky thing about women.. which all men
              knows, and all women denies, is that they will never own their
              mistakes. Even if they got purposely themselves drunk and f***ed,
              still, they will wake up in the hotel room, and cry to the guy
              saying "Look what u did to me". The point is, if the woman wants
              you, man, you are done for.</p>
              <p>If she does not want you, end of story. She'll rant on and on
              about "why is sex important in a relationship", and tomorrow she'll
              still give it to him.</p>
              <p>I swear to you, this is what happens.</p>
              <p>It is amazing that there are so many sympathisers for the women
              race. Yet none for the men.</p>
