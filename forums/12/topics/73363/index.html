But when you find a new love, you<br>view the past as a teacher. In the game of love,<br>it doesn't really matter who won or who lost.<br>What is important is you know when to hold on and<br>when to let go! You know you really love someone<br>when you want him or her to be happy, even if<br>their happiness means that you're not part of it.<br>Everything happens for the best.<br><br>If the person you love doesn't love you back,<br>don't be afraid to love someone else again, for<br>you'll never know unless you give it a try.<br>You'll never love a person you love unless you<br>risk for love.

Don't find love, let love find you.<br>That's why it's called falling in love because<br>you don't force yourself to fall. You just fall.<br>You cannot finish a book without closing its<br>chapters. If you want to go on, then you have to<br>leave the past as you turn the pages.<br><br>Love is not destroyed by a single failure or won<br>by a single caress. It is a lifetime venture in<br>which we are always learning, discovering and<br>growing. The greatest irony of love is letting go<br>when you need to hold on and holding on when you<br>need to let go. We lose someone we love only when<br>we are destined to find someone else who can love<br>us even more than we can love ourselves. On<br>falling out of love, take some time to heal and<br>then get beckon the horse. But don't ever make<br>the same mistake of riding the same one that<br>threw you the first time.<br><br>To love is to risk rejection, to live is to risk<br>dying, to hope is to risk failure. But risk must<br>be taken because the greatest hazard in life is<br>risk nothing! To reach for another is to risk<br>involvement, to expose your feelings is to expose<br>true self; to love is to risk not to be loved in<br>return. How to define love: fall but do not<br>stumble, be constant but not too persistent,<br>share and never be unfair, understand and try not<br>to demand, hurt but never keep the pain.<br><br>Love is like a knife. It can stab the heart or it<br>can carve wonderful images into the soul that<br>always last for a lifetime. Love is supposed to<br>be the most wonderful feeling. It should inspire<br>you and give you joy and strength. But sometimes<br>the things that give you joy can also hurt you in<br>the end. Loving people means giving them the<br>freedom who they choose to be and where they<br>choose to be. For all the heartaches and the<br>tears, for gloomy days and fruitless years, you<br>should give thanks, for you know, that there were<br>the things that helped you grow.<br><br>Loving someone means giving him the freedom to<br>find his way, whether it leads towards you or<br>away from you. Love is a painful risk to take but<br>the risk must be taken no matter how scary or<br>painful, for only then you'll experience the<br>fullness of humanity and that is love.<br><br>Only love can hurt your heart, fill you with<br>desire and tear you apart.<br><br>Only love can make you cry and only love knows<br>why. If you're not ready to cry, if you're not<br>ready to take the risk, if you're not ready to<br>feel the pain, then you're not ready to fall in<br>love. There was a time in our lives when we<br>became afraid to fall in love 'coz every time we<br>do, we get hurt, and then I figured that's why<br>it's called falling in love.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jolin80:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="font-style: italic;">I think Quite meaningful</span><br><br>When you think of your past love, you may view it<br>as a failure. But when you find a new love, you<br>view the past as a teacher. In the game of love,<br>it doesn't really matter who won or who lost.<br>What is important is you know when to hold on and<br>when to let go! You know you really love someone<br>when you want him or her to be happy, even if<br>their happiness means that you're not part of it.<br>Everything happens for the best.<br><br>If the person you love doesn't love you back,<br>don't be afraid to love someone else again, for<br>you'll never know unless you give it a try.<br>You'll never love a person you love unless you<br>risk for love. Love strives in hurting. If you<br>don't get hurt, you don't learn how to love.<br><br>Love doesn't hurt all the time. Though the<br>hurting is still there to test you, it is to help<br>you grow. Don't find love, let love find you.<br>That's why it's called falling in love because<br>you don't force yourself to fall. You just fall.<br>You cannot finish a book without closing its<br>chapters. If you want to go on, then you have to<br>leave the past as you turn the pages.<br><br>Love is not destroyed by a single failure or won<br>by a single caress. It is a lifetime venture in<br>which we are always learning, discovering and<br>growing. The greatest irony of love is letting go<br>when you need to hold on and holding on when you<br>need to let go. We lose someone we love only when<br>we are destined to find someone else who can love<br>us even more than we can love ourselves. On<br>falling out of love, take some time to heal and<br>then get beckon the horse. But don't ever make<br>the same mistake of riding the same one that<br>threw you the first time.<br><br>To love is to risk rejection, to live is to risk<br>dying, to hope is to risk failure. But risk must<br>be taken because the greatest hazard in life is<br>risk nothing! To reach for another is to risk<br>involvement, to expose your feelings is to expose<br>true self; to love is to risk not to be loved in<br>return. How to define love: fall but do not<br>stumble, be constant but not too persistent,<br>share and never be unfair, understand and try not<br>to demand, hurt but never keep the pain.<br><br>Love is like a knife. It can stab the heart or it<br>can carve wonderful images into the soul that<br>always last for a lifetime. Love is supposed to<br>be the most wonderful feeling. It should inspire<br>you and give you joy and strength. But sometimes<br>the things that give you joy can also hurt you in<br>the end. Loving people means giving them the<br>freedom who they choose to be and where they<br>choose to be. For all the heartaches and the<br>tears, for gloomy days and fruitless years, you<br>should give thanks, for you know, that there were<br>the things that helped you grow.<br><br>Loving someone means giving him the freedom to<br>find his way, whether it leads towards you or<br>away from you. Love is a painful risk to take but<br>the risk must be taken no matter how scary or<br>painful, for only then you'll experience the<br>fullness of humanity and that is love.<br><br>Only love can hurt your heart, fill you with<br>desire and tear you apart.<br><br>Only love can make you cry and only love knows<br>why. If you're not ready to cry, if you're not<br>ready to take the risk, if you're not ready to<br>feel the pain, then you're not ready to fall in<br>love. There was a time in our lives when we<br>became afraid to fall in love 'coz every time we<br>do, we get hurt, and then I figured that's why<br>it's called falling in love.<br><br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  where were U when I needed morale booster ????<br>anyway this is wonderfully written.</div>
