So this puzzling question-mark will sometimes make you feel like you don't like him that much. And I'm not suggesting that you're gay, so don't get me wrong. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Simple...just keep a distance from him for a while and observe him. It can be physically keeping a distance or it can be keeping a distance from his friendship...up to you to decide which one is more appropriate. The reason for keeping a distance from him for a while is to take a step back to see if he's treating you as his best friend or not...and you will also be able to see his intentions clearly. And I'm not telling you to ignore him ok? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Do the above and you'll be able to get the answers you seeks in 3 weeks or less if both of you see each other everyday. Remember to make your own decision after that, and trust your own instinct. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>One more advice for you...remove all your expectations of your friends and don't have expectations for them. Cos they will definitely disappoint you one way or the other and you're going to waste your moods and frustrations dwelling on it. Just thought that it'll make you happier in the future. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good Luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
