            <div class='col-md body'>Hi TS, look at the bright side. There're many more worse fathers in the world. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>When I was very young, my dad bashes up my mother as and when he likes. As far as I can remember during my primary school days, he likes to grab my hair and bang my head towards the lift wall and the walls in my home. While in sec sch he used the boken which I used for my sports to attack me obviously aiming at my head. Luckily I blocked with my arm with several severe bruises on it. On many occasions, he threatened to kill me by grabbing a knife from the drawer everytime I do not do anything according to his demands. Being young, I was just simply immature and didn't have the rational to think will he really kill me. I just ran away out of the house as quickly as I could and not get home until my mother is home. He only stopped after the very first time I fought back by kicking him and he fell down. That was slightly more than 10 years ao when I just entered poly.<br><br>After ending his physical violence on me, he'd turn to use verbal abuse and he particularly enjoy cursing at me that I will hang myself to death in my NS days because I will not stand the life inside. Anyway I signed on and ORD in one piece 2 years back.<br><br>What's most saddening was that instead of attacking me a grown adult, he continued to pick on my weak mother. He even used my motorcycle helmet to attack my mother by throwing it at her with great force.<br><br>The irony, when I called the cops, he acted pitiful and said he will never hurt his family and he loves his children and wife. When I moved out of the house after my marriage, my mother applied for PPO. After 1 year, ironically, my father filed for divorce. He thought he's going to get 50% of the house with a divorce, definately a good deal since he paid only a couple of thousands out of the 60 over thousands of the house. Even in the courtroom, he lied to the judge on and on and on endlessly on many issues. His trademark behavior: only pick on the weak, play victim &amp; lying.<br><br>Initially my mother do not want to 'bully' him and wanted to give him 25% for the house. But at the end of the legal battle, the judge gave my mum 80% and the remaining 20% to my father.<br><br>I have not seen my father since 2003 SARS period shortly after I got married when I moved out. I don't know how he looked and forgot how he sounds now. My sister has also went to Australia to get her degree and my mother having the whole house to her while waiting for the documentations to settle sell the house this Sept is living a new life. I still meet up my mother and email my sister. Despite my many attempts to convince my mother to move into my house which I prepared a room for her ever since I moved in, she refused. She has never experienced such life to live without fear that the man next door will ever bash her up again. And she want to relive the life she was deprived of for decades.<br><br>But I know there are worse fathers in the world &amp; the only reason why I stay away from my father is that he is the sort who'd resort to any lies to get his ways. I am not surprised that he pretend to fall down and accuse someone of assaulting him to get something out of it. Definately a very dangerous person to associate with.</div>

There're many more worse fathers in the world. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>When I was very young, my dad bashes up my mother as and when he likes. As far as I can remember during my primary school days, he likes to grab my hair and bang my head towards the lift wall and the walls in my home. While in sec sch he used the boken which I used for my sports to attack me obviously aiming at my head. Luckily I blocked with my arm with several severe bruises on it. On many occasions, he threatened to kill me by grabbing a knife from the drawer everytime I do not do anything according to his demands. Being young, I was just simply immature and didn't have the rational to think will he really kill me. I just ran away out of the house as quickly as I could and not get home until my mother is home. He only stopped after the very first time I fought back by kicking him and he fell down. That was slightly more than 10 years ao when I just entered poly.<br><br>After ending his physical violence on me, he'd turn to use verbal abuse and he particularly enjoy cursing at me that I will hang myself to death in my NS days because I will not stand the life inside. Anyway I signed on and ORD in one piece 2 years back.<br><br>What's most saddening was that instead of attacking me a grown adult, he continued to pick on my weak mother. He even used my motorcycle helmet to attack my mother by throwing it at her with great force.<br><br>The irony, when I called the cops, he acted pitiful and said he will never hurt his family and he loves his children and wife. When I moved out of the house after my marriage, my mother applied for PPO. After 1 year, ironically, my father filed for divorce. He thought he's going to get 50% of the house with a divorce, definately a good deal since he paid only a couple of thousands out of the 60 over thousands of the house. Even in the courtroom, he lied to the judge on and on and on endlessly on many issues. His trademark behavior: only pick on the weak, play victim &amp; lying.<br><br>Initially my mother do not want to 'bully' him and wanted to give him 25% for the house. But at the end of the legal battle, the judge gave my mum 80% and the remaining 20% to my father.<br><br>I have not seen my father since 2003 SARS period shortly after I got married when I moved out. I don't know how he looked and forgot how he sounds now. My sister has also went to Australia to get her degree and my mother having the whole house to her while waiting for the documentations to settle sell the house this Sept is living a new life. I still meet up my mother and email my sister. Despite my many attempts to convince my mother to move into my house which I prepared a room for her ever since I moved in, she refused. She has never experienced such life to live without fear that the man next door will ever bash her up again. And she want to relive the life she was deprived of for decades.<br><br>But I know there are worse fathers in the world &amp; the only reason why I stay away from my father is that he is the sort who'd resort to any lies to get his ways. I am not surprised that he pretend to fall down and accuse someone of assaulting him to get something out of it. Definately a very dangerous person to associate with.</div></blockquote>wah lau...ure one more drama sia...its xiao wu jian da wu wor...</div>
