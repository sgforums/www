              <p>I don’t know. I just feel as though I’m in a mess.</p>
              <p>Failing in school, no particular outstanding
              achievements.</p>
              <p>Had changed so much since I was in primary school. Is
              that what growing up do to you? It just fucked my life up
              totally..Whatever that I used to do, I stopped doing them, and I
              kept to myself..</p>
              <p>I don’t know what I want in life, what I want to be
              when I grow up, I just live everyday aimlessly, living on for
              tomorrow, enduring what everyday has got in store for me.</p>
              <p>Recently got 0/30 for a math test. Like what the fuck?
              0/30? I have always sucked at math, but getting a 0/30..was
              depressing I would say. And it was especially so when I though I
              would actually pass it.</p>
              <p>Now in school, I am famous for getting 0/30. Getting
              0/30 for math was near impossible, and that was what I thought when
              I heard that there were 2 other people who did so.</p>
              <p>I have always tried to keep up, always trying to give a
              damn, always asking questions, always doing my best.</p>
              <p>But when am I going to see the results of my hard
              work?</p>
              <p>Any teens in the same shit that I am in? Feeling down?
              Feeling aimless and feeling like shit?</p>
              <p>Worst still, I’m in a rather famous school in which
              students are known for their intelligence, even though not all of
              them go along with this idea.</p>
              <p>I have expectations to live up to, both mine, and
              others. I have already tried very hard to achieve them, and yet, my
              standards for myself are dropping yearly while failing to meet
              them.</p>
              <p>Life appears to be mundane to me now, all the shit that
              I do everyday that repeats itself drives me crazy…</p>
              <p>I’m known to be rather hardworking and friendly amongst
              my friends, but I don’t do as well (academically) as compared to
              those who seem to not give a fuck..</p>
              <p>Really don’t know what to do now..</p>

              <p>Whether you are a leader, a follower, a go getter, or just staying alive, depends on your attitude while you're a teenager.</p>

              <p>definitely agree with you, mancha.</p>
              <p>been going for maths tuition for almost 2 months now, and there's been significant improvement for me <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"> and i can deal more or less with all maths questions in my eoy revision papers which is a compilation of questions from past year papers as compared to before when i get completely stumped and unable to seek (professional) help.</p>
              <p>its really sad that people rarely do get second chances, and given the choice i would have definitely worked harder in the beginning, rather than being kicked around by people (who think they are) smarter than me...sometimes i still get upset over my own poorly made decisions..</p>

              <p>i don't see any improvement at all..</p>
              <p>worst still, its getting from bad to worse. started off pretty well this year, got almost 90% for most tests, and ended up doing not as well as expected for the others.</p>
              <p>if only i could even get a 60% for maths, i would be more than satisfied already..</p>
              <p>and sometimes i get stuck while practising my maths, and when i mean stuck, it really is stuck. as in i cant think of any other solution, and would never complete the question.</p>
              <p>when i read other peoples' (correct) working, i never fail to understand it. whereas when im on my own, i always get stuck and unable to move on.</p>

              <p><br>Practical advice: It appears therein lies the problem... You really have to stretch your wits. I've thought about math problems for whole days only to wake up with the answer. You just have to not give up even if you're not in an exam. It really makes a difference because it teaches you resilience to keep going in the exam no matter how tough the questions are.</p>
              <p>Emotional advice: I completely understand how you feel.... We're the minority, the people who work harder but fail anyway. I really don't know what to say except to hang in there... If it helps you should know you're not alone. Keep struggling, one day we'll get out of this dastardly boat.</p>
