              <p>2. i have a hunch you're focusing on the things you want to achieve and that school is just a mere thing to not let people's expectation down.</p>

              <p>U mentioned that u knew how to do the questions but made a few mistakes thus losing all the marks; marks were not even given although your method was right.</p>
              <p>Actually, some markers do give marks for correct methods; even if ur final ans is wrong, they will still give u marks for the workings. It depends on the individual markers.</p>
              <p>There may be a possibility that ur teacher was being strict but being strict is better than giving u marks here and there and giving an impression that all markers will mark the way he/she did. Most teachers tend to be more harsh in their marking especially those teaching Sec 3, 4 and 5.</p>
              <p>If it was due to mistakes that u had a lower score, it could be that u are careless? If that's the case, u should try to be more careful in the future.</p>
              <p>In fact, maths is one subject where carelessness will have a great effect on the marks.</p>
              <p>Not to worry, there will always be room for improvements.</p>
              <p>Take me for example, I was in the top class in my school; thus higher expectations from teachers. But apparently, I can never ever understand Physics. My marks for it was a downward sloping curve from Sec 3 to 4. I was thinking it's definitely going to be a 'gone case' thing for my O Levels.</p>
              <p>I even got a 20 marks for my Prelims; I could still laugh at that time. Ultimately, I didn't actually put in extra effort for Physics during my O levels; kind of don't wanna stress myself. Eventually, I still manage to get a B3 for it.</p>
              <p>Whatever happens, look on the bright side of things. Rem there's always a rainbow after a shower. Cheers!</p>

              <p>Dude, you gotta clear up 2 barriers. One conceptual and one psychological.</p>
              <p>Conceptual is easy. If your maths foundation is weak, no matter how long you stare at the paper, the paper is just going to stare back at you. Go get a tutor. Go get a mentor from school. Go and do something, anything.</p>
              <p>Psychological is much harder. Most importantly, don't dispise yourself. A person who dispise himself, will always go down on a road to failure. Look at the mirror , is it a wretched face you see in the mirror? Don't you hate it? Then do something about that face. Buck up and say I can do it, I will do it.</p>
              <p>Is there any distractions at home that will hinder you from working? For me, its the computer. In the past i will just disassemble the computer and reassemble it back during the holidays.</p>
              <p><br>But with things like project work, I can't do that. That is a waste of time. So i do all my self study a few rooms away from my computer.</p>
              <p>Do your best dude. At the age of 15, you haven't even reach 1/4 of your life time yet. There is a very long way to go. So don't think of this as the end. As you go past one stage after another, you find that all those previous stages were just so insignificant. It would have been such a waste to have ended everything during those previous stages of your lives. The future is much more important than the past. So live on for the futre. Don't let the past hinder your future.</p>

              <p>Since you said you can understand your friends' workings, then I suppose you don't have much problems with the concepts and that's good! The problem with you could be the lack of practice. Practise more and get the hang of answering the questions. If you do a lot of Maths questions, you will notice that there can only be a few ways in which they ask you the questions and for each kind of question,  there's a certain way to tackle it.</p>
              <p>If you get stuck and you really need to take a look at the solution, don't reveal the solution all at one go. Show yourself the first working step in the solution, and try to figure the rest out by yourself. Even if you spend more than 30min on one question, if you are able to solve it in the end without referring much to the answer key, you should be proud of yourself! Work on your answering first, then work on your speed after that.</p>
              <p>I feel that Maths is something which really needs understanding and lots of practices. You can't just 'read' Maths alone. Yup. =)</p>

              <p>and i dont hate myself..i appreciate myself as a unique individual..besides, there are always people worse off than me(other than the fact that no one can get below 0), and by being able to cope fine with other subjects in my school is already considered good by national standard (only average in my class)</p>

              <p>I am now reminiscing the life of a 15 year old.</p>
              <p>I used to screw up my tests, especially during exams and I almost gave up on myself.</p>
              <p>viopurp's suggestions are really useful, and it is very helpful to a student.</p>
              <p>Now, in college, the rate of retaining is super high, and I have reached a stage where it is not a matter of passing a subject but passing a year.</p>
              <p>Nobody has the permission to affect your feelings other than yourself.</p>
              <p>Now people know that you have flunked a test rather deeply, they should be curious about you next test result. Why not baffle them in the next round by scoring a straight A?</p>
              <p>I know you can do better than that.</p>
              <p>Believe in yourself that you can do it!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believe every teen have their own set of problems. Your mind is stronger than you think. Don't let a small obstacle break down your psychological barrier. Though this fall is real hard, dont be afraid to kick all stones away and stand up again.</p>
