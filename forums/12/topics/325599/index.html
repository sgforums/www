              <p class="MsoNormal">I don’t know. I just feel as though I’m in a mess.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Failing in school, no particular outstanding achievements.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Had changed so much since I was in primary school. Is that what growing up do to you? It just fucked my life up totally..Whatever that I used to do, I stopped doing them, and I kept to myself..</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I don’t know what I want in life, what I want to be when I grow
              up, I just live everyday aimlessly, living on for tomorrow, enduring what
              everyday has got in store for me.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Recently got 0/30 for a math test. Like what the fuck? 0/30?
              I have always sucked at math, but getting a 0/30..was depressing I would say. And
              it was especially so when I though I would actually pass it.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Now in school, I am famous for getting 0/30. Getting 0/30
              for math was near impossible, and that was what I thought when I heard that
              there were 2 other people who did so.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I have always tried to keep up, always trying to give a
              damn, always asking questions, always doing my best.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">But when am I going to see the results of my hard work?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Any teens in the same shit that I am in? Feeling down? Feeling
              aimless and feeling like shit?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Worst still, I’m in a rather famous school in which students
              are known for their intelligence, even though not all of them go along with
              this idea.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I have expectations to live up to, both mine, and others. I have
              already tried very hard to achieve them, and yet, my standards for myself are
              dropping yearly while failing to meet them.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Life appears to be mundane to me now, all the shit that I do
              everyday that repeats itself drives me crazy…</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I’m known to be rather hardworking and friendly amongst my
              friends, but I don’t do as well (academically) as compared to those who seem to
              not give a fuck..</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Really don’t know what to do now..</p>

              <p>i know how you feel..</p>
              <p>like you, i have the intelligent look. everyone thinks you're damn smart. but you're not. just like any tom, dick and harry. there's nothing much you can do about it except proving their point. yes! showing that at least, your look got abit of substance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as for your maths, when I was in sec 2, im famous for failing them also. in sem 1, i would be like always at the back of my class. like everyone knows i just dont want to do them properly or just purposely get super low grades to attract enough attention to be at the back of the class.</p>
              <p>well, guess wad, proven them wrong when I start focusing and whacking for my maths during the june hols. practically did the book everyday. And ya, I was known from zero to hero and nobody else actually bother to say anything about my maths after that.</p>
              <p>Imagine how happy my maths teacher was.</p>
              <p>Imagine how happy my parents was.</p>
              <p>Imagine how happy I am. Thats what's most important.</p>
              <p>Find something you like. work on it. Life never come easy neither it is that difficult. and it's never too late to start anything new.</p>

              <p>I flunked my amaths with a F9 from the first week of sec 3 all the way to my prelims. I already intended on giving up, but 2 days before the paper my friend gave me intensive training, plus a tad of luck i managed to get a C6 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>All i can say is dont give up on the subject, slowly explore and try it out.</p>

              <p>I don’t know. I just feel as though I’m in a mess.</p>
              <p>Failing in school, no particular outstanding
                      achievements.</p>
              <p>Had changed so much since I was in primary school. Is
                      that what growing up do to you? It just fucked my life up
                      totally..Whatever that I used to do, I stopped doing them, and I
                      kept to myself..</p>
              <p>I don’t know what I want in life, what I want to be
                      when I grow up, I just live everyday aimlessly, living on for
                      tomorrow, enduring what everyday has got in store for me.</p>
              <p>Recently got 0/30 for a math test. Like what the fuck?
                      0/30? I have always sucked at math, but getting a 0/30..was
                      depressing I would say. And it was especially so when I though I
                      would actually pass it.</p>
              <p>Now in school, I am famous for getting 0/30. Getting
                      0/30 for math was near impossible, and that was what I thought when
                      I heard that there were 2 other people who did so.</p>
              <p>I have always tried to keep up, always trying to give a
                      damn, always asking questions, always doing my best.</p>
              <p>But when am I going to see the results of my hard
                      work?</p>
              <p>Any teens in the same shit that I am in? Feeling down?
                      Feeling aimless and feeling like shit?</p>
              <p>Worst still, I’m in a rather famous school in which
                      students are known for their intelligence, even though not all of
                      them go along with this idea.</p>
              <p>I have expectations to live up to, both mine, and
                      others. I have already tried very hard to achieve them, and yet, my
                      standards for myself are dropping yearly while failing to meet
                      them.</p>
              <p>Life appears to be mundane to me now, all the shit that
                      I do everyday that repeats itself drives me crazy…</p>
              <p>I’m known to be rather hardworking and friendly amongst
                      my friends, but I don’t do as well (academically) as compared to
                      those who seem to not give a fuck..</p>
              <p>Really don’t know what to do now..</p>

              <p>Hm, I was in the same situation as you before.</p>
              <p>From quite a famous school last time. Got sucky results even though I thought I've studied hard while my friends, who appear not to have studied, all did better than me. I was feeling quite indignant and depressed at that time then, and I will always think the world is unfair. However, if I think about it seriously, my friends could have worked much much harder than me, just that I didn't get to see it (i.e. they mugged like crazy at home)  or they could have engaged tutors to guide them. For me, I don't engage tutors, so if you are the same case as me, you ought to put in much much more efforts than your friends in order to catch up with them.</p>
              <p>My L1R5 was like more than 20 all the time. And I was like the only one in my class that actually can get E8 and F9 and hence I was the lowest in my class. The 2nd lowest person in my class only got C6 as his lowest grade? That was how bad I was at that time. At times, I've wanted to give up on myself. However, being the kind that always want to win, I refuse to let myself down just like that. I pushed myself on harder. Until sec 4 prelims then my L1R5 got raised to 14 and my lowest subject grade in my L1R5 was a B4. And for O-levels, I've managed to get a single digit for L1R5 and my lowest subject grade was an A2.</p>
              <p>My advice: Don't give up on yourself yet. All's not lost yet.</p>
              <p>And another thing, famous schools always tend to set harder papers for their own students so as to challenge them. Only until prelims, then they are much kinder and they set easier papers. Even though the prelims paper were much easier, whenever I compared my school's prelim paper and the O-levels paper, I will go WTH.</p>
              <p>So don't worry too much but at the same time, don't be too complacent! Must continue to work hard! If I've managed to overcome this problem, you can too! =)</p>

              <p>but i take 10 mins for a simple 5 marks question, reason being that i always kana stuck, because some questions can only be solved at a certain step with a certain solution..i just hate dead subjects like maths man. makes no sense to me at all. im only worried about it because it has double weightage as compared to the rest of the subjects (a/e maths).</p>
              <p>and many career options have maths as a prerequisite..and i dont want to give myself lesser roads to take, especially when i have absolutely no idea what i want to be and what i want to do next time..</p>

For example. pi. Why is pi is 3.14 . Why it is not 1.14 or 2.14 or 4.14 but 3.14? It is because when any circle's circumference is divided by its radius, the result is always 3.14.  <br><br>Once you get the basic concept right, you can can proceed to understand the formula better.<br><br>Adn one more thing, don't hang on the net too much - it sure will affect your school work.</p></div>

              <p>Here are some advices for you. Hm, some may sound quite cliche but
                  they have really worked for me! Last time, I refused to take these
                  advices seriously, only when the critical moment came, then I started
                  to really heed them. I reckon you are only sec 3 this year, you
                  still have a year to improve yourself. Unlike me, I was only left with around 3 months at that time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>-When in doubt, ask the teacher.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Seriously,
                  no one else can answer your questions as clearly as a teacher,
                  especially if he/she is the one who has taught the topic which you are
                  not clear in. Your friends may not have a clear idea of the topic and
                  you may just end up even more confused or end up having the wrong
                  concepts. Tutors may not be clear of the syllables nowadays since it
                  has undergone some changes. Teachers are there to help you. Don't be
                  afraid to ask and don't be lazy to ask too! For me, when I'm doing my
                  revision, I will jot down my questions on a piece of paper so that I
                  won't forget what I've wanted to ask.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>-Stay in school or go out to mug.</strong></span></p>
              <p>I
                  usually do this so that I can prevent myself from using the
                  computer/sleeping once I reach home. I can spend the whole day at the
                  computer, doing nothing other than surfing random sites. And before I
                  know it, one whole day is gone just like that. Staying in school to mug
                  is good as I find the environment more conducive and you can always
                  look for the teachers for help. Going out to mug, you can get help from
                  your friends. But the down side is, you may end up chatting/slacking
                  with your friends if you are not disciplined enough.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>-Do up a study schedule/plan.</strong></span></p>
              <p>I
                  used to think this was damn stupid and tedious. However when my friends
                  all started to come up with their own study schedules. I felt the
                  pressure and started to do up one too. And surprisingly, it helped me a
                  lot in revision and time mangement. Since you still have time, try
                  covering like 2-3 topics a week? I think it's not that difficult. =)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>-Sleep early.</strong></span></p>
              <p>I
                  used to sleep at around 3am last time and it really affected me in
                  school. I could not concentrate and as much as I tried to listen and
                  focus on the lesson, I found myself drifting off to sleep unknowingly.
                  Only when my friend woke me up, then I realised I've actually fallen
                  asleep! So I tried changing my sleeping habits gradually, and now I'm
                  off to bed at around 11 or 11+ pm, which is a lot earlier as compared
                  to last time. You can sense the significant difference in your
                  concentration level and alertness.</p>

              <p>bro. 15 years old, don't know what you want in life is ok one.</p>
              <p>maths is a tricky subject. you either score or fail. rarely in between <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>
              <p>one thing for sure i can assure you is, practise really makes perfect when it comes to maths.</p>
              <p>because there's only a limited amount of ways maths can be phrased. so as long as your grasp the fundamentals, english is next.</p>
              <p>just like saying,</p>
              <p>1 + 1 = 2      ===&gt; straightfoward right?</p>
              <p>one basket got one apple. i put one more apple in. how many apples do i have?</p>
              <p>this kind slightly tougher because it requires the english language. but ultimately it also means what is 1 + 1 isn't it?</p>
              <p>all i can advise is keep practising. if you need a tutor to guide you, please try to get one. for your own good. you don't wanna curse and swear if you fail your Os <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>
