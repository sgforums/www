                                <p class="">Failing in school, no particular outstanding
                                achievements.</p>
                                <p class="">Had changed so much since I was in primary school. Is
                                that what growing up do to you? It just fucked my life up
                                totally..Whatever that I used to do, I stopped doing them, and I
                                kept to myself..</p>
                                <p class="">I donâ€™t know what I want in life, what I want to be
                                when I grow up, I just live everyday aimlessly, living on for
                                tomorrow, enduring what everyday has got in store for me.</p>
                                <p class="">Recently got 0/30 for a math test. Like what the fuck?
                                0/30? I have always sucked at math, but getting a 0/30..was
                                depressing I would say. And it was especially so when I though I
                                would actually pass it.</p>
                                <p class="">Now in school, I am famous for getting 0/30. Getting
                                0/30 for math was near impossible, and that was what I thought when
                                I heard that there were 2 other people who did so.</p>
                                <p class="">I have always tried to keep up, always trying to give a
                                damn, always asking questions, always doing my best.</p>
                                <p class="">But when am I going to see the results of my hard
                                work?</p>
                                <p class="">Any teens in the same shit that I am in? Feeling down?
                                Feeling aimless and feeling like shit?</p>
                                <p class="">Worst still, Iâ€™m in a rather famous school in which
                                students are known for their intelligence, even though not all of
                                them go along with this idea.</p>
                                <p class="">I have expectations to live up to, both mine, and
                                others. I have already tried very hard to achieve them, and yet, my
                                standards for myself are dropping yearly while failing to meet

              You have to keep trying, don't give up.
              I got bad marks before, but came through as well. Bottom in physics in sec 3class (something like20+%), came up with A at end of year.
              
              Got F9 for my F math in JC, came out A for A level.
              
              Keep trying. bombard your teacher if you cant follow what's being taught in class.

              <p>wow chill dude. the thing is, you've got to be proud of who you are. when i was in jc i fucked up pretty bad too  but hey, life is a self fulfilling prophecy and if you hold on to your pride and tell yourself that you'll pull through this it should be you wont end up too bad.. and when i say fucked up bad i dont mean JUST maths you know.. i mean fucked up like ALL my subjects were fucked.. and trust me, if you're talking about competitive studying environments.. hmm lets just say cannot compare to my jc eh :p</p>
              <p>the thing is, if you tell yourself that you're screwed you'll end up screwed. if you tell yourself that you'll turn out successful you will turn out successful. and you're 15 goddammit. no one dares to say any 15 yr old is pathetic because you're no where near your prime..</p>
              <p>seriously, just chill, and work hard.. sec schl life is all a training in time management so you should probably spend less time on forums like these too :p (ok dont slam me already) i just chanced upon this cos i am waiting for uni to start and i am eff-ing bored!! grrr..</p>

              <p>i got either e8 or f9 for my math from sec 3 all the way to sec 4 prelim.</p>
              <p>had to do a re-exam for math in the first term of sec 4 if not i have to go back to sec 3. and i barely scrapped through!</p>
              <p>i remember clearly, on the day of my paper for o levels, my teacher still told me to not bother trying because i am bound to fail anyway. it was THAT BAD.</p>
              <p>i got an A2 for my o level math. i didnt study like crazy or smth, i just concentrated more. and simple as it sounds, it helps.</p>

              <p>Dude.</p>
              <p>Maybe you studied the wrong way? Try asking teacher and ask them how can you get better grades... Since you are hardworking, I am sure you can do it.<br>There are seldom people who is hardworking nowadays... As people nowadays are just lazy and wanted the fast way out. People who are hardworking need are those with self-discipline. They know what they need to do.</p>
              <p>Make use of your strength (hardworking, self-discipline) and continue to work hard.<br>15 this year eh? I suppose you are sec 3 no?<br>Don't worry just keep working hard. Endure you way through...</p>
              <p>Live for a better life next time...<br>Take time finding what is your real aim in life...<br>What really can make you happy...</p>

              <p>Don't worry dude. Things will get better! It's just part of growing up. I was like that too a few years back. It will soon pass.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hell, my maths is still a blemish on me till this day, and I'm still standing. But don't be like me; keep putting in effort, and you'll see the fruits of yoru labour eventually. At the very least, you'll be able to look back and say "I tried." Frankly, it's better to have tried and failed than to give up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But moving beyond maths, I guess we all should try to go beyond living for your and others' expectations. If you try to compare yourself to others, there's always gonna be someone better than you. Better to go beyond that, and find your own purpose and meaning to work. I came across this quote: "The problem with the rat race is that even if you win, you're still a rat." Why limit yourself?</p>

              <p>I don’t know. I just feel as though I’m in a mess.</p>
              <p>Failing in school, no particular outstanding achievements.</p>
              <p>Had changed so much since I was in primary school. Is that what growing up do to you? It just fucked my life up totally..Whatever that I used to do, I stopped doing them, and I kept to myself..</p>
              <p>I don’t know what I want in life, what I want to be when I grow up, I just live everyday aimlessly, living on for tomorrow, enduring what everyday has got in store for me.</p>
              <p>Recently got 0/30 for a math test. Like what the fuck? 0/30? I have always sucked at math, but getting a 0/30..was depressing I would say. And it was especially so when I though I would actually pass it.</p>
              <p>Now in school, I am famous for getting 0/30. Getting 0/30 for math was near impossible, and that was what I thought when I heard that there were 2 other people who did so.</p>
              <p>I have always tried to keep up, always trying to give a damn, always asking questions, always doing my best.</p>
              <p>But when am I going to see the results of my hard work?</p>
              <p>Any teens in the same shit that I am in? Feeling down? Feeling aimless and feeling like shit?</p>
              <p>Worst still, I’m in a rather famous school in which students are known for their intelligence, even though not all of them go along with this idea.</p>
              <p>I have expectations to live up to, both mine, and others. I have already tried very hard to achieve them, and yet, my standards for myself are dropping yearly while failing to meet them.</p>
              <p>Life appears to be mundane to me now, all the shit that I do everyday that repeats itself drives me crazy…</p>
              <p>I’m known to be rather hardworking and friendly amongst my friends, but I don’t do as well (academically) as compared to those who seem to not give a fuck..</p>
              <p>Really don’t know what to do now..</p>

              <p><br>If you don't work hard now, you'll suffer more later. Like it or not, in Singapore, unless you're filthy rich; or that you have some damn unique business idea, in the end, the thing to fall back on is some of the basic paper qualification. Only 15 yrs old nia, still got hope.</p>
              <p>If you think you're not good in studies, then have to understand why, seek help from school, this is what teachers are for, to help you to achieve the necessary academic requirements (note:I didn't say becoming top student or what, don't stress out).</p>
              <p>If you're really competent in a subject, there's no reason you will have your standard drop, rather, it's because you have a weak comprehension in your tests/exams questions. You will need more experience, practices and help from teachers to help you with this.</p>
              <p>As in you don't know what you want in the future, I can tell you, even when you know what you want in the future, you may not end up be what you wanted. This is due to the changes in society and the changes in you. As you grow up, you will find that your priorities and interests start to change, not that it is bad, but the way you see things and the things that you treasure may gradually change.</p>
              <p>And you harping on the 0/30 for your maths test, did you find out WHY you get 0?</p>
              <p>Don't live up to other's expectation but live for your own. Set your own targets, no matter how small, an achievement is an achievement. Say you can aim for just a passing grade for your next maths test, then gradually thinking of scoring a band B then to band A.</p>
              <p>I used to have a teacher who told me this:</p>
              <p>In Singapore, you may not know what you want now for life, but that's okay, just score the best in all subjects so that in time to come, you get to choose your interest of study; and not the other way round.</p>

              <p>recently i had this problem of waking up every morning just to find myself thinking " fuck, 1 day more to my maths end of year, another opportunity for me to fuck up"</p>
              <p>last time, i did not have such disturbing problems..i didnt even care if i failed or passed as long as i tried, i think im desperate for success now :(</p>
              <p>and i still dont know why i got 0/30. i reflected on my mistakes just to realize that i was motherfucking careless, and all the solutions were well used, except for a question which i had no idea how to start with. that really pissed me off. so fucking unfair. 30 mark paper, a few careless mistakes and bam, kosong.</p>

              <p>true, i agree</p>
              <p>hey donk, dun be so hard on yrself, at least u are free from the expectations, unlike those 'elites' who struggle everyday under the stress n expectations piled upon them</p>
              <p>nonetheless, u might still hav the hidden potential within u, and being freed from these expection n stress makes it easier to draw out that potential</p>
              <p>dun lose hope donk, life may be unfair, but it's still full of opportunities</p>

              <p>Maths just needs a lot and lot of practice. You already realize that it is important for your future. Just take the first step and start practising. I was like you, back then. My maths is still bad, but at least I managed to clear my O levels.</p>
