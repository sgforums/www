Your only worry is that how are you going to bring this matter up to her..<br><br>Everyone has their own expectations.. Noone is perfect.. Come to think of it.. If you expect so much from your wife.. Are you giving out that much as you think you expect your wife to be?<br><br>If you based on your expectations to find a wife who will eventually fits in the citeria so perfectly.. No flaws about her.. No weaknesses only strengths.. No quarrels.. No objections.. Everything goes your way.. Be the one always giving in but not you (though might be your fault)  Aren't you having an emotionless, affectionless.. ROBOTIC WIFE??<br><br>Well this reminds me of a movie that i had watched some time ago.. Is it called Stephen's Wife? Or stephenson's Wife..?? (something like that). It talks about how men implant a micro chip into their wives' brain and take control or them.. they who wants their wife to be so perfect that they will not question their husbands where they go.. Do what they says.. the wife jus stays at home and look after kids.. Cooking.. Washing of clothes.. blah blah..<br><br>ANyway... Your gal might not be the one that suits you.. Widen your social circles and get to know more people.. Purpose of doing that is not only to get GFs.. ok??<br><br>Cheers..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>GF = Wife?</strong><br><br>Let me answer this quesition in another perspective.<br>In most realistic situation, it is not neccessary that your lifetime partner is always the one who love most.<br><br>Time and fate play a major role in choosing 'her'. Well, at times, when we are all young and we tends to be selective in choosing the 'ideal' fairy in your mind.<br><br>But once you pass the village, you might not see an identical hut again. Think twice before you make any implusive decisions.<br><br><strong>she will never give-in in an arguement and i have to say sorry most of the time</strong><br><br>This is subjective, it depends how objective you guys see in the arguments.<br>If she is strong headed, try to cool her down and talk to her again when everything is clamer again.<br><br><strong>less romantic</strong><br>Of cos, as the time moves, the relationship may be more routinise, and based on what you said, i think this is apply to you.<br>romance don't come by itself. It need a strick and a sparkle and also it concern both parties. Maybe you can start the ball rolling and make some effort in doing something for her again, this may rekindled back the feeling again.<br><br><strong>To her, for now, everything is alright. but to me, something is lacking in this relationship.</strong><br><br>If there is nothing wrong with her, maybe problem lies with you. Identify the problem instead of avoiding the issue.<br><br>Lastly, i understand what i said is easier than done. But it is possible if you try your best effort in making as a goal. I think the problem lies with you, less probablity with her, so it's up to you if you want to give up this relationship simply.<br><br>All the best and good luck.<br></div>

What if the person you are with is gf material, but not someone that you can spend the rest of your life with? Is this girl still worth the time and effort?<br><br>I admit that i have quite a high expectation for my wife, and that my current gf does not meet all of them. There are certain traits that i do not really accept in her, such as her stubborn-ness (such a word?), lack of respect (in some ways), and her past, which still irks me (have accepted, but will never forget it).<br><br>Why i say that she is gf material is that we are quite close already, being together for more than a year, and i admit that she is nice to me and we get along quite well. The first few months were fantastic, the so-called honeymoon period and it was like in heaven.<br><br>Lately, since last june.. i start to find that we were not that compatible afterall. she will never give-in in an arguement and i have to say sorry most of the time. and we became less romantic. Now, she feels more like a close friend rather than someone I can spend my life with. I can tell that she's not likely to stand by me through all difficulties and stuff i may face in the future. u know.. the through thick and thin kind..<br><br>To her, for now, everything is alright. but to me, something is lacking in this relationship. I don't feel what i used to feel anymore. i lie about my feelings sometimes to make her happy and think that nothing is wrong.. to the extent that i cannot say my deepest feelings.. maybe they have bottled up to the top, which gives this sucky confused feeling..<br><br>I admit that my mind has strayed. I've been browsing through friendster and it reminded me that there are plenty of better fishes out there. problem is, my social circle is very limited and i only know 3 girls other than her.<br><br>I really don't know, so confused. arghh, can't even phrase out my thoughts properly.. it's all jumbled up. if only i could pull this messy bunch of chains into one straight line, it would be so much easier to solve...</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Judging from CloUdiSm stand, I will not advocate marrying your first relationship, <span style="font-style: italic;">in this modern era</span>. Usually, most people <span style="font-style: italic;">in this modern era</span>, will have between 2-4 partners before they settle for marriage (on average). It is because karmic debts will not exclude you: if you experience more and mature emotionally before marriage; you can probably exempt some learning 'modules' in marriage.<br><br>Again, if you are simple minded and generally free from cynical thoughts, which I think is quite rare in this modern era, it is possible to marry a first love, with happily-ever-after sort of conclusion. But this outcome is almost utopia IMHO.<br><br>When you have deeper understanding in Love, your thinking and emotions began to complicate. It brings you to a new level, like a marathon run, where you could no longer see the starting point you began your run. Our sight absorbed new sceneries, our feet led us to new places and of course, fatigue start to affect us.<br><br>We are nowhere like before.<br><br>I would say that it is dangerous to automatically put gf = wife or bf = husband sort of mindset in any relationship before marriage. When marriage comes naturally, you wouldn't even have doubts regarding the woman/man you are going to marry. And if you do have... chances are, you are not ready for marriage.<br><br>In BGR, we are still exploring and learning. Avoid absolute thinking. I am <strong>not </strong>encouraging you to give up, rather, learn to discover your relationship as you understand your specific needs and the woman you have. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
