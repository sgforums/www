What if the person you are with is gf material, but not someone that you can spend the rest of your life with? Is this girl still worth the time and effort?<br><br>I admit that i have quite a high expectation for my wife, and that my current gf does not meet all of them. There are certain traits that i do not really accept in her, such as her stubborn-ness (such a word?), lack of respect (in some ways), and her past, which still irks me (have accepted, but will never forget it).<br><br>Why i say that she is gf material is that we are quite close already, being together for more than a year, and i admit that she is nice to me and we get along quite well. The first few months were fantastic, the so-called honeymoon period and it was like in heaven.<br><br>Lately, since last june.. i start to find that we were not that compatible afterall. she will never give-in in an arguement and i have to say sorry most of the time. and we became less romantic. Now, she feels more like a close friend rather than someone I can spend my life with. I can tell that she's not likely to stand by me through all difficulties and stuff i may face in the future. u know.. the through thick and thin kind..<br><br>To her, for now, everything is alright. but to me, something is lacking in this relationship. I don't feel what i used to feel anymore. i lie about my feelings sometimes to make her happy and think that nothing is wrong.. to the extent that i cannot say my deepest feelings.. maybe they have bottled up to the top, which gives this sucky confused feeling..<br><br>I admit that my mind has strayed. I've been browsing through friendster and it reminded me that there are plenty of better fishes out there. problem is, my social circle is very limited and i only know 3 girls other than her.<br><br>I really don't know, so confused. arghh, can't even phrase out my thoughts properly.. it's all jumbled up. if only i could pull this messy bunch of chains into one straight line, it would be so much easier to solve...</div></blockquote>My PERSONAL ADVICE is for you to LEAVE HER unless you're VERY SURE she's what you REALLY WANT...<br><br>You might be hurting her by leaving her now, but I reckon you would be HURTING her EVEN MORE in the future should anything goes amiss...<br><br>You're confused about the relationship, what you want from it, and ultimately what being a relationship really means...<br><br>It's weird that you could be talking about marriage and commitments on one hand, yet on the other hand... Your DOING, your BELIEF, your UNDERSTANDING shows you're NOTHING even NEAR for that... WAKE UP PLS....</div>
