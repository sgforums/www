So why wait until it does?<br><br>although she still feels it'll work out, in a long run, both of you will suffer even more. from your post you've mentioned you've been lying about how you feel towards her, not being the sincere one. ask yourself, where do you draw the line in such a relationship? do you keep telling her what she want's to hear, the way she likes it heard, pretending until you blow up in hurtful words of confessions? i wonder how she'd feel. if you don't see yourself proposing to her anytime soon, why bother making both of you wait for nothing?<br><br>in other words - break off.<br><br>it's a win-win situation right? unless you think in these 2 years you'd really benefit from the experience, it's a really great advice.<br><br>all the best man.</div>
