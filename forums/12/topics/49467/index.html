            <div class='col-md body'>Recently, I wrote a letter to a gal which I have loved secretly for 3 years already telling her about my feeling. You see 3 years ago when I was about to tell her, she just found a bf, so I refrained from breaking this to her.<br><br>Hence I've been pretty moody and kept asking myself, "what if I had told her about my feeling? What could have happened then?".<br><br>In the end, a few days ago, I decided to end this guessing game and just wrote a letter to her explaining everything. I also stated that I'm not expecting anything from her now since we've almost lost touch for so long and she may already be engaged liaoz, but I'm just seeking an answer to a question that has been bothering me for years. Once I get the answer I'll move on with my life and leave her alone.<br><br>Well, it sure feels great to finally get it off my chest. Now I've just slotted the letter into the postal box and waiting for her reply. It could be a simple "yes" or "no" but it  more than suffices.<br><br>I think I've finally done the correct thing to trash everything out and move on, instead of leaving it to fester longer and more years of agony for me.

Since such is her intention, why force your way through and make things difficult for everybody...?<br><br>As much as your intention is without ill motive and straightforward as explained by yourself... You cannot spectacular the whole situation based on just what you want out of just a SIMPLE question.... The SIMPLE question MIGHT just means so much more for her... For her current attached bf...?<br><br>I wanted to tell you that some things are better left untouched... Especially if you're already without an intention.... You might just wanna 'ask'.... At this point, unless some miscommunication has cropped up, it's pretty obviously that she's not into your frame of thinking.... Life goes on for everybody...

You see 3 years ago when I was about to tell her, she just found a bf, so I refrained from breaking this to her.<br><br>Hence I've been pretty moody and kept asking myself, "what if I had told her about my feeling? What could have happened then?".<br><br>In the end, a few days ago, I decided to end this guessing game and just wrote a letter to her explaining everything. I also stated that I'm not expecting anything from her now since we've almost lost touch for so long and she may already be engaged liaoz, but I'm just seeking an answer to a question that has been bothering me for years. Once I get the answer I'll move on with my life and leave her alone.<br><br>Well, it sure feels great to finally get it off my chest.

            <div class='col-md body'>It was a misunderstanding; she was busy with her work when I SMS her. Then she called her just now during her lunch break, said she has received my letter and it was a surprise for her and she's attached now and we're still friends.<br><br>But now I'm actually feeling better; at least the issue has finally been resolved. Still she didn't tell me what she could have said 3 years ago but it is no longer important. The important thing is that I've told her about my feeling and it's time to move on.<br><br>Right now I'm not really thinking about how or when I can find my next "prey" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> or getting into some relationship. I got other things in life and I'm now comtemplating what to do in future. Maybe I wouldn't find another gal but that's OK for me; it has been wonderful for me to know her already.<br><br>And thanks for everyone here who have contributed your invaluable comments and advices when I'm feeling down and having problems with my life. And I would like to thank Bob Tasca for his book "U will b Satisfied" and quote, "It'll never happen if you sit back and wait for it; if you try to make it happen and fail at first, at least you'll be failing forward, and eventually, you'll win."</div>
