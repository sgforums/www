              <p>Hi, I have been thinking and doing research for
               months that I have got no interest in any of the jobs that are listed 
              in the job searching websites. I have done packing job at warehouse and I
               have done badly for it which I resign. My parents have some shops that 
              they rent to tenants and I am learning from them on how things are done.
               I wasn't interested in it either as I kept on forgetting things and 
              doesn't really care much about it. The only thing that keeps on running 
              in my mind is playing video game.<br> <br> I have watched some video series of Evolution championship series as a 
              fan of some fighting games like the Street Fighter 4 series. I notice 
              this man, Mr. Ho Kun Xian, our fellow citizen has won the Super Street 
              Fighter 4 Arcade Edition's tournament in year 2013. I have read about 
              his articles that he takes gaming as his career for living which I 
              always think that there is no such thing and would think that playing 
              video game is like a hobby. After reading his articles, I feel that 
              maybe it is worth a try. I am interested in following his path such as 
              learning how to play the game since I have played a few times but not as
               serious as him and the rest of the pros, but I do not know how to 
              start. <br> <br> I have thought of another alternate career path, I have not told my 
              family members about it. I was thinking that there are some of their 
              shops that they have not rented yet and I would like to start a business
               such as making it into a video game shop where customers would come to 
              my shop to play console fighting games since the only video game I am 
              interested is fighting games. I did not see any shops having this, so I 
              was thinking whether is it a good ideal to start this kind of business?</p>

              <p>Starting up any business is a tough chore, without thinking too much since a long time back there are several polytechnics even universities that offer a minor or perhaps major in technoentrepreneurship. Perhaps, assuming that 'fighting games' are without any physical violence, and if anybody is keen on broadening one's scope from guarding one's family shophouses to a country worth of barracks, the military is a better place if a user can type three paragraphs in proper English as TS above. If the purpose of life is about running a computer shop with several inter-connected network computers that offers tense and engaging computing experiences, there are all kinds of legitimate - perhaps - vocations that range from an air traffic controller monitoring planes or even fighter jets taking off and landing. Of course, Daddy Government has everything built from air traffic controllers till War Games training grounds, the difference between being employed by Daddy Government my My-Own-Sweet-Daddy is that there is a payscale in civil service so that there is what is known as 'career progression'.</p>
              <p>Certainly, My-Own-Sweet-Daddy has got his own perks and benefits as well, e.g. one can keep a family together perhaps by having a mother watching after the shophouse while the father walks a dog, all the way till the bigger challenge: &gt; 1.3 babies per man and woman become the real reason why one needs more than one shophouse property. If we go by national policies, any start-up business that dispenses with violent computer games while doing strange yesteryear endeavours like blind-dating and match-making or even student care or even pet columbaria can offer countless hours of fun. Since it is a family endeavour so far as it is being described, what matters perhaps may be the clan's expectations. Some families have little issues with their youths dropping out of school without completing their degrees, yet others like mine will make sure one gets a scholarship so that they can sleep better..</p>
