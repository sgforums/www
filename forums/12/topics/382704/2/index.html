              <p>But not to worry and to overestimate your self-worth, a guy like you who would readily ditch old love for new, isn't half as worthy of remembrance as you think you are. What's more a lifetime of hate?</p>

              <p>Hi god of spunk,</p>
              <p>You cannot treat the relationship between two people the same way as that between a person and an object. Each time a better labtop enters the market, it is fine to replace it with your current one, if your finance situation allows it. But you must understand that it is ethically wrong to replace a girl with a "better" one whenever you "find one", though it is unfortunately what a significant amount of people do.</p>
              <p>If I were to teach you how to break up with your girlfriend, I will only be encouraging you to dump girls the same way as one will dispose of their garbage. Instead, I will like you to think about it, why did you become a couple with your girlfriend in the first place? What did you like about her back then? What were the ups and downs in your relationship?</p>
              <p>Just to add on, if a girl is to dump her boyfriend so easily just because you ask her to do so, it will speak a lot about her views and beliefs of a relationship between a couple, and in turn also her character.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
