              <p>the problem with you gals is that you think the world revolves around u.</p>
              <p>it doesnt matter who did what or whos to blame.</p>
              <p>if either party feels that there is a problem in the r/s then just speak out and try to resolve the issue.</p>
              <p>its crap when you say he is not sincere cause he didnt call. did you try to call him? no! so why blame him?</p>
              <p>if he what he did with that gal is totally innocent, im sure he is really dissapointed and sad about being accused.</p>
              <p>If you cant accept what he did, whatever the reason he did it for. then no point starting this topic.</p>

              <p>He may be innocent or he may be guilty. Fact is that people make mistakes but make sure you make your decision based on facts n not assumptions.</p>
              <p>Different people have different viewpoints for every issue. Being in a R/S means you have to adapt n try to understand your partner'e feelings and actions.</p>
              <p>Sometimes people do things at the spur of the moment without thought for his/her partner only to regret it later. Ask yourself, did he apologise or at least sound sorry?</p>
              <p>Communication is the most important thing a R/S should have. Lose it and all is lost.</p>
              <p>If you dont convey your emotions and thoughts to your partner. All he knows about you is from second guessing and that will only have a 50/50 chance of being right. Im almost sure your r/s is pretty new. You dont know each other that well, if you dont communicate, there will be more complications to come.</p>
              <p>I am not defending him but mayb this tourist is a very old friend from his past, in this current day n age, even strangers hug when taking a pic. Even if they were just normal friends, would you brush your fren off if he was to put his arm around u when your taking a pic?</p>
              <p>If he is cheating on you, good for you that you found out early n kick the bastard outa your life.</p>
              <p>But before you make your decision, COMMUNICATE.</p>
