              <p>Costing a bomb can get him out of NS is ok, but if still cannot, then really waste. Today, with so many of your soft and nerdy singaporeans young guys, I feel so sad for singapore, if they cannot take the hardship and the social aspect of NS life, guess they will not be able to fit into the working society, what then, had singapore education and parenting become?? a shift is greatly needed here</p>

              :) I don't understand him now. He's seldom talks to us and just lay
              on his bed for the whole day and amazing is he didn't even sleep.
              If it was me I could have fall asleep within 1 hour i guess? He
              used to be very cheerful and and lots of friends which I envy so
              much. His fb is flooded by lots of ppl every single day. But now he
              no longer going out anymore and he quit buying and talks bout those
              branded stuff. Ya now I remember him telling my mom he hear weird
              voices like someone is talking to him.</span></p>

              hahas I'm not good in searching things over the internet that's why
              i came here to ask. To my knowledge I do know there's  Mount

              Judging from the part where you said about him "hearing weird voices talking to him" can be quite serious. U can try asking him if those voices are simply talking to him or are commanding in nature. If it is commanding in nature PLS BRING HIM TO A DOC ASAP. I used to work in a psychiatric clinic and if i am not wrong,that can be a early symptom of psychosis(schizophrenia) but i am not medically trained enough to diagnosis that. Lost of interest is a common symptom of depression. I believe you can bring him to any govt hospitals for a psychiatric review. If you need some recommendation for a psychiatric review in a govt hospital u can drop me a PM.

              <blockquote>Come on, don't be that biased to say that NS ruin one's life... Not mentioning about your buddy that if he did no go into NS, his father's life will be saved.. There's no logic in saying that.. Does that mean if your buddy is not in NS, he will be with his father 24/7 and not a second out of sight? I understand what you are thinking but don't be that biased to the extent. What's the point of your buddy going AWOL, at the end of the day, he will be caught sooner or later and after serving his sentence, he is still liable for his NS remaining period. Many of us also went through quite a lot for the 2 years and ORD.. Your brother just have to bear with it. I would say is your brother's mental issue.. since he will become alright if he is out of NS.. some people will even say that he's just trying to bluff his way through even though he may be really mentally affected... As his family, instead of trying to find ways to get him out of NS, why not talk to him, care for him and walk through this 'hard' period. Even if he is given PES F and discharged from NS, do you think is a good thing? Next time when he apply for jobs, his employers will ask for his National Service status... is he going to say PES F, result: Mental Issue - Depression? No one will give him a job... especially nowadays job stress is an issue. <br></blockquote><blockquote><br></blockquote><blockquote>

                  will tell him bout it. Oh I rmb 1 thing which I had this buddy who
                  is superb " ON ". He become very depressed or sad after his parent
                  pass away. He wouldn't want to come to camp and even go awol after
                  the SAF ward psychiatry said something to him. I think his friends
                  or someone brought him over to Mount Alvernia and from that day I
                  didn't see him till ORD. I try putting me in his shoes and after
                  the few nights of thoughts. I found out that people with depression
                  are like they wouldn't want to go to places that hurt them deep
                  down the bottom of their heart. For example my buddy. If that time
                  he have not gone into NS he could save his dad from a heart attack
                  at home which no one notice during the daytime. So NS is a place
                  that left the hurt over there that he can't take it when his back
                  in camp. As for my bro he's going to have a bright future and NS
                  ruin it.</strong></span></span></p>
