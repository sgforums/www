              <p>Hi Ladies and Gentlemen. I have a serious problem about my younger brother. He's in the army now and he was diagnosed with Depression when he enlisted not long after. He had been to the SAF Ward for quite a number of times and it seems not to work for him. </p>
              <p>I wanna bring him to see a Private Psychiatrist and see whether it works or not. So is there any recommendation? </p>
              <p>Btw does those Private Psychiatrist take in NSF? </p>

              <p>You can bring your brother to a private practice, however, it really depends on the situation.. What does your brother intend to do? Downgrade status or?? He can get a report from the private psychiatrist and bring it to his camp's medical officer for review. Chances is that he might be temporary given light duties or temporary downgrade..</p>

              <p>then they will ask you a few questions (which should be fine since you are not the å½“äº‹äºº) so they can put you to the right doctor... i think.</p>

              <p>He got downgraded for the rest of his NS or temporary? A good psychiatrist will not necessary give him MC. Psychiatrist will have to diagnose what's the problem and give a treatment plan to it accordingly... He/She will then write a report and advise you on the path your brother will have to go.. he/she will then recommend to SAF on solution(s) for his NS. some solution may be download your brother to become a clerk instead? or storeman or something suitable for his situation.. All these will see what's the problem with your brother.</p>
              <p><br>There's no point keep giving MC to your brother. He can't be taking MC for the rest of his NS period. Anyway, whatever MC given apart from SAF camp medical centre, it will have to be verified by the camp Medical Officer. Which mean, even if the psychiatrist give your brother 7 days mc or even longer, your brother need to bring it to the medical centre to show it to the medical officer who will decide if it is 'approve' or not.</p>
              <p>You may want to consider trying Raffles Hospital where they have a counselling centre with some in-house psychiatrist... Mount Elizabeth and Gleneagles do have..</p>
              <p>One point to note.. private psychiatrist are very expensive where it can reach thousands of dollars.. do consider this.. Depression may only require counsellor, not to the extend of psychiatrist, so take note.</p>

Yea He can't take MC all the way but sometimes if he really going crazy they should be able to help him. Wow I didn't see this Gleneagles Hospital before. Thanks for the info too :) I saw some of the Consultation start from $150. He's seeing a counsellor now and heard from him the counsellor is a very nice person.</span></p>

He's seldom talks to us and just lay on his bed for the whole day and amazing is he didn't even sleep. If it was me I could have fall asleep within 1 hour i guess? He used to be very cheerful and and lots of friends which I envy so much. His fb is flooded by lots of ppl every single day. But now he no longer going out anymore and he quit buying and talks bout those branded stuff. Ya now I remember him telling my mom he hear weird voices like someone is talking to him.</span></p>

To my knowledge I do know there's  Mount Alvernia and Elizabeth.  </span></p>

              <p>Addict tainedlove - Charges of counsellor and psychiatrist are very much different. Why not ask his current counsellor if it is necessary to see a psychiatrist? If he requires medication, then he need a psychiatrist because counsellor cannot prescribe medication. What's more does he want since he is already permanently downgraded? Honestly, if like what you said, sometimes he really is going crazy, he need to be warded.</p>
              <p>Gleneagles and Mount Elizabeth are the same medical group. They each have medical centres where that are many private practices. If you want hospital, go to Raffles Hospital.</p>
              <p>I have not heard of Newton Medical but heard of Novena Medical. It's just a facility with many different private practices.</p>
