He kept coming back no matter how many times I rejected him. He even knows where I stay. I accepted him partly because I really didn't have the heart to reject him anymore and since he knew where I stay, he might hurt my family, afterall I meant everything to him, without me he is just a zombie.

He's a really good guy except that he needs me. I am like part of him life. Everything he does, he does for me.<br><br>I really don't see the problem, but yet there's a problem...</div></blockquote>Don't take this problem lightly. You have to solve this problem before it becomes a tragedy. I have seen a similar case whereby a man killed the woman because repeated begging doesn't work. He killed himself in the end. The whole case is very similar to yours.<br><br>Maybe you can try giving hints to him that you have no feelings for him. Avoiding isn't the solution, as seen in this case. Moving house doesn't help, because this woman had done the same thing and only to be killed by him. You can introduce other girls to him also. Someone who is like you in terms of characters, like kindness, loves cooking, loves sewing etc.</div>

It'll only bring us back to square one, where I'm too scared to break up with him again, but will I stay for long? no, i cant live a lie, so I'll have had to break up with him all over again and put the two of us through that ordeal all over again.<br><br>By the way, right now my ex is so happily attached with another gal... but all these won't be possible if we did not end the relationship that was going nowhere.<br><br>If you really do not love him, Do it for him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was about to answer you that if he loves you, he wouldn't hurt your family &amp; cause you sadness, until I remembered yi ai cheng hen.  This may be applicable since he's so melodramatic about losing you, &amp; has even resorted to using emotional blackmail on you (who's to say to which level he's willing to stoop?).<br><br>Since you know what he's like, then the answer lies with you.  You know that No matter what, he's Not gonna give up.  So just keep telling him No.  He uses those tactics because he KNOWS that eventually, he'll wear you down.  If you show that you're equally adamant, &amp; if it means you hafta repeat No daily for the rest of your life, you'll do it, he may think twice.<br><br>If you're really afraid that he'll be psychotic &amp; hurt your family, then speak to your family members.  You owe it to them to let them know their safety may be affected, so they can take necessary precautions.  Speak to the police about this guy if he comes &amp; harrasses you or your family members.<br><br>I usually don't entertain people who're very persistent &amp; who disregard what I want as well.  If I say No, I mean it, &amp; No matter how they keep on giving different reasons or repeating themselves, I'll say No.  If I'm sick of them talking &amp; talking, I'll just use body language to let them know I'm Not listening, &amp; they're boring me, like yawning, dozing off, reading, etc.<br><br>Once, somebody actually pulled my hand &amp; said in that wimpy, weepy voice, "Hey, are you listening to me?"  So I just nonchalantly asked, "Oh, I can't remember what you were talking about already.  Kinda switched off after you'd repeated yourself the 6th time.

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly speaking, I used to be like that. Doing everything and anything for my ex, just to make her happy. But your case is different from mine. Ask yourself this few questions:<br><br>1) Do you really love him? Or are you just holding on because of his soft nature?<br><br>2) As many have pointed out, if he really loves you, would he try to harm your family? Has he ever indicated to you of such a violent thought? Or are you just being too paranoid?<br><br>3) If he has never said things like, 'I'm going to harm your family if you leave me' and such other stuff, then why are you still holding on if you don't have feelings for him? Are you really afraid of hurting and breaking his heart? Or is there another reason behind it?<br><br>Sometimes, you have to be cruel to be kind. If you can't see yourself being with him in the future, voice it out to him and he should be able to understand if you talk to him about it. You have to be firm. Don't be afraid of hurting him now. If you both are to carry on this empty relationship, both of you will get hurt even more later on as you both would have sunken very deep into the mire by then. That's what I call being practical.<br><br>Think about it and all the best...</div>

Infact, we started out because he kept breaking down infront of me. He kept crying and crying and crying. My friends and I all know that he can't live without me. He kept coming back no matter how many times I rejected him. He even knows where I stay. I accepted him partly because I really didn't have the heart to reject him anymore and since he knew where I stay, he might hurt my family, afterall I meant everything to him, without me he is just a zombie. Besides, if he really hurt my family, calling the police won't do any good as the damage is already done.<br><br>However, he treats me really really really really well. He gives in to me everytime. He buys me everything I wants, brings me everywhere I want to go. He doesn't even dare hug or kiss me, he just holds my hand lightly. I can't bear to see him hurt. He's a really good guy except that he needs me. I am like part of him life.

Emotions are oozing all over the place, spilling unsaturated agony as he has yet to attain emotional maturity. A relationship with such people is usually karmic because you bring on lessons to them.<br><br>Somehow, you thought of your acceptance of Love as a form of panacea for his life. In fact, based on what you have written about him, he is likely in need of emotional and spiritual evolution or crudely put: get a life, as having a relationship would not restore any of these afflictions.<br><br>To make matter worst, you have thought and his perceive in a way which you feel that you must be his answer to his suffering. Why, do you seriously think that, you are doing him a great favour?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The truth is that you are destroying him every minute. </strong></span><br><br>This relationship is like him taking illicit drugs. You feed him with bleak hope that one day he could win you over, unknowingly, he will never succeed. This abominable desire grows with strength each new day and he will attempt to give everything that you wish because in his vision, this is only way you could allow him the 'drugs'... by allowing him to remain in this relationship with you.<br><br>Sympathy? Your sympathy blends in nicely with his self pity. So fitting that it revealed a blatant karmic pattern. When you retreated physically or when he 'thought' that you retreated emotionally, it is as if you are denying drugs for his addiction.<br><br>He cries.<br><br>He regressed back to his early childhood... back to how he react with difficulty he faces when he was a young boy.<br><br>Very ill or passive maternal influence.<br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Don't think about him; think about yourself. If this is not what you want, don't play angel to people whom you know will be intensely involved with you. You will sprout extremism in these people and leave burning scars that will be impossible to eradicate in the future.<br><br>Love is not about his inability of living without you - it is about the inability to live without each other.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
