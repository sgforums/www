I mean, what kind of wimp is that? And to think that ''he doesnt dare to kiss or hug''<br><br>The problem is that u have accepted him when u learnt that he knows where u stay. U shdn't have, seriously. I bet if he knows u have no feelings whether now or initially, he will still be begging for ur affection. Tell him to stop being a wimp and maybe, maybe you might start to have feelings for him. Tell him to stop giving in to u sometimes. Tell him to make decisions himself sometimes. Tell him to stop crying and hug u more.</div>

Infact, we started out because he kept breaking down infront of me. He kept crying and crying and crying. My friends and I all know that he can't live without me. He kept coming back no matter how many times I rejected him. He even knows where I stay. I accepted him partly because I really didn't have the heart to reject him anymore and since he knew where I stay, he might hurt my family, afterall I meant everything to him, without me he is just a zombie. Besides, if he really hurt my family, calling the police won't do any good as the damage is already done.<br><br>However, he treats me really really really really well. He gives in to me everytime. He buys me everything I wants, brings me everywhere I want to go. He doesn't even dare hug or kiss me, he just holds my hand lightly. I can't bear to see him hurt. He's a really good guy except that he needs me. I am like part of him life. Everything he does, he does for me.<br><br>I really don't see the problem, but yet there's a problem...</div></blockquote>Just wise up to him of the fact that you do not love him. Period.<br><br>Sorry to say, but this is the only way to make him come to his senses? U're suffering because u're FORCED to be his lover, unwillingly (or not). Regardless, I just think that that's not what he should do, and you should stand up for your view on the r/s.<br><br>No point getting urself hurt in the first place <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>And yes, I believe you're really kind, in considering his feelings before any moves are made <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to have a true long lasting r/s,  one must learn when to hold tight and when its time to let go..<br>Instead of hurting the partner in future, you might want to end earlier to shorten the pain...<br><br>but b4 you do it, ask yourself whether you really have no feelings at all? i see some cases where the person who initiate ends up regreting..<br>good luck <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The terms "breaking up " is a tough choice to make for both parties whether it's one-sided , due to circumstances ...etc , it's never easy for the parties.<br><br>He shoul realize even they stay together , the one-sided affair , how long can it last ? But that is another problem which I should not drag about it.<br><br>For your case, I believe you should do what is right for yourself . I don't think you want to let the one-sided relationship drag on until it becomes worst. You have to put your foot down. Love is selfish and Love cannot be bought with money. Perhaps you can ask his best buddy ( if you can't talk him out ) to explain to him why they  have to break up .(since he cannot accept your explanation) His stunts (crying ..etc) is being totally unfair for you , he doesn't even consider for you. Pretty immatured to me I must say . So for now , maybe you should explain to his best buddy . Get his best buddy and your best buddy ( 4 of you all meet up ) then you talk things over him . He has to get it over somehow .Don't give in to him anymore because the more you give in , the more he thinks he still has a chance to win you back. Remember this.  Good luck to you.<br><br>All the best .<br><br></div>
