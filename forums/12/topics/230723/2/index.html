ONly you can find out the answer.  You either do it directly or indirectly to find out if she is willing to accept you getting a step close to her/to woo her.  If you are daring enough, ask her what she is looking for in a bf.   I can see that she likes you, too.   Up to you to find out what sort of liking is that.   Or it is possible that she treats you as a good friend like what I did to my other guy friends.  When they expressed their liking for me I did not give them the green light to be my bf then they all left me, so sad!  Sometimes it is very easy for guys to mistaken that gals like them.  For you, please find out by depending on your gut feeling.  It is kind of tough to mention any signal from a gal, because many times guys may be mistaken.  Whatever you are doing , don't rush in case you scare her off.<br><br>Good luck.</div>
