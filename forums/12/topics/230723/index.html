Of course, when I say take your time doesn't mean take few years or so.Find some topics that you both are interested in to talk about and also if possible try to find out tactfully and skillfully on what sort of man is she looking for?  Oh yes, since Valentine's Day coming, you can seize opportunity ask her if she has any plan on how to spend Valentine's DAy.<br><br>I would think "test water" for once or twice in the way that cause no hard feeling and hurt is OK.  But don't do it again and again.  My ex loved to do it to me and he admitted he like to test me, and I tell you I hate it!<br><br>Good luck!</div>
