Then we continued to exchanged smses for a while.</span><br><br>if you thought you were decent in the cinema or behaving properly , what prompted you to send that sms? - im sorry for being naughty?thats contradictory isnt it?<br>and how about the earlier part that you said that she led you on?have you conveniently forgotten about that?<br>i find the things you said strange and disjointed.<br><span style="color: blue;"><br>Some time after, a question which kept popping my mind continued to disturb me. There was another(?) forumite who PMed me about her problem (sorry I can't disclose the nick) which involves a sex buddy. She and Quinsy were PMing me about the same time which was really in the middle of the night. So I thought they might actually be the same person, hence I smsed Quinsy the question of "Do you have a sex buddy?" out of the blues...</span><br>haha, i predicted that,...you will say that the sms was not meant for her..<br><br>what else<br><br>what happened to your resignation?...so sad that this is your best attempt in defending yourself..i do really hope she will go to the police..</div>
