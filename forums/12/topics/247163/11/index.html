Stop playing into her mind. She will go to the police, just a matter of time. And saying that she led you on...thats BS! You could have said NO or simply focus on the bloody movie rather then focusing on her. Its all about the intention in the act. And the way I see it, your intention during the show was to outrage her modesty, so there it is.<br><br>1st you say she looks ugly and won't wanna outrage her modesty, now you say that she led you on. What are you going to say next? Her mom was wrong to allow her to buy such clothes? Her mom was wrong to allow her to go out? All in all, its always Quinsy's fault ain't it? Nothing to do with you. She's the active ingredient in this whole episode, you are merely the reactant eh?You mentioned that she did not object, cuz she was too stunned and traumatized by it. So if you have an ounce of decency left, own up to the police. If not, may you not only be molested by the inmates, but get ass-raped as well!</div>
