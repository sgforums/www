Sharing something that is shameful (Quinsy words not mine) is beneficial? I don't think so. I have read the post in length and 99 percent Quinsy post came across as playful and ask forumners to guess who is the culprit. What kind of message was she trying to put across? Guessing game? If she was serious about the whole situation she should post it in a serious manner. As someone said it takes two hands to clap. also Quincy did mention that said molester wasn't that cute. So if the said molester was cute she don't mind it and this issue wouldn't have been publicisized or broadcast? Interesting indeed.</div></blockquote>zzz. I can say I don't know the best way to do things, ok? I just knew i had to let ppl know, to stop him from tricking other girls. I didn't dare to come out right and just accuse, cuz I was afraid people might just say me anyhow slander. When it happened, I only SMS-ed SpecOps87 about it. He was the one who told me to shame him. I did the best I knew how to.</div>
