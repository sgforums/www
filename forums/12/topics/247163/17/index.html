            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I have a friend who went through a similar situation like Quincy and I understand how she feels. Please respect her decision by just letting this thread die, want to discuss, please don't do it on the forum (public). The more you all discuss about it, the more humiliating for the victim, Quincy. So please show her some respect by ending this thread once and for all.<br><br>Unneccessary comments just add fuel to fire , I hope some of you guys please get this into your head.<br><br>( I am pretty sure someone else will comment after my post) . -_-</div>
