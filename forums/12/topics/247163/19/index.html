            <div class='col-md body'>hi quinsy,<br><br>its a criminal mindset on his side and he will do anything and say anything to prove his innocences...He may one day plead with you,tell you how much he actually was obsessed with you but behind your back. He would stab you dead and deny all shit.Furthermore, there will be some idiots and his friends who would side him and ridiculate you. take heart. You do not deserve all that. Just learn to do selective listening and filter out craps. i guess you shouldnt care what ever excuse he has came up for his actions. The easiest excuse is simply to point out that you seduced him. Singapore law, protects woman.do not be afriad. Its truely a hassle to make a police report but before you ever contemplating degrading yourself again or commiting suicide, well at least file a report.<br><br>If you do not wish to report. i feel that its a decision that i respect. But you must move on and not allow him to affect your life, infact let it be a character builting experience. It may hurt for a very long time 2 years 3 years or even 5 years..but If you can find a man who loves you in future, i am sure you find peace again. Even so, You have all the rights to hate him eternally and do or say any sh*it you want,until e day you could let it rest and be happy.<br><br>tc,<br>Angelza</div>
