            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Despite what has happened, be glad and happy for the fact that the girl is at least truthful to you.  You would definitely experience more pain and anguish if she is not truthful should you have continue to move forward the relationship.<br><br>The girl must have enjoyed being with you since you have meet up often and call each other daily.  However, it is clear that she has decided it is someone else she loves at the moment.  If you can respect her decision and maintain some kind of distance (ie, more as a friend), both of you can and/or may still stay as friends.  This is tough to do though.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>* What you can feel and fully express, you can heal*</strong></span><br></span></div>

Sometimes, they have to sort out things for themselves before accepting you.<br><br>Look also at your own actions, calling her and going to her office.  Do you know what is a stalker is?  These are big NOs NOs.  It's scary and suffocating for her.<br><br>The next piece of advice is always strive to be a better man.  Be relaxed and also challenging to her.... That's all for now.</div>

Before you continue to swear and curse, I would like to share some GOOD NEWS with you....<br><br>BE GLAD, that this girl realise her 'mistake' and decided to put a stop to this thing before the situation gets even more complicated... No doubt you've chosen her and she might have proved to be the one who can change your stubborn heart, but she have also made her CHOICE clear.... You've chosen your path, she've chosen hers.... This is a relationship... And would take 2 hands to clap...<br><br>Maybe you feel that she should have given you that <span style="font-style: italic;">chance</span>...? Well... Chance... You've got to earn it... Not push it though...? If it's meant to be and she've really got the torch for you, your chance would be here again one day....?<br><br>And since you've realise that there is this girl who can makes you forget about your past relationship, you should also realised by now that it's highly possible that there're others out there who can do the same? May she be a 'better' person or 'worse', just remember she's gonna be <span style="font-style: italic;">the one you love....</span> And not the one you should use to compare with the others... Not even with this one....?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">My friend,</span> if you can decide to love then it would be.... Just a matter of time.... Like people say "there's always a forest out there..." If you really think that she's the one for you and you're willing to wait and devote for her without expecting any fruit in return and without affecting this love of yours <span style="font-style: italic;">go ahead,</span> this is call PERSISTENCE.... But if you turn overboard in your case and stand, eventually, you'll HIT RESISTANCE.....</div>

I got a feeling that I'm only someone to feel up a gap whenever she's bored or sad..other days she won't even think of me at all.... Arghhhh.....</div></blockquote>i think u are quite a fool to still go after her despite the way she treats u. Come on man! there are much more lovely ladies out there who would love to meet u.<br><br>On the contrary if u really love her, u should have a real good talk with her. Honest and straight from the heart and ask her what she sees u as. Potential mate, friends, or some guy to fill in the space? Be very clear on that and both of u should agree so that u 2 work on your relationship/friendship in that particular direction.<br><br>Read of the book 'Who moved my Cheese?' Recommend u to read it. can get it at Popular, Times.. MPH. It teaches u to let go of old things and seek new ones. Helped me abit. Try reading it and reflect on this relationship with this girl of yours. All the bes</div>
