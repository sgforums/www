            <div class='col-md body'>hm...  I think that ur family had heavy financial problems cause it is not easy to support a family. She maybe too stressful or tired to talk and something when u talk about $$$. It may trigger some thoughts in her mind and remember the problems she maybe facing now.<br><br>As a son, try talking nicely to ur parent.. Maybe ur can approach somebody who is close to your mother and ask her what she is facing. Try talking in a nicely way. Dun think that ur parents dun love u , maybe she does not know how to express or express in a wrong way. Try guide her.. Tell her how to change some of her ways of expression concern. Tell her what u like her to do...Maybe she had no idea... too busy with earning $$ to support the family<br><br>All these need time, take things slowly and have faith.</div>
