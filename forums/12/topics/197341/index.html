Thats what I wanna know too.<br><br>Anyway, if you are well off, maybe its just your mum who is brought up that way. To value things and money really carefully. She understood the need of money nowadays and need to safeguard it all cost. Regarding abt things broken,maybe she do not want to waste money to incur the cost of the damages.<br><br>The amount may be small, but maybe she feels its better to save, And if the breakage can be avoided, sure she will flare up at you and give you warning as she does not want to spend any money.<br><br>She is just prudent in her ways of handling money.

My mom insisted on educating me to whatever level I can go to. My mom would get upset when we spoil things in the house so we try to be careful and use as little electricity as possible. Everything cost money to replace, buy and etc. Actually eating home cooked food is cheaper than eating outside food. But all these are just choices.<br><br>See from her view and learn from her the value of a dollar and how to stretch that dollar.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Weijian,<br><br>Typical asian families are such that love is never really communicated through words. Not that they don't want to but they don't know what is appropriate, thus "tough love" is usually practised. How your mother reacts may not be the best response to the issue but you should also understand the stress she is in. She is sort of "responsible" for your education and livelihood, being the sole breadwinner she has to ensure every cent is spent prudently so that in times of need she can use it.<br><br>Do not take it to heart when she shouts at you when you talk about monetary issues or any issues because you must understand on her part that she may not want you to run away with the idea that she will be and has to finance all your needs. Perhaps what you can do is try to contribute to the household on a regular basis: be it by paying the utility bills or as a monthly contribution to your mother.<br><br>I am sure once she knows you are able to share her burden and understand her difficulties she will be willing to share with you her problems.<br><br>juz my 2 cents worth.<br><br>Good luck and work hard</div>

As for my mum, she is slightly stingy toward my elder sister and younger brother but not toward me, she tend to gave me money whenever she knew i need it and will prepared before hand and kept it in her pocket and pass it to me when i went out on the next day if i ask money from her. But if i kept asking from her, she scolded me too, so i have to know my limit. And i have am lucky to have a good sis too, whenever i am emergency in need of money, she will transfer some funds to my posb account, so overall, i can say i am lucky toward money matters.</div>

Anyway, try to be more understanding on your end. That money is really earned by her sweat and blood and of course if she thinks you are being wasteful, she will really feel the pinch.<br><br>Being in an Asian environment, I don't think most parents show their love and affection openly. I guess to her, she shows her love by making sacrifices to bring food on the table and bringing up you guys. Maybe you can start off by being more affectionate towards her.
