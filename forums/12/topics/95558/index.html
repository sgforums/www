Sounds like she's met someone else. Firstly, you MIGHT be leaving sg. If she was still attracted to you, she would be beggining you to stay and stuff. But it seems she's not, instead she's brushing you off and says ur waste of time.<br><br>She's met someone else and she wants you off her back. Only imagine a girl who is that frank here?

I can only say that your relationship together with her is very young. So the foundation of the relationship is still pretty fragile. She probably feels that it is easier and painless for her to let go of this relationship right now rather than later.<br><br>She was probably confused when you told her that you might be leaving Sg in a year's time. She probably feels that you are toying around with her feelings and wasn't really serious about being with her. Hmm...in fact, if you have told her in the first place before she became your gf...she wouldn't have accepted you as her bf in the first place.<br><br>Lastly, from the way you posted ''she knows I would still very much like for us to continue and gain whatever we can from each other for now'' doesn't really give anyone the impression that you are really serious about the girl.<br><br>I feel that it is unfair for her to continue being your gf and if you are not serious about her, then please let her go. Girls at times would rather prefers guys to be her good/close frd than being their bf. And some guys are great as a friend but sucks as a bf. Anyway, it depends on which category you falls into. Bottomline, whatever the outcome may be...choose the outcome where she will be the happiest...because if you don't, she will choose the happiest outcome for herself anyway. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Take care. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
