Seriously, when I was in nitec there was this 30 something year old lady studying in my course (though for a few days). It's not that bad. Now in my HNitec there is this 24 year old classmate, a lot of people starts studying after going NS/working etc. But hoenstly from what I read about your own post you don't seem to care about what your bf wants more like what you want...</p></div>

              <p>okay firstly if you feel that he isn't good enough for you or what he is doing isn't then maybe he really isn't and it's time to move on and not waste your time.</p>
              <p>secondly on his side, it is actually a really good thing that he is aware of what he have done and not done and trying to make amends for himself which is to go back to studying. of course your concerns are valid but put yourself in his shoes, i believe he wants to be better and he can do better. education isn't everything but w/o it, especially in sgp. where can he go? </p>
              <p>you got to think about it long term. </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Last I remembered age has nothing to do with learning, there was this one Chinese quote I remembered while studying for higher Chinese haha. I don't know shit about the different Singapore education institutions, but the least you could do as his gf is give him support. Clearly he regrets his past, and clearly he wants to do something positive about his life, if he's fine with the age dilemma, you should be encouraging him. And honestly, did you just call your bf pathetic?? From what you've wrote I can infer that you have extremely low confidence on your bf, that you're bang on clear he's not making it in life. That's a toxic relationship if u ask me... </p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What kind of gf are you? Instead of encouraging him, you're pouring cold water on him. It's not easy for a rebellious person to turn over and start a new life. Infact i'm happy that he changed his thinking and initiated to go study. Maybe you can try to convince him to get a part time job and study at the same time. But telling him it's too late? No. Why you telling him to quit his studies when this is the chance for him to upgrade himself? People have a life and have their freedom to choose what they want to do you know? Instead of finding faults with him, why don't you go find a job and support yourself? Then you won't have time to complain so much.</div>

I do feel he abit never think properly. if he want go canada study, and have enuf money, just go there study lah. or maybe he should study something that doesnt really need to 'study'.

              <p>I have a friend like that too. Although we're all still in secondary school and he is at the appropriate age, he has been scoring bady even though he has a clear idea of his aspirations and knows what he needs to do to achieve it.</p>
              <p>I think that you should, in fact, support your BF. He has decided to go back to school at his age after screwing himself over in the past and like you said, it speaks highly of his character. I myself feel that Singapore's stuent body cares too much for social norms such as age-appropriate studies. As I recall, there was an article in the Straits Times in the past couple of years about an elderly woman in the US who got a degree for herself at the age of 90+. So it's not impossible for your BF to ake something of himself at this age.</p>
              <p>Also, the SG system focuses more on hard work and memory than actual intelligence so if he really buckles down and gets to work, he'll be fine.</p>
