              I really don't get him. He is 24 years old now and he is studying now. not JC, not uni, not even poly... he is in ITE... NITEC somemore. I try consult him saying that it is too late for his age now so might as well just quit and get a full time job from here on out. But if i remember correctly, this is what he respond. 
              
              "I don't live a quite youthful life back in the days, many regrets and it is useless and more hurtful for me to just think about those past. Yes i admit, i'm really pathetic as i don't study hard and also because of 'friends' and interest. I know i am too late for everything now but i dont know.... i must try and study to see where it leads me. I finally have a dream of what i want to become and i will keep striving for it" Now is his second year in NITEC ITE and his first year wasn't that good in terms of gpa. 3.1 in 1st semester and 2.1 in 2nd semester... that is really pathetic of him. And he still thinks he can go far? In later years if he ever made it to poly, he will be in a class filled with students which will be 10 years younger than him.. isn't that weird? 
              
              He also told me he want to go overseas study in canada, US etc. Because of the dorm living with roommate kind of thing and they all have to same focus etc. What is wrong with him? how can i tell him to just fking give up as he is too old to study full time now??

              You should not judge him too fast. He admitted that he made a mistake when he was young. What he is doing now is to turn over a new leaf and carry on his education. It's never too late to study and learn.

              At least he is still willing to upgrade and serious about it. You should encourage him instead of being a wet blanket. I believe this is the period he needs encouragement the most to pull through this.
              
              It's not easy.. and never will be.. but as long as one is willing to persevere.. better days will be ahead.

              <p>ok i will just try to encourage him but he is feeling down lately due to his latest GPA. This is will be very tough for him and he is only in ITE. But i need to really emphasize on this, he is 24!! and he is stuck in ITE.... he is like the big brother in the classes to come</p>

              <p>Why don't girls in this country serve NS as well? This question is the best answer to the one of the reason why her BF is become too <em>old</em> to study. Isn't this the era of gender equality?</p>
              <p>Most important this country's problem is employers is focused too much on paper qualification, even sales jobs like financial adviser, you still need to take M5, M9 examination to apply for an licence to qualify for the job.At least an poly diploma just give you an 'discount' to skip certain module. Even the 'older' financial adviser is not spared and together with the 'younger' colleague they had to take examination together to renew their licence, otherwise they would be out of the job. You think being weird to study and taking lesson with their younger colleagues is their main concern?!! </p>
              <p>Finally the pathway to obtain an qualification is also long due to credibility issue. You tell your future boss you got shorter route to obtain an degree I doubted that would make your resume 'stand out' to other applicant who took long path to obtain an degree. You didn't mind the 'younger' candidate be your BF's manager and didn't feel <em>weird </em>about that by all mean convinced your BF to start working.</p>

              <p>Ah, you're more psychotic and ignorant than I initially thought.</p>
              <p>What do you think your boyfriend is doing in ITE ? Learn how to belly dance ?</p>
              <p>Your bf needs some kind of qualification/skill to compete in the job market. </p>
              <p>Let him finish his ITE education first. Whether he can get into Uni or not, it's up to the uni administrators to decide. </p>
              <p>If dreaming big is his motivation to get a qualification, so be it !</p>
              <p>When our company hire, we don't hire based on age. We have hundreds of applicants even for simple receptionist jobs. The ages are all over the place. </p>
              <p>We don't just pick out the younger applicants and throw out the older ones. </p>
              <p>In fact we don't like young people. Their immaturity is often a setback than an advantage. They are often flight risks and they don't assimilate well into our more experienced workforce. </p>
              <p>In order to make them productive, we have to train them and grow them, it's a resource drain. And there's no guarantee they won't jump ship over a $50 raise.</p>
              <p>You need to stop being so freaking obsessed with his age and let him finish his current ITE education !</p>
              <p>When he go into an interview and the hiring manager ask him, why he didn't continue his education after secondary school.. how will he look when he tells the manager because his gf force him to quit ITE ?</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> My assessment on you still stand. You're a dumb girlfriend. A very big and clumsy  tripping stone. he really needs to get rid of you for his own good.</span></p>

              <p>The Minister of Singapore say it's never too old to learn and educate yourself but of course if he is 24 in second year ITE it's not really too late for him if he sucessfully complete ITE with good gpa 3.2+ chances are you're able to enter poly and 24yr old + 3 year sucessfully graduate from poly with no repeats he should be 27 year old. He can take up some part-time job while studying</p>
              <p>but i see your point there just ite cert is really hard to get a job these day and i think even poly cert might also be the same case as ite cert in coming future since we already knew world-wide uni graduates can't even get jobs so they come to singapore aka foregins talent taking up everything so you really can't compete with them. So might as well quit studying and get working experience but again if he is going to canada or austrilia the life there sure is slower, and standards are lower compare to fast pace singapore life afterall they are caucasian people tend to take life at slower pace relaxing life and live happily and asians are the crazy competers 24/7 non-stop like robots....</p>
              <p>In my case i'm 2013 intake many of my friends from electronic course who got 3.2 - 3.5 gpa all are able to enter NYP it was pretty shocking i was gpa 3.7 + - 0.2 cca student council that 3.9gpa didn't got in Singapore poly but got into NYP and the first year i went in i'm already crying i miss the life of ITE teachers there teach till you really understand and slower pace oh and i'm Nitec electronic driectly jump to poly first year which was a really bad mistake coz you will struggle in maths and physics that the 2 module first year 100% all ite students will repeat unless ur the god like kind...so back to the NYP life it's hell really almost everything i currently learnt is like 50-50 understand or highest is 75% understand or totally blank...alot of projects time given is divde by 2 shorter compare to ite and you have alot of sht to complete. T<span style="line-height: 15.756799697876px;">here time i really felt quittig or felt like leaving this world aka killing myself </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">but i'm still surviving im in year 2 term 2 coming to the end so far my gpa was 1.2gpa really desperate to see this gpa from 3.9gpa to 1.2gpa now i just please god just lemme pass everything and sucessfully graduate from poly but even if i graduate i don't think i'll show my poly cert to my boss i rather show the ite one....life is tough</span></p>
              <p>So in the end he has to decide which road he wanna take weather is bad or good he has to deal it you can't change one decision rather you must support him and encourage him maybe that way he will achieve something at the end of the day life is short don't regret anything behind when you left this world...i know i sound like a old man but im 21 currently havent been in the army but i've seen alot of whats going on with this world...</p>

              <p>TS, not that I oppose freedom of ideas. I think if your BF is those kinds that are 3 minutes enthusiasm or he is the type that cannot ensure the stress of study, or later he choose to 'study' smartphone/video game or want to go pub to 'chong', then he better off go to work to SUFFER and grow up.</p>
              <p>Trust me, if your BF is still depend on his parent to spoon-feed him to study, I didn't think he will get the motivational for his education or even feel the 'pain' if he choose to give up again. The fact that some of the people I know choose to 'drop out' of poly in year one or two because they score badly (they studying in group by talking cork I presumed) just prove this point. That why I feel that working and study part-time is the only best way for your BF for learning and be independent.</p>

              <p>Yah right. He drop out of school go suffer already,  then what? Can he come back to ITE to finish his cert? </p>
              <p>He will have to pay private cost to continue his studies instead of government subsidised programs. </p>
              <p>He will be working full time and study part time, that means he will have no time for gf. </p>
              <p>He also will have chance to go meet those sexy working class ladies. Yummy.</p>
              <p>Assuming he dont continue study. Today he is 24 year old with secondary school qualification,  5 years later he will still be a secondary level holder. 10 years later same. </p>
              <p>He will never go up the corporate ladder. He will see young guys step over his head every promotion. </p>
              <p>If thats what you call not hurting him, well be my guest and tell him to just quit. </p>

              <p>Option 3 leave singapore and go to a easier country without much competer and get a oversea cert usually oversea is more easier to grad compare to any sg uni or poly.</p>
