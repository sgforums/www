              <p>ok look, i think im a little of fault here since all my talks to him kinda demotivate him. He now kinda scared and don't know what to do if he really didn't succeed at all throughout these ITE years. 
                  
                  Keep mentioning poly will take 3.5 gpa and above in Nitec no matter what.... so he will spend another 2 more years in higher nitec which he then will be 26 years old. WOW... and he really broke down now. Because even if he <a id="_GPLITA_5" style="border: none !important; display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: auto !important; margin: 0px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; text-transform: uppercase !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: baseline !important; width: auto !important; background: transparent !important;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by TheGoPhoto.its V10 1.1" href="#">manage<img style="border: none !important; display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: 10px !important; margin: 0px 0px 0px 3px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; text-transform: uppercase !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: super !important; width: 10px !important; background: transparent !important;" src="http://cdncache1-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png" alt=""></a> to get 3.0 and above on this current semester, he has a feeling his culmulative will be around 2.5? which is still low since his current gpa is 2.1. I never seen him this down before. I think i really failed him as his gf.</p>
              <p>Also, jojobeach and network.. you both made good points. I dont know which to really lean on.</p>
              <p>btw the code, i think my bf not those party type of person. He woken up already so he has this courage to study</p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">The number of flaming posts here is extremely disheartening. A person has come to the forums in search of an answer to a real problem, and instead of helping to address issues or clarify matters, she needs to first deal with people with people who insult, belittle and worse, wish that her relationship end.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Do you not realise that this sort of behavior leads to super serious issues like depression and suicide, due to the inability to get a support group? jeez.Â </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Anyway, let_me_zip_u, I hope you can just ignore the terrible comments. I just want to give my two cents on your issue.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">From what I have gathered, you first felt your bf is too old for nitec, and stress that he is 24. You were worried that he would be humiliated because he is way out of the average age group that normally attends nitec. You have been trying to talk him out of it, and have dampened his spirits. You think you might have failed him as a gf.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">If you are still trying to find a solution, maybe you can explore some of these questions?</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">1. Is your bf trying to work towards a higher goal other than just being competitive in the job market in the future? Is he trying to secure a future for the both of you?</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">2. Are either of you financially dependant on the other? Does your worry for him come from the fact he will not have enough money to sustain the education?</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">3. Why did you feel it was a waste of time before? You must have had a better plan for him, what was it?</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">From my life view, it is never too late to learn something new. The fact that he is willing to try for an education later in the game does speak a lot about his character, even if he does not do well. It isn't an embarrassment to be late to study, it's actually friggin courageous to step into a room full of younger people who are supposed to be your peers.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">I believe that in the working world, it should not be about who has the paper credentials, but about who can get the job done right, and fast. Of course this isn't an ideal that's shared with many employers, which is why the papers are so important as a fallback. I work as a programmer and the only thing I got asked about is my previous projects, they didn't even look at my grades.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Do not linger on the feeling that you have failed him as a gf. You are the best person to cheer him up and support him, and hopefully once you have more understanding of his motivations, you can work towards helping him any way you can. If you love him, you would want the best for him. Just gotta figure out how you can help him best.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Please correct me if I am wrong about anything, and I truly hope you and your bf will get through this tough time. Good luck!</span></p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">The number of flaming
                  posts here is extremely disheartening. A person has come to the
                  forums in search of an answer to a real problem, and instead of
                  helping to address issues or clarify matters, she needs to first
                  deal with people with people who insult, belittle and worse, wish
                  that her relationship end.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Do you not realise that
                  this sort of behavior leads to super serious issues like depression
                  and suicide, due to the inability to get a support group?
                  jeez.Â </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Anyway, let_me_zip_u, I
                  hope you can just ignore the terrible comments. I just want to give
                  my two cents on your issue.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">From what I have
                  gathered, you first felt your bf is too old for nitec, and stress
                  that he is 24. You were worried that he would be humiliated because
                  he is way out of the average age group that normally attends nitec.
                  You have been trying to talk him out of it, and have dampened his
                  spirits. You think you might have failed him as a gf.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">If you are still trying
                  to find a solution, maybe you can explore some of these
                  questions?</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">1. Is your bf trying to
                  work towards a higher goal other than just being competitive in the
                  job <a id="_GPLITA_11" style="border: none !important; display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: auto !important; margin: 0px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; text-transform: uppercase !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: baseline !important; width: auto !important; background: transparent !important;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by TheGoPhoto.its V10 1.1" href="#">market<img style="border: none !important; display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: 10px !important; margin: 0px 0px 0px 3px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; text-transform: uppercase !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: super !important; width: 10px !important; background: transparent !important;" src="http://cdncache1-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png" alt=""></a> in the future? Is he trying to secure a future for the
                  both of you?</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">2. Are either of you
                  <a id="_GPLITA_12" style="border: none !important; display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: auto !important; margin: 0px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; text-transform: uppercase !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: baseline !important; width: auto !important; background: transparent !important;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by TheGoPhoto.its V10 1.1" href="#">financially<img style="border: none !important; display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: 10px !important; margin: 0px 0px 0px 3px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; text-transform: uppercase !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: super !important; width: 10px !important; background: transparent !important;" src="http://cdncache1-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png" alt=""></a> dependant on the other? Does your worry for him come
                  from the fact he will not have enough money to sustain the
                  education?</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">3. Why did you feel it
                  was a waste of time before? You must have had a better plan for
                  him, what was it?</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">From my life view, it
                  is never too <a id="_GPLITA_13" style="border: none !important; display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: auto !important; margin: 0px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; text-transform: uppercase !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: baseline !important; width: auto !important; background: transparent !important;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by TheGoPhoto.its V10 1.1" href="#">late<img style="border: none !important; display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: 10px !important; margin: 0px 0px 0px 3px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; text-transform: uppercase !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: super !important; width: 10px !important; background: transparent !important;" src="http://cdncache1-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png" alt=""></a> to learn something new. The fact that he is
                  willing to try for an education later in the game does speak a lot
                  about his character, even if he does not do well. It isn't an
                  embarrassment to be late to study, it's actually friggin courageous
                  to step into a room full of younger people who are supposed to be
                  your peers.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">I believe that in the
                  working world, it should not be about who has the paper
                  credentials, but about who can get the job done right, and fast. Of
                  course this isn't an ideal that's shared with many <a id="_GPLITA_14" style="border: none !important; display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: auto !important; margin: 0px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; text-transform: uppercase !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: baseline !important; width: auto !important; background: transparent !important;" title="Click to Continue &gt; by TheGoPhoto.its V10 1.1" href="#">employers<img style="border: none !important; display: inline-block !important; text-indent: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-weight: bold !important; height: 10px !important; margin: 0px 0px 0px 3px !important; min-height: 0px !important; min-width: 0px !important; padding: 0px !important; text-transform: uppercase !important; text-decoration: underline !important; vertical-align: super !important; width: 10px !important; background: transparent !important;" src="http://cdncache1-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png" alt=""></a>, which
                  is why the papers are so important as a fallback. I work as a
                  programmer and the only thing I got asked about is my previous
                  projects, they didn't even look at my grades.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Do not linger on the
                  feeling that you have failed him as a gf. You are the best person
                  to cheer him up and support him, and hopefully once you have more
                  understanding of his motivations, you can work towards helping him
                  any way you can. If you love him, you would want the best for him.
                  Just gotta figure out how you can help him best.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;"><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Please correct me if I am wrong
                  about anything, and I truly hope you and your bf will get through
                  this tough time. Good luck!</span></p>

              <p>ohh u edit the post haha. Because last time i was here, that post was incomplete..</p>
              <p>not really too bothered by all that but thanks for your concern</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>anyway, i think we both have nothing to worry about finance. Just that he beginning to feel insecure lately with his age card. 24 in NITEC and he will be in poly when he reaches 27 then he will be surrounded by students who is 10 years younger than him. He is not proud of that at all.. it is an opposite. But he just have to go through with it, he said. But i feel it is because of that, he feels a distraction.Â </p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>I may qoute on what u said "<span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px; color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px;">Â it is never too lateÂ </span><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px; color: #333333; font-size: 13.6499996185303px;">to learn something new.

Just that he regret not studying well and now he want to feel the need of study again.Â </span></p>
              <p>Â and oh ya reason that i feel 24 is too old because he is in NITEC haha. I never seen anyone so far who is at his age studying in NITEC. The day if it comes that he goes to university, he will be like 30 years old? people already settling in by that age. i think the problems starts already by then</p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">well based on working experience, there are actually many people that take their diplomas or degrees part time, while working, way past 30. 30 year old in university is actually a lot more common than you think it is! M<span style="line-height: 1.231;">ost people do it because they want to upgrade themselves (apply for another job after getting their diploma/degree and get a pay raise in the process) and if they persevere it will pay off in the long run.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">I know some people who do it because they are genuinely interested in certain fields of study (a friend studies social work because she really wants t<span style="line-height: 1.231;">o be more involved in that)</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Well, I'm a hopeless romantic that believes that if you guys really love each other, and are mentally/financially sound, these are just waves in your journey that will not rock your boat. Being 30, working and part time schooling, doesn't mean cannot be settling down and planning for a future together at the same time. They are not mutually exclusive, just like how you can be exercising in the morning, working in the day, partying in the evening, chilling out in the night.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Since you guys are financially stable, maybe you can think about how you want your future with him to be. Where do you want your relationship to be at 30? He may be in university but still able to give you what you want. Good stuff to chat with your partner about if the mood is good.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">Let us know how it goes!</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">(i didn't edit my posts, I'm not sure what happened, my other posts in other threads also seemed to disappear, was quite sad coz i wrote quite a bit lol)</p>

Im sure he knows what he is doing. Regardless of his decision give him the support he needs so that he feels what he is current doing is right. That will motivate him too. Success is achieving what you want in life and definitely not just achieving a high salary. Dont let the word 'NITEC' affect your thinking. Sure he is abit old but so what? I see many Singaporeans taking private diploma at 25-30 too at SIM and also i have a friend taking his diploma at NYP at age 26.
