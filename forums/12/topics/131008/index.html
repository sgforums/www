I have this suituation where I want to be friends with the gal who reject me before. She is still friendly with me but the problem is when I saw her, I tend to like 'automatic' tried to avoid her. Will have this sad and sour feeling when looking at her, but yet sometime miss her and yearn to see her again. Is it because I am not mature enuff, that is why I will feel like that when looking at her??

But fortunately, i will not be meeting her as we will be working in different coy. Its very sad for me to turn up like this. Have to give up a friend becos I can't get over.

I think maybe I still need time and confident before I can treat her as normal friends. Sometimes I really hate my ego. I really concern about her, but in front of her, I just gave her this 'don't care' look. But I just afraid if I get close to her again, I migt fall for her and has false hope again....Haiz, I will let her go...for a while. Before I can let go of this weird feeling and treat her as a normal friend, I think its best not to contact her again. This will some how make me like a loser but I think it should be the best for me at the moment.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for your case is possible to be friends but first you must clear your mindset.<br>Your mind has not given up on her yet, that is why you got these problems.<br>First tell yourself is over she do not like you and she will never ever like you at all.<br>you will never have a chance and stop kidding yourself. so stop thinking that it is possible. If you can change this mindset of yours then is possible to be friends with her if not you will remain in the cycle of hoping and wishing she will be back to you.<br><br>I went through the whole thing a few times liao. so I know how it feels. Is hard to change the mindset but is possible and a strong will. When you wake up from your dream, then you will discover that the so call " LOve of your Life" has so many bad points that you even will ask why you even love her at all.</div>

But she is willing to share some of her family problem with me, so I think she is still quite comfortable with me. I understand ur friend's plight for distance u away, and he might be suffering the same problem with me...for moving on. But the difference between me and him is I won't give up this friend of mine and I wish her happiness.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Tuatau:</div><div class="quote_body">That's good to hear.

She told me she dun want to have relationship yet and say she might stay single forever. But I try not to think so much on wat she say now, if she has found a good companionship, I will be happy for her. To love someone is not to own, but to wish for happiness her.<br><br>Finally I thank u for all who gave me sincere advice. I already know what I want and will procced to do so.  Next time if i post in AA side, hopefully the tittle should be " Yay, I finally found a mei lar"  instead of those sad sad stories.
