            <div class='col-md body'>Dear people,<br><br>I badly need advice as this problem has been haunting me in my head ever since.<br><br>Ok, there was this guy a year ago, he had a crush on me and I too, began developing some feelings for him.<br><br>The feelings grew and eventually, we really like each other. I am always absenting classes/late for school, but he doesn't seem to mind, well, that's what I think. He should know that too.<br><br>So the trouble begins..<br><br>There's this girl (she's my enemy, she doesn't like me, I doesn't like her) , she purposely sat close to him in class and tried to get friendly with him (funny how she isn't THAT close to him last time) I was jealous indeed and wasted a whole year staring daggers behind their backs.<br><br>The guy, of course, didn't get fresh with her. During this time, I was really hoping he knew that that girl was just trying to 'snatch' my boy from me. Oh btw, we didn't talk to each other, we just communicate with our body languages. But we understood each other perfectly.<br><br>Our classmates didn't like me and him to be together. Also, that girl and her friends has always been picking on me since sec sch days. I am a loner and of course, I suffered silently and painfully.<br><br>And now, she wants to take away my only happiness. I was really dejected and neglected my studies at the end.<br><br>Anyway, the guy didn't end up me..but, they are close together the last I saw them.<br><br>It's been a year, but I still feel very angry, upset and mostly, betrayed at how and why the guy did this to me. He should know that the girl was just trying to ruin me..sobs.<br><br>Please don't give me words like 'learn to let go'. I can't, really. Like I've said, it's been a year :/. I'm not so sure but I feel really lost and confuse that such a relationship can be ruined so easily..can anyone intepret what's going wrong here?<br><br>Btw, I gave him a note to call me if he still have feelings for me and so on. But he didn't reply  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> Pls also note that his friends knows that he likes me but I don't understand why he can be so fickle to let go that easily. And why does he have to be so close to my enemy?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> I don't know whether he and my enemy are steads now. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> I can't believe God gave my happiness away to my enemy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hahaha from what u hae written, the 1st thing that struck me was... how old are you? i mean such things only happen in secondary schools so dont worry too much, once you get out of there, you'll realise that the world is so much bigger than what i think it is.<br><br>for now, concentrate on your studies. better all your so called enimies in terms of grades. this is the only thing that they cannot fight back. as for that guy... well, i guess u've made him wait too long and therefore i thought that u are not interested in him and therefore have given u up... it's not that he is fickle... it's just that it is hard and painful to maintain unrequited love... he had most probably burned out all the passion he had for you and thought that there is no future between you and him. hmm... and you mentioned it's a crush right? hahaha.. well... you know... crushes are infatuation.. haha they are meant to come and go if the opportunity passes.<br><br>for now, look forward, concentrate on your studies. being smart, good in studies and looking confident are some traits that will attract guys  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ... don't despair, there are plenty out there. be happy =)</div>

Does his actions "protect" you from hurt or harm? In a short span of time and under the lure of another grl, the guy switching just tells you he's not the steady type. As for yr competition, don't expect her to hang on to the guy for long once your interest in him dies and chances are he'll find another to switch to - maybe focus back to you which I suggest you should ignore.<br><br>If the thought of them and what they do brings the ugliness out in you, I'm sure when you look in the mirror, you're not going to see the goodness in you. Slowly, you'll see a jealous person.<br><br>Letting go is hard but clinging on to something that does not favor you just makes life a more intense struggle and pain. You don't have to go through life that way. Just have none of it and divert your mind, interest on other things that make you feel good and happy. There're so many things out there when we divert our minds and interests to can make us feel good and happy.<br><br>The more you feel good and happy everyday, the more you'll see that side of you in the mirror everyday and the more people around you will notice.<br><br>Just as the more you feel miserable and jealous everyday, the more you'll see that side of you everyday and the more people around you will notice.<br><br>Let no one change you (you'll just get transformed into a jealousy monster).
