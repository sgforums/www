            <div class='col-md body'>I believe love only comes from understanding the other party. You like him not just because of her outward appearance, but his inner character as well. You would enjoy his company, want to go out with him, appreciate his good points and willing to accept his bad points. Even deeping, its mutual understanding, consider his interests more than your interests, having mutual trust, able to forgive him whenever he has done wrong and willing to share your life with him to go through any obstacle in life.<br><br>Love takes time to cultivate, it does not come immediately, coz you need time to understand him as well.<br><br>Love can come from a crush as well, provided the other party is interested in you as well. A crush might not turn into love, coz you may like him initially, but after you discover his bad points, you find that you cannot accept him.<br><br>Regarding that long time buddy, if you find that you understand him enough, u enjoy his company and you allow yourself to discover him more, it can develop into love as well.<br><br>There are no definite answers to love. There are only guidelines to follow, the rest is up to u to discover.</div>
