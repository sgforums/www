My reason for suggesting the person to stay away if the problem is related to the forum is because I believe to nurse emotional wound is very much like nursing a physical wound.  For a physical wound, everyone would  at least try to cover the wound up with bandage to protect it from further injury and remove the bandage when the wound heals.  The same apply for emotional wound - the best thing for the person to "recuperate" is to stay away from the cause of the injury.
