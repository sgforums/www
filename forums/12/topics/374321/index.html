              <p>Some background information: We got to know each other through work(yes, we are colleagues sitting barely a few metres from each other) I guess all those late night and weekend OTs have ignited sparks between us. I have feelings for her, she says the same thing but she said she wants to know me more before committing. Ok,I have no problem with that.

              <p>We were lovely dovey till the Tues just past. On Monday,her best female colleague gf had her last day at work. On Monday evening,my potential gf took over her seat,now she is across the room,no more physical proximity. From Tues till today, she has been pretty cold towards me. During the day,she is quite nonchalant towards me. But on Wed and Thurs mornings at 3- 4am,she sent me some lovey dovey msgs, but when day comes,she is back to her strange cold ways.</p>
              <p>I am absolutely baffled.</p>
              <p>By the way,she is a super emo gal with unbelievable mood swinging tendencies.</p>

              <p>Fear-based love (assuming its love lar) inexorably derails as the ego-rebounds to claim itself back.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">U say - 'lovey dovey'</span> - well, there were two human beings without any past/future encroaching in an existential herenow flow of love.</p>
              <p> Real love is a here-now experience - sadly, many misintrepret the heart's hankering for eternity/infinity as a sign that one ought to quickly make it permanent.</p>
              <p>Hence the  fear of being possessed, fear of losing, fear of  ....</p>
              <p>As to what she is - it's for her to be, what matters - is what are u being? Being now or when u relate to her?</p>
              <p>One cannot possess love, it is always bigger than one. One can at most, share, partake of it. Of course, it is possible to possess a person in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">guise of love</span>; what good is a dead, plastic flower?</p>

              <p>Simply put, if u love her, just love her lar, why wonder what is going to happen tomorrow. Of course, it is assuming u have it, one can only give or share what one has. By that I mean, what u have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">INSIDE</span> of u.</p>
              <p>Are u loving? are u kind? Are u grateful?  Being kind, being loving, being grateful - u have nothing to lose. Cos it is your state of mind and being - u never will lose it. It was created from within u.</p>
              <p>Cos u are so <span style="text-decoration: underline;">self-fullfilled</span> in you (eg. love,acceptance,responsibility ...., that u no longer need to beg that someone love u , appreciate u.</p>

              <p>There is no 'better' place now, no 'better' world, no 'better' perons lar, It is only a question of one's stance. ie.what one is being now, always! One is either loving/kind or hostile/belligerent. Wherever one is or whoever one relates to, one <strong>carries it within</strong>. The loving lives ... loving world, the hostile lives ... hostile world. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Same world</span>. <span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"></span></p>

              <p>think is probably she is sitting too far away from you... she needs you... cannot concentrate on her work...</p>
              <p>why not you just show her more concern and ask her what is happening... then it might just end up with you and her being rightfully together instead of this "underground" relationship...</p>
              <p>Dont scare la... she is still interested in you because she sent you mushy messages at night..</p>
              <p>Maybe over at her new place, she isnt adapted to the new environment? Or some other colleagues over at the new end are pesty or what??</p>
              <p>Go ask her straight...</p>

              <p>I am a man of reason and logic, and find it undescribably hard to deal with women who goes on wild mood swings. One moment they could be the most reasonable person on Earth and the next the most frightening shrew one can ever get to know.</p>
              <p>One part of me just wanna leave, but the other part of me tells to stay, because very often, mood swings are not faults of her own. It is a biological fact base on a female's hormones, which causes such swings.</p>
              <p>Some experience it mildly, some just a simple passing occurence, some frighteningly prolong for days and even weeks. They would weep at the slightest things, or find fault at the smallest mistakes, or just plainly flare at anything and anyone, varying from female to female.</p>
              <p>And when such hormonal changes stabalises, they revert back to normality. It is part and parcel of being female, our precious specimens, for in them will our next generation be formed. Hormonal changes are what makes them women with the capability to give birth, which we males will never be able to.</p>
              <p>But we men, whom are spared of such frightening changes, on our part must not think less of them, or avoid them, but to make allowances for such behaviour and understand it, and help them deal with it by being patient, regardless if they are our gf or wives.They are simply being themselves - women, with varying degrees of hormonal changes.</p>
              <p>As for TS, if you truly love her, then you must understand her changes, make allowances for it and help her deal with it. There are medicines avaliable for her to help her deal with it. It is not a pyschological disorder, never is, but alienation or without help, it will or may eventually lead to it.</p>
              <p>I am no doctor, only sharing experiences of women aquintances whom had exhibited such conditions and learnt how to handle it. I hope you too may be able to deal with it, by understanding such conditions more from more professional sources.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
