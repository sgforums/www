Make her see that your parents do love her but dun let her noe your parents guilt or she may just play on it and become an even bigger problem.<br><br>And also try to ask your parents to be more patient with your sis.<br><br>I guess it's the least that you can do as her brother.<br><br>It's not going to be easy but if you don't do it, nobody else can.<br><br>Jia you... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Then for so many years, only because ur brother/sister is going somewhere else liao, then ask u come back to stay.<br><br>My guess would be that she felt that ur parents do not really care about her in the first place, and that they were biased against her, and making her stay with someone else rather than with u people. As u people grow together as a family, it seems like she is now an outsider. Of course she will feel that ur parents do not love her. Plus, her being forced to break up with her bf only makes matters worst.<br><br>Try talking to her, and tell her that even though she never stays with u people, all of u love her. That's what she needs, not scolding or a slap.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I actually pity her a little. She was really the chosen one of live with your grandmother. Why not try to treat her like a good friend, know her better, bring her to outings etc. Let her feel that she still has a family that loved her (Despite choosing to let her, and not u stay with GM).</div>
