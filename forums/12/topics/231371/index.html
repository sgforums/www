Love from you and your parents.  In many ways I don't blame her for behaving like that.  Sadly, to her your family is like a stranger since she grows up at your grandparents' place.  What makes you think that you can tell her what to do (to break up with her bf even though it's with good intention) etc when all these years none of you show any interest in her.<br><br>While I understand that your parents' predicament to have her stay with your grandparents, however for someone who is still young like your sister, all she feels is rejection from your parents.  Also, she has probably been wondering why your parents chose to "abandon" her instead of you and hence her comments about your parents being bias.<br><br>I think you and your parents need to be patient and try to spend more time with her to allow all of you to "get to know" each other as family.  Perhaps, your parents should try to explain to her about the situation and why they made her stay with the grandparents.  Also, she might need to have some counselling, just to help her to deal with her hurts, resentments etc.<br><br>Love her, be supportive to her is all you can do now.  Hopefully as time passes, she will warm up towards your family and will come to know how much your family loves her.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
