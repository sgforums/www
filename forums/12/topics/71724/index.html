With family members... Relatives... Friends.... Even for a stranger though it's generally rare for the majority....<br><br>The separation of 'love' in a BGR and other forms of relationships can sometimes be more complicated, especially when it involves a 1-1 relationship in particularly of the opposite gender....<br><br>For some who ain't really certain, they can often be confused by it.... But of course the theories can be rather lengthy, so I'm not going into the depths here...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Love?<br>Hmm...<br>1) You feel jealous when he talks to another gal<br>2) You wanted his attention so much<br>3) You feel upset when he never gives you anything for your birthday<br>4) You feel like hurting him in any possible way you can but can't bring yourself to do it when you felt hurt<br>5) You do all those small little things for him coz you care for him, even if he never shows any appreciation but you still do them willingly<br><br>pt 1:i dont really agree that love means u will be jealous when ur lover talks to another gal....thats more of being possessive. it has got some love but it is more of a human instinct that u want to keep your lover.<br><br>pt2: need attention is more of reciprocation of your love. it falls under "expectation". you must understand the need for personal privacy / breathing space. dont keep bugging.<br><br>pt3: when he/she fails ur expectation of esp he/she forgets ur bdae...it doesnt mean he/she dont love u anymore. sometimes it could be due to hectic life schedule etc. anyway this is more like 'love expectation' again. not love alone.<br><br>as for pt 4...prob it is a personal reaction that differs fr everyone.<br><br>pt 5 is correct for me.<br><br>i think there's a need to understand more abt the real love concept.<br><br>i noticed a pattern: usually when people naturally understand the meaning of true love; or broke up with someone they really loved. they will take a very long time to find their next lover. true love take some time to heal...esp it is something so precious and u are not fated to have it forever. they either have a true lover or else none of it. i have some friends who have empty love lives coz they want to reserve it for the ultimate special one.<br><br>as for those who experienced not true love or surface love...they get into another r/ship faster.<br><br>becoz love is something not just surface...like having some funny expectations etc. it integrates into their lives and affects their thinking and consideration for the lover seamlessly. it like something like pt 5 which u do sth but dont expect anything in return. basically there is no hard and fast rule to detect if u are in real love... but when naturally u know u are doing for that special one...thats it...very simple.<br><br>i shld say true love also means sacrifice. an example will be avoiding being the 3rd party but still love the attached person very much...and biting the bullet to see that person getting married. coz u know it will benefit that person...it takes an enormous energy to do this.<br><br>hope these help. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
