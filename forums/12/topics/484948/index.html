              We are both in the 30s. We went out occasionally and msg each other at times during the first 4 mths and 1 fine day, he asked if we can go into a relationship.  As I'm not those who will easily go into a relationship with someone, I took some time to consider before accepting his request. Of cos I did recap on the things
              he did, he is filial and other factors which I thought we can try out and understand each other more.
              
              I really feel happy when we went official and he is sweet to sms me to wake up daily, update me some of his daily activities, asked if i have taken my meals, etc. Basically, he shared with me things which I consider silly but I don't mind. My mind is thinking of him though I'm at work and I feel blessed. Sometimes I will buy his favourite snacks for him and cheer him up whenever he faces challenges at work. During his update of his daily activities, I know that he likes to run as an exercise to keep fit. He runs before going to work and run after work. Wkends will also go running in the morning and evening. We went out a few times after being official during wkend afternoon time frame and we also sms each other at night after he finished his run and before he goes to sleep. He slept very early..can be 9pm-10pm.
              
              
              One fine day, he went into silent. I'm not sure what has happened to him and I'm worried. I tried to sms him few times and call him but he didn't pick up. He just replied with sms that he is fine and will be ok after few days. On and off, I still sms him and ask if anything happen to him or his family and need any help. He will just reply dun worry. Silent after 4-5 days, he finally sms that he is sorry for keeping silent. I was trying to ask what exactly happen but he just say "move on" and dun be a spoilt radio so I keep mum.
              I do not know what can cause a man to go into silent for so long. From his sms to me after moving on, it seems that his mum is having a persistent cough for few wks and not getting better after visiting the doctor twice. Hence, I shared with him some remedies to cure the cough and eventually it should help because he never mentioned about his mum's cough anymore though I asked how's his mum now and he never reply. From this incident, I understand that he belongs to those who will not say anything if he doesn't want to but I somehow feel that he doesn't share with me his probs though I'm his gf.
              
              I started to find out that he is a hard core runner as time passed. He will run in the morning before going to work, run during lunch time NOW and run after work.
              
              He started to sms me lesser during wkdays. He will tell me that he is tired after the running and go to sleep and we never have chance to interact much after work on wkdays. Most of the couples went out during weekends and I know that he is a poor planner as he commented that things may change even though well planned. I accepted the fact that he is an ad hoc person and I would suggest the place to go to on a particular wkend 1-2 days before. However, he can comment that he is very tired after the running on that actual day and need to cancel the outing. I commented that he really runs too much and whether he has enough energy to handle other things and his reply was that's why he needs ample rest after running (indirectly telling me no time for me...?).  On another occasion which I did not mention anywhere to go, he will tell me his eye is swollen due to flies getting into his eye while he is running the night before. I was thinking there goes my outing with him again. Somehow, I feel that out wkends outings are due to running and other excuses. He will still goes running with his swollen eyes!
              
              He went into silent on a 2nd occasion which I don't know why it happens again. I asked him but as usual, he ignore again. I started to think our relationship why it turns out in this manner. Is there anything I have done wrong which causes this withdrawal symptoms from him? I apologize to him if I say or done anything wrong and ask him to move on. He replied me the next day with a smiley face. However, frankly speaking, I still do not know what I have done wrong. I saw a poster which states "Apologizing to the person doesn't mean you are wrong and the person is right, it shows that you value the relationship more than the person". I think this statement is quite useful and I believe nobody is perfect and we both have different backgrounds. Each relationship needs both parties to compromise each other and understand each other. If I can just give in and he is happy, I don't mind to say sorry. We went back to normal days with the limited sms daily and no outings on wkends. Either raining, running too tired or I went overseas for holidays. 
              
              The official lasted for 3 months and he is very well planned for his running activities but never plan for our activities. I tried to ask him out for a meal so that we can talk to each other face to face but he never reply. I'm at the cross road, should I continue such an unhealthy relationship or I should persevere? I learn that he has a very bad temper and a MCP. His relationship with his family is also not good and he seldom trust pple. After much consideration, I have decided to break up with him. I wanted to face to face to tell him how I have been feeling the past 1 month but he never want to meet me. He will just sms me. Therefore, in the end, I just sms him that we shall end this relationship. He just replied with a sad smiley face. Frankly speaking, I'm not sure if he is sad or happy.
              
              I'm now at the healing stage. I admit I do miss him else I won't have posted this. He has other good points but the problem is he doesn't give me a chance to interact with him properly. He doesn't trust pple easily and he trust his running world more than his family. A relationship without proper communication is a failure. I rather he "bark" at me when he is unhappy at least I know what he is thinking.....

              <p>Hi Owl,</p>
              <p>Your partner has a most peculiar personality.</p>
              <p>I suppose it is possible that a person prefers to be alone and the part of his life that he wishes to share with you is actually very little.</p>
              <p>To be honest, in my opinion "One fine day, he went into silent" was when he decided to call the relationship quits. Sometimes people do not wish to man up and face the issue and prefers that the other party calls it quits ....sorta like pushing the blame. He might think that it is kindness but I have my own view and I think otherwise.</p>
              <p>My advice to you is that in future, besides thinking about whether the person has traits you admire, perhaps try looking at his lifestyle....spend more time as friends and try and work out if he actually is a good fit for yourself.</p>
              <p>I suggest you concentrate on the healing process and if possible avoid all contact with him. Helps heal faster.</p>
              <p>All this is just an opinion....good luck.</p>

              Think the biggest mistake I made is to agree to b his gf too early. I thought I hv affinity with him because I keep bumping into him and we can click as we hv some similarities in our way of doing things. I was wrong. Getting to know a person takes many yrs....
              
              but if we can understand each other better thru more interaction, shouldn't it be able to improve the situation? I think he didn't even bother to continue understanding me as he is living in his running world. Wondering how hard core runners handle their relationships...those who really runs 1-2 time daily and each route is at least 10km -20km+....

              <p>Hi Owl,</p>
              <p>Whilst it is true that you can understand each other thru more interaction it will not work without him being willing.</p>
              <p>Sorry if i come across as too harsh....you need to burn away the hope in your heart. It will be painful but its for your own good.</p>

              running the night before. I was thinking there goes my outing with
              him again. Somehow, I feel that out wkends outings are due to
              running and other excuses. He will still goes running with his
              swollen eyes!</p>
              <p>He went into silent on a 2nd occasion which I don’t know why it
              happens again. I asked him but as usual, he ignore again. I started
              to think our relationship why it turns out in this manner. Is there
              anything I have done wrong which causes this withdrawal symptoms
              from him? I apologize to him if I say or done anything wrong and
              ask him to move on. He replied me the next day with a smiley face.
              However, frankly speaking, I still do not know what I have done
              wrong. I saw a poster which states “Apologizing to the person
              doesn’t mean you are wrong and the person is right, it shows that
              you value the relationship more than the person”. I think this
              statement is quite useful and I believe nobody is perfect and we
              both have different backgrounds. Each relationship needs both
              parties to compromise each other and understand each other. If I
              can just give in and he is happy, I don’t mind to say sorry. We
              went back to normal days with the limited sms daily and no outings
              on wkends. Either raining, running too tired or I went overseas for
              holidays.</p>
              <p>The official lasted for 3 months and he is very well planned for
              his running activities but never plan for our activities. I tried
              to ask him out for a meal so that we can talk to each other face to
              face but he never reply. I’m at the cross road, should I continue
              such an unhealthy relationship or I should persevere? I learn that
              he has a very bad temper and a <span>MCP</span>. His
              relationship with his family is also not good and he seldom trust
              pple. After much consideration, I have decided to break up with
              him. I wanted to face to face to tell him how I have been feeling
              the past 1 month but he never want to meet me. He will just sms me.
              Therefore, in the end, I just sms him that we shall end this
              relationship. He just replied with a sad smiley face. Frankly
              speaking, I’m not sure if he is sad or happy.</p>
              <p>I’m now at the healing stage. I admit I do miss him else I won’t
              have posted this. He has other good points but the problem is he
              doesn’t give me a chance to interact with him properly. He doesn’t
              trust pple easily and he trust his running world more than his
              family. A relationship without proper communication is a failure. I
              rather he “bark” at me when he is unhappy at least I know what he
              is thinking…..</p>

              <p>I think you are confusing adult conditional love with unconditional love for children and nature.</p>
              <p>Adult love is always conditional, hence the monogamy requirement. As there are many partners to choose from a sea of people. Why do you love one and not the rest of them? </p>
              <p>Unconditional love from a child or parent is possible because you don't get to choose. There's no other to replace them. </p>
              <p>Love is often transient in conditional cases. Only a naive will think otherwise.</p>

              <div>This guy clearly <strong>needs space</strong>, too much of texting can "suffocate" a man. There is a ton of time required to train for a marathon. If he is obssessed about running, maybe he feels a sense of accomplishment and pride whenever he competes in a race. I'll say support your man. You mentioned that his ex dumped him because of his passion for running, perhaps he feels that history might repeat itself that's why he is backing off and not opening up to you. If you feel that you are forcing yourself to accomodate him and its eating in your insides, than move on. Anyhow i wish you good luck babe! </div>

              <p>We are both in the 30s. We went out occasionally and msg each
              other at times during the first 4 mths and 1 fine day, he asked if
              we can go into a relationship. As I’m not those who will easily go
              into a relationship with someone, I took some time to consider
              before accepting his request. Of cos I did recap on the
              things<br> he did, he is filial and other factors which I thought we can try
              out and understand each other more.</p>
              <p>I really feel happy when we went official and he is sweet to sms
              me to wake up daily, update me some of his daily activities, asked
              if i have taken my meals, etc. Basically, he shared with me things
              which I consider silly but I don’t mind. My mind is thinking of him
              though I’m at work and I feel blessed. Sometimes I will buy his
              favourite snacks for him and cheer him up whenever he faces
              challenges at work. During his update of his daily activities, I
              know that he likes to run as an exercise to keep fit. He runs
              before going to work and run after work. Wkends will also go
              running in the morning and evening. We went out a few times after
              being official during wkend afternoon time frame and we also sms
              each other at night after he finished his run and before he goes to
              sleep. He slept very early..can be 9pm-10pm.</p>
              <p>One fine day, he went into silent. I’m not sure what has
              happened to him and I’m worried. I tried to sms him few times and
              call him but he didn’t pick up. He just replied with sms that he is
              fine and will be ok after few days. On and off, I still sms him and
              ask if anything happen to him or his family and need any help. He
              will just reply dun worry. Silent after 4-5 days, he finally sms
              that he is sorry for keeping silent. I was trying to ask what
              exactly happen but he just say “move on” and dun be a spoilt radio
              so I keep mum.<br> I do not know what can cause a man to go into silent for so long.
              From his sms to me after moving on, it seems that his mum is having
              a persistent cough for few wks and not getting better after
              visiting the doctor twice. Hence, I shared with him some remedies
              to cure the cough and eventually it should help because he never
              mentioned about his mum’s cough anymore though I asked how’s his
              mum now and he never reply. From this incident, I understand that
              he belongs to those who will not say anything if he doesn’t want to
              but I somehow feel that he doesn’t share with me his probs though
              I’m his gf.</p>
              <p>I started to find out that he is a hard core runner as time
              passed. He will run in the morning before going to work, run during
              lunch time <span>NOW</span> and run after work.</p>
              <p>He started to sms me lesser during wkdays. He will tell me that
              he is tired after the running and go to sleep and we never have
              chance to interact much after work on wkdays. Most of the couples
              went out during weekends and I know that he is a poor planner as he
              commented that things may change even though well planned. I
              accepted the fact that he is an ad hoc person and I would suggest
              the place to go to on a particular wkend 1-2 days before. However,
              he can comment that he is very tired after the running on that
              actual day and need to cancel the outing. I commented that he
              really runs too much and whether he has enough energy to handle
              other things and his reply was that’s why he needs ample rest after
              running (indirectly telling me no time for me…?). On another
              occasion which I did not mention anywhere to go, he will tell me
              his eye is swollen due to flies getting into his eye while he is
              running the night before. I was thinking there goes my outing with
              him again. Somehow, I feel that out wkends outings are due to
              running and other excuses. He will still goes running with his
              swollen eyes!</p>
              <p>He went into silent on a 2nd occasion which I don’t know why it
              happens again. I asked him but as usual, he ignore again. I started
              to think our relationship why it turns out in this manner. Is there
              anything I have done wrong which causes this withdrawal symptoms
              from him? I apologize to him if I say or done anything wrong and
              ask him to move on. He replied me the next day with a smiley face.
              However, frankly speaking, I still do not know what I have done
              wrong. I saw a poster which states “Apologizing to the person
              doesn’t mean you are wrong and the person is right, it shows that
              you value the relationship more than the person”. I think this
              statement is quite useful and I believe nobody is perfect and we
              both have different backgrounds. Each relationship needs both
              parties to compromise each other and understand each other. If I
              can just give in and he is happy, I don’t mind to say sorry. We
              went back to normal days with the limited sms daily and no outings
              on wkends. Either raining, running too tired or I went overseas for
              holidays.</p>
              <p>The official lasted for 3 months and he is very well planned for
              his running activities but never plan for our activities. I tried
              to ask him out for a meal so that we can talk to each other face to
              face but he never reply. I’m at the cross road, should I continue
              such an unhealthy relationship or I should persevere? I learn that
              he has a very bad temper and a <span>MCP</span>. His
              relationship with his family is also not good and he seldom trust
              pple. After much consideration, I have decided to break up with
              him. I wanted to face to face to tell him how I have been feeling
              the past 1 month but he never want to meet me. He will just sms me.
              Therefore, in the end, I just sms him that we shall end this
              relationship. He just replied with a sad smiley face. Frankly
              speaking, I’m not sure if he is sad or happy.</p>
              <p>I’m now at the healing stage. I admit I do miss him else I won’t
              have posted this. He has other good points but the problem is he
              doesn’t give me a chance to interact with him properly. He doesn’t
              trust pple easily and he trust his running world more than his
              family. A relationship without proper communication is a failure. I
              rather he “bark” at me when he is unhappy at least I know what he
              is thinking…..</p>
