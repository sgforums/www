            <div class='col-md body'>Hello ZiZi again!<br><br>Dun be despair abt life yet lar (I believe u r still very young), or at least younder than Atti, haha.......... Life do turn bored at times, and it isn't a bad thing to keep it simple!!! Believe me, haha......<br><br>Allow me to go into myself a bit...... errmmmm i am like u, feeling very down and exhausted with many things in life at the moment, but believe me, yr life now cannot be as bad as mine! Those who konw me ard in here will know what i am talking abt and going through. The only difference between yr life now and mine is that you complaint that yr life is too simple, but mine is too dramatic!!! Really 'chi bu siao', haha.......<br><br>Errrmmm, care to share abt the family problem? Maybe i can help, or at least lend a pair of listening ears  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> . Errmmmm i am going through some family problem not long ago too, so i understand how it felt to have 1, esp when a family/home is a place where we wanna come home, or looked forward to come back after a hard day work. However, with all the troubles, sometimes, we really dreaded to stay at home........ agrees?<br><br>Okie as for yr relationship with yr bf, hope u dun mind i say what i feel........ hmmmmm..... think its a bit diff lor, for you cos yr case really very extreme leh...... now in 21st century liao leh, still got such guy who dun allow gf to go out one meh? I find it rather amazing also for a ger like u to accept this (maybe u r force to lar) but, under normal circumstances, a ger will be together with a guy who loves her more than she loves him, ermmm get what i mean? If given a choice, between 2 guys, a ger will NORMALLY choose to accept the guy who loves her more than a guy who she loves but he dun love her that much. I dunnoe, but maybe like u have mentioned, u r deeply in love with him, and this, can easily blinded you.<br><br>I really dunnoe how long can u take this but i hope u will be more sensible too, as in think for yrself.....  of cos i am not encouraging u to do something dramatic, but do you think u can accept a guy who take you for granted, and u r not the 1 he loves most for a lifetime? I, personally feels that short term, maybe can lor, but on the long run........ not very 'le guang'.<br><br>okie b4 i end, allow me to share a little something wif u...... my ex-gf told me this, and i still remembered this........ " A gerfriend is like a bird, you dun have to put her in a cage. Instead, you have to let her fly in the sky. All you have to do is to tie a very long thin string on her leg, so that when she flies, at least you know where she is and wun lost track of her. The best thing is she still have her freedom flying freely in the sky. Eventually when shes tired of flying or have enuff freedom, she will fly back to the point where the string start, the place where she belong, the place where she knows where she really wanna be, and its you, the bf. "<br><br>Okie i know i did not describe it very well cos i translate from chinese myself one lar, heh...... ermmm but hope u get the picture   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> This make me realise that the ger might even love u more deeply, if you show her respect, one way is by giving her enuff freedom.<br><br>Sad to say, i believe its something u r lacking now. Errrrmmm, whats the point of he wants u to stay at home when hes out with his friends? See, u already start to complain. Maybe, u would want to have a heart to heart talk with him. U think that u love him deeply now, but u didn't realise there's much much more depht left in the love than u have expected.<br><br>Talk to him, really....... and all the best!<br><br>Regards<br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Atti, long time no post... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>For ZiZi,<br><br>In a r/s, there's one powerful word that can lifen up a r/s. ...Trust... Both parties must convince each other that whenever which activity they do must be able to believe that nothing will happen.<br><br>What Atti has described, like example going out and got drunk brings about trouble and problems, and that leads another party to get very worried and tends to be more protective over the other in the near future. *Like putting the bird in the cage may prevent other hungry and cunning cats from attacking....try to see more warner bro cartoons and you will know what I mean*<br><br>Guys knows tat this outside world is not prefect and you should try to understand how he feels whenever you are out in the open. Maybe you have done something in the past that make him so protective. That's where the word trust comes in. Convince him that you will not mixed with bad company, pick up bad influences and ur love will never die down no matter what happen. On the other hand, you must remember that he will be there for you.<br><br>------------------<br>"A relationship is like a rose,<br>How long it lasts, no one knows;<br>Love can erase an awful past,<br>Love can be yours, you'll see at last;<br>To feel that love, it makes you sigh,<br>To have it leave, you'd rather die;<br>You hope you've found that special rose,<br>'Cause you love and care for the one you chose."<br><br>[This message has been edited by *Sad_Soul* (edited 02 April 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ZiZi:<br><br>I can always say the same thing to a girl all the time, but does his actions prove otherwise?? Only u can tell.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I get the feeling he is a MCP: women stay at home while men are outside. A very unhealthy mentality. Maybe he should learn to trust u with your friends, instead of restraining u at home. We are all humans. He should also have more faith in the relationship. To me, he feels insecure. That could be the reason why he is restraining u from mixing around.<br><br>I myself have a gf. I have platonic friendships too and I had even went on single dates with them, but I had never gone astray with my platonic friends as they are my true good friends. My gf even went for SDU activities, and we often joked about the whole thing. The point I am trying to drive here is <strong>MUTUAL TRUST</strong>. If a relationship doesn't have this fundamental, then u might wanna reconsider it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i am v sad to read abt ur whole story.. i have encountered a similar case before but the thing is that my ex did not restrict me but instead we gave each other too much freedom..n i gave him too much trust that he is not worthy of it. i loved him alot, just too much to describe as he is my first love! i was v sticky to him in the first place but he wanted his own space so i am afraid that if i do not gif him wat he wants, he might leave me..i gave n gave.. i rarely see him n tok to him as he is forever with his frens..it's bad for me to say that his peers are not decent but they are indeed of bad influence..most of them had criminal records n few were once in jail..so when they go out they go n get to noe gers.. n he still haf the cheecks to tell me..i just tolerated everything..till in the end he broke up wif me for a stupid reason..he say that he still love his ex gf whom doesnt even likes him anymore as she refuses n rejected his request for patchup many times.. well, after the breakup i was v brave to ask him to be frens..we were frens till abt almost 4months after we broke up, his buddy told me that the reason that we broke up was not due to his ex onli, but also that he two-time..or rather u can say 3time me! there was another 2 gers that he was courting at the same time when he was wif me..i ws so hurt n cried like mad although we broke up so long ago cos i realli still love him.. he denied abt the whole matter but i chose not to believe him n now..i chose not to be frens n forget him entirely..he is just not worth it.. so zizi, maybe u should learn something from my case.. my ex used to promise me that he will nv do anything wrong to me.. but he actually 3 time at one goal! isnt that amazing? think abt it..if he is worth it.. kip ur love before he shatters everything n at that time.. it's just too difficult to pick urself up from the fall!!! take care n be smart!</div>

If u really felt insecure about this realtionship, mayb what u can do is to give him some surprises during special occasions and let him realise that u really love him so deep that u can't lose him.  Tell u something, don't keep asking a guy whether he loves u or not, this may hav negative results, although he loves u, but when u keep popping the same question, he will find that u r very "irritating", ok?<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>
