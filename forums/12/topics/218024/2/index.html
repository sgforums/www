The KEY is to LISTEN to your class and UNDERSTAND no matter how much you hate the teacher... Tell yourself you don't hate that subject and has to be responsible to yourself... The more you FEAR and AVOID it, the WORSE the situation would get....<br><br>For Maths, don't JUST DO IT.... UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE DOING... It's always GOOD to have someone who KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON to GUIDE YOU by your side...</div>
