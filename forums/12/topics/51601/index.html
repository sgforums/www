            <div class='col-md body'>you are not ready for marriage and you are not thinking straight. being with some one for life is not a test where you have to get as many correct answer as possible. if you are serious with your girlfriend you truely love her it will be an easy decision. becos you are now in such a fix you have proven to yourself that you are not ready and perhaps its time for you to evaluate your relationship with her whether you decide to go wif the stewardess or not thats beside the point. temptation will always be there forever. its you yourself and the feelings and respect and responsibilities you have towards your partner that will keep you on track. its time to be honest, at least to yourself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is a very personal problem because whatever decision u make, it'll affect both u and either women's life.<br><br>your current gf will definitely feel very dejected and sad if u drop her, because she had been with u for quite some time and been understanding because of your working hours. if she is not, she'll probably ask for a break. the spark between u and your gf is gone because the 2 of u r not simply spending time together. that's y probably u r having such chemistry with the stewardess. at this point of time, any man will think of the stewardess more as memories are more short-term and u r having a busy schedule so cannot think of the past. do take note that u have only known the stewardess for a month. do not dive in too soon and get caught in no man's land.<br><br>did u set a target date for yourself to ROM? if yes, how many years u have left? is still got at least a couple of years, i dun see y u cannot choose the stewardess just because of your age. at this point of time, i'll make a decision after getting to know the stewardess interest in proceeding further with u and if there is any more years left to actually getting ROM.</div>

Short-term relationships or a long term one? You're now in an unstable trianglar relationship and you sense that you'll have to do something about it soon...<br><br>This 'interesting' part-time stewardess gf of yours... I don't know her much... But from the sound of it, she's quite 'unstable'...? One factor in her life which might have turned the table for her and makes her more appealing to you....? Strange thing... If you sense that you've not got enough time for your gf why is it that you've got time for her? It could be that both of your schedules work out fine... (she being a stewardess is a plus?)... But UNDERLYING factors...? I think it's your WILLINGNESS to CLICK... As you've mentioned, she GREATLY APPEALS to you... So much so that you've unknowingly but willingly created divert in more time for her...?<br><br>That brings us back to the question of TIME with your gf... Perhaps not really because it's not enough but monotonous...? How QUALITY is your TIME with her depends on HOW you wanna use it.... No doubt 'extra relationship' is usually more THRILLING than your normal one.... 'Spice' in a relationship can also be CREATED, depending on the EFFORT put in by BOTH parties...? Why not get the BEST of both worlds but WORKING on your relationship with your gf? Where do you expect this extra relationship to bring you? You might easily end up with NOTHING if this unstable triangle BREAK UP...? THINK through it.....<br><br>All in all it's WHAT YOU WANT... THINK through it CAREFULLY and make your decision SOON... Don't drag the matter as it won't be fair for everyone.... The current situation is not a wise one to stay in. Work out your things and let everyone get on with life... Not gonna teach you what else to do here... It's YOUR LIFE... You DECIDE...?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you all. Very considered responses from everyone. I was expecting to be called names.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Anyway, yeah, I know I'm not ready for marriage ... because I can't resolve this "temptation issue"... not quite temptation but i guess "choices". It's like, you close the road forever. I really admire those friends of mine who can take that step and say, fuck it all - I'm going to be with this girl forever. yeah, who knows if it'll all end in divorce but it's still a very very very brave step.<br><br>But right now, the problem - as brought up as an anomaly - is that my time is unsteady which brings me apart from my gf. She leads a normal sedatory life, and she has a good family life, which means she has the normal Sunday with family thing. I dun. I work really long and odd hours. She can't meet me past midnight.<br><br>Now - surprisingly - I can meet the stewardess as her roster is easier to plan. And she's willing to meet as and when. So I guess, it's not that hard to fanthom why I'm suddenly spending more "quality" time with her than my gf.<br><br>And becus it's a flight thing - she's not in SG most of the time. And when she's back, it's easier to "make time out" to meet her.<br><br>Does that makes sense so far?<br><br>Thing is ---- I am moving ahead with my gf on the surface, but inside my heart, I feel I'm shrinking away from her. It's like when u get married, you take the other person's presence for granted and move on to worry about money, housing, children.... emotionally, you are detached from your space. You know you have a responsibility to her, to the family but it's no longer ... love?<br><br>I don't believe in love anyway. Love is shallow. Duty and responsibility lasts longer. Question is, I'm finding out the hard way that, there is no single person that you can love...<br><br>Let me know your thoughts. Thanks! Good night.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi confused2000, since you mentioned duty and responsibilty.. to me these two factors are components of love.. because love is about faithfulness too..<br><br>from here, you've got to ask this question. why and how did the stewardess friend's marriage ended up in divorce? if you should choose her as a life partner, is there anything that could prevent the same thing from happening? would the sparkle disappear just as your present relationship did? if it did, would you find another with the sparkle? true love stands the test of time, not another person coming in.<br><br>also, if indeed you want to choose a long term partner.. then it has to be a decision not on your own.. it's more than having sparkle or tingling feelings.. which of these two have the same perspective of life as you? sparkle can be created, excitement can be induced if both parties are willing to make effort.. my ex was a stewardess.. flying long-term wasn't her plan, she said that it's hard to settle down if flying continues.. is your stewardess friend considering that? or is she even considering settling down after a failed marriage?<br><br>lastly, happiness can only come when you find contentment in yourself.. i hope the questions i put out can lead you to the road to blessings.. you have my best wishes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Marriage should be a progression from a stable &amp; loving relationship.  It is not an item on your TO DO list by age 30.  You know you're not ready to get married, then you shouldn't even consider it, age be damned.  What are you worried about - your sperm being less fertile with age or something?  Wrinkles?<br><br>You have high ideals like "duty and responsibility".  Very admirable but this is your head talking.  The flesh is weak.  You already proven you can't walk the talk by breaking your "duty and responsiblity" to your girlfriend by seeing another woman.<br><br>The fact is, the need for passion and excitement in life is regardless of age and gender.  Whether you're 18 or 58, a fresh, pretty young thing will excite you.  You've got to be able to find a balance between the mundane everyday and still find passion and fun in that.  That's how you survive a marriage and temptations.<br><br>If your relationship isn't giving you this balance, then don't rush into marriage.  Just focus on mutual gratification.  It's not such a bad thing.<br><br>In your post I see rationalisation of your relationship, but no deep affection for your girlfriend.  If you don't love her anymore, then put her out of her misery and break up with her.  She may cry and rant but she will thank you for not wasting her time, ultimately.<br><br>Suitability of a girlfriend based on family background is less important than you think.  Since you're the man and usually the main breadwinner in a relationship, you depend on her less financially than her on you.  Unless you've got a famous family name like Shaw or Lee, or have got billions in a family business and marriage ties are important, I suggest you just give a girl a chance and not judge her by her previous relationships / the family she was born into.</div>

I really admire those friends of mine who can take that step and say, fuck it all - I'm going to be with this girl forever. yeah, who knows if it'll all end in divorce but it's still a very very very brave step.<br><br>But right now, the problem - as brought up as an anomaly - is that my time is unsteady which brings me apart from my gf. She leads a normal sedatory life, and she has a good family life, which means she has the normal Sunday with family thing. I dun. I work really long and odd hours. She can't meet me past midnight.<br><br>Now - surprisingly - I can meet the stewardess as her roster is easier to plan. And she's willing to meet as and when. So I guess, it's not that hard to fanthom why I'm suddenly spending more "quality" time with her than my gf.<br><br>And becus it's a flight thing - she's not in SG most of the time. And when she's back, it's easier to "make time out" to meet her.<br><br>Does that makes sense so far?<br><br>Thing is ---- I am moving ahead with my gf on the surface, but inside my heart, I feel I'm shrinking away from her. It's like when u get married, you take the other person's presence for granted and move on to worry about money, housing, children.... emotionally, you are detached from your space. You know you have a responsibility to her, to the family but it's no longer ... love?<br><br>I don't believe in love anyway. Love is shallow. Duty and responsibility lasts longer. Question is, I'm finding out the hard way that, there is no single person that you can love...<br><br>Let me know your thoughts. Thanks! Good night.</div></blockquote>As much as you feel this is what you want. It's still unfair that you're hiding such a relationship behind your gf. And there can be much consequences to things too? Things could be much worse than this. My ADVICE is, HANDLE it before it gets way out of hand.... Penetrating DEEP into the heart of yours and your love ones.... You can choose to be as selfish as you want to for now, but one day you'll still have to FACE whatever you've done....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting. Would have replied if not for my damn computer having to screw up at the such moments. Well, at least, it's solved. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Anyway, for your situations, your relationship enters into a passive routine relationship - a risk factor for liking someone else. Very comfortable? Very easy? Probably because there isn't any flames or quakes to shake the foundation of your relationship - people are taking things far too easy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Relationship ain't maintain there day by day as it goes - it require a minimal amount of effort to make it work. If not things often go wrong.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>One thing I would like to mention is that - if you can't find yourself committing to a partner - Forget about the thoughts of marriage first. Your biological clock may be getting old, however, on such grounds, you ain't in a state to marry your present gf. (Presume that its was in plan) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>No such thing as love, only responsibility? All I can say is that the kind of partner you are with will affect this preception. Because I presume that there isn't much issue about her or you that shook the relationship (or probably there is, but it has passed), AND the both of you have been together for quite some time. Being together doesn't equate to love - its what both parties wants to do about their relationship as a whole.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You now prefer the company of S - she gave you what you couldn't get from your present gf or in the past.<br><br><strong>'...steady instead of mischevious, sexy instead of sweet, callous instead of caring. But we clicked and we had fun...'<br><br>'Can meet the stewardess as her roster is easier to plan. And she's willing to meet as and when....'<br><br>'All through dinner, we (gf) talked about work....'</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> From this - you fell.<br><br>On the account of a Plain Water Relationship (CloUdiSm definition: Responsbility is the glue that holds the relationship and has slipped into rountine mode.) Continuing a relationship for the SAKE of continuing - love has diminished in such small measure, its difficult to see where exactly your relationship is going forth. (The growth for you is probably on the decline or stagnant). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Advice?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Settle each issue one by the time - if you are having unfuilfilling relationship from your present gf. I think it good to talk things out and trash whatever you wished to speak. If there is simply nothing to hold you back apart from responsibility - there is little reason to be together. Indecisiveness will only drag time and worsen situations. Face your feelings and acknowledge them - rather than to put it behind the back of your head and continue life as if nothing has take place.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>On a astrological point of view, this relationship is likely to be karmic. One issue to think about is whether you think pursuing this new relationship is beneficial?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Quote of the day: <strong>Someone you like and fancy doesn't mean he/she is compatiable with you on love level.</strong><br><br>Psychologically, currently, she is providing with the kind of void you have been facing in your past and present relationship. Since she was divorce, there must be something about her (and of course her ex-husband) that couldn't make that marriage work. Source it out before you attempt anything drastic - don't be blinded by the fantasy and dream created from the false imagery of your heart. Karmic relationship always holds very strong attraction in the beginning but intense relationship later on. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In the end, it all boils down to what you want and what you would do. Like you have mentioned, you ain't very young, therefore be decisive and not keep mum about such critical issue with your present gf. Whatever it is, the decision and choice you make, there isn't any right or wrong, just that...<br><br>...<span class="large">Don't ever regret making that move</span>.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
