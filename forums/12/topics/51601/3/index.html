            <div class='col-md body'>doubt anyone rems this by now ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>lots of water under the bridge in these *hhmf* months (?!).<br><br>i honestly thought abt the state of things and decided that choices, no matter how hard, must be made with due considerations. So much so that, with the soft property market, I had seriously explored getting a piece of the sky. Needless to say, I broached this to both parties and their reactions threw me even more ... off tangent.<br><br>actually, the relationship with the stewardess had deteriotated nosedived after a few months and it became weirdly skewed. But when the property issue came up, she was oddly keen. No this was not a 'money' thing cos she offered her share (consider it hefty - we are not talking HDB flats here). She was keenly suggest we move in together. It's a damn big turnaround from her lackadisical attitude then. It took me by surprise - what the heck, here's this woman who is willing to throw her life savings to a guy whom she met for a few months.<br><br>But guess what, just when I'm taking that as proof that we are going to pull through and I'm going to break off with my current gf, she displayed a total lack of committment recently.<br><br>I can't deal with this anymore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>In a way, I can't deal with her mood swings, her reticience, her emotional desert.<br><br>Guess what. I'm giving up.<br><br>As for the state of things with my gf, it's not improving. Guess what too... I think I'm also heading for a break up there. But my head's telling me - what the hey, she loves you more than you love her - and that's the person who you should choose. My heart says, I'm letting her go too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Oh well, I guess I'm expecting more flames coming my way.

            <div class='col-md body'>HI Confuse,<br><br>Well, this situation I believe that everyone has been through. As times are bad nw, we cannot help that our working hours are long. Your gf should be more understanding rather than making a fuss abt it saying that both of you have drifted apart.<br><br>To maintain a relationship is difficult. It takes two hands to clap and question is have the both of you sit down and talk about it? If not, I advise you to do so. Discuss on the issue abt your long working hours and your work load so that she can understand more on ur work. There should be a compromise rather than blaming each other which I don't think it's necessary.<br><br>If this carries on and in future both of you are married, how are u going to keep this marriage if this problems are not solved! As for you are saying that you know a stewardess, you have to think it carefully. How long have you know this air stewardess and how long have u know ur gf? If you are so easily being influence, then you have to sit down and think carefully on ur current relationship.<br><br>The stewardess is divorced or not is not important. Important thing is: Do you love your girlfriend? If you do, keep this relationship. If you don't, don't waste ppl's time and youth by trying to be a two timer.<br><br>Sit down and think carefully asking yourself what do you want in life? Be it career and marriage. We are always confuse when comes to relationship but we have to be rational.<br><br>What you say that the air stewardess reminds you of your ex. I think that's more like reminding of your past relationship and I can say it's infatuation. You are just being curious and not thinking in a rational way.<br><br>I suggest you sit down and talk to your gf abt your problem. If you don't, the problem will remains even if the both of you end this relationship.<br><br>Remember, time don't wait for ppl.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I seriously hope that your present gf will ditch u before u break up with her. She deserves a much better guy, someone who loves her wholeheartedly.<br><br>Dont try to give urself excuses. Dont blame ur gf, she is didnt do anything wrong, in contradictory, u did her wrong. U cant have the best of both worlds. One more thing, age doesnt equal to maturity.<br><br>Yes u r behaving like young teen. Shame on u!</div>
