            <div class='col-md body'>hi confused2000, i  dun think i can offer much advice on your problem..coz i am facing a very similar problem to yours.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>i am in the same position as the 'air stewardess' in your story. Yup..i am the third party. I knew he was attached when i got to know him. He's a good fren, knew him for about 7 mths by now...nothing really<br>happened between us... but emotionally we are close.<br>He's a SAF personal and is outstation now in East timor for 7<br>mths. HE was there since april and everyday we commuicate via emails..he does calls occasionally<br><br>He has been with the gf for  6 yrs. Me and the guy are both 28 and the gf is 24.<br>We didn't dare to see each other often as we dun wan things to get out of control. We are also physically attracted to each other...but hasn't gone beyond a  kiss or hug so far. I think he should be facing the same issues as u rite now. The gf has gone thru all kinds of sh.i.t with him.... not much sparks ... has certain religion issues.. and then i came into the picture. Emotionally he has already betray the gf.  He just came back from East timor for 2 weeks break..and everytime he spend time with gf.....he was thinking of me.We met up a few times those 2 weeks. Now that he is back to east timor.. i am not as stress as before. and hope he can sort his feelings out.  That goes the same for u . If u think u cannot love your gf as before... u should think clearly and not waste her time. I wouldn't want a bf who is always thinking of someone else. Sorry i am not able to help much here.<br><br>i like my fren alot but i dun wan to get involve with him when he is attached. Either he breaks up with the gf.....or he choose her again.If he wants both ways.....i will just leave lor. Things like that can really get very very messy</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you RealliRaw and Snowygal.<br><br>I've coped better these few days because you are right, I was standing too close to the issue.<br><br>Went on a weekend break with my gf. Yeah, we had the same issues but hell, I realised that basically, what's wrong with that? It may not be love ... yeah, no such thing as "romance"... but then it's ok isn't it?<br><br>She's just so much better to start a married life with. She's pleasant to live with, she's responsible, she can organise and not let me do all the work myself. Financially, we'll be alright. Not spectacular but she maintains she can live w the pittance we have. And I believe her.<br><br>Deep down though... scared to find I dun love her enough. Oh and snowygal, yeah, we have some religion problems too cos she's staunchly Christian and my family will b aghast at a Church-going ceremony.<br><br>Stewardess went on a long long flight. Found myself angry at her. Dug deeper and guess what, think I am angry cos I think I'm like a port waiting for her to come back to. Maybe it's not like that, but she certainly makes me feel that way this trip round.<br><br>Oh, financially, due to her fortunate experiences, she does expect the guy to be the breadwinner. She wants to marry well.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>hi cunfused 2000,<br><br>A few things that i'd like to offer... for a start, many guys (and gals alike) take a closer look at their relationship before they sign on the dotted line. It's especially frightening when relationships around you do not work out well or reports on divorce rates have been steadily climbing up. We start to question if this is what we are getting ourselves into.<br><br>I was told that love has 3 components: passion, intimacy &amp; commitment.<br><br>We can quickly identify with passion, the racing heartbeat, the world slowing down when you are with your significant other and all seems bright as day. Perhaps that's what you are feeling with Ms S. I reckon you must have felt that when you first knew you gf. The thing about passion is it can quickly come and quickly go. Give yourself 6 months or a year and the heartbeat will go back to normal.<br><br>Intimacy is like the anchor. The more you know about your SO (sig other) and the more you complement her, the easier it is to sustain it. Common values and beliefs play a big part. The more you know about the other and agree with that, the greater the chances of sticking it through. For me, i started out talking to my husband on the phone. We would talk for hours. It's at those times that i found out about his values, which is family first. I was looking for a man like that and i knew that since he treasured his parents and siblings, he will take good care of ours.<br><br>the last and often mistaken as least is commitment. It almost sounds like a dirty or taboo word. After i got married, a friend enquired about our state of affairs. He's been married for years and have 2 children. So he told me something that i'm holding on to... we marry the one we love. after the wedding bells and all, we learn to love the one we married. It's not a chore, but realise that we have committed to the life or better or worse, in sickness or in health, till death do us part. Getting married may be the easy part, but keeping it together takes a lifetime<br><br>Perhaps it's for you to know what you really want in a spouse, not just the practicalities (i have a 5-room flat, no car but all the loans you've talked about), we're talking about personality, values, etc. It's important to know who you are too. It is a good time to take stock and make a decision, an informed one and one you'll hold on to.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks. Nice to hear from some one who's actually married and ... happy (?). Not too sure from your tone.<br><br>Anyway, yeah, "love the one you marry" or "marry the one you love"... seems tough isn't it?<br><br>I think I'm becoming a girl. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Hahah.<br><br>In the sense that we always bitch abt girls who chose the guy with the most assets, most valuable/stable career, not exciting nevermind, nice and 'husbandly', responsible and will help with the kids ---&gt; best sort of husband rite? sow your wild oats first and marry this dork who will loves you more than you do him.<br><br>So, I think I'm approaching that kind of thinking ... is it bad?<br><br>Anyway, S is coming back this weekend. It's going to be a tough weekend as I'm going to thrash some stuff out with her.

She's pleasant to live with, she's responsible, she can organise and not let me do all the work myself. Financially, we'll be alright. Not spectacular but she maintains she can live w the pittance we have. And I believe her.<br><br>Deep down though... scared to find I dun love her enough. Oh and snowygal, yeah, we have some religion problems too cos she's staunchly Christian and my family will b aghast at a Church-going ceremony.<br><br>Stewardess went on a long long flight. Found myself angry at her. Dug deeper and guess what, think I am angry cos I think I'm like a port waiting for her to come back to. Maybe it's not like that, but she certainly makes me feel that way this trip round.<br><br>Oh, financially, due to her fortunate experiences, she does expect the guy to be the breadwinner.

But it's through it that we get to know more about each other and enjoy the sunshine after the rain. It's fair that there is balance, no overdose of sugar (from this honeymoon year) but we know we love each other so much that we want to make things work.<br><br>As you were talking about marrying the one you love, i can't help but recall the life of a friend. She had been attached to a guy for many years. Bystanders would think that he is a great guy and would be a great husband. To that, she agreed. She also added that when she marries him, it's because she knows that he loves her dearly and he will make a good husband. At my young age then, i did not question her motives. Years down, both of them got married. It should have been their 3rd or 4th anniversary this year. But i spotted her with some other person. Later i found out that she had actually divorced him, the guy she has been for years.<br><br>Responsibility will be just that , responsibility. Something you might not want to do but have to do. If you are content with living that life for the rest of your life, it's your call. I'm not justifying a decision to leave your gf. There was a spark somewhere and if you really want to, you can rediscover that and love her for who she is, not less. It's not fair to be loved and withhold it. Sooner or later, the other person will know.<br><br>All the best to you...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>confused2000... u mentioned that the stewardess wishes to marry well and u were lamenting abt ur own financial status.. hmm.. from a practical viewpoint, dun u think that there would not be a very optimistic ending between u and the stewardess?<br><br>sorry if i sound harsh or wat.. eventually if u 2 were to be married, after many many yrs, the "passion" and feeling of romance or love between u two may die off too, jus like between u and ur long-term gf. rite? thatz when u will feel even more demoralised and degraded by the then-wife of urs (the stewardess) who will grumble abt why she chose u and not some other rich man, etc etc....<br><br>while reading all ur posts, hmm I kept putting myself in the shoes of ur long-term gf, whom i really pity wif.. seems to me that she loves u sincerely but a pity u find ur relationship wif her stagnant, without any romantic feelings... confused2000, have u ever suggested to her not to talk abt work? And, a lovelife without sparks may not necessarily by boring.. it could be peaceful, blissful...<br><br>I do hope u can sort things out on ur own and make some decision quick.. at least that is being fair to the girls.. afterall, u are getting older each day... *grins*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, another week, another story. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I admit there's always the possibility of being degraded after marrying 'S'. I have the confidence in myself earning enough not to starve my family. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But I have a feeling I wouldn't make S happy material wise.<br><br>Anyway, I had my talk ... we sorted out some negativity. She's holding back her feelings for me, she claims. I dunno to believe her but she's been a bit up and down emotionally since she's back. Her marriage broke up I think, partly due to her unwillingness to compromise. Strangely, some stuff she does is still so cloying sweet to me.<br><br>My gf is, as usual, tied up this entire week. The day she's free (note the singular) is the day I'm not and the rest of the time, she had to either work late or have family engagements.<br><br>Not that I'm that free either since I end work usually at 8plus 9pm.<br><br>But timings like that doesn't suit her. She can't/unwilling to come out - even for dinner. So, it's an excuse ... but a very tempting one to go out with S.<br><br>On one hand, my gf is more marriagable (she would on her own initiative look out for me), while the other, S surprisingly provides company? How is that possible?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I just saw S off at the airport. She looked gorgeous. She seemed a little bright at the edges when she's on the job. When's she off it, she behaves a bit screwed up. But when she's at 'work', she makes you feel so good abt yourself.<br><br>This sucks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>I guess since I'm not looking for validation... and many many kind users had given me their good advice, i think this is becoming my online blog/diary.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is a mature question? Dun think so, because let me put it this way, not only pple ur age will succumb to temptation. A fairly young person can do that do. I think this events happens every now and then when a man cannot stand firm on his beliefs and take charge of his life. Mature questions will only seems quite childish if it is not handled appropriately I guess.<br><br>I think, if ur gf cannot compromise on the timing to go out, please have a gd talk to her. Well, I understand ur working stress, but surely u can make out time to have a talk with her? Not even on the phone? Let me tell you, it is the job of an air stewardess to be bright and jovial because she is considered in a customer service line. She must be gorgeous because it is also part of her job to look good in her job. U are attracted to something quite "plastic" in a sense? If you can have a talk to 'S', maybe u can have a talk to ur gf as well.<br><br>I just have a feeling that perhaps u are trying to push majority of the blames to ur gf. Maybe you shd not compare 'S' to ur gf. They are 2 totally diff person altogether. Although much different from one another, I can tell u, it is very painful to know that oneself is being compared like that. I am speaking from experience.<br><br>If u are not ready to get married, why worry about which gal is being more marrigeable? And getting away from problems like this with death is not a very gd idea. Just plain....ridiculous. I mean, I m not here to give advice. I just think that u need to wake up.<br><br>Either u love the air stewardess or ur gf. U cannot 2-time gals like that u noe. Talking about responsibilities. Part of the resposibilities of a bf is to be faithful n loving to his gf. The LOVE CAN DIE. It is up to both parties to make ways to rekindle it. If ur gf is not willing to do anything, talk to her. Just tell her u might feel neglected. But then, due to ur work, u also neglect her in some ways isnt it? 'S' is not always in SG, so one day she neglect u, u gonna look for another gal?<br><br>It is human's nature to go for good looking counterparts. It is also human's responsibility to understand the rights and wrongs to accept temptations, whether with reasons or not. Watever it is, you should know the outcome. Just that u are running away from it.<br><br>I am hardly 23 yet. Am I considered juvenile to answer ur questions? Well, I think age has got nothing to do with problems that comes in our life as and when. Physical age doesnt equal to mentality developments.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>really, i have been following the post and it seems to me that u are just trying to find out what the general consensus is. the fact that u have strayed and trying to find excuses for it is simply disgusting...<br>not only are u trying to justify the reason to double time but you are completely irresponsible in your actions towards your long term gf and in a aspect with yourself and your 'fling'. you are 30 yrs old... u're behaving like a teen whos just found out that he is wanted by 2 different women and is relishing every moment of it... the trill and excitement AND the drama. SHAME ON U! really... i dont believe you would have made it in your professional life by being wishy washy. i have chosen not to mince my words because, this behaviour is just unacceptable... you donÂ’t need to have a flashy car, landed property or a surname such as shaw or lee to give a woman that loves you a stable family life. Get it?Although women are materialistic; but because men <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">understand that fact of life so thatÂ’s why the greatest motivating force for men is his desire to please women!</span></strong> at the end of the day, all she wants is stability.... sure having more money to spend is a plus but remember, money<br>is just a convenience to get the things you desire, but as might already know, money cannot buy 'sparksÂ’ andand a multiple year relationship.she clearly has the patience  to put up with all your bulls**t and the foresight to see u through i suggest that u rethink your non-commitment policy and shape up soon. i fear that if u hesitate any longer u might lose both and then u will be lamenting about the lost. act before she gets cold feet! and before some nice rich hunky guy with a surname of lee, maybe shaw? sees what u used to see  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> in your gf and whisks her away!<br>seriously, i would have asked her to be my spouse by now.....<br>have a think bout it.<br><br>_____________________________________________________<br><br>Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former. - Albert Einstein_</div>
