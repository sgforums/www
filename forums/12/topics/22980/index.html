            <div class='col-md body'>Like to share a little something with the people in here... This comes from an e-mail sent by my friend.... Alot of the things mentioned contain the ideas of what I've thought of, but dare not say out today... Think I was more outspoken and straight in my behavior in the past.... Today, I'm just a little more defensive and relunctant?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>With that, I share with you....<br><br><span style="color: DarkBlue;">There is a huge drama called <span style="font-style: italic;">life</span>. Some of us prefer to review as <span style="font-style: italic;">little</span> of<br>our real self as possible, hearing judgment from society. We do things the<br>usual way, the way-its always been done and never question why things are<br>being done the way they are. Is it because is the right way ? or are we<br>behaving like this because we should and ought to ? We speak tactfully, do<br>whatever we think is socially busy with diplomatic, we get our Degrees, find<br>a decent job and get married with respectable people. I am not saying this<br>is bad, as long as this is truly what you want and you are happy. But many<br>people are wearing for such simple for the sake of being one of the threads<br>in the fabric of society. Because they feel this is the right thing to do<br>but they are still unhappy.<br>Betty Lee Yong writes about sometimes we are <span style="font-style: italic;">afraid</span> of showing our true<br>self. Â“I keep my paint brush with me wherever I may go in case I need to<br>cover up, so the real me does not show. I am so afraid to show you ME,<br>afraid of what you will do that you might laugh or say mean thing. IÂ’m<br>afraid I might <span style="font-style: italic;">lose</span> you. I like to remove all my paint coat to show you the<br>real true me, but I want you to try and understand I need you to accept what<br>you see. So if you be patient and close your eyes, I will strip off my coats<br>slowlyÂ…Â…Â…..please understand how much it <span style="font-style: italic;">hurts</span> to let the real me show. Now<br>that my coats are all stripped off, I feel <span style="font-style: italic;">naked, bare and cold</span> and if you<br>still <span style="font-style: italic;">love me</span> with all that you see, you are my friend, you are as gold. I<br>need to save my paint brush though and hold it in my hand. I want to keep it<br>handy in case someone does not understand. So please protect me, my dear<br>friend and thanks for loving me true but please let me keep my paint brush<br>with me until I love me tooÂ”.<br>Are you willing to show the world your <span style="font-style: italic;">true self</span> ? The true you that you <span style="font-style: italic;">can<br>accept and love and be proud of </span>regardless of what others think and say ?</span><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Most of us are so busy rushing around that we forget to be thankful even if<br>you happened million dollars and you arenÂ’t thankful you wonÂ’t be happy. One<br>can be grateful for even a simple everyday item like toothpaste, if you<br>really think about how life would be without it.<br>Be thankful for your friends-in bad times they are there to listen to your<br>problems and even help you resolve them; in good times they multiply your<br>joys. Material possessions can never made you truly happy. Buying a new car,<br>you might happy for a while but when an improvement model in the market, you<br>will start wanting the new one. They cycle of wanting will never end.<br>Be thankful for your health. It enables you to experience the most of your<br>life. The richest man is not the one who has the most but the one who needs<br>least.  A timely reminder with violence and bilateral tensions escalating<br>many parts of the world. Even during hard times, we should be thankful,<br>struggle and hardship help us grow. A perfect environment would be<br>impossible for men to survive in. Without many flaws and inherent<br>characteristics, our life will become lazy and redundant. Even when you make<br>a mistake, donÂ’t feel defeated and embarrassed. ItÂ’s an opportunity to learn<br>something that means you are constantly improving. ItÂ’s easy to be thankful<br>for the good things, but the life of rich fulfillment come to those who are<br>also thankful for the setbacks.</span><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<span style="color: olive;"><br>How many <span style="font-style: italic;">acts of love</span> have been shower upon us without us <span style="font-style: italic;">realising</span> it and<br>how many gifts of affections have been give to us that we are overlooked or<br><span style="font-style: italic;">misunderstood</span>. If we re-examined our lives, IÂ’m sure each of us can easily<br>come out with a log list. Loving someone sometimes means not having too<br>vaguely or conspicuously <span style="font-style: italic;">express our love</span>, occasionally the person giving<br>the love doesnÂ’t show spontaneously and suddenly that he or she doesnÂ’t even<br>realize that it was an act of love.Take this story for example : -<br>A husband and wife were celebrating 50 years of marriage life together,<br>their golden wedding anniversary. They have blown-out a celebration at a<br>hall with their children, grandchildren and their relatives and friends.<br>When they finally made their way home on the big party that was thrown for<br>them, they were tired and happy to be home again, to peace and quiet. They<br>were so busy with everyone that day and so excited with the grand event that<br>neither of them had eaten much during the day or evening. So they decided<br>before going to bed have a little snack of coffee with home-made bread and<br>butter. They were sitting at the kitchen table, the husband took out a new<br>loaf of break and handed the end piece, the heel, to his wife of 50 years.<br>She immediately went into a rage. She shouted at him Â“For 50 years youÂ’ve<br>been dumping the heel of bread on me, I just wonÂ’t take it from you anymore.<br>You could care less about what I likeÂ”. On and on her anger raged, all<br>ignited by his offering her the heel of the bread. He said that in absolute<br>astonishment at what he was hearing. When she finally finished, he said to<br>her quietly, <span style="font-style: italic;">Â“But honey, is my favourite pieceÂ”.</span><br>The next time you feel angry with your family member or partner because of<br>something he or she did, stop and <span style="font-style: italic;">take a moment</span> to examine why he or she did<br>it. We often think the worse of other people intentions and thatÂ’s the<br>reason why we ended up infuriated with <span style="font-style: italic;">the one who loves us</span> the most. No<br>matter how close or intimate people might be, perception and methods can<br>still differ. <span style="font-style: italic;">DonÂ’t always jump to conclusion</span>, donÂ’t judge action and<br><span style="font-style: italic;">overlook the intention</span>. It maybe more love than we <span style="font-style: italic;">ever imagined</span>.</span></div>
