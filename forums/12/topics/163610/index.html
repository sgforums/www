All maybe she just need a "FRIEND" not a person whom she can commit in a long term... Think about it... Either u treat her as a ordinary "friend" also, or the other... if u can't and still like/love her so much.. better keep ur distance... You wouldn't waste all the rest of your time and losing self respect with her, who wont ever commit with you right?</div>

Well, we are all just speculating based on his side of story. We can base our advice on nothing else at the moment, unless the lady involved comes in and give us her view on this matter.<br><br>So I think it is best if he just talks to her and let her know of his worries and concern. And if she is truly in love with him, she will tell him how she truly feels and assure him that she is not making use of him?</div>
