You deserve a better gal than her. Don't worry, there are plenty of much better gals around in sg that doesn't go for physical outlook. She is probably still very young, but she will soon outgrow her mentality in a couple of years. So I advise you to move on and do not feel depressed for her actions cos she had just made you a much more noble person than she is. Be strong and never lose your faith in love, the right gal is still out there...waiting.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
