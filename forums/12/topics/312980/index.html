              <p>    I think I am suffering from depression. I just went to see the doctor this morning. He said that what I am going through has a cause (I can't figure out this cause for the past week despite asking myself many times). And this cause triggers off the negative thoughts and which is why it makes me feel down.</p>
              <p>    I really have no idea what is the cause. Maybe you all could help me in determining the cause. The few possible causes I could think of are work stress and accumuated stress.</p>
              <p>    Work stress has been getting on to me for sometime and it doesnt help that the department I work in is shorthanded and every staff is over loaded. My old manager just left and there has been no replacement since and no one seems to help me in my work. I am also taking alot from my higher supervisor who likes to assign me those extra work to do for him.</p>
              <p>    It makes things worst that he is insensitive. My other half is also working in the same company as me and my higher superviosr knows and he seems like a avid kpo person, going around telling others about this. (Hes an old guy btw). This is something which is not too good as somehow it will affect how ppl view us as profesisonals at work.</p>
              <p>    Accumulated stress I would say is due to my past experiences? I used to be a normal, quiet and shy guy. A bad experience with friends during my secondary school days has caused me to become more introverted and to lose all trust in friends, particularly guy friends. I experienced a betrayal of a guy friend. I duno how this past experience links here but it seems I have not forgotten it.</p>
              <p>    Any thoughts form anyone?</p>

              <p>Hello, there are different types of depression. You might be going through a temporary mild depression.</p>
              <p>HMM I think all the factors mentioned are inter-connected. Coincidentally the work stress trigger the subtle suppressed emotion ?</p>
              <p>Well, still best to see the professionals.</p>

              <p>It could be temporary depression. If it's temporary then I suggest to find someone you really trust and pour out your woes to him/her then have a good cry. Believe me a good cry helps. Usually after a good cry you will feel as though your burden seems to be lifted off your chest and shoulder.</p>
              <p>But if it's a long term depression you need to go on medication prescribed by certified doctors.</p>

              <p>If you go to IMH directly, it will cost you alot. Maybe around $80. But if you get a referral from polyclinic, it will reduce the cost to maybe around $30.</p>
              <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_depression">Find out the symptoms of a depression</a>.<br>Then just go to your nearest polyclinic and tell the doctor that you might have a depression.

              <p>setokaiba,</p>
              <p>Like many others, I agree that it's better for you to find professional help on this.  The best person who can help to to see which memory inside of you that is anchoring you down is a professional who deals with it.</p>
              <p>And depression is not something that you can just snap out of.  Eddyvlad's suggestion is good, so it's better to talk to someone who has the know-how to help you deal with it.</p>
              <p>If you'd just like to let it all out in the forum, I'm sure many of people here would spend time to read, but at the end of it, we can only voice our opinion, which is now, to seek professional help.</p>
              <p>Sorry that I have nothing to offer you here.  Do take care and keep us posted.</p>

              <p>    I think I am suffering from depression. I just went to see the doctor this morning. He said that what I am going through has a cause (I can't figure out this cause for the past week despite asking myself many times). And this cause triggers off the negative thoughts and which is why it makes me feel down.</p>
              <p>    I really have no idea what is the cause. Maybe you all could help me in determining the cause. The few possible causes I could think of are work stress and accumuated stress.</p>
              <p>    Work stress has been getting on to me for sometime and it doesnt help that the department I work in is shorthanded and every staff is over loaded. My old manager just left and there has been no replacement since and no one seems to help me in my work. I am also taking alot from my higher supervisor who likes to assign me those extra work to do for him.</p>
              <p>    It makes things worst that he is insensitive. My other half is also working in the same company as me and my higher superviosr knows and he seems like a avid kpo person, going around telling others about this. (Hes an old guy btw). This is something which is not too good as somehow it will affect how ppl view us as profesisonals at work.</p>
              <p>    Accumulated stress I would say is due to my past experiences? I used to be a normal, quiet and shy guy. A bad experience with friends during my secondary school days has caused me to become more introverted and to lose all trust in friends, particularly guy friends. I experienced a betrayal of a guy friend. I duno how this past experience links here but it seems I have not forgotten it.</p>
              <p>    Any thoughts form anyone?</p>

              <p>Hmm i think you are just too stressed with work. You need to learn to unwind abit and have some bits of fun. Maybe you and your wife can go for recreational activity, play a sport, go for an evening stroll, have a nice movie and dinner..basically do something nice and enjoyable after work, to loosen up abit.</p>
