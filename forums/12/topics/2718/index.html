In his eyes, it was me.<br>he got into trouble with the law recently and I, instead of consoling him, have been very angry with the things he did behind my back. All i ask is for him is to lead a proper lifestyle and not hang out with his "gangster" friends. After knowing them, he has been dragged into trouble just by being eith them! I told him (for his own good) to stop mixing with them but he did not listen.<br>he suddenly told me one day that he wanted us to separate for a while. he wanted to get over his court case before he could "deal" with me. i got upset and told him it was as good as breaking up. So, i guess that was then when he took it that i was breaking up with him.<br>Let me get it straight that this kind of "breakup" thingy always happen and nothing came out of it. its just that this time, he was serious enough it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>As for sleeping with him, he initiated it. he came to my place and i was crying and all. He was comforting me and i think he gave in in the end. that was why he initiated the whole thing. and i really love him. but after it happened, i think he regretted it and as you have said, he thought things were still impossible between us.<br><br>[This message has been edited by misunderstood (edited 25 March 2001).]</div>

He needed a substitute for love because i couldnt be there for him.<br>I dun feel really good about getting him back either. this may sound childish, but who would feel good when their bf or gf tells someone else that he/she likes her? did u feel this way? Do you still think about him now? what caused the breakup?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to thank all of you for your wonderful advise. I guess, when i was setting up this topic, i was feeling confused and upset about the way things were going on in my relationship. I made my bf sound like a total jerk. There was a lot of misunderstanding and he said a lot of hurtful things to me because he thought that it was for the best if we broke up (he felt that i was unhappy in the relationship and didn't want to continue hurting me) and had a lot of distrust for him. In the past few days, he has tried to call me and me, having cooled off from my anger,  tried to understand why he did the things he did (because I believe he is not all that bad). As both of us threw aside our anger and unhappiness, we discovered that the unhappiness in our relationship was partly because I couldnt accept a lot of his bad habits (like smoking) and that's why he appeared to always be hiding things for me. This is why I always snapped at him and made him feel like a total piece of shit.<br>Most of your advise made sense and I really appreciated them. However, me and my bf got back together again (he finally decided to come clean with me on everything). Through his sincerity, i was shaken and realised that I truely loved him and he does love me dearly.<br>I dunno whether what I did was right, but I really love him and will try my very best to make things better.</div>

Since you have so much faith and love for him, do stick with him thru thick and thin. I believe he is not a jerk as well. Give him the moral support when thing turn out low for him. And help him to wake up if he still cannot see the light. Make him think about both of your future. Guys are normally immature until they have someone in their life to worry for, to work hard and strive for their happiness.<br><br>Hope you attain happiness in your life with your persistency.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by misunderstood:</div><div class="quote_body">I would like to thank all of you for your wonderful advise. I guess, when i was setting up this topic, i was feeling confused and upset about the way things were going on in my relationship. I made my bf sound like a total jerk. There was a lot of misunderstanding and he said a lot of hurtful things to me because he thought that it was for the best if we broke up (he felt that i was unhappy in the relationship and didn't want to continue hurting me) and had a lot of distrust for him. In the past few days, he has tried to call me and me, having cooled off from my anger,  tried to understand why he did the things he did (because I believe he is not all that bad). As both of us threw aside our anger and unhappiness, we discovered that the unhappiness in our relationship was partly because I couldnt accept a lot of his bad habits (like smoking) and that's why he appeared to always be hiding things for me. This is why I always snapped at him and made him feel like a total piece of shit.<br>Most of your advise made sense and I really appreciated them. However, me and my bf got back together again (he finally decided to come clean with me on everything). Through his sincerity, i was shaken and realised that I truely loved him and he does love me dearly.<br>I dunno whether what I did was right, but I really love him and will try my very best to make things better. </div></blockquote>Well... I remember u saying he was into another relationship right? What happened to the third party? He might still be in contact with her...<br>I'm glad things turn out the way you wanted... but still... be careful.<br><br>------------------<br>**I want u to be with me.....<br>be with me in the morning...be with me in the nite...with me when its dark out...with me when its light...<br>I want u to be with me...no matter what we do...just keep this reminder...of how much I love u...**</div>

Now, he's come clean on his "secrets" of smoking and drinking which I absolutely hate. So everytime we meet, I can smell it from his breath (even if there isn't, I will still somehow feel that there is). I tried to be cool about it, but i realised that I can't. It really takes a lot of effort to overcome the shock that he is gonna be like this for quite some time (I dun think he will ever quit, there is no drive).<br>Somehow, I feel rather cheated that i have to accept this because I came into this relationship because i tot he was a non smoker.<br>I feel really at a loss and I really dont want to hear things like, " if you love him, you will accept him for what he is" crap because I know that it is not fair to me. He knows I hate smoking. So "if he really loves me, why doesnt he quit?"<br>Anyone been in this kind of situation before?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>^_^ if you have smoked before, you will know the difficulty it is to quit... It is hard... trust me. However, give him some time... It didn't take a day to built Rome (as they say). Keep reminding him bit by bit. Eventually he will understand that you are taking great effort to put up with him and soon will quit.
