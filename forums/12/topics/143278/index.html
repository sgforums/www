            <div class='col-md body'>yes, frog...I still remember you.<br><br>so what are your plans? actually you cant blame her for feeling this way and acting this way..she feel insecured as you know, her looks. so that is why she resorted such actions.<br><br>she is afraid of lossing you, and i believe that she feel that any girl outside is better than her, so thus she can only feel better by acting this way.<br><br>There is no other way to solve this problem except by communicating more, and by ensuring her of your feelings towards her. Girls like her need alot of assurance, as she does not have much confidence.<br><br>in order to stop such unreasonable behavior, you can try talking to her how you feel by her actions and tell her that you feel restricted and so on...tell her that you feel very troubled and stress if she doesnt stop her unreasonable actions and if she really love you, she will give way, otherwise you might want to reconsider your stand again.<br><br>I have meet girls that demand their bf to cut off all platonic friendship with friends of the opposite sex by deleting away their female friend no and not allowing messages from them and other....but this things only go one way, meaning that the girl doesnt have to do that. Hence,I am not sure what is their thinking, if you are one of them can you please enlighten me on these actions.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kero.. Firstly, stop having sex with her, stop all intimacy, deny any accusations from her, bring her out to more romantic places, stop using vulgar, stop trying to think that she is so sticky, try treating her a bit better, understand her more, talk to her more, listen to her more. You are just getting bored of this relation, and she is the opposite, she cherishs this relation more and more. Y? NOT becuz u r romantic, cuz u haf sex with her a few times le.. Hafing sex is more than a pleasure action, it is a form of bonding with another person, is just like a romantic date together, unforgettable.. Try to understand her more.. Think about it, do you really hate her that much? do you really like her that much? Clear your mind of all distractions, go to a beach or something, clear your thoughts.. And then start to think about your life.. Do you want it to go on like this? Can your consience take it? If you don't want it to continue, tell her frankly, but since she's more of a ruffian kind.. take it slowly, plan ur moves carefully.. I don't know what will happen, but this is the advice i can give now.. You better consider wisely and make a wise choice.. don't end up regretting everything.. =) But remember, humans are humans because they make mistakes, but every failure has a root to success.. TAke Care..</div>

I can't reject her if she wants sex because i don't want her imagination to run wild. this is the first time i encounter having sex without enjoying it. it's very jialat. No i don't hate her at all but she thinks too much.</div>

She sms me everyday a few times and calls me everyday. all these i don't mind but what start to scares me is today when i told her "sandy (not real name), what if i fall in love with another girl and leave you?" she says she will kill herself to make me feel guilty for the rest of my life and she mean it when she stares at me.
