As a man, can u resist the temptation?? </div></blockquote><span style="color: blue;"><br>the answer is: YES... if i m not sure whether i want to go into a r/s with a gal, i will not have any sexual encounters with her... for one, u dunno if u can handle the responsibility after that.. for two, what if u decide to back out after serious consideration? how would u answer to the gal? making things so difficult for urself... for three, if u cant even control ur own emotions, u arent a man..<br><br>my qn back to u is this: does it mean that if any gal by the street offers sexual favours to u, u must take it in order to proof that u r man? is that ur definition of being a man?<br><br>my opinion of a true man is knowing how to do the right thing at the the right time... unless one is dead serious abt a gal, sexual encounters should not even be in the to-do list... spare a thot for the gal if the r/s doesnt work out... howz the gal gonna face her next partner if he is not as open-minded?<br></span></div>

She will kick and scream, if she wants to die she would have already died.
