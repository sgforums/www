              <p>Thanks for ur kind words. Ya we visited to old age homes here in sg and they told us they cant accept cos of the condition being too bad. She is 52 this year. We enquire IMH cos there they accept in-patient but too ex $75 per day. We even go to a home in JB and they dont mind accepting. The thing is its $1.5k monthly. My dad and his bro must split payment. We went to MCYS and his bro die die dont wanna share. He say he don wanna come money for that. So now we goin thru govt lawyers cos in the prev short term agreement state if any opportunity of home comes both party must come to an agreement. He breach so we gonna go where we can lor. But the lawyer said since the contracts states 50-50 custody now its our turn to take care...</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Thanks for ur kind words. Ya we visited to old age homes here in sg and they told us they cant accept cos of the condition being too bad. She is 52 this year. We enquire IMH cos there they accept in-patient but too ex $75 per day. We even go to a home in JB and they dont mind accepting. The thing is its $1.5k monthly. My dad and his bro must split payment. We went to MCYS and his bro die die dont wanna share. He say he don wanna come money for that. So now we goin thru govt lawyers cos in the prev short term agreement state if any opportunity of home comes both party must come to an agreement. He breach so we gonna go where we can lor. But the lawyer said since the contracts states 50-50 custody now its our turn to take care...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>also i now asking SAF to exempt me from ns or give me time off. im still willing to do office duties but just that i need to be at home at night to take care of my mom and sis in law. say something happen to my aunt then how can my mom handle all that after her op? so ya... this is my problem.</p>

              <p>I don't think it is easy to get an exemption. On the other hand, I don't think your auntie would want you to waste your youth to take care of her. I am sure she wants the best for you and for you to start a new adventure in your life, not to be bogged down taking care of her. Having said this, of course, she wants you to visit her constantly and be an emotional support for her. This is your duty as nephew.</p>
              <p>Is there any charitable organization that may accept her for less maintenance fees? The downside of cheaper nursery homes is that the risk of them mistreating her. About the nursery in JB, better make thorough check to see if they are legal and have the proper facilities to take care of your auntie. I heard of a case of a Malaysian mother who sent her 18 year old son suffers from celebral palsy to an illegal nursery home in Malaysia, only to find out 3 months later that her son died from incessant physical abuse. I am not wanting to scare you but there is that risk of nursery homes mistreating their patients. So you have to check their permits and license to see if they are qualified. Malaysian nursery homes may be cheaper but they may be at a higher risk because they are not regularly vetted like those of Singaporean nursery homes.</p>

              <p>I undst but my situation is bad now. We dont even have 1 room for her. My dad sleeps with her in the living room. I talked to my dxo she said she will do what she can. Im sure SAF can help its just whether they want or dont. U see 1 clerk do an average duty of 1 duty per day... Its more towards my lost than their gain. If still they want to ask me do duty then i must seek for post out. If i ask for charity it will be hoohah. She is mentally retarded so she dont know who is who except my dad. She got skin infection too. My mom can and dad can take care but my mom now going to do a major op and dad working 2 jobs. Im not making m problem big im just sayin how it is.</p>

              <p>This ops duty is not forever right? How long is it going to be? You cannot be the only clerk over there right? There must be some rotating shifts. Perhaps they have certain manpower constraints so they cant just agree without any concrete evidence to proof what you are saying is true.</p>
              <p>If i'm not wrong stay-out can be approved by CO of your unit. But do not jump the chain of command, when your DXO rejects your application for stay out. Just politely voice out that you need to speak to CO for your matter. Don't be afraid to ask your DXO about the status of your issue. Just inform her that this is quite urgent and everything. Normally there are certain steps that they must follow before granting you stay-out, such as house visiting etc.</p>
              <p>If all fails, call the SAF HOTLINE. Or approach MP, you don't know it might just help as elections just passed :)</p>
