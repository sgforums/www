              <p>Are you an unemployed Singaporean just trying to make it by in this crummy time. </p>
              <p>Do you stay up late at night only to enjoy the hum from your computer fan. </p>
              <p>Do you struggle to get up every morning because the sun shines in and puts you in the unemployed spotlight.</p>
              <p>Does your cell phone ring only to reveal a foreign voice trying to sell you Wine Futures, Yoga Membership or yet another Credit Line you really don't want anything to do with?</p>
              <p>Do you sigh a relief on Friday because the rest of working Singapore also has a reason to wind down like you?</p>
              <p>Does the local newspapers just make you want to puke with disgust about yet more bad news and retrenchments and belt tightening? </p>
              <p>Why is it when you look through and apply for ads through head hunters you never get picked or shortlisted?  Most don't even bother to reply.</p>
              <p>How come there are so many postings for the same job spec and no mention of the company?</p>
              <p>Everyone seems to be a headhunter today and they are mostly expatriate as well...are we missing something?</p>
              <p>Why does it seem I am still out of a job even though I have a just as good a degree and probably worked for more years and worked harder than most visitors who will come and go?</p>
              <p>How come there is a distinction between Expat Condo and HDB Upgrader Condo, what is the difference? (in case you did not know, 99 year condo's are the later and lesser variety).</p>
              <p>Like you I wonder everyday for the last 5 months now.  If there is anyone out there feeling just a little miffed, do tell.</p>

              <p>Dear Master,</p>
              <p>Agree with you and am still trying.</p>
              <p>Since the first month I got put out I sent out 2300 job applications.  800 were for advertised positions, the rest unsolicited.  All sent to the CEO or MD.</p>
              <p>I have only hired a professional CV writer from UK to edit my already 4 times  previously edited CV and Executive Bio, by so called professionals here.</p>
              <p>I have been invited to only 5 interviews in 5 months.  My credentials, are better than most Ang Moh's (by the way I am in that pay bracket where I compete with them head on, GM level and above).</p>
              <p>Appreciate your perspective but what I am really saying is that I think the headhunters in this town are really not worth their salt.  They would not know talent if it landed on their heads.  They all are looking for that perfect fit.  Just imagine if the CEO of INSEAD SINGAPORE (who does not have an MBA or experience in education business) was headhunted and placed by Singapore style criteria.</p>

              <p>"I just got back from a month long stint in the States,
                                      specifically LA, SF and Vegas and although its tough, no body even
                                      hints or brings up the "R" word."</p>
              <p>Really? Things seem pretty bleak to me here in the US. Just visit the finance.yahoo.com or cnn.money.com websites, and you hear gloom and doom about the housing and banking industries every single day.</p>
              <p>I was in a hugely popular restaurant in San Jose recently, and the wait used to be an hour for lunch, but it was only half full. Many retail places, especially shopping malls, are quiet. You pass many a strip mall nowadays and see many stores closed.</p>
              <p>Car dealerships are even advertising that you can return a newly purchased car if you loose your job, or they make your car payments for up to 1 year.</p>
              <p>This is really the worst I've seen in a long time. They're calling it the "Great Recession" in the media now. Hey, at least Singapore was profiled in TIME magazine this week, albeit as one of the worst hit economies in the world...</p>

              <p>Dear Master,</p>
              <p>Agree with you and am still trying.</p>
              <p>Since the first month I got put out I sent out 2300 job applications.  800 were for advertised positions, the rest unsolicited.  All sent to the CEO or MD.</p>
              <p>I have only hired a professional CV writer from UK to edit my already 4 times  previously edited CV and Executive Bio, by so called professionals here.</p>
              <p>I have been invited to only 5 interviews in 5 months.  My credentials, are better than most Ang Moh's (by the way I am in that pay bracket where I compete with them head on, GM level and above).</p>
              <p>Appreciate your perspective but what I am really saying is that I think the headhunters in this town are really not worth their salt.  They would not know talent if it landed on their heads.  They all are looking for that perfect fit.  Just imagine if the CEO of INSEAD SINGAPORE (who does not have an MBA or experience in education business) was headhunted and placed by Singapore style criteria.</p>

              <p>2300 Applications is huge. Always thought sending customized applications will be better. Used to blast in the past, got lousy companies, lousy offers. Got better if i offered a better more well thought through resume for each single company</p>

              <p>In a time like this, I wondered how many unemployed went to apply for jobs that require lower education qualifications and with lower salary, for example you are a polytechnic diploma holder, have you applied or will you apply for jobs that require only O level or even N level holders? Is it true by this way, the chance of getting a job will be higher?</p>
