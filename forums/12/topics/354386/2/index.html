              <p>Seriously 2300 applications? This looks like spam to me. Are you sure your
                  applications didn't finish in the junk mail box?</p>
              <p>If you're such a high profile, why do you still use the same job hunting
                  technique than new graduate looking for an intership or a first job? It’s just
                  make you look like you just don’t care of the company, you just need money, and
                  you’re desperate.</p>
              <p>If you’re not happy with headhunters, then do it yourself. Go networking, make
                  yourself visible on the internet with your own website/ pro blog. And if
                  nothing works, then use the money you probably put aside thx to previous high
                  paid job to create your own opportunity and your own business. Why don’t you
                  create your own head hunting agency as it looks you have a good inside view of
                  the business.</p>
              <p>And last, please cut the Ang Mo crap. This kind of attitude won’t help you
                  to secure a management job… Tell you what, next time you send a resume, why don’t
                  you send another one with quite similar experience and diplomas but using a
                  Western name? This way you’ll see if they really discriminate you.</p>

              <p>Hey look, you sound bright and I yes you have some points which make good sense and I will take in stride...I will make use of them, thanks and its appreciated.</p>
              <p>...but on your last point I do have a FULLY ANG MOH name sorry to say.  So actually I fair much better than alot of my other Chinese Named Contemporaries who didnt even get the interviews or any phone calls of enquiry.....</p>
              <p>And yes they are always suprised when me an Asian shows up in the conference room.  On the ones I include a CV I get no interview, but the ones that have my Exec Bio I sometimes get an enquiry and the rare interview.  you know why....because my cv reveals I did NS.</p>
              <p>Look there was one joker who actually wasted a full hour of my time telling me why and out of curiosity I Googled him and guess what, that Ang Moh has all of 5 years working experience in his entire life.  and on checking his degree he had graduated in english literature and history.  Talk about crap...what relevance could that bring to the table in dealing with long enough standing individuals..  Isolated you may probably say....but shocking when it comes form a supposedly leading consultancy would you say.</p>
              <p>Setting up a search firm is precisely what every other recently unemployed is doing and its making rubbish out of the system and thats creating more problems.</p>
              <p>Let me point out what is happening with search slum dogs these days.  they see one company advertise then they all jump on the band wagon run their own ads and without saying which company its from and then get a 200 or so responses then go to the company with a short list of say 12.  I know this for a fact, a PERSONAL CONTACT revealed this to me after he wanted me to work as a search professional with him also.</p>

              <p>Very well written, hits the note I'm feeling now. It's been 2 months since I got laid-off, and indeed, the sun is not a welcomed sight in the morning. Sometimes I go to bed at 4-5am in the morning and groan to wake up at 3pm in the afternoon.</p>
              <p>Depression is vicious, nightmares, stress, personal relationships crumbles, on top of that, my friends abandoned me (or I abandoned them depends on the perspectives).</p>
              <p>I used to be an architect, now I'm seeking any openings, including insurance sales. I even took military test to see what's it like to join the ARMY, the 2 year contract and super low pay and the possibilty of getting shipped to Iraq/ Afgan quickly made me snap out of it.</p>
              <p>That, plus during my test session, another guy was so eager to join the ARMY, I only found out later, he has a death wish...</p>
              <p>What happened to the bright future my degree promised me... 10 years of solid academia and 100k USD in debt has yeilded nothing.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Dear Noodle Eater and everyone else fresh grad, old grad, no grad or even post grad in prog like me at the at an old age of 46. </p>
              <p>I have decided one thing, its you who makes the job, not the other way around. We in Singapore have been brought up to only know how to describe ourselves through our jobs.  Not many have been able to express themselves beyond this.  (mind you this is not a critism, I am just as guilty ok).</p>
              <p>Its not ones degree or non degree or job title that makes you a person of character.  These are just titles and thats all they are.</p>
              <p> I am painfully discovering that I am me, not because of all the other things or titles or because of my job or past jobs or career status.  My existance is not because the title on my name card.  That is not life ... surely it has to do with the content of ones character.</p>
              <p>That has to be the true measure of the individual.  Alot of people when they meet someone new for the first time can't help but ask what they do for work.  Its such a Singaporean thing ... or at least I am told.</p>
              <p>....its just that...its what one does for work...its not the reason for ones existance and if one feels that way please please try not to get too demoralized.</p>
              <p>I know I struggle daily...for now I seem ok, but when I awake tomorrow it may all come back again!  But it helps to know that some of you in this post have been quite helpful if not by method at least in compassion....its appreciated from your fellow mate who like the rest sometimes don't quite feel like going out for dinner with the family or to meet friends these days.  Because there seems nothing to celebrate, this cant be true.</p>
              <p>...Thanks mates.</p>

              <p>Maeren you need to learn how to edit a post without duplicating it...</p>
              <p>Anyway, physical letters are almost as bad as spam. Most of it is not open by the CEO himself, it will be screened by the secretary.</p>
              <p>BTW you totally miss my point about Ang Moh. But i think i didn't make it clear. I'm new in Singapore and there's a lot of lingo i really don't understand (like NS, what's that?). I had to search for a definition of Ang Moh, and wikipedia didn't give me nice answer. So please stop using offensive words, being unemployed and rejected after so many application maybe make you bitter, but this is not an excuse. Besides, do you really want to work in a company that think smartness and efficiency is based on the color of your skin?</p>
              <p>if nobody wants to employ you, than be your own boss. If you earned so much money, and at your age, you probably still have a good load of it. Use it, make your own business. There's a lot of opportunity around, specially on the internet.</p>
