              <p>You don't use derogatory names to talk to people, and neither did we at all.</p>
              <p>And if you are really not a clone, please go back. Your kind of attitude will not bring you anywhere, nor will you be accepted anywhere in Singapore. A foreigner comes here, he/she will play by the rules here. Cannot play by the rules, too bad. Go back.</p>
              <p>And if any of us cultured Singaporeans go to any other country, and find that we are not able to accept what they call us or play by their rules, same thing. We come back. It's a duh.</p>

              <p>We have treated you as a guest; we educated you about the culture here, and the cultural explanations of the language and terms used. But no, you appeared to be unable to take it in your stride, but instead, criticised it. Is that in your country's culture? To criticise your host as a guest? And in this case, the culture of your host?</p>
              <p>I wouldn't know about you, but Singaporeans practice cultural and religion tolerance, giving rise to a multi-cultural, multi-religion society. Seems like you aren't able to accept it.</p>

              <p>'Ang moh' is actually spoken with endearment and not with derision. You should be glad others call you an ang moh. It is symbolic with being wealthy, holding a stable career, a big spender and very liberal in attitude.</p>
              <p>So much so that ridiculous singaporean women believes such myths and hero worships fair skin blue eyed boys, disregarding the real Singaporean males whom looks on with much amusement as they cherish their more intelligent and sensible womenfolk or foreign kind. Regardless of your skin color, we are all the same, but such myths still prepertrates, a hangover from our colonnial days on the superiority of the white race, whom built their civilisations upon the backs and heads of non-white skin asians.</p>
              <p>BUT all that is past, for no one can exist on historical baggage, more so on the descendants of such imperialist and cruel white men or japanese torturers, as we seek to build a new world free from all kinds of discrimination, as you can see in Singapore - people of all races with one common goal - to survive for themselves and their next generations.</p>
              <p>I personally bid you a warm welcome, and would address you by your real name if you should provide, to our shores and may you contribute to our growth and our society in a meaningful way, instead of being overly sensitive which will only inhibit your own personal development. </p>

              <p>@Eagle: there's no point telling you my home country, so i won't indulge you. I don't you want to start a new stereotype based only on what i said...<br>What on say on my guest/host example doesn't apply. Your other examples don't apply. I'm losing my time with you.</p>
              <p>@All</p>
              <p>To make it short, I'll be please if nobody call me Ang Moh, because i don't like it. Even if you grand father used it all the time, if you think it's a cute name, and i should be glad i'm called like this, or you think i'm stupid. Just don't use it, for the reason il already described. This is a cultural difference, you don't see anything wrong about it, 90% of western people will think different. In the west using this kind of stereotyped name is seen as racism. and you may face serious argument leading to violence if used in the bad place.. I'm not accusing anyone, i'm just telling you guys and I understand it's different here. Maybe it's better to live in a country like Singapore where nobody cares of what other people call you by, but it's really difficult for me, regarding my education, and the place i grown up, to understand that. I was thaught that refering to people using stereotype is really rude. I'm not into the whole typical political correctness concept like "vertically challenged" instead of "small", but I'm trying to not make an opinion on people, just based on how they look like and where they coming from. That's why Ang Moh sounds rude to me.</p>
              <p>But i wonder if everybody in Singapore think like you. I'd like to have the opinon of other local and other foreigners like Indian, African, Caucasian. I think i'm gonna start a new thread to discuss about that. With a better suitable subject we could gather more opinion.</p>
              <p>BTW: I ws wondering if my nickname was a problem? I realized that with this subject, it could be taken bad. It's a really old joke, maybe i should have take somethng more neutral. It maybe make me look like a arrogant dude who want to rule you all.</p>

              <p>To make it short, I'll be please if nobody call me Ang Moh,
                          because i don't like it. Even if you grand father used it all the
                          time, if you think it's a cute name, and i should be glad i'm
                          called like this, or you think i'm stupid. Just don't use it, for
                          the reason il already described. This is a cultural difference, you
                          don't see anything wrong about it, 90% of western people will think
                          different. In the west using this kind of stereotyped name is seen
                          as racism. and you may face serious argument leading to violence if
                          used in the bad place.. I'm not accusing anyone, i'm just telling
                          you guys and I understand it's different here. Maybe it's better to
                          live in a country like Singapore where nobody cares of what other
                          people call you by, but it's really difficult for me, regarding my

                          thaught that refering to people using stereotype is really rude.
                          I'm not into the whole typical politcally correct concept like
                          "vertically challenged" instead of "small", but I'm trying to not

              <p>But i wonder if everybody think like you. I'd like to have the

              <p>BTW: I ws wondering if my nickname was a problem? I realized
                          that with this subject, it could be taken bad. It's a really old

              <p>As I have already said, if because of cultural difference that Ang Moh is derogatory in your country, then it will be extremely dumb of us to use it in your country.</p>
              <p>But because of the same cultural difference that it is not in Singapore, it is extremely dumb and rude of you to criticise it.</p>
              <p>As xtreyier has put it:</p>
              <p>'Ang moh' is actually spoken with endearment and not with
                                                  derision. You should be glad others call you an ang moh. It is
                                                  symbolic with being wealthy, holding a stable career, a big spender
                                                  and very liberal in attitude.</p>
              <p>Just like in Western countries, they regard all Asians as well, Asians. Not Singaporeans, not Japanese, etc. Or some even regard the Chinese race in Singaporeans as Chinese from China. There are a number here who take offence at that, so how?</p>
              <p>Lastly, "ang moh" is not even Mandarin or English. It is a dialect. What you have done is tantamount to criticising another culture's dialect/language. Are you trying to breed racism and sow discord between caucasians/eurasians who accepted the culture and Singaporeans? I hope you are not.</p>

              <p>Well, in the US, Africans are refered to as Blacks. Would Africans find it racist?</p>

              <p>Problem is, he made that stereotype on himself, and now he's putting the blame on us.</p>
              <p>Worse still on his credibility, he can't bring himself to tell us his home country. If he was so sure all his countrymen would agree with him, I don't see anything wrong with stating it. Furthermore, it would educate us which countries would find it offensive, and when people from these countries come over, we would not use it as freely in front of them.</p>

              <p>i'm not ashamed of my country. I love it, even if i'm away from it for personal and profesional reason. What i don't want is you changing the subject by finding bad stuff to say about my country, because this is not the point. You see a man jumping from a bridge. You follow him? Meaning just because some people do stupid stuff around doesn't mean that it's ok to be stupid yourself. So talking about other country using derogatory name is just not what i'm interested here, i don't want to talk about it, because there's nothing we can do. You say some foreigners from the west don't make difference between Asian people wether they are Chinese Malays or Japanese? It's true! This is a lack of education, and I can't help making a remark when they do it in front of me. Fortunatly things are changing.</p>
              <p>Guest/host example. If the host call me "Ang Mo" i will ask him not to do it. Other you said about it don't apply. Did i came here and say "hey Sg like Durian, but it stinks, stop doing it!" ? No i didn't. I react to someone using Ang Mo in bitter way.</p>
              <p>Don't put words in my mouth. I just say i don't like being called Ang Mo, i never said anything about Hokkien culture. There's probably better word to describe caucasian than Ang Mo in Hokkien. I think you're the one trying to make a troll of this thread...</p>
              <p>seyKai, you talk of Ang Mo Kio. This is what i've found about it:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The locality's name is believed by some to derive from the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Minnan (linguistics)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnan_%28linguistics%29">Hokkien</a> phrase <em>Ang Mo Kio</em> (çº¢æ¯›æ¡¥), meaning "Westerner Bridge". The term <em><a class="mw-redirect" title="Ang mo" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ang_mo">ang mo</a></em> (literally "red hair") is a somewhat derogatory <a title="Hokkien" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkien">Hokkien</a> reference to the people with fair hair who settled from the West and,
                  because such a name might be considered unflattering, it is now written
                  as å®�èŒ‚æ¡¥ which is pronounced in an almost identical way but means "Bridge
                  of Expansiveness and Prosperity"</p>
              </blockquote><blockquote>
              <p>The words 'Ang Mo Kio' mean 'red-haired man's <a title="Bridge" href="http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/Bridge">bridge</a>'

                  occupants of <strong><a title="Ang Mio Kio" href="http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/Ang_Mio_Kio">Ang Mo Kio</a></strong> New Town. The <a title="Bridge" href="http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/Bridge">bridge</a> refers to one or two bridges** located in the area during Singapore's
                  era under colonial rule. It was the British who apparently built these
                  bridges during the bygone colonial days. When Ang Mo Kio was
                  transformed from a forested kampong into an HDB-flatted new town in the
                  1970s, the authorities decided to keep the phonetics of the name 'Ang
                  Mo Kio', but altered the Chinese characters slightly, so that it would
                  read 'large and prosperous <a title="Bridge" href="http://www.sgwiki.com/wiki/Bridge">bridge</a>', instead of 'red-haired man's bridge</p>

              their skin colour, their hair colour, or by calling them ghosts.</p>

              <p><br>In my experience, I have been called all three of these names many
              times. If a friend or colleague refers to me in any of these ways, it
              is often with affection or without malice and therefore I take
              absolutely no offense. <strong>However, as with any 'name calling', any of
              these terms can be used in a derogetory manner</strong> - which I have also been
              exposed to. No country is without some level of racial divide or
              downright racism, but I have found these people to be the minority in
              this era of globalization. In this instance, I just feel sorry for the
              person offering the racial taunt, as it suggests an ignorance that may
              never be resolved, no matter how much education.<br><br>I also
              understand the cultural divide here - what is acceptable in one
              country, may not be in another. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>It is my choice to live and work in a
              foreign country, and must therefore learn to live with the differences
              and respect the cultures for what they are </strong></span>- I cannot personally try
              and change centuries of tradition and beliefs in another country, just
              because I was raised differently by my parents.</p>

              <p>I just feel sorry for you, that no matter how much info and cultural information is provided to you, you just cannot resolve within yourself. It's clear that you cannot respect the culture and language here.</p>
