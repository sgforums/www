              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Integration is a very visible aspect of Singapore.<span>  </span>So, its not wise to be too sensitive about slang or local cockney associated with words such as Ang Moh, Mat Salleh, Orr Ew, Keling, Gwelingko and such, it is not used with intention to be derogatory. If anything our history has been shown to be one of inclusion.  Heck most of the minorities laugh at and even give back to the rest so its been ok all this while.</span></p>

                      totally out of the subject… But I’m going to indulge you an answer, as it’s
                      probably too late for the topic after your 4 posts anyway.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> I'm very happy
                      being here: i enjoy the food, i enjoy the climate, i enjoy the general
                      kindness of the people and the security the country offers. I really
                      respect Singapore
                      society, which to me look very modern and harmonious when we talk about the
                      different communities who seems to live peacefully all together. It’s really
                      impressive, and lessons should be learned around the word, specially in Europe
                      and USA.
                      I don’t know if it’s working because it’s a micro state or because of something
                      else, but still it’s impressive. As I sa</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">id I’m new here, and don’t know a lot
                      of people, and I’m maybe wrong about what I've said, and there’s maybe a lot of problem than i think, even if I read Singapore
                      newspaper everyday.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> Anyway,
                      what I don’t like, but observe a lot, is that a common answer to foreigner’s
                      criticism about Singapore
                      is “if you don’t like it leave it, you fool!!!” I dare to say it’s an extremist
                      way of reaction. Like every other society, you can’t say that 100% of
                      Singaporean society is good, and nothing could be changed to make it better. That
                      would be very presumptuous, and very stupid. And using derogatory names to
                      refer to other people is one of the things that could be amended. You think
                      calling Caucasian “red haired” or “read haired devil” is ok? But how would you
                      react in those foreigners talent/devils call you “yellow face” of “yellow dwarf”
                      in your face because this is the way they used to do few centuries ago in their
                      culture? I bet you wouldn’t be happy… Because you’re not that small, and your
                      skin is not yellow, actually some women here have a very white skin. And I don’t
                      have red hair. Then why using these kind of name? Do you call black people “nigger”?
                      Because I hope you realize this is exactly the same... </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> Showing
                      respect to people around you is the basic of living in a community. So show
                      respect to people around you, and they will keep on showing you respect as
                      well.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"> You said</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;"><span> </span>“Do not be so presumptuous to flippantly offer
                      your unfettered comments about how a Singaporean should react to and deal with
                      his or her current employment position set against the current economic
                      backdrop” </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">This is totally
                      ridiculous. This is a public forum, and I gave my comment on Maeren public
                      topic. He looks in depression, and I gave him advices, trying to give him ideas
                      that could be helpful for him. This kind of stuff is the very aim of a forum, I
                      was totally in the topic, unlike you. This is solidarity; this is what people
                      of the same community will do for each other. If you choose to take it on the
                      wrong side, it’s your mistake. </span></p>

              <p>Dear Noodle Eater and everyone else fresh grad, old grad, no grad or even post grad in prog like me at the at an old age of 46. </p>
              <p>I have decided one thing, its you who makes the job, not the other way around. We in Singapore have been brought up to only know how to describe ourselves through our jobs.  Not many have been able to express themselves beyond this.  (mind you this is not a critism, I am just as guilty ok).</p>
              <p>Its not ones degree or non degree or job title that makes you a person of character.  These are just titles and thats all they are.</p>
              <p> I am painfully discovering that I am me, not because of all the other things or titles or because of my job or past jobs or career status.  My existance is not because the title on my name card.  That is not life ... surely it has to do with the content of ones character.</p>
              <p>That has to be the true measure of the individual.  Alot of people when they meet someone new for the first time can't help but ask what they do for work.  Its such a Singaporean thing ... or at least I am told.</p>
              <p>....its just that...its what one does for work...its not the reason for ones existance and if one feels that way please please try not to get too demoralized.</p>
              <p>I know I struggle daily...for now I seem ok, but when I awake tomorrow it may all come back again!  But it helps to know that some of you in this post have been quite helpful if not by method at least in compassion....its appreciated from your fellow mate who like the rest sometimes don't quite feel like going out for dinner with the family or to meet friends these days.  Because there seems nothing to celebrate, this cant be true.</p>
              <p>...Thanks mates.</p>

              <p>Hey noodel-eater, thanks for the read from the good book. </p>
              <p>I can well appreciate the good word.  It got me digging around for a King James I have at home too.</p>
              <p>I am a Buddhist but that does not mean I cannot see Good.  You know I have decided not to respond anymore after seeing alot of careless comments probably coming from people who live with assurance that the months salary will be credited into the account.</p>
              <p>Last month we let our domestic helper of 4 years go just so we could make ends meet a little better.  I look after the two kids now, wash, iron and cook whilst my wife goes to work and doesn't get home till 10 pm each evening as she works two shifts to take in just a bit more.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Ok C96223</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">, you’re totally out of the subject… But I’m going to indulge you an answer, as it’s probably too late for the topic after your 4 posts anyway.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> I'm very happy being here: i enjoy the food, i enjoy the climate, i enjoy the general kindness of the people and the security the country offers. I really respect Singapore society, which to me look very modern and harmonious when we talk about the different communities who seems to live peacefully all together. It’s really impressive, and lessons should be learned around the word, specially in Europe and USA. I don’t know if it’s working because it’s a micro state or because of something else, but still it’s impressive. As I sa</span><span style="font-family: Arial;">id I’m new here, and don’t know a lot of people, and I’m maybe wrong about what I've said, and there’s maybe a lot of problem than i think, even if I read Singapore newspaper everyday.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> Anyway, what I don’t like, but observe a lot, is that a common answer to foreigner’s criticism about Singapore is “if you don’t like it leave it, you fool!!!” I dare to say it’s an extremist way of reaction. Like every other society, you can’t say that 100% of Singaporean society is good, and nothing could be changed to make it better. That would be very presumptuous, and very stupid. And using derogatory names to refer to other people is one of the things that could be amended. You think calling Caucasian “red haired” or “read haired devil” is ok? But how would you react in those foreigners talent/devils call you “yellow face” of “yellow dwarf” in your face because this is the way they used to do few centuries ago in their culture? I bet you wouldn’t be happy… Because you’re not that small, and your skin is not yellow, actually some women here have a very white skin. And I don’t have red hair. Then why using these kind of name? Do you call black people “nigger”? Because I hope you realize this is exactly the same...</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> Showing respect to people around you is the basic of living in a community. So show respect to people around you, and they will keep on showing you respect as well.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"> You said</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span> </span>“Do not be so presumptuous to flippantly offer your unfettered comments about how a Singaporean should react to and deal with his or her current employment position set against the current economic backdrop”</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">This is totally ridiculous. This is a public forum, and I gave my comment on Maeren public topic. He looks in depression, and I gave him advices, trying to give him ideas that could be helpful for him. This kind of stuff is the very aim of a forum, I was totally in the topic, unlike you. This is solidarity; this is what people of the same community will do for each other. If you choose to take it on the wrong side, it’s your mistake.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">while the term "ang mo" itself was derogatory, the usage and meaning nowadays isn't, it's used to imply white people or things associated with them like "angmo pai" for people who are more into western culture. the usage has evolved since "white red haired devils" first appeared in the far east.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">and we don't call black people niggers because thats a term you use in the west, not here.<br></span></p>

              <p>I can well appreciate the good word.  It got me digging
              around for a King James I have at home too.</p>
              <p>I am a Buddhist but that does not mean I cannot see Good. 
              You know I have decided not to respond anymore after seeing alot of

              assurance that the months salary will be credited into the
              account.</p>
              <p>Last month we let our domestic helper of 4 years go
              just so we could make ends meet a little better.  I look after
              the two kids now, wash, iron and cook whilst my wife goes to work
              and doesn't get home till 10 pm each evening as she works
              two shifts to take in just a bit more.</p>
              <p>I put off the thought of sending my elder for Mandarin Tuition
              its an expense that can wait.  Same go for her speech and
              drama classes as well.  Yesterday evening at Shop n Save was a
              real shocker for me as I punched in my NETS only to have it
              rejected and I took the last $50 from my wallet as I lugged home
              the 10kg sack of rice and 36 pack Pampers my one year old strapped
              to me and my 5 year old holding my hand as we walked back. 
              Don't get me wrong but I have got very strict with the monthly
              expenditures lately so that we can wheather the strom.</p>
              <p>I went to the income tax department today to ask if there could
              be any rebates that I might have missed out and also make
              arrangements for an extended repayment scheme.  And also had
              to make changes to the CPF payouts for our home so that we could
              maximize our cash in hand.</p>
              <p>Budgetting is now going through a new and thougher phase, 6

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Sometime, it’s probably right to say it. But I don’t think in our case it’s the best reaction. One should try to think and find if it was legitimate before cutting all debate with “take it or leave it”.<br>Besides, the fact that people use derogatory words in a casual way doesn’t make them ok. Go back 200 years, Caucasian called Asian with a lot of derogatory words, in a casual way. Was it right? You maybe feel it’s ok to use Ang Moh in everyday life, but if Caucasian find it uncomfortable, why do you go on and say it’s ok? <br><br>You see a man jumping from a bridge.

              <p>In Singapore, we use the term Ang Mo freely. Nothing wrong. <br>But if we go to other countries where this term is regarded as derogatory, then it is dumb and offensive if we use it there.</p>
              <p>But of course, if pple use it in front of you, and you feel uncomfortable, state it out. There's no obligation for them to stop using it, but most people are cultured enough not to use the term in front of you again.</p>
              <p>Then again, if you want to go on and criticise the culture and language of others, you are inviting flames and criticism to yourself. And that's rather dumb in my opinion.</p>

              <p>Hi everyone, I'm a fresh graduate looking for job with little success. Honestly, the feeling sucks but it is comforting to have a common ground where we can all gain strength on. Lets be positive and I'm sure we'll all find what we want in time to come.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To MyLord_L:</p>
              <p>Please do not be discourage by the <span style="font-family: Arial;">cultural difference. This is something that will take time to change but perharps not at the speed you wish. For example, few years ago</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> if you ask someone to stand at the left side of the escalator for the right side to be mobile, people will think you are crazy. Today it'd be crazy to stand on the right side. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To my fellow Singaporean:</p>
              <p>Our language style sometimes makes a conversation easier for us but for someone new it's very hard to understand and they may feel "divided". It's like if we're in some other countries and they call us funny names...it's hard to take right? How about we all forget about things and names that some may or may not understand and stick to the topic that we can all understand and share.</p>

              <p>thing is most people here don't find it derogatory, you get that problem only when an angmo comes here.  we don't think its ok as long as no one complains, we think its ok even if someone complains. we just stop saying it in front of you to avoid offending you and think you're a dick at the same time if you're the one to claim offence.</p>
              <p>culturally singaporeans do believe in being good hosts to guests but there isn't a point in claiming we should be good hosts to our "guests" since guest means invited and the ones complaining probably aren't the ones who did the inviting and are unlikely to think of you as a "guest"</p>
