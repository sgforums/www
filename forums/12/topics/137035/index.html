To leave her for another woman. A keeps on saying if N is not a liar, she will lost this relationship forever. I understand that. But i was confussed.

How the soul and the mind sees things, are way two different sources. If this experience cannot allow you to learn this lesson, you could be 'losing' more than you ought to.<br><br>Generally what happens to A is similar; she probably still loves you, however the bitterness temporary overcome her and cause her to rake the past and seal doom into the relationship. The conflicts between the heart and mind, with one side saying 'I love him' and the other saying 'He's a jerk.'<br><br>P.S: You made your choice, you lived with them. What you learn from your mistake will benefit your future relationship for what's not yours, will never be. Express love through the heart, not the mind: You can't tell yourself to treat her better just because you 'think' she is a nice girl - you will come to realise in the future that it wouldn't work this way. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
