            <div class='col-md body'>I am 164cm at 18. Not much hope for me to grow anyway.<br><br>Your issue is not so much so as an external issue which can be solved medically. Rather this whole issue about your height is really all about how you chose to handle your vertical challenge. I won't bother giving any medical advice because I think it will not cure your root problem, that is the chronic lack of self-confidence due to a lack of height. In your mind, you seem to equate social standing with height. To you, no height = no social standing = no face.<br><br>Yes height is undoubtedly a social issue. People tend to judge you based on that, but hey people tend to judge you on your superficial looks as well, right?<br><br>There's no point moping about your vertically challenged physique. So what if you are short? What matters is how you work around the obstacles you have.<br><br>Be confident about yourself. For example, if people misjudge your age, think it as you looking younger than your age (which can't be all bad in society. after all who doesn't want to look young?).<br><br>The worst kind of losers are not those who are short, but rather those who are short and continue to use the lack of height as an excuse to whine and mope further.<br><br>Come on brother, just present a confident front. It does not matter if people suan you for your height. Take it as it comes. From time to time, do retort it with a witty remark as appropriate and you may find your companions and even yourself laughing it off. Also, you may seem to be even more 'outstanding' in a sense. A stranger (or a stranger girl if you like to be optimistic) looking at your clique may tend to notice you first compared to others.<br><br>I used to whine and mope and thoroughly lack self-confidence in secondary school because of my height. However, my form teacher, even though I hate her, told me that as long as you present yourself confidently, height is definitely not a big issue. She told me two of her friend who are also vertically challenged males. One was self-confident and has a wide social circle. The other refused to do anything because he suffered from a chronic lack of confidence due to his height and he is just a whiny b1tch whom people shun.<br><br>Choose which one you want to be. I, compared to others here, can emphatise with your situation. I chose to be like the first person my teacher described. What about you?<br><br>Think it over, brother. Height is sometimes so insignificant an issue that years later, you look back and wonder why you were so caught up with it that you neglected other stuffs around you.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

However her height did not allow her to become one. So out of her deep passion, she decided to endure the painful treatment and recovery to attain her required height. If she just believed that she's more fortunate than those with growth abnormalities (ard 120cm tall), Would she have gone to that great extent just to grow a few cm taller ?
