But I guess in my own opinion, I can't really agree with you....<br><br>Instead being busy with trying to judge the 'value' of your friends, you could be doing better just by appreciating them.... Think they're making too much use of you and not sincere at all? Well, you've always got the rights to choose....? To help, or not to help? Choice is YOURS....<br><br>And by judging them, the people around you could be asking this question... "Why is this friend of mine judging me like this? Value for friend? Is he/she a friend indeed...? Why is he/she avoiding me just because I want more help from him/her...?"<br><br>Go THINK about it.... Your life is yours to build and your friends are yours to search for....<br><br>As for myself... I know acquaintance... People who I'm not very close to.... I have friends.... Buddies.... People who I hardly know them.... If helping them is EASY, doesn't harm or affect others (much) and they deserves it.... Most probably I would...? Are they <span style="font-style: italic;">really my friends...?</span> I guess maybe not? Perhaps they might choose not to return me this favour the next time round or even backstabs me..... But the FACT is I've decided to help them THIS TIME ROUND.... All else doesn't really matter... Anyway, I can't really predict the future....?<br><br>And people who HELP me though we're just <span style="font-style: italic;">strangers...</span> So strange..? Do you consider them my friends....?<br><br>And I'm TOTALLY INDEBTED to my BUDDIES.... I don't TRUST them.... Because I DON'T have to.... I think TRUST don't exist between us because DOUBT don't exist too.... I've not done them much favor and they never really hesitate me help me TIME and OVER AGAIN.... The only hesitations they had would be that I'm making the correct decisions and that everything would be alright for me.... And their worries... That I would keep the burden to myself....<br><br>IF I ever TURN AROUND I'll REWARD them KINDLY as a BUDDY... And this I DARE SWEAR.....<br><br>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT. FOR what I AM is CUT so DEEP inside of ME.<br>I LIVE my FLESH and SOUL ONLY to BLEED for the OTHERS.<br>FEAR ME NOT. FOR I AM YOUR 'MASTER'. GIVE YOU STRENGTH. FOR YOU ARE MY 'ENEMY'.<br>DEVIL PHRASE I<br><br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....  DEVIL PHRASE II<br><br>Though NOT the RIGHT thing to do,<br>This might be the ONLY NATURAL thing to be...<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Just like heat</span> is produced when work done...<br><span style="font-style: italic;">EVIL</span> is the GENERATION of SYSTEM FLAWS... <strong>DEVIL PHRASE III</strong><br><br>In DREAMS you CAN NEVER DIE.....<br>For YOUR LIFE is about the EXISTENCE of....<br>Your Happiness.... Your Sadness... Your Pain.... Your Pleasure....<br>Like a painted sky, when it rains... All CEASE to BE...
