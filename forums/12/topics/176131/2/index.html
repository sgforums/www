We both sort of liked each other, and have been going out regularly. Although we're not official a couple, due to various reasons.

To me it seems to suggest that she is not really interested in u. If she's truly interested in u, she will definitely be committed to u.<br><br>then u say she always find fault with u... if that suggests anything it can also mean she is not interested in u. Gals who are interested in u will try not to find fault with u. ie they will respect u.<br><br>Ya u were wrong when u did not go all the way with her. If u had, she would have been ur gf.<br><br>There are gals who can be so nice to u and yet not interested in u.<br><br>It seems to me it's better to avoid this gal. She's not worth it. There are better ones out there. After throwin tantrums at u and tellin u her friend wanted to screw her do u think u shd continue to pursue her?? She is tryin to tell u to get lost.</div>

Regardless, she is probably a Siren (AOS), so if you are inexperienced in handling such characters... I don't advocate you trying her out, especially if you are looking for serious relationship without complication.<br><br>She has shown some blatant aversion to commitment. It doesn't matter what actually happened; what matters is the ideology she is equipped now. When we talked about the inability to commit but has the ability to be intimate... this actually revealed an insidious truth about her current self - you probably hold no chance and even if you did, you merely fulfill a certain need that is visibly lacking in her emotional structure.<br><br>She is a Predator; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]a woman indulged in mercy sex</span></strong>. The roles are exchanged and you felt the pressure of her being on the dominating side. It stultified your masculine position and you wonder how should you react when she come aggressive.<br><br>IMHO, you are spell-bounded by her well crafted seduction spell. I don't know you personally... I also cannot say that you are in love for sure and I believe that you won't know the answer as well. Your coming tracks are perilous; you are not trained to handle them. You can ignore me and press on, but I am quite sure you won't survive this game ultimately (because my impression of you is a good person. Don't ask me why...
