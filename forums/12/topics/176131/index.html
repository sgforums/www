Is it her looks or physical appearance? And how much do you know about her? From what i read, she may not suit you. She could be someone who had a fanastic record of number of exs, but thats just my assumption...<br><br>Although she may be testing you on the sex part, i still think a decent girl would never let her friend do it with her, no matter how close...<br><br>If you two really want to have a future with each other, i think u two must sit down and talk it over. If she understands your plight (in NS), then if she is an understanding girl, she will accept that you cant call her every night. If not, i think the problem doesn't lie in you already....<br><br>From what i think, she just needs a companion to talk and to accompany her...Worst still, she wants a s** partner...I apologise if i offend you or her in any way, but its just what i think....<br><br>Good luck!</div>
