Your mum is smart enough to use this method becos she knows that you still value face and still care for her feelings. Thats is why you are feeling the full effect of this underhand method.<br><br>Got a few methods counter this SOP so is up to you to chose which one.<br><br>1) Ignore mum since you and her did not do anything wrong why worry about what people say?<br><br>2) bring a guy to your house and start touching us butt in front of your mum.<br><br>3) kiss her more and hug her more in order to show that you do not care a darn what your mum say.<br><br>4) tell the girl not to meet you for a certain time period.<br><br>5) find a good gf younger gf and bring home to your mum.<br><br>6) find a bad gf and sent her to trash your mum. hehe.<br><br>7) bribe your aunts to go against your mum. some bird nest will do the trick.<br><br>8 ) start touching your mum hehe... yeah i know is insane but sometimes it works ...hehe just kidding hor.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u might think the both of u are in love, but i tell ya, in the end they almost ALWAYS go back to their husband's side. Trust me when i say i'm speaking from experience. They can say all sorts of shit like, "wait for me to get a seperation letter/divorce cert, then we can be together" KNN u know how many YEARS it takes for that to happen? Meanwhile what about you? They can cry into your arms, tell you what a b**tard their husband is....and the next thing you when you call her, her husband answers the phone. woo hoo. Don't waste your time man.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Alfresco coffeeshop:</div><div class="quote_body">I got to know this married lady but not staying with husband, 8-9 years older than me. She is 33 year old My mum suspects i having affair with her. And she goes around telling my aunts about it,,..saying thingz like "yeah he likes aunties and old hags, let him do what he wish, i dont care" I feel like disgraced and doing like something wrong to tarnish her name. But I am only frens wif her, is it wrong to be frens?<br>Why must women like mum must be so suspicious?<br>When i bring her home, she does not like to see us together. She thinks she is too old for me. This lady i met on the internet and made friens.<br><br>Have i disppointed my mum very badly?</div></blockquote>Ok...So you are sexually attracted to her...but are you emotionally attracted to her? You value her as a friend or as a "potential partner"? Physically attached or Emotionally atached?<br>You are 24~25 years old. So do you have a steady gf, still single or just broke up?<br>If you've got a gf, bring home and let your mum see. That'll shut her mouth.<br>If you are single or just broken up, are you taking this as a platonic relationship to get more friends, or just so that you can fulfil your sexual desires and not to worry much as "she is a mature adult and has her needs too".<br>And your mum...she's being over protective. Is she annoyed at the age gap (25 vs 33) or that she's 33?<br>Have you tried sitting down and talking to her? Communication is very important in ANY relationship, let it be parent/child, teacher/student or bf/gf.</div>

My father keep silent all this while as it is not his problem<br><br>But younger gals around my age 24-26 are immature so like dat how to go for them. Experience will tell u that this age group is not mature. Ahh, forget about teen gal, they are worst.Experienced them in my poly days. Sux.<br><br>this lady is mature, attractive and does not expect $. When i calls her out, she dont mind come out. pays for my food and taxi fare and send me home. doesnt mnd waiting for me to finish work. She prefer to go park sit down than that young gal who prefer to go cclubs and want u to spend money on them this kind of lady u want to find with younger age group?<br>Ahh forget the idea. young gal first look at your money then u.<br><br></div>
