            <div class='col-md body'>I would strongly suggest u forget about her, unless she chose to come with u. To me, being attached is nothing really. Either party can always choose to leave for greener pastures. But beware of the surroundings.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>She could be 2-timing, or she could have missed the detail of letting u know of her status. But if she chose to lead u on, then clearly we know what type of person she is. Give her the benefit of the doubt.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Don't be so sad. There are greener pastures out there, waiting for u to explore. Have fun!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Think becoz both of u still young.. Will rather want to try out more relationships first before settling down. Just that she use the wrong method. She just wouldn't let og of her 1st r/s becoz she is scared that if she lets go, she will not get it back if the 2nd dun work out. Or she is scared of the lonely period that comes after that.<br><br>All pple are greedy also lahz.. They want everything, and sadly, many do not haf their principles well guarded, hence rather get themselves involve in all kinds of trouble in the end. out of 10 pple who two-timed, at most 1 will get be able to get out of the situation safely wif 1 still attached to him. Most cases just fell out. Coz we the r/s grows, the usage of feelings gets lesser, and the head begins to see things clearer.<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>
