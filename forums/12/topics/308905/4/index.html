              <p><br>It is a sad thing that most girls are usually trained to be sweet, polite and not to antagonize since young. Some jerks (pardon me for calling your ex that) will see this as an opportunity to come and take advantage of nice girls like you except that <strong>they are not as obvious as the villians we see on tv dramas. They can look like normal people and may even be sweet and caring in their own ways.</strong> BUT, the only difference is that they are taking advantage of you by abusing the trust you place in them.</p>
              <p>In my personal point of view, you can still be that sweet young lady in your own rights. <strong>But the sweetest and most polite thing you can do now is to totally cut off contacts with him and not hear from him at all. </strong>Nevermind if you think he may be heartbroken (if he is <strong>sincerely</strong> heartbroken at all), cos does he think for you at all that you are disturbed by all these? Dun worry about him being angry at you, cos these are none of your fault but his doings. If he curse and swear at you, that just all the more goes to show his dark and ugly side rather than yours. You are more of a "victim" than he may proclaim himself to be.</p>

              <p><br>Think rationally on this point ger. He also must have spoken a lot of sweet nothings to his prev gf. Just that these are things he would try to hide away from you or even lie to u about. Think back on the time he was two-timing his gf and made you a third party without your knowledge.</p>

              <p>this kind of sad story again.......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>same thing with my friend except he's the guy.  wanted to patch up with his wife after having an affair but i just told him to save the effort because knowing him yeah he really regreted it now but give him another 2 months with his wife he'll start "eating outside" again.</p>
              <p>like you, the women around him are all softhearted to him, want to give him another chance but it won't work. they know deep down inside it'll never work out but they like to cling on to hope. kinda stupid isn't it? but love is blind, some women can love men who beat them and cheat their money yet cannot accept others who treat them well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>like all those who went back and hurt themselves all over again, the best advice i can offer is, if you really choose him, at least make sure you enjoy the process, and then pick yourself up again when its all over.</p>
              <p>i'm sure you'll be able to get a listening ear over here again.</p>

              <p><br>Pardon me, in my sincerest opinion, you shouldn't even be keeping touch with him at all. If it were me, I would have deleted him off my contact list.</p>
              <p>The tactics I see him pulling, do not even deem him worthy as a friend in the first place.</p>
              <p>Because you are not even sure of yourself in this confused state right now, it is best if you ignore all his calls and even his presence if he goes find you. Get someone to accompany you if possible like a friend or a sister to ward him off.</p>
              <p>I'm telling you based on experience. I have an ex who i was actually with for several years. He is still messaging me mushy stuff on and off. I have my reasons for not being able to cut off ties totally.</p>
              <p>For all that he does and is, he is totally not worth it. You deserve someone better.</p>
