              <p>we broke up 1 year back. the reason why we broke up was becos he confessed that he had a gf all along (i was still unaware of the situation den) and i couldn't be accepting being "the other woman". many times, he asked me to stay with him but he had no plans to break up with her.

              <p>go disappear for a while..</p>
              <p>seriously..</p>
              <p>turn off your mobile.. everything..</p>
              <p>btw.. he's "disappointed" with your response...</p>
              <p>that says a lot..</p>
              <p>he played you like an angler plays with his fish, then after that tossed you back, he expects you to go on your knees and worship him?</p>
              <p>therein, lies someone who is self-centred and thinks only for himself..</p>
              <p>forget No.2.. you weren't even that.. you were No.3 or worse..</p>
              <p>No.1 is himself.. and i think No.2 and No.3 are also himself..</p>
              <p>he played with another, got her pregnant, she aborted, he tossed her aside or she came to her senses and threw him away..</p>
              <p>now, he's looking for another go at you..</p>
              <p>will you be tossed aside?</p>
              <p>i think it's best you disappear for a while..</p>
              <p>it's hard.. but like happiness, all it takes is a decision to do it and then each time you think about it, remind yourself of that decision made.. and do it.. keep doing it.. it becomes easier..</p>
              <p>no one deserves to have their hearts played with...</p>

              <p>Ah yes, I guessed as much. So when he was having unprotected sex with her, they get along well. And when it's time to take responsibility, he can't get along. How convenient.</p>
              <p>In other words, he used her, and then dumped her.</p>
              <p>So next time, he's gonna do the same to you too ?</p>
              <p>If you really cannot live without him, I'd suggest you abstain sex with him. Soon he'll lose interest in you and leave you alone.</p>
