              <p>we broke up 1 year back. the reason why we broke up was becos he confessed that he had a gf all along (i was still unaware of the situation den) and i couldn't be accepting being "the other woman". many times, he asked me to stay with him but he had no plans to break up with her. During this 1 year after breaking up, there are a couple of times that he called and mentioned he saw me with guys, and he was jealous over that. He feels as though he had given me away. of cos, during this period after breaking up,  he did, on a few occasions, asked me back but i rejected.</p>
              <p>Now, he has broken up with the gf, and has been asking me out. Did only went out once and afterwhich we had been talking over the phone frequently. he had been hinting abt getting back, but i ignore that. now the hint has become obvious and he wants me back. I'm afraid that history will repeat itself <span style="color: #ff0000;">and one thing that's for sure, i no longer have the trust and confidence in him.</span>  i told him that i hope we can remain as friends now, and any other things, we shall talk abt it later.</p>
              <p>I'm kinda lost now, apparently he did told me that he's quite disappointed over my response.</p>
              <p>Could anyone give some suggestions on my situation?</p>

              <p>If he dares say such thing again, you should tell him off .</p>

              <p><br>Sometimes its just hard for ppl to listen even when u advice them politely or the harsh way. Only she never knew what im trying to say here. Or mayb only me enjoying here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Speaking of childish, i read that those who are easily angry always show lack of intelligence. I can see that anger from your words, TS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ts perhaps still stay in wonderland. She cant even take a critism the harsh way, all she wanted are some good polite advices without anyone critising her the harsh way. Since u post a thread here, its Sgf's members business to reply to your thread. Its only up to you how to take critism or advice in any form.</p>
