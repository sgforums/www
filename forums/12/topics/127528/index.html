            <div class='col-md body'>"Time is the best healer." The pain is most acute when the memory is most fresh. Just let him go because once a man's heart is no longer with you, it is virtually impossible to win him back and re-live the happy days. Sinking yourself into self-pitying despair would not make him turn back.<br><br>You need more time, but don't go through this difficult period alone. Fall back on your family and friends. Go out, watch movies, sing karaoke, shop, pig out, go for a make-over, pick up a new hobby, etc. There are many ways to keep yourself occupied during weekends, and I'm sure after a few more such occupied weekends, you'll start to feel better.</div>

I know you would kidda hate him perhaps? but still at the same time miss him alot..<br><br>seriously I still think you should go find him(meet him up, never have a serious conversion at phone) at least ask for the real reason why he did so.. at least tell him you want to share his burden with him(parents) or if he really had another relationship.. den say thanks to him for being honest so that you could move on without any regrets  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>anyway do keep us inform of e outcome..<br><br>how many 4 years do we have in our lifetime?</div>

Maybe he'd really be back again after that.<br><br>I probably shouldn't have assumed that his heart is no longer with you in my earlier post.

Sorry to interrupt, but aren't you one yourself? Didn't you love him all the same despite knowing he has no money? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>At least he has a stable job, and he is not really broke or debt-ridden. He just has some heavy commitments and cannot afford to splurge too much on girlfriends, that's all. Most girls in Singapore are independent and have incomes themselves anyway. If a girl really loves a guy, it wouldn't really matter if he did not have a lot of money to spend on her (as long as he did not keep asking her for money, which is another story). In fact, there are some guys in Singapore who don't earn as much as their girlfriends do, and their relationships are still going on strong.<br><br>Not saying that he has another girlfriend of course -- just pointing out that sometimes money is not really a big matter when it comes to relationships.<br><br>The other posters have given some good advice, but whether you choose to wait or to move on, it is best you focus on what is immediately ahead. You'll be doing yourself a big favour if you keep yourself busy in preparation for the exams now. Hope that in one or two weeks from now, when you come back to this forum again after your exams, you'll be a happier person.</div>
