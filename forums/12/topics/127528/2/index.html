            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Jayne<br><br>Your reply make me feel that you really want your life back.  And in that way I may able to help.<br><br>Yes, it always hurt so bad.  Very very bad.  The pain from the heart and drive tear out from your eyes without you knowing it.  But you have to understand those pain and tear arent sign of you still love him.  They are sign of feeling, they are sign that you are afterall a human being.<br><br>So dont run away from it, face it.  Understand that you feel so painful because that is how important and precious your feeling are.  Now think if your feeling are so important and precious that just by misplacing it can hurt you so much, do you think you want to continue misplacing it?<br><br>Regards<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jayne:</div><div class="quote_body">hi varatare, thx 4 ur advice..

He could be silent about his feelings on this issue because it's like compromising on his part (although silent compromising is one of the least appreciated qualities around).<br><br>Remember that fat kid we used to 'suan' when we were younger? About his size and all? You THINK it wouldn't affect him?

In the past (possibly now as well, not time has not pass to confirm this), he created a series of drama just to stimulate this thinking. It's so classic. Every guy out there who is having this problem, WILL artifically inject certain tension in the relationship just to stimulate thinking.<br><br>Then, he got his answer. He may decide his course now: the course to leave you. There are infinite reasons and of course, you and I know that these are bullsh!ts. The actual reason lies with his ego and his psyche.<br><br>I) The Ego of a man who is unable to provide very much for his love will in turn reject love to allow her to seek for greener pasture. When Uranus is strong and afflict Sun, this ego is difficult to manage. There are many man with relatively lower esteem will see themselves as 'no future' man. They want their partner to have better life, but failed to see this as a motivating factor to excel in life.<br><br>II) His love for you may have vanished long ago OR the desire to leave the relationship. But there are simply no great deal of a reason for him to end it. He may be dragging it, thus always opting for your exam period to annouce the news. Reason is simple: you will be too busy to find him and he could also avoid seeing you this period.<br><br>Do you remember this overly used phrase <strong>'You can't force love unto someone</strong>'? IF he is not willing to be in a relationship (regardless of the length of time together), then its completely unneccessary to play 'catching' and go through the extra miles just to catch him back. The rules of 'Catching' <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span> applies to THOSE who WANTS to play them; try catching those bystander who happen to pass by - they will NOT follow you to 'jail'.<br><br>P.S: If you got to move, you got to move. You can't wait for circumstances to force movement into you (Esp. Taurus, Scorpio, Leo, Aquarius). If that ever happenes, you would either bleed to death or your tears will fill a river. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
