              <p>For life to be unfair you're requiring that some higher force has set things out for everyone, so no, I don't understand. You make your own luck, life will give you nothing because it's simply your existence - what you do with it is your choice. I don't believe that being born rich makes you any luckier than being born in a family of 10. Life is neither fair or unfair. It's your attitude that matters.</p>

              <p><br>But given a fairer place of born, most likely you attitude will align to it, let say, you are born in a normal singaporean family, get educated, lead a normal life, hv a career, married, have childrens and live a good golden age to bid farewell to all. But if you born in a poor countries with a dictatory govt, the environment do not warrant you attitude, cos no matter how good your attitude is, you are doom cos you do not have the opportunity to excel, these are the peoples who would be saying life is unfair. Given these pple from the poor and controlled govt with education, i guess some can be doctor, lawyers or even great businessmen etc etc. So is life fair to them?</p>
              <p>Anyway, we have different school of thought.</p>

              <p>You assume that your ideal way of life is everyones? I'm not saying people want to live under some tyrannical dictator but even then there must be ways to make it worthwhile, or why would people bother?</p>
              <p>You take the hand you're dealt and you make what you can - some people will take a pack of cards and fold, others could take just seven and make a royal flush, some could take 2 jokers and bluff their way to the top, hell some could take a pack of cards and build a house - but the smallest gust of wind and it's gone.</p>
              <p>It's what you do with it that matters not what you get. You work then the opportunities to reach your dream will come, is it unfair just cos you have to work a little harder? hell no. Most of the time it's better to have to work a little harder than the rest - if you win it's a hell of a lot sweeter, you lose it's not quite so bad. Generally it's passion that wins in the long run not pedigree. I'd be more proud of myself winning with 2 cards of nothing than given the choice of any cards I wanted.</p>
