            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br>You have to know who you are. <strong>who are you?</strong> As far as I can see from your short post, nothing has been done to you other than rumours that you are gay. Are you? Who are you?<br><br>You cannot stop people from talking nonsense behind your back. You are not what they say your are so, who are you? You can try to change people's perspective of you but you need to know who you are first and "Who are you?"<br><br>Take out a piece of paper and write down who you are and what you hope to become. Know that this is you only for "now" and you will change and all your friends will change.<br><br>How do you want people to see you? You can try to project an image but it is much better if you know who you are and just be yourself. Once you know who you are, you try not to give people the wrong impression. It is easier that way.<br><br>You have what is known as an identity crisis. Maybe you can google and find out how to solve identity crisis problems. Maybe some here will be able to help you.<br><br>As for me if I try to tell you it will sound as if i am preaching to you... unless you are interested to hear?</div>

You can't possibly stop everyone from saying bad things about you..... If you're not, you're not... If those people are as to be so shallow as to believe in whatever they're told as and when they like, it'll probably be better to keep your distance from such  SHALLOW people...?<br><br>And... Regarding that female friend of yours... Maybe you should have just kept your distance from her in the 1st place...? Do not speak of others if you do not wish of others to speak of you....</div>
