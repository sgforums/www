            <div class='col-md body'>WEll, If few years back i might done such a thing to a gal i have never seen b4..Giving up everything...But not after seeing life much more clearer and knowing what you want in life...i think otherwise....<br><br>WEll, the reason why he wanna give up everything might be becoz...<br><br>1  ) He already got the money and don't have to worry abt living expenses in life... Not like most of the pples out there working to support family ..We got more more problem to worry abt rather than love problem.  If we can't even feed ourselves where the hell we got the time to thing abt love thingy<br><br>2  ) Status is not important if u already got the money.  Rite?<br><br>3 ) There;s alredy nothing much for him to look forward to other than LOVE. He might be without goal in life..Nothing for him to pursuit in life.  Life to him is just like passing each day. The lost of motivation to fight on. Even if he really has a goal...he need someone to fulfil with him. maybe the gal he never meet b4....hmm..<br><br>4 ) WEll abt the dream gal thingy..maybe the one is not really his dream gal. Or maybe someone who is too perfect to him. (since u say his dreamgal). It might instead scare him off. There's such a possibility.<br><br>5 ) I agreed with him abt the thing u never try and u might regret.  I think tht;s nothing wrong with such thinking.  Someone did ask me b4..."since u will regret if u do something after tht, why don't u don't do it in the first place"....i replied telling her tht" I knoe i will regret after doing it, but if i don't do it i will regret even more".  In life, thing u need to do u will know u JUST GOT TO DO it.. Maybe tht's god message to some pples..Who knoes ?<br><br>6 ) Well, i think love is really a too big a word to use. Like is a more approciate one. Not really possible for me to love someone easily unless we went thru thick and thin. But i do admit tht u can like someone who u didn't meet b4..tht's possible.<br><br>Well, in conclusion, i think tht this person must be well to do..nothing to really worry abt in life...one who takes thing rather easily to a certain extend...<br><br>hmm..one thing making me wondering..<br><br>Wht will he do if one day the person he loves leave him and nothing much came out of it...<br>Or if he is without his wealth, will he still do it? I really doubt so...u?<br><br>[This message has been edited by patie (edited 21 March 2000).]</div>

That "perfect" girl beside him does not<br>really exist. It was a lie told to make<br>you think that he really loves you. Of<br>course, this is an unfair allegation.<br>But if he is an extremist, i dun see any<br>reasons why he won't do that.<br><br>b.  That girl exists but he really has no<br>feelings for her. Well, this is very<br>normal in everyday life. I see so many<br>perfect wives around me but we just dun<br>"click". Too bad. If this is the case,<br>then it is no big deal for him to "give<br>up" on this girl cos even if you dun<br>exist, he will not give this girl a<br>chance.<br><br>Why he wanna risk ? There may be a few reasons :<br><br>a.  His life has been dull hence he is<br>looking for something exciting,<br>something crazy, something even he<br>himself can't believe he'll do.<br><br>b.  He is sick of his way of life and wanted<br>a change, he hopes that you are the<br>change in his life (and this can be<br>dangerous for you)<br><br>c.  There are no big risks involved. If<br>things dun turn out the way he wanted,<br>he has a back up plan. With his<br>qualification, he can easily find a job,<br>so no risk here. Forgoing everything in<br>Singapore ? Maybe those things are not<br>important to him. That "perfect" girl ?<br>Maybe she'll wait for him ? Maybe she<br>does not exist at all ? Maybe he won't<br>except her even if you dun exist ?<br><br>d.  He is truly, madly in love with you. But<br>i dunno how cos i dun really believe in<br>"virtual love". You must have an OVERALL<br>feeling for a person in order to love<br>her/him. His looks/gestures/voice/way he<br>speaks etc etc are all important cos<br>they give you an OVERALL feeling of this<br>person. But of cos there are cases where<br>things do work out.<br><br>My opinion is, if you really think that things will work out well, give him a chance, if not, end the relationship before things get out of hand. By allowing him to visit you, you are already giving him hope. And if this hope bubble burst in the end, will he just face the reality and return home ? Or will he resort to extreme methods to "win your heart" ?<br><br>Whether he should see you or not, i think should be a mutual decision and not a single sided one. If you think that both of you should not meet, then by all means reject him.<br><br>If i am a girl, i will feel afraid of him. Cos his feelings are "too strong". It may be romantic though, but i really dunno wat he is capable of doing if things dun turn out the way he wishes.<br><br>&gt;&gt;As u can say since he might have known that the conclusion might be a no...why would he risk it..<br><br>Like what i had said in my previous post, NOTHING MATTERS when you are trying to get something, especially for man. We are more goal driven. We just wanted to "win", sometimes, at all costs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa,<br><br>6 months is not long. Yes, your sister may have met him and think that he is a very nice person. But we all know we can't judge a person by just "meeting up with him". I believe you are old enough to know that right ? (I dun know your age)<br><br>Another thing is, what is the reasons for him to visit you ? To start a relatonship ? A friendly visit ? Or wat ? I think you have to make things clear to him. If it is just a friendly visit, then i think it is ok. If he expects an answer from you during that visit, then a bit difficult lah.<br><br>The frenship can advance from a "virtual frenship" to a "reality frenship" but i personally think u should not jump into a BGR.<br><br>I know i have been very discouraging here, but i just hope that u will be careful, he may be a nice person, but when a person gets too emotional, he losses control of himself and disasters may result.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa,<br>Is this guy in Cananda or in Singapore? If he is over here, then just tell him to wait for you to come back then meet up with u. Who knows, maybe things may have subside a bit on his side.<br>On the other hand, if he is in Cananda, my geography is bad, can u meet him halfway...instead of u meeting him at ur place. There u will be obligated to be with him as you would think that he had travelled far and all that.<br>I don't really think a rational person, or sensible practical person would do what he is doing. No offense. But giving up something that is perfect in ur own eyes and going for something that is unknown? I don't think I will ever do that....but that is me....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa,<br><br>just to share something with you ... this happened to a close fren of mine recently.<br><br>This fren of mine was after a ger in singapore, he is in UK. Initially, he wanted to get a driving license in UK (cos it is easier) but later he decided to fly back to singapore to celebrate this ger's 21st birthday, cos of love.<br><br>This ger's bd happened to be near the Millennium hence the airfare was ridiculously ex but he insisted. And becos of that he had to give up his driving license.<br><br>Dat ger asked him not to come back cos too ex but he insisted and said that he *did not expect anything in return*. So he went back.<br><br>He was in singapore for a week.<br><br>When he returned from singapore, he told me that week was terrible. That ger was late for his appointment, though only 10 minutes late but he felt so unwanted cos he flew 10+ hours to meet her, and she did not even bother to be on time.<br><br>Moreover, that ger's family wanted to celebrate her birthday for her at a restaurant. So this guy had to celebrate with her on some other day. He again felt very sad cos of that, cos he had FLEW ALL THE WAY BACK to celebrate her birthday and yet this ger did not reserve the actual day for him.<br><br>Note : he once said he *did not expect anything from her* Sometimes, things which we assumed that will happen are already our expectations. My fren assumed that she would be on time, assumed that she would reserve the actual day for him blah blah blah, these were aredi his expectations. And yet he said he *did not expect anything*<br><br>Now, that ger is attached to another guy in Singapore. This fren told me how he had regretted spending so much money and effort on this ger. He could have gotten his driving license and spend more time with his family instead of with that ger when he was in singapore for that 1 week.<br><br>Got my point ? This fren of mine merely sacrificed his driving license which he can by all means get when he returns to singapore but yet ... he was so regretful.<br><br>Does your canadian fren has any experience in relationship ? as in any ex gf ? how old is he ?</div>

And I do appreciate gers who will reject me early, before i get too emotionally attached to her.<br><br>Anybody will feel hurt after being rejected even if it is by someone you don't really like ! It's a matter of pride.<br><br>A good way of rejecting someone is to sit down and analyse your character and his character rationally and logically and prove to him that both of you are not compatible. Dun malu him, dun make him feel that he is useless and unwanted. Dun say you dun deserve him blah blah blah too, it just doesn't work. And dun ever say that he is a great guy.<br><br>Good luck !</div>
