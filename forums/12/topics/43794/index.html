            <div class='col-md body'>Its not being possessive or anything, its just a matter of your preference. Girls who had steads b4, kissed before, had sex before are not necessarily bad. And girls who have done any of those are not necessarily good either. Again its your preference, but my advice to u is to not stereotype.</div>

HOWEVER, if you get a gf, who is not a virgin - realise this thing: Your initial love, impression and everything isn't base on such mundune issues (because you never knew about it anyway, unless she told you about herself while you are still friends) - instead it was based on the feelings, emotions and her character. Dump her and you ain't any better than those jerks who had they share of fun with her and left. You should instead treasure her and appreciate her more - because she will know that you are  much better than them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>About holding hands, kissing - the only damn way you could be in such situations is when you chase a secondary school girl and last all the way till your marriage and marry her. By then, looking at statistic, how many secondary school girls are mature in thinking. and WHAT makes you think they would fall for you either? etc, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Did you ever have a decent and proper (no one week kind or few days kind) gf before? I doubt so right? Because if you have - you would open your eyes to the real world.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: You have to suit yourself to the world and not ask the world to bend to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ya i think as long you urself never done it, you have every right to demand it because it is you mah, other people cant say much. For me, i guess its more an issue of the girl's mentality towards sex. I simply dun understand why girls think that as long is BF can and must have sex. I just feel girls need to know how to protect themselves more, though guys are very much at fault here. Afterall, keeping ur virginity or refusing to have sex with your stead could be your best weapon. In the end, dun end up on the losing side because for most girls, when you have sex with ur BF, i believe you love him very much, so guess who will be most hurt when he leaves you? so protect urself, buy some insurance by refusing to have sex, even then if he decides to leave you,  at least you not taken advantage of  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
