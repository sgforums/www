HOWEVER, if you get a gf, who is not a virgin - realise this thing: Your initial love, impression and everything isn't base on such mundune issues (because you never knew about it anyway, unless she told you about herself while you are still friends) - instead it was based on the feelings, emotions and her character. Dump her and you ain't any better than those jerks who had they share of fun with her and left. You should instead treasure her and appreciate her more - because she will know that you are  much better than them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>About holding hands, kissing - the only damn way you could be in such situations is when you chase a secondary school girl and last all the way till your marriage and marry her. By then, looking at statistic, how many secondary school girls are mature in thinking. and WHAT makes you think they would fall for you either? etc, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Did you ever have a decent and proper (no one week kind or few days kind) gf before? I doubt so right? Because if you have - you would open your eyes to the real world.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: You have to suit yourself to the world and not ask the world to bend to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers  </div></blockquote>i have already taken note of what u said the last time. there is no need for such hostile manner to repeat it to me even if i have not taken yr point down.<br>anyway i find yr reply seem to on the verge of being an attack</div>
