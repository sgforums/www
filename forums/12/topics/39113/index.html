The fact that she got into Pre-U coz this is what she wanted, but on the other hand, i m getting paranoid abt the distance to sch and the friends she's gonna make. Personally, i dun trust guys at all, which i couldn't figure why. the reason i posted this is to hope someone could give me a piece of valuable advice to help get rid of my paranoid emotions. Also, i m facing a problem, i wanna fetch my girl to sch and after sch, but somehow she just doesn't allow it and says that she wld much rather i go to slp. well, personally, i dun mind waking up at 5am and go to her place and accompany her to sch, in fact, i can't wait to see this happen, but she doesnt sound happy abt it and even set a 3 days rule with me. I could only fetch her to sch once and twice after sch. Ok, i m happy she gave me this opportunity but what i m really interested with is that she tells me herself she wans me to accompany n that she wans me to do this and that for her.This is what i really hope for.  I didn't want to tell her abt this request becoz i dun wan her to force herself to do it.

            <div class='col-md body'>you are being to possesive as to bring her to school and back from school everyday. I know you are good to her but she needs some space, some freedom too to make more friends in her school too. You should trust her if you love her and not be suspicious that she is going to make new friends in her school and flirt with them. Trust is very important, and not to be too possesive or you might lose her..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Somehow your actions spells this negative aspect, however you are rational to know not to make it a <strong>demand</strong> out from it - if you would, this relationship would probably end sooner than its expected lifespan.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Can't trust guys? You can't trust guys or you can't trust her? There is a significiant difference between the the prior and latter point. Think about this: do you really think you could stop *ALL* (I stress, ALL) guys from liking your gf or even trying to stop them to treating her nice, etc?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In dreams, perhaps. But In reality - you can't.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Low self confidence in yourself or in the relationship? Work on this self confidence. One common characteristic of a possessive or a potential possessive guy/girl is this gnawing inferiority that lies secretly deep within them - stay dormant until when a catalysis triggers it - it explode violently.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You have few cosmic lesson to learn from your relationship<br><br>I) Learn to RESPECT and give each other's personal space.<br>II) Have more confidence in yourself, your gf and your relationship.<br>III) Possessiveness never build relationship - it always falter them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

E more u wanna to get hold of it, e more it would struggle to escape from you.

Learn to take your relationship easy. When I say that, I am not telling you to neglect her but take it slow and steady. Is this your first relationship ?<br><br>From your anxious tone, I can tell that you're afraid that she might be 'taken' away from you. In a relationship, the most important thing is trust ! And I repeat <strong>TRUST</strong> !<br><br>Don't rush to see her every now and then. She will feel awkard and this might add tension to the relationship. Learn to relax and steer your relationship with her naturally.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
