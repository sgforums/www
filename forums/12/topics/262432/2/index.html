            <div class='col-md body'>Recently, I just finished a book "Got Singapore" writtent by Richard Lim, the Life editor from Singapore Press Holdings .  Two chapters in his book got me emotional and to ponder over whether I am following in his footsteps ( he is still single and is now in his late 50s ).<br><br>Part of his story revolving his past 2 loves goes like that ( I would only quote one chapter ):<br><br>It is an image from 10 years ago.<br><br>A suburban Toyko street on a summer afternoon, the sun casting long shadows on the sidewalk. She is running towards me in a blue dress and a clean white kitchen apron with blue polka dots, with the straps tied behind her neck.<br><br>She runs the way women in .................<br><br>It is a moment born as though from a spell, cast finally by a benevolent hand after U had yearned for it so hard and for so long.  She could well be coming to me from the other side of the world, from the place where dreams reside.<br><br>As I watch her run towards me, I tell myself: never forget this moment, this image........<br><br>.................She was in her late 20s, slim and attractive , with an oval face and straight hair combed back.<br><br>...........She was now working for an American think-tank, she told me.  We made a dinner date for that Sunday.<br><br>.............But the image of Tomako running down her street is what I carry around with me from that trip 10 years ago.<br><br>At that time, as I watched her run towards me , I told myself never to forget the image , the moment , and to write about it some day.<br><br>Well, I have finally done so.<br><br>..........................somehow I got to thinking about Tomako, and that image of her from 10 years ago.<br><br>Orginally published in The Straits Times: March 27, 1992.<br><br>I got emotional after reading this part, some things in life are quite unforgettable and remain clearly as part of my memory.  I am thinking of writing down as diary but definitely not in blog.  Next time, when I am already an old woman and still single, I will give the book to my nephews to read about my life experiences being active in forums, work, personal issues for them to learn a thing or two. ha ha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Maybe I will be like the journalist in old age, still recalling fondly about the past but like him, I am not daring in the matters of the heart and are more courageous in other matters in life.  Sometimes, I wonder only if the young and naive are more "rash" when it comes to love, hence, they often get attached more easily.  I don't know, maybe I need to find advice from the experienced "love fighters in the dating battlefield"!!!???<br><br>I guess the old journalist did regret slightly for not being married at old age but why didn't he be more active in his pursuit for love when he was young.  Difficult to comprehend his full thoughts at that time.  How about my case - matters of the heart are complex and cannot be fully explained or even to understand for my own situation at times.<br><br></div>

I am thinking of writing down as diary but definitely not in blog.  Next time, when I am already an old woman and still single, I will give the book to my nephews to read about my life experiences being active in forums, work, personal issues for them to learn a thing or two. ha ha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Maybe I will be like the journalist in old age, still recalling fondly about the past but like him, I am not daring in the matters of the heart and are more courageous in other matters in life.  Sometimes, I wonder only if the young and naive are more "rash" when it comes to love, hence, they often get atatched more easily.  I don't know, maybe I find advice from the experienced "love fighters in the dating battlefield"!!!???<br><br>I guess the old journalist did regret slightly for not being married at old age but why didn't he be more active in his pursuit for love when he was young.  Difficult to comprehend his full thoughts at that time.  How about my case - matters of the heart are complex and cannot be fully explained or even to understand for my own situation at times.<br><br></div></blockquote>Matters of the heart cannot be fathom. Some people are destined to be married, some not. Maybe instead of being blessed with marriage, he is blessed with a quick mind and good health. Enough, of course, to be able to write that article.<br><br>Dont think that you will be an old woman and single...or u will  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
