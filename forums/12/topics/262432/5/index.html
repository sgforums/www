            <div class='col-md body'>Well, not really sure about the you or we men are decent. Different pple are subjected to differrent opinions about pple. Some could say you are a jerk when you have noble intentions while others can misinterpret your actions. Never is a strong word though. girls are girls, women are women. When you grow older, u will see the distinct differences between a girl and a women. What you are dealing with now are maybe immature who only wants short-term relationships and not thinking about it long term. Think about it urself too.<br><br>my keyboard is giving me probs and if any typo. apologize in advance.. &gt;&lt;</div>
