            <div class='col-md body'>Hello.<br><br>May I offer an opinion?<br><br>I think u better don't tell him that u like him. Don't.<br>When you do that, you are fast-forwarding a process, skipping a process essential to your success in having a relationship with him.<br><br>I think it's better that you spend more time trying to make both of you closer and closer first......until such time when you don't feel uneasy or doubtful to say you like/ love him. Or from him to you.<br><br>I hope you understand what I mean.<br><br>For now it's better not to tell him. Otherwise, yeah, it will be like a gamble, and it will throw both of you off balance because the change is too sudden.<br><br>I think when u say u wanted to tell him u like him, you want to be more active. You want to turn the relationship into a romantic/ dating one. But better not say it out loud, better just by doing more approach first, like asking him out one-on-one. Call him, chit chat. Show attention. That kinda thing first. Shift gear from a platonic friend to a wooer. He will subtly notice. Then later see how. If he warm up, u can continue, and then reach a point where u can formalize the relationship. If he's cold, then maybe he really wants you as a friend or sister instead. By doing this I think it's much better than outright saying it out at the beginning.<br><br><img src="http://photobucket.com/albums/b122/newties/th_LKSs.jpg"></div>

I only confirmed my feelings for him when I felt my heart beating very fast when he was sitting beside me and I was looking forward to meet him everytime.<br><br>Now I am contemplating whether to let him know or not.. past hurt in relationships is holding me back from taking a step forward.  As much as I wanted to move on, I still fear.. fear of being hurt again.  Actually I also do not dare to expect anything from him.  But I just feel so silly that I am feeling happy over the little things that happened and yet it is all one sided.<br><br>I guess he look upon me like a little sister.  I never thought that I will feel this way for him but it just happened.  What should I do?   </div></blockquote>Hmm, I used to have this same problem? I have liked this guy more than a year before I could bring myself to confess to him. Before that, it was pure nightmare. I kept second guessing his motives everytime he did something as innocent as to message me suddenly and asking me out, and everytime he did something for me, I would ask myself,"Does this mean he loves me?"<br><br>So I see my confession to him as a closure. I told myself that if the response is positive, then we will move on to become a couple. If not, then at least I know the answer and I will never ask myself the "what if" question again.<br><br>He told me that he only sees me as a friend, a very close one. Even though we can spend hours just talking to each other, but he says he feels comfortable with me, but he has no feelings towards me. So we agree to remain friends, and until this day, the friendship is still intact <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So, I think it would be good for you to confess to him how you feel. Because you will not have any regret even if it ended in rejection. And if you worry about risking the friendship, I believe that a strong friendship can withstand this kinda test.<br><br>What happened to me after the rejection? Yes, I was hurt but after a while, I can see that maybe Life has something else in store for me, and I moved on. If not because of the rejection, I would not have met my ai ai today  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Good luck <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
