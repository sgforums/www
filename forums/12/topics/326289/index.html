              <p>don't worry too much about it, i have the same problem as you too.</p>
              <p>i think it's because i'm only comfortable when i'm talking to people that i really know. i'm the kind that may seem anti-social at first, doesn't talk much, lousy at making small talks etc. however, when i get to know the person better, i will start to become chatty. in short, i guess i just need time to warm up to someone whom i've just known. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>I think firstly you must feel comfortable with yourself. How to be comfortable ? Learn to love and accept yourself unconditionally.</p>
              <p>Feed yourself with positive thought. For instances, you can try wishing yourself " May i be well and happy. May i be free of fear and anxiety. May i abide in peace and harmony. May all be well and happy. May all abide in peace and harmony. May i take care of myself happily"</p>
              <p>Some conservation topics will interest certain people. It's normal to find yourself running out of topics sometime. Take it easy.</p>

              <p>Socialise doesn't mean have to talk a lot de, talk something intelligent, something basic like his background, intro your own background then maybe talk about some of the current news.</p>
              <p>If you happen to share same interest with this person then can share your experience etc.</p>

              Why must you do all the talking? Or most of it?
              You have one mouth and two ears. 
              So the ratio of talking to hearing is 1:2.
              
              Ask a question, and let the other speak.
