If you send her back, I don't think she will expect this call because you saw her safely enter her house. If you didn't, she obviously will expect you to call her to make sure that she is safe.<br><br>You say you are chasing her, but your actions are showing otherwise. Girls are pretty sensitive to such things, they take note of every little thing you do for them, like buying things for them, take them to dinner, surprised them once in a while, etc...<br><br>Try contacting her again. Say that you were tired and overslept and that's why didn't call her. Try to make up to her. Don't lie.</div>

And the only way to fix this is to get her to drink enough alcohol that she would forget everything! Usually saying sorry doesn't work in such situations, even if she does accept your apology, in future arguements she might still use this incident against you.<br><br>You could try smsing her "Hey, I'm getting really worried about you.. pls reply me alrite?" Then wait for afew days and she might reply.</div>
