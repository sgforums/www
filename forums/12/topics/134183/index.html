            <div class='col-md body'>If you can spare the time, look around the old threads in this forum and you can actually find threads like this:<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=124473" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=124473</a><br><br>Authenticity aside, you can see from the thread there are actually a lot of men like the one causing you misery now. (Right now, there is one co-worker behind me boasting about his subservient mistress... uh, slave.)<br><br>Unless he happens to be reading your post as well, the rest of us here could only speculate the reasons behind his actions. Besides, knowing the reasons isn't likely going to do you any good. You wouldn't be able to change him or do anything on him to make him faithful to you. And you'll still feel miserable.<br><br>The only person who can bring you out from this misery is not him, but you. (Even if, by some miracle, he could leave his family to be with you, there is a high chance one day you'll end up following the exact footsteps of his current wife.) So instead of misplacing your focus on his motives by asking "Why?", you ought to concentrate on extracting yourself from this self-destructive love trap by answering "How?", and leave him with his pitiful wife and child.</div>
