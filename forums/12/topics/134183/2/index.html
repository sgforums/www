IMO, I feel tat no matter wat, to d extend tat fate determines everything--- Till feeling fade in marriage--- stuck in a unhappy marriage... Both parties gotta b responsible enuff to end it... If u'r stuck &amp; u juz let it be... Then dun 'harm' others...<br><br>And ya, I noe I noe tat all things takes 2 to clap... but, somethimes, d other party doesn't noe enuff to clap d correct way... &amp; when d other party noes, it might be a little too late to withdraw out of d situation</div>

Your revenge plans may cause hurt to the faithless guy, but the emotional damage would also likely splash to his innocent wife and child as well. Such revenge only amounts to a hollow victory, and I don't think you'll feel happy in the end.<br><br>Channel the energy of your anger to work instead. Keeping yourself focused on work might help you from harbouring such unhealthy thoughts.</div>
