I NEVER DEBATE BOUT OUR COUNTRIES.<br><br>Well, i never be so racism, what i said is the truth.. Malays in Malaysia are really just weird. I never critic them useless or curse them. THey are just their kind..all of them seems the same kind. I just dun understand why u being so emo when i talked bout Malay which is not your race and i assumed your a Malay cuz your name is Malay name.. lol whatever<br><br>For your case, u just need to stop doing the wrong thing especially sending the letter to the teacher.. if you hide it, then its ok. cuz the teacher is already married.<br><br>We all have bad experience in the past. Just take some time and perhaps you will  find some1 your age that you really like. WIsh u the best and just stop doing the wrong thing cuz if you continue doing this, it will become a habit and later in future its harder to change it.<br><br>Liking some1 is not wrong, EVeryone can like anyone but need to see if it is the right path. The last decision still up to you if you wan to be like what you are today. No more arguing plz . GOd bless you</div></blockquote>right i was the one who started the country thingy... But u responded to it... i would prefer calling it a debate rather than a quarell,argue or a fight abt it... ismail nurul huda is a muslim name also arabian NOT a malay name... since u live in m'sia u SHOULD be aware of it. Malay names are like melati, embun etc... Most muslims have arabian names FYI ragardless of race.<br><br>i sent the 2 letters 3 yrs ago! i didnt send it to the teacher every month!<br><br>u were the one who started being the racist. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
