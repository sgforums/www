            <div class='col-md body'>There was this time. Few months back then, my friend and his stead fight. I heard it and sms to his stead while my another friend talk to the guy.<br><br>I sms-ed her daily, every min, for about 3 days (my sms bill bust during that month). I try to talk to her into getting back together wif his stead. In the end they did.<br><br>I felt glad. Then my friend in my school knew i sms her everyday. And he asked me "Are u really happy?". i was shock. Have i fallen in love wif her? I can't, i won't. Cause i believe my heart is still wif the gal that rejected me 3 years ago.<br><br>Finally my friend and his stead are back, but a little different. Sometime they do kiss and hug infront of my other friend, but this time not... She just stick around wif me instead of him... I tried to ignore and ask her to talk to the guy.<br><br>There was this short moment of time, i went to my friend and tell him "Sori", sori for smsing her, sori for being so close to her. He said "nevermind". Few weeks later, they broke up. And then never contact even till now.<br><br>But sometime... i just suddenly receive her message.<br><br>I decide maybe, i should just ignore.<br><br>And i caused the break up? The "Guy" say to my another friend (which my another friend told me) that I might "jio" his stead.<br><br>I'm still in the wrong huh... even though he say "nevermind" to me when i said "sori".</div>
