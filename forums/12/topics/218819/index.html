            <div class='col-md body'>bro, i can understd how u feel... sometimes i think it's rely a crazed, farked-world. I'v a fren who's also inexplicably in love with an unemployed, uneducated, glue-sniffing stupid ah-beng. That useless jerk is practically living off her, &amp; still treat her shabbily...<br><br>Despite all that u've done, and i know u were hoping that all ur effort would hopefully bring about a happy ending, sometimes thing jus dun go ur way.<br><br>my heartfelt advice is to forget abt this gal.... she's jus AIN'T worth it! given her character, i've seen so many gals like this, i somehow foresee more probs coming ur way even if u can resolve this issue this time.<br><br>There are jus these weird people who has this "what u can't get is somehow better" underlying mentality... she would always pin, long for that farking jerk who hasn't given her nothing but agony. She believe this is true love, although medically, we would call it "psycho-delusionary"..<br><br>pardon my harsh words... i've seen so much nonsense, so hoping u would save urself from unnecessary agony. but then again, i know it's hard for u to forget this gal no matter what ur frens or ppl here advice.. it would take time &amp; ultimately ur own resolve...<br><br>good luck</div>
