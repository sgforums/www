              <p>When you gamble, once you win, stop. You lose, also stop. Try another time. Don't keep thinking about it as your greed will overtake you and hamper your judgment. Now go and do some p/t job, save the money and pay it back. Be responsible as you've also lost the hard earned money of others.</p>

              No point crying over spill milk. Take a deep breath and ask yourself, what is it that you want now? To clear your debts by working hard or to recoup it at the table again? (99% you will lose more, not only money, but time, youth and trust)
              
              Talk to yr bf and if he is caring or responsible, 2 of you should work out a plan, e.g - to work hard together to save and repay yr debts. 
              
              Take this time to quit yr cigges. One pack a day $10, is $300 a month. $3600 a year. You need to save on yr cigge for 5 years before you recoup yr $18k without going back to the table. Including yr cigges savings, yr partime jobs etc. I believe you should be able to clear yr debts in a few years. The most you are 20+, you still have a long way, a bright future. It all just depends on you. Jia You! Help yrself, coz no one can help you. Take a step forward to a brighter future now.
