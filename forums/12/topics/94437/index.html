            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all. Recently know of the situation of a friend and she is confused and frustrated. So i am posting here so that she can get some advice from all you people out there..<br><br>Since young, she has been under the control of her mother. Besides going to school and fro, she has not much freedom. Her mother controls the amount of time and money she has. As a child, this was reasonable to her but as she slowly grew up, she felt that she is missing out a lot cos she cannot go out with friends due to low allowance and curfew set by her mum. She had a big fight with her mum because of this. At that time, her mom threatened to send her to a girl's home. As a young girl she is afraid and so the arguement was over. He mum agreed to double her allowance but from then on, she was under locks and keys. Other then to and fro school and ECA, she was never allowed much time outside. Her mum made sure she was kept busy. She had to do housework, cook dinner. She changes the water of her mums fish tank weekly ad feeds them twice daily. She has to teach her younger sister homework. If her sister has a project and she does'nt know how to do, she has to go online to find info for her. All this is besides the fact that she has to do her own homework and projects and take care of her own pet rabbits. After doing all these, she hardly has time to do any socialising. As a result, her social circle suffered and only a few close friends remained...In school she has always been teacher's pet and chairman of the student body. Her studies also not bad....She had a few boyfriends before but most broke up with her for the same reason. She is unable to go out with them often due to her curfews...<br><br>When she finally reached the age of adulthood of 21 years old, she asked her mum when she can have more freedom and go out till later in the nite. Her mum replied that she will have that freedom when she has married...My thinking at the time i heard this was : How was she going to get a boyfriend when she has all these curfews... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>After graduating from poly, she got a job in a small firm. She was happy as this marked the start of her financial stability. She no longer had to depend on her mum for finanacial support. Her boss and fellow supervisor were kind to her and taught her a lot so she is happy there while learning all the skills to prepare her for her future role . As most of the time at the office, there is only her immediate supervisor and her, they talked, joked and played around when they have free time. However there are a few things that her supervisor does that strikes me and another friend as strange.<br><br>1. He calls her everynight to chat with her. Even when he is in malaysia, visiting his family. he is married with kids. His wife and kids are in malaysia.<br><br>To us, this is the behaviour of a boyfriend, not a normal friend.<br>To her, just a friend who has little friend in singapore and is bored.<br><br>2. He bought a gift for her friend as birthday present even though she has only know him since she worked at the site which is like 2 months. Later i got to know that he also invited both she and her friend to KTV as a belated celebration as he missed the birthday girl's celebration dinner.<br><br>To us, which guy will buy a gift for the friend of a normal friend when he       barely knows her?<br>To her, just a gift, like a papa to daughter. (he is 39...)<br><br>3. He always joked with her in the office. He would say in a joking manner that he likes her. There was once when a friend (the birthday girl mentioned above) called her and he asked to talk to her. On the phone, he told her friend that he loved her. Her friend replied that she already has a boyfriend. Instantly the supervisor's face changed and he went silent and handed the hp back to my friend. Later when he talked to her again, he asked if she heard what he told her friend and if she wants him to repeat it... she told him don't need as she had heard it..<br><br>To us, he should not joke about this to a single woman especially when he is married and the girl is young...<br>To her, just crapping nia...<br><br>4. Everyone in the office is a smoker. She is the only one that does'nt smokes. So normally her boss and the other supervisors will smoke outside the office but only her supervisor smokes in the office. She complained but to no avail...<br><br>To us, because she doesn't put up much of a fight, he is in control...<br>To her, she bo bianz.. cannot do anything about it...<br><br>5. He told her about his past as a gangster and his family in malaysia. How he is indebted to them and loves them very much. How he slap his wife when she is unreasonable and only one slap sends his wife spinning...<br><br>To us, he is trying to intimidate her in a subtle way... defy him and she may kena whacked..<br>To her, she is afraid of him...afraid he give her shit at work...afraid of him physically...<br><br>6. Jio her go out la kopi, see movies and drink at pubs after work...<br>To us, he likes her. She does'nt reject his invitation maybe because she dreads going home?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>To her, he no friend in singapore...<br><br>7. He used to borrow her hp to play the games inside. Last time he waits for her to hand him her hp. Now he just snatch from her. There was once an incident that scared her. He asked her for the hp and she refused jokingly and he come from behind her to snatch it from her! happened a few times already!!<br><br>To us, Openly touching her already! danger! danger! No matter what, the guy should not touch a girl physically. Cause for molest...<br>To her, She will just hand over her hp next time. Then there will be no such incident again...<br><br>Conclusion:<br>To us, she has little to no social experience. Problems in family, her longing for freedom from her over protective mother may lead her to seek solace elsewhere. Even though she has no intentions, she may be misleading the guy because she does'nt reject anything from the guy. Also, She is intimidated by him both physically and at work. She dreads going home. She has only puppy loves that has never advanced to anything further. Also being a teacher's pet could have moulded her into subconsciously she adores praise from her mentors, in this case, her supervisor. She fears disapproval from him.By not doing anything about his calls, his invitations, she is leading him on. She is only avoiding the problem, not stopping it.<br><br>To her, the actions of her supervisor are normal of friends. Nothing special. He tells her of his family often and how much he loves them. He told her he don't love her. He only like to chat and be with her because she makes him happy.<br><br>After we analysed the situation and explained to her, she is still unconvinced and confused. So we are posting this thread to seek advice.. please help.. thx...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I just got some advice......hope it will help<br><br>1 . Gifts are gifts .....he gave it and she took it. No one said she cannot accept it as a friend. If he uses it against her , she has to learn to be hard hearted and say "look no one forced u to give it to me " and best she return all of them to him as well.<br><br>2. Having a supervisor like that is going to have a backlash on her working environment. Sexual harassment is what I call it. If she doesn't feel good about working with him , she got 2 options - talk to the big boss or get another job.<br>I got a feeling last option is viable since her supervisor seems to be smoking inside an office and no one cares.<br><br>3. Talk to the police about it : her ex supervisor claims to be a malaysian gangster in the past ....SS section of the police may be interested to know him. And talk to them about how she feels intimidated by him i.e. how he bashed his wife and told her etc. I am sure mata can advise her on something. Ask her to keep a diary of the events as well for legal documentation - just in case they ask her regarding the events<br><br>Just let ur friend know :<br>She really needs to get out of this sinkhole type of  relationship  by standing her ground.I don;t mean to scare u but I think the jerk could be either showing off how controlling he is , or he could be a direct danger to her. Some guys like to talk - empty vessels make the most sounds.<br><br>If you are her friend , prolly she needs someone to accompany her back home or from work . My advise is to get her to talk to her big boss and see how it goes. If he views her as a troublemaker then maybe best for her to switch jobs.<br><br>Better to be under parental control than to get into a mess with a psycho guy.<br>At least parents are over protective and guard her against "perceived" evils.<br>that guy - who knows what he can do to her....he can stalk etc<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Chi:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi all. Recently know of the situation of a friend and she is confused and frustrated. So i am posting here so that she can get some advice from all you people out there.. (Edited cause too long)<br><br>1. He calls her everynight to chat with her. Even when he is in malaysia, visiting his family. he is married with kids. His wife and kids are in malaysia.<br><br>To us, this is the behaviour of a boyfriend, not a normal friend.<br>To her, just a friend who has little friend in singapore and is bored.<br><br>2. He bought a gift for her friend as birthday present even though she has only know him since she worked at the site which is like 2 months. Later i got to know that he also invited both she and her friend to KTV as a belated celebration as he missed the birthday girl's celebration dinner.<br><br>To us, which guy will buy a gift for the friend of a normal friend when he       barely knows her?<br>To her, just a gift, like a papa to daughter. (he is 39...)<br><br>3. He always joked with her in the office. He would say in a joking manner that he likes her. There was once when a friend (the birthday girl mentioned above) called her and he asked to talk to her. On the phone, he told her friend that he loved her. Her friend replied that she already has a boyfriend. Instantly the supervisor's face changed and he went silent and handed the hp back to my friend. Later when he talked to her again, he asked if she heard what he told her friend and if she wants him to repeat it... she told him don't need as she had heard it..<br><br>To us, he should not joke about this to a single woman especially when he is married and the girl is young...<br>To her, just crapping nia...<br><br>4. Everyone in the office is a smoker. She is the only one that does'nt smokes. So normally her boss and the other supervisors will smoke outside the office but only her supervisor smokes in the office. She complained but to no avail...<br><br>To us, because she doesn't put up much of a fight, he is in control...<br>To her, she bo bianz.. cannot do anything about it...<br><br>5. He told her about his past as a gangster and his family in malaysia. How he is indebted to them and loves them very much. How he slap his wife when she is unreasonable and only one slap sends his wife spinning...<br><br>To us, he is trying to intimidate her in a subtle way... defy him and she may kena whacked..<br>To her, she is afraid of him...afraid he give her shit at work...afraid of him physically...<br><br>6. Jio her go out la kopi, see movies and drink at pubs after work...<br>To us, he likes her. She does'nt reject his invitation maybe because she dreads going home?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>To her, he no friend in singapore...<br><br>7. He used to borrow her hp to play the games inside. Last time he waits for her to hand him her hp. Now he just snatch from her. There was once an incident that scared her. He asked her for the hp and she refused jokingly and he come from behind her to snatch it from her! happened a few times already!!<br><br>To us, Openly touching her already! danger! danger! No matter what, the guy should not touch a girl physically. Cause for molest...<br>To her, She will just hand over her hp next time. Then there will be no such incident again...<br><br>Conclusion:<br>To us, she has little to no social experience. Problems in family, her longing for freedom from her over protective mother may lead her to seek solace elsewhere. Even though she has no intentions, she may be misleading the guy because she does'nt reject anything from the guy. Also, She is intimidated by him both physically and at work. She dreads going home. She has only puppy loves that has never advanced to anything further. Also being a teacher's pet could have moulded her into subconsciously she adores praise from her mentors, in this case, her supervisor. She fears disapproval from him.By not doing anything about his calls, his invitations, she is leading him on. She is only avoiding the problem, not stopping it.<br><br>To her, the actions of her supervisor are normal of friends. Nothing special. He tells her of his family often and how much he loves them. He told her he don't love her. He only like to chat and be with her because she makes him happy.<br><br>After we analysed the situation and explained to her, she is still unconvinced and confused. So we are posting this thread to seek advice.. please help.. thx...<br><br></div></blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rant: </strong></span><br><br>Type a whole chunk of my essay, only to be destroyed by error in my IE.
