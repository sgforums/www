Partial agreement with this. Have to depends on the case?<br><br>Like in this case, her mum seems to be overly using her authority... You have to start somewhere or at least a bit... Somehow I feel that it's already giving her much socialising problems... Not a case where she can just wait till her mum finds that she's mature enough? Control by parents is ok... But not OVERLY DONE.<br><br>And the immediate problem she's having here at her workplace. She could have just handled it like her supervisor is abusing his authority or be taking necessary precautions.. But seemingly she's just on a 'withdrawal mode'... Denial and pretends that nothing is happening...? Not a very smart move... Before I continue, I would just like to bring to note that the ROOT of her problem is her SOCIALISING SKILL and ABILITY to REACT in a SOCIETY. Her mum... She got to OVERCOME sooner or later.. Should she just wait for her mum to pass the green light? What if she don't? What if it's not in the near future...? Next point...<br><br>Changing the job won't solve the ROOT of her problem. The same thing can happen again... And perhaps other problems... The main chance would be to get her exposure and to OPEN her up...<br><br>It seems also quite unlikely that she would just give up the stability of her job like that... At least the $ is still important for her in terms of studies and such..?<br><br>Besides... She don't even seems convinced that there's a need to do so...<br><br>The main chance I'm betting on here is for her to be EXPOSED to the SOCIETY and LEARN for herself... Even if the REBEL is a 'failure'... Let her 'turn bad' if possible... At least her supervisor won't be touching her that easily... And as time goes on, it'll probably ACCELERATES her MATURITY...<br><br>Leaving her down there is just like putting a lamb on the mountains... Waiting to be eaten by a tiger....</div>
