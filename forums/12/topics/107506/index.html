I dream this several time when young, thinking about it still give me a unpleasent feeling. And there was once when I dream I am sleeping and thought I woke up but realize I am still in a dream whereby I am still in bed. After 2 -3 time of 'waking up' I finally manage to really wake up. That was horrible too cause its like I know I am in a dream which I have problem waking up from. All this dreams I remember well cos they really leave a strong impression in my mind.</div>

To dream that you are in a room, represents a particular aspect of yourself or a particular relationship.<br><br>To dream that you are sleeping, denotes peace of mind. Alternatively, it may also mean that you are ignorant and <strong>not fully aware of the conditions and circumstances around you.</strong> To dream that you are waking up in your dream,  indicates that something is missing or lacking in your life. There is an aspect of your life that you are <strong>not utilizing to its fullest potential.
