Just deny deny deny.. lol!<br><br>hmmm.. what am i doing in SgForums so early! anyways, i personally dun think you should be persuing this course of self destrcution. I may be wrong but dun u think maybe its just the feeling to want J ? She is going to be married soon. You have a wife and althought like you said things are not going well atm doesnt mean that things wont work out. Call me pessimist , but what if you reveal your feelings to her and she tells her husband-to-be and ur wife ? its game game over for you. That may not happen , but i am not sure as to what her reactions might be. I think u maybe sexually attracted to her that why .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Married_man,<br><br>Since you are married, just stick to your wife and be faithful ya? In a relationship, its all about trust and faith. Even if her sister might be for what you describe - "seduce" you, it shouldnt let you fascinate that she might habour feelings for you since she is already engaged and in the process of getting married.<br><br>Have an liking for anyone is normal. To be honest, i feel my gf's sis is hot, but tt's the line i wouldnt cross because, omg, she is like my sis! Dressing loosely at home is quite a normal thing since its at home, why bother to dress nicely correct? The exposing her top seems tempting, whether she is purposely or not, just treat it as a eye candy and nothing more.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you're lusting for your sister-in-law, probably due to boredom or bec your marriage is now stable, so you're looking for some excitement. Please stop such thoughts, and remember a marriage is meant to be forever. It's up to you to make or break it.<br><br>If you do something foolish, bear in mind the consequences is tremendous as it affects not just you and your sister-in-law, but your wife, your sister-in-law's soon-to-be husband, and both families. They have not done anything to deserve having their happiness snatched away from them and their family lives destroyed. It would be an ugly situation and you will be guilty for the rest of your life. Please be a real man and be responsible. Thank you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey dude. remain faithful to your wife and don't even think of going after your sis-in-law. remember. ultimately, it's your wife whom you would be spending the rest of your life with. after 3 years, maybe the passion is lesser but responsibility and commitment kicks in. take time to know your wife better, do something together, spend time together. for 2 people to get together is not easy. don't ruin your life, your wife's life and the life of your sis-in-law and the lives of all others related. think twice.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello....<br><br>I think u r confused becoz she is a woman who happens to be ur sis-in-law.<br><br>Imagine if she is ur own sis, of course u won't be confused. But since she is ur sis-in-law, u didn't grow up with her and ur mindset has not fully accepted her as a sis-in-law. In ur mind, she is a woman. Ur mind is receptive of her as a woman, and u r romantically/ sexually attracted to her.<br><br>My advice is, u have to take full account of her status as ur sis-in-law, more than her status as a woman. If u can do this, ur way of perceiving her will be different. And it should.<br><br>As an example, will u be romantically/ sexually attracted to ur own sis? Im sure u won't. Even if ur sis happen to show some cleavage when she happen to wear something loose and pour coffee, u won't think whether she's deliberately doing that to tease u, to seduce u. It should be the same with a sis-in-law. It's one of those mindset that u must imprint in ur mind.<br><br>If u fail to take full and whole account of her status as ur sis-in-law, u r just living in a confused world. In fact, deep down u already realize u r confused, alarm bells are ringing in ur head somewhere, and that's why u come here and seek advice. Right? So what to do? Take her as ur sis-in-law, fully and wholly. Problem will be solved.<br><br>If u act foolishly, if u ignore ur own alarm bells, then like some people pointed out, all those 'damage' to ur families will be too much for anyone to sort out later. But Im sure it won't happen, coz deep down u already realize u r just confused. All u need to do is 'wake up' from it, sooner than later. Don't let it mess with ur mind for long.</div>
