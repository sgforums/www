            <div class='col-md body'>This reminds me of a story:<br><br>I was a very happy person. My wonderful girlfriend and I had been<br>dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married. There was<br>only one little thing bothering me. It was her beautiful younger<br>sister.<br><br>My prospective sister-in-law was twenty-two, wore very tight<br>mini-skirts, and generally was braless. She would regularly bend down<br>then she was near me, and I always got more than a pleasant view of her<br>private parts. It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was<br>near anyone else.<br><br>One day the "little" sister called and asked me to come over to check<br>the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived, and she<br>whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me that she<br>couldn't overcome. She told me that she wanted to make love to me just<br>once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. Well, I<br>was in total shock, and couldn't say a word.<br><br>She said, "I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want one last<br>wild fling, just come up and get me."<br><br>I was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs.<br>When she reached the top she pulled off her panties and threw them down<br>the stairs at me.<br><br>I stood there for a moment, then turned and made a beeline straight to<br>the front door. I opened the door, and headed straight towards my car.<br><br>Low and behold, my entire future family was standing outside, all<br>clapping!<br><br>With tears in his eyes, my father-in-law hugged me and said, "We are<br>very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for<br>better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family."<br><br>And the moral of this story is:-<br><br>Always keep your condoms in your car!<br></div>

But of course.. men being men.. ur DICK and it's needs are more important than something as unimportant as vows.<br><br>Y the heck get married anyways?
