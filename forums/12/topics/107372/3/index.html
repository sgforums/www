Your gf's conscience gave in and finally admitted to you about her misdeed and now you sank into a world of confusion - thinking if you SHOULD forgive her because of her frank honesty, or leave her because there are simply no room for forgiveness.<br><br>To break down into atoms and molecules about your situation and what you should do now, is the ultimate business law: <strong>High risk, high gain. Low risk, low gain</strong>. You can opt to pack up now, salvaging what that was intact emotionally and leave the chaotic scene, OR you choose to stay and invest more to repair this badly damage relationship.<br><br>Which should you opt for? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I) Do you really understand why this is happening? Have you even question yourself what went wrong with THE relationship, instead of pin-pointing at the result of the misdeed? During the length of relationship... how did it went? If it was never 'decently ride-able', you may consider saying goodbye, for often, suitability is a sticky major problem. (What you are seeking and what she is seeking is a different thing altogether)<br><br>II) Her personality? How much do you understand about the REAL her? Not talking about the imagery picture painted by WHAT love wants you to picture. There are people who are so madly in love with their partner in which all that was negative, are forcefully push back into their subconscious. Her noted past? How she fare in her previous relationship? (Not asking you to dig history now, but according to those that you already knew). If she already have reoccuring thingy of promiscuity and stuff; you do your own consideration.<br><br>III) If you plan to give her another chance for Love and her plain honesty, do you seriously think that if similar thingy happened again, do you think you would succumb to the fear of losing the relationship and give in another? Are you sure she is truely repentant and willing to work with you to build back what was lost? If either one of the points above is unable to fulfill for any reason; you do your own consideration. (Remember, <strong>Two wrong doesn't make one right</strong>)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

( guess who filled the void  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">   ).. she says that the sex was just a spur of the moment thing and my ex-friend was very making her confused...<br>I told her that I dont trust her anymore, but I still love her very much ...so she has to earn back my trust..on my part I would try and make out relationship #1 and work #2..<br>I dont know if this will work out between the two of us but I am giving it a go.<br>I can forgive  but its so hard to forget ..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Borgkilla, I really feel sorry for u....<br><br>If u two really want to give the relationship another try, then try really hard. Doubly hard. Coz u two have to overcome a major scar. Spend more time together, communicate more, go to counsellors, find a religion together, etc.<br><br>It might be possible to heal over time. You two might grow closer and the relationship takes a deeper level after this major test.<br><br>So.....give ur best efforts ok.....<br><br>Meanwhile, hire some professional mobs to beat up ur friend, burn down his house, cut off his dic*, throw acid on his face, and kill his pets.<br><br>Better still, think of a major plan to frame him and make him go to jail. Spend ur time thinking and scheming, and give all ur energy, effort, time, and money, to make him suffer, big time. Im serious.<br><br>After u have returned him the favour, u will feel much better.</div>

If violence solved anything, there wouldn't be need for Personal Protection Orders, Wars would be raged all the time, and we'll all be dead from nukes.~<br>___<br><br>I'm glad that you finally had the talk, and the crying together. It was just what the both of you needed.<br><br>I'm happy for you, that you have decided to give her another chance as well. I know that she'll cherish that chance, and that she'll try very hard to earn your trust back.<br><br>Your ex-friend could be playing mind games with her. This needn't be said, but you should cut off all communications between them.<br><br>If you overcome this big hurdle, there will be no doubt that the love and bond between the two of you will be much stronger than a normal relationship. Overcome the pain slowly, and open up your heart to her again. Take it slow. There's no rush.<br><br>I hope you find peace within you soon... Wishin' you lots of luck~<br><br>Aaron</div>
