If a person is drowning, we endeavor to save him by swimming to his rescue or calling for help. If one is bleeding to death, we either apply a tourniquet or summon help in order to save him. In a state of anger, however, we do quite the opposite. We keep pouring on fuel to the fire by our words and actions.Â”<br><br>Sidney Newton Bremer, Ph.D</div>

That's the only way I know to handle anger.<br><br>Our temper is govern by the state of Mars in our natal chart. Everyone has different degree of temper because we all have different placing of Mars. When Mars is afflicted (especially by Signs of Aries and Scorpio), our animalistic instinct tends to blow out of control and subjected to the tendency of inflicting 'damage' on things/people to mollify our moods.<br><br>Human is but a higher being with a conscious mind. When you loses your conscious self, what's left is the rudimentary animal self that is common to all beings in the animal kingdom.<br><br>Then you become an animal.<br><br>Damaging your book is nothing - what's worst is when you hurt someone with your temper so badly that the wounds become permanent. You can always buy a new book another day, but you can never piece back a shattered relationship.<br><br>I recalled an old case in Aunt Agony, where this guy lost the woman he loved because of his foul temper. His realization only came when he lost her forever. Albeit he vowed to correct his flaws, by going through anger management course and stuff, it's too late to save his relationship, although it's never too late to save himself.<br><br>Do you need be like him before you truly evolve?<br><br>Go spiritual. Seek advice from your religious leader if you need to. I would also suggest you drop by Borders and purchase a book on anger management.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

If a person is drowning, we endeavor to save him by swimming to his rescue or calling for help. If one is bleeding to death, we either apply a tourniquet or summon help in order to save him. In a state of anger, however, we do quite the opposite. We keep pouring on fuel to the fire by our words and actions.Â”<br><br>Sidney Newton Bremer, Ph.D</div></blockquote>so wat is this about??<br><br>make us more angry? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
