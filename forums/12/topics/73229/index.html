When things is not on ur side...it may juz meant he/she is not the fated one or maybe loving one another at the wrong time n wrong place.<br><br>But if he/she is the chosen one of your life, no matter wat, going thru the whole big hassle (break, quarrels, spilt etc) , he/she will still be the one eventually.
