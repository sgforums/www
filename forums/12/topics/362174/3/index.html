              <p>when you have been thru alot of relation and finally find the one that you really love, i don't think you will mind her being a non virgin.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pretty girls sure many people want, and surely, she'll have a relation before, a beautiful relation, but also, a sad one. no girls want to get pop and say bye to the relation, well, of cos there is, but not as much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if you got to pop some cherry in your life and in the later stage when you are with her for sometime u found that she's not the one that you want, the relation turn bad, will u still be with the girl consider that you had pop her virgin?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if your gal's ex come and mock at you saying you are wearing his old shoe, you should answer that she's your love one. only him ( the ex bf) tried her as a shoe that's why he got dumped. any way, you should praise you gf for dumping the freak guy or you should be glad she got dumped off by that freak guy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well for a conclusion, love is not forever, many divorce now a day. it's up to your mind to think you can accept the facts or not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>some guy married windowed, some guys married some mother who is divorced, so what does the cherry being pop by other people stand? it's not like after she've been with you, and she still sex with other guys.</p>
