Let me tell you how I felt when my ex colleague who liked me and trying to woo me commented something very personal -  he is very fair, fairer than many other men, I am darker, he commented I am dark and that put me off.  At that time, he likes me and yet said this of me and to me this is really rude and uncalled for.  So when he continue to show his liking for me I sometimes would think of his comment about my skin colour.    He said I am dark he prefers fair ladies.   Ironically, later he confessed with his mouth that he likes me.   It is so hurting!<br><br>Don't call her shorty again!   It is rude of you to say that to her especially when you like her.  By saying that you have poison yourself, nobody can help you.</div>

I called her shorty in chinese. And yes, she around 1.5+m tall. The other guys also tease with this term yet she doesn't take it into heart. But when I called her that, she flared up and give me the cold shoulder...why the double standard?<br><br>She knew I didn't say it out on purpose; I was teasing her only. Right till now, she haven't forgive me and ignore my sms...I may be thinking too much though..but does this mean what I actually said do mean to her something? As in she <span style="font-style: italic;">zai yi </span> what I said? I wrote to her an apology letter but don't know if she really read it.....This is just making me vex and I doubt I can sleep peacefully tonight....</div></blockquote>wtf man,  i missed this one.. u actually wrote apology letter? so not sincere..<br>You should tell her straight face to face .. not by letter.. oh cmon..<br><br>Dont you know some words from normal guy cant hurt her but word from some1 they like have tremendous effect on them ?<br><br>You clearly dont understand women...<br><br>She initiated the break-up of friendship huh ?
