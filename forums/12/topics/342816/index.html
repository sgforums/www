              <p><br>I have felt the same before but I guess this is jus part and parcel of growing up. As we age, we have bigger and more commitments. Friends would have made other friends. The singles could have become attached and the attached may have gotten married. Therefore, they may seem to have lesser time for you than previously.</p>
              <p>I think the key is to learn to enjoy your own company in the absence of others.</p>
              <p>Remember that you may be alone but not lonely.</p>

              <p><br>I think you need to understand the distinction between friends and acquaintances - your colleagues/classmates whom you socialise with (i.e. have meals with, go out to movies with, etc) are not necessarily your friends. Therefore, you shouldn't really get all too hung up on the idea that your weekends should necessarily revolve around these people for clearly, they don't necessarily regard you as an intimate part of their personal and social lives. More importantly, meeting up with these people more often for meals/movies/what-nots is hardly a guarantee that bonds are strengthened.</p>
              <p>In short, it's the friends whom you can still call a friend 30 years from now and wouldn't think twice about calling at 3am if you need help (and know full well they are people you can count on) that matter - the losers with pathetic time management and an insecure outlook on life (yeah, those who are often "busy" juggling their schedules between different cliques of "friends" in the short-term who hardly keeps any friends in the long-term) are hardly acquaintances you need in life.</p>
              <p>After all, as some folks have mentioned in this thread, if you're simply lonely and need temporary company to tide you by, offering to pay for your "friend's" expenses will very easily do the trick. But are fairweather acquaintances what you're looking for?</p>

              <p>Sheesh, couldn't get anymore obvious than that! Were they just trying to... motivate, you to find a job a little faster? Or perhaps said it in a joking fashion?</p>
              <p>Back on topic, while most of the time, it's up to the individual to make time to meet up with friends if they are truly serious about keeping up the friendship. However on the flipside, with singapore's absurd preoccupation with results and the 5 C's (for working class folk), it tends to create the mindset that "if you're not studying/working, you're falling behind the pack". And then comes the issue of "face" and kiasu-ism...</p>
              <p>Still, I would say that ultimately it's up to the individual, and whether they want to make time for you or not. If they don't, perhaps (hard as it may be) it's time to find some new friends. :)</p>

              <p>I agree with what the posters above said. It's up to people if they want to make time for you. It happened to me before, maybe i can share with you guys:</p>
              <p>I used to have a very close friend, used to even call him "best friend". I would have known him for 10 years now if we had kept in contact. I last saw him about a year back &amp; after that, i swore to check him off my friends list. Thing is, it doesn't matter how long you know somebody, they can just be making use of you the whole time.</p>
              <p>He used to hang out with me really often, like maybe 3-4 times a week. He didn't really have much friends then, &amp; as i found out from his later actions, was just making use of me as a stepping stone. Then after he entered a new stage of his life, a new school, he started hanging out more often with his new found friends &amp; we slipped contact.</p>
              <p>I tried contacting him but like you TS, he was BUSY. I tried many times but it was always the same reply. So after some time, i got the hint &amp; just stopped contacting him altogether. If someone is keen on keeping a friendship, they will HAVE time no matter what. So, if those people keep making the same excuses, they just aren't keen on hanging out with you.</p>
              <p>Do what i did, i totally dropped that person off my friends list. If i bump into him anywhere, i wouldn't even acknowledge him. Be smart, not desperate. Now i'm so much better off, i have a bunch of buddies who hang out with me very often.</p>
              <p>Go make some new friends &amp; open up more. Be friendly &amp; i'm sure you will find friends very soon! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Find new friends to accompany your boredom.</p>
              <p>Well i am pretty sure there's plenty of people out there who wants to be your friend, not in the wrong way.</p>
              <p>Well in Singapore I don't have many friends, so I normally meet new friends through my friend friends when I normally go clubbing/social hangouts. Back in Australia, I got heaps of friends. Most of them are working on weekdays, just like myself so I am fine with it.</p>
              <p>You could probably find a job to kill your time on the weekends instead of bumming about in your room.</p>

              <p>books is the best thing to hang out with.</p>
              <p>or go early to a big macdonalds with newspaper and lots of fashion magazine, sit there, sms to friends you are there and they can join you if they like.</p>
              <p>read the newspaper, the magazine back to back, play games on the handphone and make friends with the Mac people.</p>
              <p>I especially like going there and read whatever library book i borrowed the day before.</p>

              <p>Hi Meilin..think that's another stage of your life...there will be a stage when you find you have many friends..and suddenly all started getting busy with their own lives, new friends, boyfriend/girlfriends, family, etc..</p>
              <p>but you need to know that it's not neccesarily good to have a lot of friends..what's most important is quality friends. Those who only want to hang out with you for fun and avoid you when you are in trouble are not worth it..</p>
              <p>so keep making new friends..or join new activities (something that you like, some leisure courses)</p>
