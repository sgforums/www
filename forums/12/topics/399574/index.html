              <p>Seeking help will be the right choice. Actually pouring out your problems to a counsellor will be good for you, try to understand there are people there to help you and not harm you or make you feel shameful. It is the brave ones that stand out and face the problem.</p>
              <p>You can try hospitals.</p>

              <p>From your reply...you seem to be still schooling.</p>
              <p>If you don't have cash to burn, then I would recommend that you see your school's counsellor. But if you prefer to see more professional ones, then just do a simple search on google for psychologists in private or government sectors.</p>
              <p>I seem to recall that there is one in Orchard Road.</p>
              <p>Good luck and I hope your life takes a turn for the better.</p>

              <p>Hmmm I can't really make any recommendations for good counsellors because I don't know any. =X</p>
              <p>But I found this <a href="http://www.counsel.org.sg/index.cfm?GPID=9">http://www.counsel.org.sg/index.cfm?GPID=9</a></p>
              <p>And it seems to be subsidized by the Community Chest of Singapore, so no harm giving it a try. Please remember to ask for a price quotation first before you decide to confirm an appointment (Coz I'm not sure of the prices).</p>

              <p>Hmmm</p>
              <p>I think it depends on how serious your disorder is...To me I think you're suffering from mild depression and have some anger management issues.</p>
              <p>And yes, you'll have to declare in future, if you are dignosed with a mental illness. But please don't put off seeking help because of this. If your disorder is not treated, it may become worse and your problems will mulitply.</p>
              <p>And yes, any information you disclose will be kept strictly confidential, but of course the counsellor will have to keep a record for future references.</p>
              <p>From what I see, IMH has quite reasonable prices for counsultation. I think it's $22 for subsidized patients. So I don't think it'll be a strain on your resources.</p>

              <p>You can try for other hospitals if you dont want Imh. I said hospitals because they are professional and they can provide medical help too (drugs) if they find your case on the serious side.</p>
              <p>Anyway just go for help, dont be afraid. Fall down liao must climb up.</p>

              <p>There are always ups and downs in life and most of the time they are manageable. From your post, it seems that you're struggling. I'd advise you to seek professional help eg. shrink, counsellor. No 1 is born equal.</p>
              <p>Be strong.</p>
