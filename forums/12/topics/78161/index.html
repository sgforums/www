If you have read my posts in AA before, you would know that I have been stuck in this kinda situation too. As I read your poem, I was like..omigod. This is like...me. Like you, I have also listened to him talked about the other girl, I have helped him during those nights when he missed her and when she wasn't around..I have even helped picked present, bday card, wrote love letter to her, etc. And yes, I know it hurts. He teased me a lot too, and he never know I took every word he said seriously and how they sometimes hurt me. I have never told anyone here about this, except for my roomate and she only found out about this like 2 days ago. Nobody except me, and maybe those who have gone thru this before would ever understand how much pain it is to listen to someone talk about another when you love that person so much and all you want is to be with him. To know that you have no place in his heart...that is just heartbreaking. And that is why I have made the decision to move on. I have blocked him off all my contact list, I have stopped talking to him...ppl are saying I am being unfair to him, they asked me to continue to be his frens...but how could I? It will only make me fall deeper for him. And honestly I am tired of all this crap. I am tired of being the one who he will go to only when the other girl is not around, I am tired of being taken for granted. Jolin, I hope you realize what you are doing. We are wasting our time on such guys. Maybe you are hoping one day he will see what you have done for him but chances are..he might not. Unless maybe you tell him how you feel, I have tot of doing that but I never did because I think it will complicate matters plus I am a coward. It takes a lot of effort to walk away from him, it will hurt a lot at first to just give up the frenship...but do something for yourself for once! You have sacrificed so much! You deserve someone better and the sooner you can let go of him, the sooner you can open your heart to another guy who will treat you better and cherish as you deserve to be cherished...anyway if you need to talk abt this, you can always PM me...gd luck!</div>
