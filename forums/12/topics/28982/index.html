I had to fight the urge everynight to call her at the time we used to chat everynite..

It simply refers to 2 reasons<br>- Just broke off<br>- Comparing the both of you, he is better.<br><br>In your case,  you both become better friends and she started calling you out, talking, all the thingy. In her subconscious mind, she is giving you a chance to do something about it, and it looks like you lost your chance to fear of she avoiding you. - Trust me if you do it properly, no woman would run away the minute you tell them your feelings even they may not like you. Come on - she said cannot forget ex, never say never like you right? This mostly likely is your mis-conception of things, which lead to zero action and ends up in this situation. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>You didn't take actions, therefore that guy took it before you. She SMS you all that, IS TO retain that kind of feeling you have in her. Still got 2 reasons<br><br>- She wants to have the best of both world<br>- She knows she won't last with that guy (probably a fling) and still needed you around when she breaks with him.<br><br>So... what to do? Play hard to get temporary because by showing signs that you bother means you are at a disadvantage. Yesh you may like her, but ai qin bu nen dang fan chi. I could teach you ways to counter her and make her break with bf, what whats the use? My advice is to move on while keeping an open eye - continue life and such and see how the situations goes, could get her back when tides turns around, but beware not to make it seemed that you have always been there (don't be a spare tyre). Remember to treat mushy SMS as just SMS and ignore mushy statement by deleting. NEVER ponder because you are nobody to her like what you have said - live what you have said to her and I can tell you and she will succumb to you subconsciously.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Post or email me for further advancement in this situations.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, u sound like a nice guy. I have a friend who tells me he is waiting for a gal (attractive but attached, at lst ex then bf again) for 3 months. While another guy told him that he has been waiting for her for 6 years... Every of our conversation lasted for hours which I feel tiring. But as an old classmate, I continue listening and help when possible. He is rather obsess with her like: feel like dying when she didn't SMS him back, figuring out her feeling sad when she doesn't get along well with her bf, etc. Although he knew that she is already attach but he still thinks he has hope b'cos she always tell him that her bf doesn't treasure her. She can't tell whether she has any bf or in love b'cos she thinks that her bf is very unstable. He grabs whatever kind of opportunity he can. Sometimes they went karaoke togather, singing love duet songs.<br><br>Are you like him? There are abundant  of gals out there which, u might not see her now. Time and determination are the best medicine to cure yourself if only you choose to let go. Let her pass without having anymore feelings with SMS or her presence. You will like yourself better as there is another kind of world waiting for you. I know it hurts, but who doesn't get it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I told her that I'm a nobody to her and wat right do I have to be angry? And why is she saying sorry to me for? I left, and haven't seen her since. She didn't call me, but she keep sms me those sorry, miss you, gd nite, kind of msg. Can anyone tell me what is going on in her head??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div></blockquote>Some things just don't always happen the way you thought it would be.... Or judging by the way things appear to be.... No supposingly so or not... Especially when it comes to the matters of the heart....<br><br>2 main reasons which I can propose to you as to why she still sms you such things are....<br><br>1. She knew you've got feelings for her... She thought she led you on and felt very sorry that things turned out to be this way...<br><br>2. She's conditioned to do so... She just do it... Perhaps even she herself is uncertain why is she doing those things.... Probably just a 'feeling'...? Perhaps she would think of it as either 'friendship' or an 'awkward relationship' which still persist in her mind....<br><br>There could very well be other possible reasons... But my advice is no point asking... She might very well be as confused as you are... By asking her and stirring up her feelings won't get both of you anywhere most probably.....<br><br>Just realise that whatever it was, it's over... What's the point of asking her what's on her mind and put both of you in a difficult position...? If you still want the relationship with her you can try friendship...? Might not work out, but it's really up to you.... If you really cannot stand her sms or don't want her to do so, can just tell her directly... Alternatively you can just choose to ignore them or give simple replies to them if you can handle it.....<br></div>

I have a friend who tells me he is waiting for a gal (attractive but attached, at lst ex then bf again) for 3 months. While another guy told him that he has been waiting for her for 6 years... Every of our conversation lasted for hours which I feel tiring. But as an old classmate, I continue listening and help when possible. He is rather obsess with her like: feel like dying when she didn't SMS him back, figuring out her feeling sad when she doesn't get along well with her bf, etc. Although he knew that she is already attach but he still thinks he has hope b'cos she always tell him that her bf doesn't treasure her. She can't tell whether she has any bf or in love b'cos she thinks that her bf is very unstable. He grabs whatever kind of opportunity he can. Sometimes they went karaoke togather, singing love duet songs.<br><br>Are you like him? There are abundant  of gals out there which, u might not see her now. Time and determination are the best medicine to cure yourself if only you choose to let go. Let her pass without having anymore feelings with SMS or her presence. You will like yourself better as there is another kind of world waiting for you. I know it hurts, but who doesn't get it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>1st of all, I AM a nice guy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> I guess I'm not as obsessive to her as ur fren is to the gal..
