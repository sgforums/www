            <div class='col-md body'>Are u the only son? If no, mabbe encourage ur siblings to engage ur mum in activities like shopping or go for tour. It will take her mind of these things. She might feel she wont be alone when u need to spend time with ur gf.<br><br>Do also on your own accord, spend more time with ur mum and talk to her. Reassure her you will be there for her even way after you are married.<br><br>Best, get ur gf to go out with ur mum too. This help build up their relationship. Get to know what they have in common, mabbe both like to sing, so get them both to sign up for vocal training classes and choir..</div>

Or ask ur gf to come over ur hse for dinner. Bcuz during dinner time, its the best opportunity for them to strike up a common topic. But u have to be the 1 who starts the ball rolling, so tat both of them dun feel awkward.<br><br>It take time for pple to get along. Esp in laws. Like my bf's mum, she's a headache for us.. but life still have to go on. Mayb u cud call ur mum once in a blue moon, asking her if she had eaten or watever, at least show some concern.. dun let her feel neglected. As for ur dad, u can only protect ur mum and be supportive. I mean he is ur dad, now he is and forever he is, this is the fact u can't change. no matter how much hatred u bore, u have to live wif it.<br><br></div>

If i'm in your mum's shoes, i'll probably feel lost and wanna hold on to my son who's my only hope left. She probably didn't realise that she's overdoing it and putting you in a tight spot.<br><br>I suggest that you do spend some time alone with her, maybe for meals, or spare a coupla hours once in a while to go out with her. Then on some occasions,  invite her to come along on your dates with your girlfren. If all else fails, talk to her. I believe she'll understand the situation if you put it across to her gently.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another thing is try not to sing praises of ur sweetheart in front of ur mum too often. Naturally ur mum might tends to compare wats so gd abt ur gf...<br><br>Women r very sensitive creatures. Being thru so much, ur mum definitely needs some1 to be there for her becuz of her insecurities. Try to give her some suggestions on her appearance, maybe she can dye and highlight her hair(to makes her looks stylish), slim down to look attractive(if she's plump), put on some make up( to look brighter and younger).<br><br>there are many ways to encourage her, to make her realise tat she should value herself.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>agreed with the above.... Do make more meeting between gf and mum.<br><br>I believe your mum does not know much about your gf .Your mum dont want to lose that status in your heart.It is a parent instinct.<br></div>
