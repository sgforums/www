            <div class='col-md body'>I had it too. Then i found out the cause of my problem...too much caffeine. Try cutting tt down. Other possible reasons are that u have too little sleep, or one of ur internal ear hair dropped inwards (or something like tt) thus creating a sense of unbalance. Other possible reasons maybe tt u received a trauma to the head or some other medical condition. Try to sleep it off and try not to turn when u slp because tt will make it worse.<br>Try this if it helps. When u sleep dun lie down fully. Lie 45 degrees or so and try not to move ur head too much. drap a towel over ur forehead as though u are having a fever. It helped alot for me. I took panadols too. And i strongly suggest u take mc or leave if u are working. For me i couldnt even walk straight machiam drunk.Gd luck and take care.<br></div>
