            <div class='col-md body'>Like almost every other post, this is about BGR.<br><br>A few months ago... I decided to gather what guts I have and approached a certain female individual in my school whom I secretly admired for a rather long time. Like every beginning of friendships, things were a little dull as we spent some time getting to know each other. I reckoned my antics were a little obvious... as such I professed my feelings for her about 2 weeks later. I know it was rash as we barely got to know each other. She, being a really nice person, did not want to hurt my feelings and told me that we would be better of as friends 'for now' (close to what she said then). It was also partly because of studies (She don't want to be distracted at this time of her education year and she wants me to concentrate on my Os). I was grateful, because she didn't shun me or anything after that minor event.<br><br>As the months passed, we had several outings that was organised mostly by me. Got to know her more and began to see how similar we were, in terms of daily habits. She's the type where she spends more time at home because she doesn't fancy roaming the streets. Throughout this time, my feelings didn't fade yet... instead, it became stronger. I personally feel that she is the only one who can understand me, unlike my peers who majorly waste their life away in Orchard Road.<br><br>Communication-wise, I think she's a very quiet girl. She doesn't talk much (or maybe in my context... it isn't much) and I tend to choke on my words everytime I speak to her (honestly speaking, i'm pretty shy too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ). And most of the time, I have to repeat myself a few times because I talk too fast and she isn't very good at catching words (especially with my talking speed).<br><br>But lately, I've been avoiding her abit. I have no idea why too. I still am very fond of her and wished that we could be together. I was thinking of asking her subtlely... but I fear I might lose the current relationship we currently have. I know that "No pain, no gain". But after that rash confession, all I felt was pain. We don't exactly meet much in school other then recess and a pathetic 0.5h lunch break (Which I feel is not such a bad thing because we all need a little privacy).<br><br>Feeling very tormented everytime when I'm alone. When I'm with my group of friends, they always manage to remind me of the happy things about her. But when I'm alone, I just feel hurt that she's there and yet I can't progress with her.<br><br>I personally feel I should ask her, firmly. Reason being, I feel I'm not a rotten jerk to begin with. Friends did comment that I didn't seem like a guy who would enter a relationship although they said they did notice a change in me after this event.<br><br>Now I just want to know on how should I go about asking her. Subtle? Direct? Public Announcement?</div>
