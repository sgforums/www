            <div class='col-md body'>No. I think you shouldn't confess to her for the time being. She has a BF already, this might cause some friction between them if you confess to her. Also, try not to get too close for comfort with her. Her BF might suspect you are trying to snatch her away.<br><br>You can still be friends with her, but dont get too close. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
