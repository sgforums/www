              <p>It feels crazy as it sounds but it's what happening to me now. Thanks in advance for hearing me out.</p>
              <p>Let's call my ex bf Dan and Jim, for this guy I've been thinking to go out with.</p>
              <p>So after I broke up with Dan few years ago, I didn't let anyone else to enter my heart, until I met Jim.</p>
              <p>I used to be deeply in love with Dan. He was everything I could ever wish for in a man. I was an introverted girl while Dan was the opposite but we matched each other almost perfectly probably because we loved each oher to every single bits. We never had enough of each other. But well we never know what are ahead of us. We couldn't be with each other in the end for some reasons.</p>
              <p>I moved on having quite a good life despite the emptiness Dan left in my heart. Sometimes I still found myself thinking about him but just random thoughts with no extreme feelings. Then things have changed since the day Jim came into my life. I used to think I'd never truly fall for someone else again but Jim has changed both my heart and mind. Jim feels the same about me and wants us to go out. I should be feeling happy but instead, I'm reluctant to go on dates with him. I know it's not right but I started thinking a lot about Dan since I realized my heart already opened to Jim. I like Jim, really do but sometimes I think about Dan even more, especially after this incident with Jim that used to similarly happen between me and Dan. When it happened, Dan made me trust and love him more while Jim kind of made me disappointed due to his lack of thoughtfulness and maturity.</p>
              <p>I'm quite confused now. On one hand, it feels so strong that I like Jim a lot and want to be with him. On the other hand, I want to hold myself back because I still think about Dan. I'm a devoted person, I don't want to think about Dan or any other guys when seeing Jim.</p>
              <p>I wanted to be honest and let Jim know what has been bugging me and ask him to give me more time but I don't know how to go about it to not hurt his feeling.</p>
              <p>Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

              <p>It doesn't really what you think. I don't think about my ex bf in that sort of way as what you mentioned but more of a guilty feeling that I've fallen for someone else, someone that doesn't treat me right as Dan used to do but I still want to be with him while I decided to break up with Dan though he didn't do anything wrong.</p>
              <p>I don't know where this stupid guilty thought came from but that's what it is.</p>

              Ha! is this the cause of your insonmia? LOL! 
              
              anyway, is Dan your first bf? Apparently it feels like you've been away from the "scene" for too long and while you might not feel for dan anymore, you actually feel guilty going into another r/s. This is not because you still love dan, probably just that you've never let anyone in since dan and subconsciously, you probably are questioning urself if Jim is the right one. My guess is that, to handle that uncertainty, u subconsciously put dan into the picture

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Surely our mind produces whatever images we feed it; many a times, unconsciously. </p>
              <p>You labeled yourself as devoted; however, there are two sides to a coin dualistically speaking. Devotion in this case is also a resistant towards a possible future. I can't tell how this future would be for you, but to you, having to adopt this picture would somewhat suggest that you would need to give up a once-important picture of the past. This is a trade-off you have refuse to relent thus far.</p>
              <p>An opportunity cost my friend; the same dollar can't buy you two loaf of bread. You somehow figured that you can't keep two pictures of the same category in your world of relationship. However, reality is pushing you into making a choice - either which would produce painful perception of lost and uncertain future. </p>
              <p>Until you have a committed decision to walk forward, you will always walk while looking backwards. The strain in your neck is basically the misery you are experiencing - nobody has the power to retain our emotional spirit in the past other than ourselves. You could tell Jim that you need time to work some things out yourself; if he is an enlightened male, then you would probably have some time. However, do not use time as an excuse to slip into escapism. You will face the same conundrum somewhere down your future again - with added misery. </p>
              <p>P.S: Regardless of options, there is no way you cannot 'don't hurt him' - especially since he has fallen for you. In some degree of truth, you are only responsible for what you say to him and not responsible for what he understands. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"></p>

              <p>I suggest you deal with your inner demons within yourself instead of dumping all your past emotional baggages on Jim.</p>
              <p>It is unfair for Jim to carry your burden. For he too has his own baggages to deal with.</p>
              <p>If you are not over Dan yet... you need to give yourself more time before going into another relationship again and risk hurting an innocent party.</p>
              <p>What exactly is the reason you and DAn relationship didn't work out ? What are the chances you and dan will get together again ? Are you still holding your breath for a miracle to happen ?</p>
              <p>While Jim may seem the perfect rebound guy.. you will only ruin the new relationship because of your old baggages.</p>
              <p>So, don't be greedy, let Dan go in your heart.. before you let Jim in.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Surely our mind produces whatever images
              we feed it; many a times, unconsciously. </p>
              <p>You labeled yourself as devoted; however, there are two sides to
              a coin dualistically speaking. Devotion in this case is also a
              resistant towards a possible future. I can't tell how this future
              would be for you, but to you, having to adopt this picture would
              somewhat suggest that you would need to give up a once-important
              picture of the past. This is a trade-off you have refuse to relent
              thus far.</p>
              <p>An opportunity cost my friend; the same dollar can't buy you two
              loaf of bread. You somehow figured that you can't keep two pictures
              of the same category in your world of relationship. However,
              reality is pushing you into making a choice - either which would
              produce painful perception of lost and uncertain future. </p>
              <p>Until you have a committed decision to walk forward, you will
              always walk while looking backwards. The strain in your neck is
              basically the misery you are experiencing - nobody has the power to
              retain our emotional spirit in the past other than ourselves. You
              could tell Jim that you need time to work some things out yourself;
              if he is an enlightened male, then you would probably have some
              time. However, do not use time as an excuse to slip into escapism.
              You will face the same conundrum somewhere down your future again -
              with added misery. </p>
              <p>P.S: Regardless of options, there is no way you cannot 'don't
              hurt him' - especially since he has fallen for you. In some degree
              of truth, you are only responsible for what you say to him and not
              responsible for what he understands. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"></p>

              <p><br>but i think even if the next person comes along, the same thing might happen though... this inner demon comes from comparing the past and a possible future you are stepping into. I say, right now, talk to Jim and let him make the decision, to move on with you or without you.</p>

              <p>Hello there</p>
              <p>Jim is now overseas and going back next week that is good 'cause I'm now taking time to think over how I should tell him which is not easy.</p>
              <p>I think by talking to Jim, it may help me to probably see some points that I can't figure out by keeping things to myself. But I'm not sure, I'm just afraid he may just say he's fine but feel otherwise inside. He is seemingly an extrovert however after some time knowing him, I see him more of an introvert.</p>
              <p>Will keep you guys updated. Thank you!</p>

              <p>Oh well anyway, it should not be difficult larh... you just needed a first step to start sharing and things should come fairly easy and comfortable. Being to much of a listenner surpresses your emotion which would not be good. Did happen to me before so preferably it does not happen to you.</p>

              <p><br> the bugs are eating ur brain? that may cause you be epileptic!
              hahaha!!!</p>
              <p>Oh well anyway, it should not be difficult larh... you just
              needed a first step to start sharing and things should come fairly
              easy and comfortable. Being to much of a listenner surpresses your
              emotion which would not be good. Did happen to me before so
              preferably it does not happen to you.</p>

              <p>Ah hah! What about having my brain eaten and then talk to myself in a mirror so I can be both listener and talker at the same time? Sound scary huh? jk</p>
              <p>Thank you but I have some ways to release stress without having to talk too much :)</p>
