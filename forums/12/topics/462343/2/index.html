              <p><br>i do not think of it as that he isn't trusting you completely. It depends alot on how you've told him about your issue. I think he is trying to come to terms with what you've told him and also trying to come to a decision. Instead of seeing it as him not trusting u completely, i see it as him seeking confirmation. He has to make a decision based on what he thinks and what you've told him, that sentence is more like just to check if you missed out on anything that you think you need to tell him. Haven't we all came across situations where we are about to make a decision then suddenly someone told us "some additional information" or "something new" that changed our decision making?</p>
              <p>Good luck to you anyway! Understanding man is just as hard as man trying to understand women yea?</p>

              <p>What is it you are trying so hard to understand about Jim ? His big ego ? This has NOTHING to do with a man's ego. It's all about you being a self-absorbed, emotionally insecure woman.</p>
              <p>And of cors he shouldn't trust you, you are coming across as a very FLAKY person.</p>
              <p>Seriously, you weren't even honest with him from the beginning. You were never emotionally available since your ex. Now he is doubting your sincerity. Can you blame him ? no.</p>
              <p>He should be asking himself if you are stringing him along for the ride. In fact, it seems you are using him to inflate your beat up ego. ( Yes women hav egos too, and ours can be much BIGGER than a male ego ). That's why many women need constant validation from men. ( mirror mirror on the wall)</p>
              <p>Your ego wants him to come chasing your skirt even after you told him you werent ready.. you still think about an ex... you are not sure.. you need space.. you need to find your feelings etc etc...all the lame excuses for you to just enjoy the cake and not have to bake it... yes ?</p>
              <p>If that guy has some self- respect.. he'd just dump you and seek fishes elsewhere.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sure, you think that after what you've told him.. and if he still comes after you anyway.. he must REALLY wants to be with you right ? Right..feels good isn't it ?</p>
              <p>you must think you are THAT worth it. ( self-absorbed)</p>
              <p>..actually it just means he has low self-esteem. There.. that's probably the reason why you keep ending up with men who are too ego maniac to love you back.</p>

              <p>Let me summarise ok... so you still not ready for new relationship.</p>
              <p>You met this guy , you kinda like him... then you don't like him because he got ego issue.</p>
              <p>Then you bend over backwards for him and you compromise etc etc.. and you still havn't go out on a date with Jim.</p>
              <p>OK.. then here comes the real motive... You need to know <strong>HOW </strong>to reject Jim without hurting him. This should be your SuBject on this thread. Next time just go straight to the POINT.</p>
              <p>Well, here's the problem . Unless you are an excellent LIAR.. it's not likely you can accomplish NOT hurting his feelings when you reject him. EVERY REJECTION is HURTFUL... get immune to that idea.</p>
              <p>Rule number 1 : MEN are NOT stupid.</p>
              <p>Rule number 2 : They are NOT as dumb as you credit them for.</p>
              <p>If you truly not want to hurt his feelings.. there is only ONE method of rejection.</p>
              <p>CLAIM YOU ARE A LESBIAN. This is the only ONE rejection men cannot argue with you about. Nor can they try to persuade you out of.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, you really need to get over this " I don't want him, but I don't wanna hurt him " bull crap. cus we've all been down this road before... the road leads to NOwhere.</p>
              <p>Just be honest and tell him you are unavailable.. and CUT OFF. Stop <strong>pretending</strong> you worry about his feelings.. because you really don't give a shit deep inside.</p>
              <p>He will first go through a withdrawal , or he will find himself another chick. Life is that simple for a guy.</p>
              <p>Unless you plan to wear a nanny underwear on the outside everyday.. it's likely you will need to reject MANY more advances until the day you get married.. then it will be your husband's turn to reject other women.</p>
