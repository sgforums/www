            <div class='col-md body'>I have been noticing this girl for few days at the same bus stop as me when i am heading for work. I never seen her before and i think that she is living somewhere around there. The first time i look at her i am attracted by her. I am a guy that actually more on going for feeling towards a girl instead of things like figure or appearance. Although those are still important but i think the feeling is still the most important i think. And i think that she has been noticing me looking at her cos i was trying to have eye contact with her when i have a chance. She just makes my heart beats fast even she is not around. I have always wanted to tried to talk to her like saying "Hi" but will she think that i am nuts? Or pervert? And oso what if she has bf already? I think there are still many questions confusing me and only the girls can answer my question. Can i be able to see from a girl's facial expression that she is oso interested in me? If i could know that she is oso interested in me, then that won't be a problem to talk to her. But is this the right way for me to do? Can anyone help me?</div>

Gather enough of  yr courage and proceed to have a small chit chat with her. U can also start the ball rolling  by smilling at her first.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think its best to be sincere and direct. Approach her and tell her you have been noticing her for the past few days and that you just want to tell her that you thought she is really attractive.<br><br>Thats all. See her reaction. If she say thanks or you see that her body language conveys that she is comfortable, then try to tell her that u want to befriend her bah.

If u wanna stand far far and wait for her to be interested in u.. "dan ti geng" (wait till dawn break) also won't happen. She might not even know your existence! Ok.. maybe she do have some impressions of u as some weird guy that like to throw her funny glances.<br><br>I feel, in a girl's point of view myself, that if you are truly interested in her, you've got to at least have the guts to approach her. That's the very least thing a man can do instead of waiting for the "right" signal, becos i guarantee you there won't be any, if you just wait.<br><br>Of cos, don't go up to her and say, "Hi. I think you are pretty. I want to know you. Can you give me your number?" That would be too direct. At least so for me.<br><br>Instead, try to make some small talk like, "Hi." (Greetings first)<br><br>Then, "You just moved in to this neighbourhood around here or..?" "So where do you work at? I see you around pretty often."<br><br>If possible, observe the things she carries, how the way she dresses. (If you like her, you would pay more attention to her and observe her right?) Drop little but sincere compliments (girls can tell if you're not sincere) like, "That's a nice bag you're carrying." or "Did you just had a hair cut?" Women generally like to be noticed &amp; complimented upon provided that it is done in a tasteful fashion, not in a leery perverted way!<br><br>Chinese saying, "yi ci sheng, liang ci shu" (to the effect of it gets better and better with each contact and consistency)<br><br>Even if you don't have a lot of fantastic topics to talk about, since both of u meet ea other consistently at the bus stop, over time, both of you should have more than just hello to say.. PROVIDED that you take that 1st step out.<br><br>The rest just leave it to fate.<br><br>All the best to you,<br>YouDonKnowMe</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One more thing i'd like to say is, even if the girl turns out to be attached, it makes no harm to make one more new friend and bus-stop kaki to talk right? Even then, she might turn out to be the one to intro her gf to you or give u some advice on girl prob.<br><br>Besides, it is no shame to like someone. Humans are blessed with this beauty of loving &amp; admiring someone else other than self. As a guy, take more initiative!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Allstar,<br><br>It will be most appropriate if the girl whom you approach will immediate take a pleasant liking to you. But if you tell her that she is pretty, wham! Sex maniac alert! Also, never ask for number on your 1st couple of conversations.<br><br>Take it slowly, now that she noticed you, the next step is to smile (practice using a mirror 1st) but not to initiate any talks. If she smile back comfortably, then you are almost there.<br><br>Good luck!</div>

If the gals are interested when the guys initiate conversation or say "hi", the gals will most likely respond.  Hmm, that guy is full of drama but can't get himself to even say "hi".   He is kind of being unrealistic.  He thinks by paying attention to me will get him the chance to get to know me and be friend with me.   In general, it does not work the way he expects.   There was once he saw me and was so keen that his body language told me that he was asking for something from me.   I was kind of scared after previous encounter with him in the lift* so I just walked away.  THe next week saw that he talked to the friend and at the same time the friend was staring at me with displeasure and hostility.   He must have been put off that I did not respond to him the previous week.   I really don't know what this silly guy wants as there is no communication from him.   What happened in the lift was that he was moaning so loudly and there was just he and I in the lift.  This kind of scared me*.   He has tried other ways to get my attention but what I can say is he is using wrong approach.<br><br>I know he is desperate to get my attention but he just simply refuses to even say "hi".   To me I will respond only if the other party say "hi" or initiate conversation.<br><br>If I can be of any help to you, do feel free to ask.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i've tried this before last time, whereby i ask for girl's contact (super chio) at a bus-stop after 1++ years of admiring here (happened in end-2005).<br><br>basically, that girl is those super-confident, world-weary time, so she was very calm when i asked her for it.<br>and by the way, to be her at ease, i asked for her e-mail, not phone number.<br><br>phone numbers are a lot more personal and she may get more freaked out and give you false one, whereas e-mail gives her a lot more room for security and all that, so she's more inclined to give it to you.<br>(with e-mail, you can also do instant messenger mah)<br><br>for my case, i stopped contacting her after the 5th e-mail cos' i realized we got nothing in common to talk about and cannot click, so why force it even though she's chio? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>observe the confidence level of your girl first.<br>what u do depends on what type of girl she is.</div>
