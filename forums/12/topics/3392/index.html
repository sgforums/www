            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Solitude<br><br>We can't TOTALLY forget a person whom we've once loved deeply. But it has been about 2 yrs and you still have STRONG feelings for your ex-gf? Then you MUST ask yourself do you want to CONTINUE to be like this? You have to do something to your LIFE yourself in order to MOVE ON. Nobody can help you, you've to HELP yourself.<br><br>I don't think you are ready in new relationship as yet. Forget about meeting new girls for the time being.<br><br>I see it that you've lost confidence in yourself already. Go out and make new friends first. If not in school then outside, but don't mix with the baddies. Friends who accept you as who you are, friends who can give you confidence. Do you have any CS buddies? Is CS=counterstrike?</div>

But it has been about 2 yrs and you still have STRONG feelings for your ex-gf? Then you MUST ask yourself do you want to CONTINUE to be like this? You have to do something to your LIFE yourself in order to MOVE ON. Nobody can help you, you've to HELP yourself.<br><br>I don't think you are ready in new relationship as yet. Forget about meeting new girls for the time being.<br><br>I see it that you've lost confidence in yourself already. Go out and make new friends first. If not in school then outside, but don't mix with the baddies. Friends who accept you as who you are, friends who can give you confidence. Do you have any CS buddies? Is CS=counterstrike?</div></blockquote>Hmm... Talk about CONFIDENCE? For a moment there I couldn't believe you're the one giving the advices here...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
