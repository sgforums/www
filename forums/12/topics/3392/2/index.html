But it has been about 2 yrs and you still have STRONG feelings for your ex-gf? Then you MUST ask yourself do you want to CONTINUE to be like this? You have to do something to your LIFE yourself in order to MOVE ON. Nobody can help you, you've to HELP yourself.<br><br>I don't think you are ready in new relationship as yet. Forget about meeting new girls for the time being.<br><br>I see it that you've lost confidence in yourself already. Go out and make new friends first. If not in school then outside, but don't mix with the baddies. Friends who accept you as who you are, friends who can give you confidence. Do you have any CS buddies? Is CS=counterstrike?</div></blockquote>Hi raingal,<br><br>It's not so much about the feelings, but rather the special intimate moments that we once shared, that makes it so unfortable.<br><br>The words and things I should have and should not have done, now then i realised. I often daydream about myself doing romantic things with her, dancing, sharing intimate moments again. I try as hard as possible not to daydream about such things and shrug it off, but its difficult. It keeps coming at me.<br><br>It's like the plug to your heart has suddenly been pulled out. That heartbeat just went dead. For the past year, i've been searching for a new plug, no to no avail. No new plug seems to fit like the old one. I have told myself to move on many times, but I just simply can't. As bad it may sound, I guess the best thing to do would to be surround myself with new friends and meet new girls. But then as one gets older, maintaining old relationships and making new friends just seem to be so difficult.<br><br>You are right, I am not ready for a new relationship. As much as I yearn for one, I would only be unfair to the other party. I do not wish to be hurt or hurt anyone again.<br><br>Yes CS=counterstrike. CS buddies? not really. Although I have been csing with my clan for 1 year +, most of them are only hi and bye friends. Can't really clique I guess. From a malay/chinese mix clan, to now mostly all chinese speaking guys +  1 malay. -__-<br><br>Jiang hua yu ah..How I wish sometimes I was brought up speaking chinese.<br><br>Well, since im going to NS soon (20th August), I might as well forget about getting involved in relationships first, but rather build a solid social circle first.<br>I have already planned to furthur my studies, preferbably locally. Study in a new enviroment (unlike f*ked up NYP), make new friends.<br><br>I am still in contact with my ex though.<br><br>From lovers we were, to become best friends. Best friends i could not. Missed me she did, Loved her i still do. Get her heart back i did not, new guys she met and about me, she soon forgot. Till this day only 2 things remain, Hurt and regret left untamed.<br></div>
