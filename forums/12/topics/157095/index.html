            <div class='col-md body'>u probably wont belive this but its so true. ive consulted many doctors about my rare case and many of them are still uncertain about what the causes are, its not heditary or passed on by anyone. they say ive got approx 10 more years to live.. if im lucky 15 more years.<br><br>i look normal. if u see me on the streets u wouldnt sense anything strange about me. but the truth is, i have 'superpowers' and it's killing me.<br><br>when i was seven i discovered by chance that my body is 'magnetic'. it's able to suck metallic things onto it unconsciously. my bodily growth is abnormally fast too.. right now i might be 19 years old but i look like a matured adult and i am 1.92m tall.<br><br>doctors told me the iron level in my body is abnormally high and its health threatening so im taking some sort of medication to 'control' my iron level. my bones are also extremely hard.. its not like a normal person. although my skin is like a normal person and i feel pain, my arm is actually harder than a softball bat made of metal. when i was in sec school i got hit hard on it and i only suffered from a few bruises. i was shocked when i saw a dent in the bat.<br><br>im planning to go for further check up.. i think my bones are made up of metal. only reason it can be that tough and can attract metallic objects.<br><br>my 'superpower' is that i can magnetise metallic objects. when my brain tells me to, and sends impulses i am able to attract and repel magnets. i know u wont believe this but right now, i can suspend a 500g piece of metal in mid air using my powers using repulsion. my magnetic nature can also be used to induce positive and negative charges whenever i want to.. my family were all fearful of this so they kept all metallic objects away from me as they knew i could easily use it as a weapon when i get angry.<br><br>now the problem is.. im beginning to experience pain all over my body. apprantly, my private doc has found out that despite being over the puberty age, my bones are STILL continuing to grow regardless of my fixed body shape.. its causing ugly tears in my flesh and skin. now i can see a couple of cracks here and there. its ugly yes, that is why i wear long sleeves now. his prediction is that sooner or later, my ribcage will expand and eventually destroy my heart if nothing is done to stop it.<br><br>i have only about 10 more years to live!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>i checked my family history. NONE of my parents or ancestors have this problem. only my closest friend knows about my condition and that im going to die! if i continue to grow even at 19 years old at this amazingly fast rate, i will reach 2m tall in no time.. im only 8cm away from that.<br><br>do not ask about my sex organs.. its big i agree but it has lost its function and im very sad about it. the high iron content in me has caused my testicles to produce defective sperms.. its quite toxic and i do not dare to engage in any sexual activity. i dont want my child to be like me.<br><br>life is so miserable for me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway, just in case it's true, you should consider what you want to do by now.  Getting a job and slogging it out 9 to 5 doesn't really sound appealing right now, so you gotta think hard about your future. Be it helping other people or setting up an awareness or special centre for this rare disease, it's really up to you.  Believe it or not, I have been given a 2nd chance in life too and people won't even begin to treasure life until they nearly lose it. Reproductive or not, you should really really treasure companionship, who says getting a girlfriend/wife must have kids?! Just enjoy what you have now 'cause you will see life in a whole new way.<br><br>Sorry, one last dig, if you focus real hard, can you levitate yourself?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I doubt what the doctor say its correct. I remember the new paper reported a man in Ipoh who had similar powers like you. He was 69 years old when they reported about him. The strage thing was, he can attract ANY form of metal to his body including steel. But he isnt as tall as you. only 1.68m tall. And he looks healthy from what I see in the papers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I advice you to come out to the public. Your condition is rare but can give light to education public &amp; medical.<br><br>By coming out, you will have more confidence in yourself. Your pain in silence will be lighten. You will live much happier &amp; longer by coming out to public I believe. Remember every living is born deeply intact with death. No one escape. It's not how longer, it's the jouney that makes life brillant.<br><br>Being at 19 &amp; told you have 10 more years to go is something hard to swollow. Make good use of your time. I am sure you are not the first one to be able to attract Iron or metal stuff. Many like you have come out to public's eye. You can also. You have my best wishes.</div>
