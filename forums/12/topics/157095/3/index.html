NONE of my parents or ancestors have this problem. only my closest friend knows about my condition and that im going to die! if i continue to grow even at 19 years old at this amazingly fast rate, i will reach 2m tall in no time.. im only 8cm away from that.<br><br>do not ask about my sex organs.. its big i agree but it has lost its function and im very sad about it. the high iron content in me has caused my testicles to produce defective sperms.. its quite toxic and i do not dare to engage in any sexual activity. i dont want my child to be like me.<br><br>life is so miserable for me. </div></blockquote>you dun talk crap here la...as if we can help you...anyway st making a fool out of yrself leh so funny leh! anyway if u really have only 10 more yrs to live...u can actually be an ironman for the rest of yr life! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> go eradicate the evils friend...dun make me laugh here ironman...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some people live longer than you yet find no meaning in living. Find fun and meanings in your life.<br><br>Be it 10, 20 or 30 more years. It doesn't matter. Lightning might struck me, a car might bang me when I cross the roads, so why do I still bother living? I might as well just jump down a hig-rise building or eat tons of sleeping pills.<br><br>Why do I still walk around looking at different people and things that never fail to amaze me? Why do I study the actions of the hundreds of people that walk past me everyday. Its the curiousity in me that keeps me living. I want to keep finding new things, I want to experience stuff never done before. I want to know of places in the world even if it means through cable tv. --.--<br><br>Humans ain't fools when they run or play about in the rain, when they go to haunted places late at night, when they scream loudly in the middle of nowhere. They are in fact experiencing whats never been done before. And they enjoy doing it even if they look like idiots.<br><br>Make every second count even when you are about to sleep. Thats my philosphy. Thats all matters.</div>
