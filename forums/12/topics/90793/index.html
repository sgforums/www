Its their love life afterall. The lack of wisdom is something NOT simple talking-about-it could help in anyway. I long made my choice if my parents were to have their marriage break up in anyway - I will live myself (or with my mum. - Moon in 4th house contribute that influence).<br><br>However, in your case, your only direct approach would be to speak to him personally and privately first before you gauge your other moves. My dad can't lie to me for I would detect it through my own means - you have to focus on the body language and see how much information you can squeeze from the first confrontation because don't expect anything much after this. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
