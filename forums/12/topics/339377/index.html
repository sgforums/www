              <p>hi, i've been in love with this girl for the pass 1 year and 5 months. we actually had something for each other when we first met, but i soon slowly found out that she couldnt get over her ex-bf. that bf wasnt her first, so i must be guessing he left a mega impression on her. well she's beautiful and she's german/chinese. she's a year younger than me but it seems like she's 4 years older because of how difficult she is. eventhough we made out once, she told me in a nice way that "im not her ex-bf", obviously saying tht i have no chance with her.</p>
              <p>NEED ADVICE! ive been trying to forget her by trying with other girls, but she keeps on sticking in my mind. im not saying i want her to forget her ex for my sake. i just neeed advice generally</p>

              <p>"letting nature take its course" does not necessarily equate to laziness.</p>
              <p>laziness only applies to one who does nothing at all, and just waits for result.</p>
              <p>"letting nature take its course" in its right context should mean " do whatever you can, and accept the result no matter how it turns out at the end".</p>

              <p>hi, i've been in love with this girl for the pass 1 year and 5
              months. we actually had something for each other when we first met,
              but i soon slowly found out that she couldnt get over her ex-bf.
              that bf wasnt her first, so i must be guessing he left a mega
              impression on her. well she's beautiful and she's german/chinese.
              she's a year younger than me but it seems like she's 4 years older
              because of how difficult she is. eventhough we made out once, she
              told me in a nice way that "im not her ex-bf", obviously saying tht
              i have no chance with her.</p>
              <p>NEED ADVICE! ive been trying to forget her by trying with other
              girls, but she keeps on sticking in my mind. im not saying i want
              her to forget her ex for my sake. i just neeed advice generally</p>

              <p>u hav to giv her some time, it's not easy for gals to forget person, let alone a person who had many shared memories with her</p>
              <p>if u really hav feelings for her, juz be patient and treat her well, by her side, sooner or later she'll be drawn to u (provided u 2 hav some chemistry like wat u said).</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>So im guessing the ex bf made her feel special/loved at some point in time. That was just like me for one particular stituation, i was totally in love with my 1st ex gf (we dated when i was 17 and she was 16) like six years back. I was dating this singaporean chick for almost two years (we broke up last year), I would always think that this singaporean chick was my 1st ex gf. Somehow I couldn't get over her but in the end I managed to get over her. I don't know and I don't know why.</p></div>
