              <p>Well things basically like this...</p>
              <p>I realised i've been losing alot of drive in my work. Somehow just felt that i lack the drive to chiong in my work. Few years back starting frm when i was in the 2nd yr of my army, i had lotsa drive and pride in my work. But as i ORD and starting really working in the outside world, started to feel that the drive within me to excel and to produce excellent work seems to be slowly going off. Many times i just feel that im totally sapped off my energy and comes to work like very lifeless.</p>
              <p>I do not have much idea why it is like this but somehow i always felt that my contributions are not appreciated and its been like this since my prev job. Not sure if this is causing me to lose my drive and everyday i feel that i am just working -studying - spending time with gf and the cycle kind of repeats. Felt like taking a break but financially speaking im unable to do that. Gf has been supportive of me and spending time with her do liven my mood but i somehow still feel a lack of drive.</p>
              <p>My current job is actually quite ok as in it is not particularly stressful, just some office politics here and there which i assume it is pretty common everywhere. I do get to knock off on time at least but i am still feeling erm... very out of drive. It feels like something is not quite right. So i would wanna ask you guys for some advice here.</p>

              <p>You need <strong>three</strong> things to gain personal satisfaction from the work you do.</p>
              <p><strong>Purpose</strong> - What meaning does the work you perform have? Does it make someone out there smile? Does it help your company in one of its decision-making processes? Think about it why you're doing the work you do.</p>
              <p><strong>Mastery</strong> - Is your work mind-stimulating, challenging and gets tougher over time? Or is it dull and repeatative? If it's the same task all the time, you can try challenging yourself by setting goals for yourself (complete in shorter time, 5% increase from last month etc.). All you have to remember, is to strive to do better (or suck less) each time, no matter what it is - and don't forget to reward yourself if you do exceed your own expectations.</p>
              <p><strong>Autonomy</strong> - Is there something stopping you from doing your work in a better way? Or you've been thinking about an exciting project but are currently buried under piles of unrelated work? Talk to your superior and see if you can work things out with him/her.</p>

              <p><br>Already picked up some hobbies but somehow i find that life has been repetitative which is like -work-lesson-accompany gf-accompany family... somehow felt it was jus getting mroe and more mundane... my job in itself is supposed to be fun and active but well... some other ppl who likes control jus somehow took control of my position and alter-ed its job scope. Furthermore my immediate superior has been changing frequently and so i believe by nature my job is not all that bad. It is just some ppl who changed my job scope which eventually i believe did helped to kill my drive.</p>
              <p>Alex - Yes my job does have a purpose and to me, quite a meaningful one and it is really a first step to where i want to be. As for Mastery, my job is supposed to be quite active where i do lots of event management and human management and lots of outdoor activity. It shld not be that repetative but well... i tink i nid to explain a little further. I actually shld belong to department "A" but under my organisation chart, i am actually classified under "B" group of staff. while my basic job scope dictates that im to be doing things related to department "A", the ppl frm group "B" basically make me do their job also while decreasing my involvement for department "A" stuffs. Furthermore i had frequent changes of my immediate superior which is the head of department "A". Basically ppl jus come in conveniently change my job scope and it changed from a active job to a repetative desk bound job which is not what i came in for initially. Since my job scope isn't really that clear,basically everyone just throw me whatever job they "think" that i shld be doing and just asks me to do it. There isn't really anyone or anything who is stopping me from increasing my efficiency well because they like to give me last min deadlines like collation of data for over 1k ppl in 1 afternoon or 1 day. Sometimes it just gets mentally straining to look that the things that are given to me to do.</p>

              <p>Well things basically like this...</p>
              <p>I realised i've been losing alot of drive in my work. Somehow just felt that i lack the drive to chiong in my work. Few years back starting frm when i was in the 2nd yr of my army, i had lotsa drive and pride in my work. But as i ORD and starting really working in the outside world, started to feel that the drive within me to excel and to produce excellent work seems to be slowly going off. Many times i just feel that im totally sapped off my energy and comes to work like very lifeless.</p>
              <p>I do not have much idea why it is like this but somehow i always felt that my contributions are not appreciated and its been like this since my prev job. Not sure if this is causing me to lose my drive and everyday i feel that i am just working -studying - spending time with gf and the cycle kind of repeats. Felt like taking a break but financially speaking im unable to do that. Gf has been supportive of me and spending time with her do liven my mood but i somehow still feel a lack of drive.</p>
              <p>My current job is actually quite ok as in it is not particularly stressful, just some office politics here and there which i assume it is pretty common everywhere. I do get to knock off on time at least but i am still feeling erm... very out of drive. It feels like something is not quite right. So i would wanna ask you guys for some advice here.</p>

              <p>Well, since you miss and lost the drive, you can do some partime driving, like chauffeur, pubs' velvet, or taxis driving, that might help you to drive on.</p>
