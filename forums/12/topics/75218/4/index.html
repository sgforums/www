Thought of letting people post all the help lines and such in this thread...</div></blockquote>Seems u have a very kind heart to reach out to those who r troubled or thinking of ending their lives. I am also one of those too . last few years ago, i was very very depressed that i actually committed suicide on few occasions but yet i ended up in hospital n the hopsital actually reported to the police abt my attempted suicide. I hate those doctors for reporting to police but later i realised it was for my own good. then i underwent lots of counsellings sessions with my former church counsellers til one year plus. So now i am feeling better for soem times but again i am getting more frustrated with my current marital problem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My personal opinion:<br>999 will consider you more as a "nuisance caller" but nevertheless they will engage you in conversation till help comes. 995 will be a better option as they can come with medical specialists and tranqs to knock you out in case you do something stupid. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Lastly, these are the 2 24 hour emergency services should all else fails.<br><br>Nevertheless, do call someone and anyone if you really need a helping hand.
