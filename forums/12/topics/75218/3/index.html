            <div class='col-md body'>Im 20 yrs old this year and i know i cant say i know what is love.a year ago when i was still workin i met this guy who is 15 yrs my senior.He happens to be a business partner of my elder brother.He started out bein very sweet to me and callin me daily to talk to me about almost jus everythin under the sun.We did had lots of fun talkin cos our characters could click pretty well.but i knew he was married and i told him i cannot possibly think of me more than a friend.I felt i was doin the right thing.Months later, we are still talkin on the phone and he still visits me at work becos he says he likes me and he misses me very much.<br><br>Then he told me he's a divorced man not married.and if i wil still be willin to take him.Of cos at that point of time,i like him alot.much more than i probably should i guess.So i agreed to be with him.then a month into the relationship i started hearin bout him bein still married.i fell out with my elder brother cos of him and we dont talk to each other anymore now..cos my elder bro is still mad at me for bein with him.He cannot forgive me.even my parents.my friends.<br><br>my boyfriend then told me that he wasnt exactly divorced.he was jus seperated from his wife.he told me he didnt marry her cos he loved her.he cared for her yes but from the first year they were together..he'd been askin for a divorce but she wouldnt agree.so they lived apart.i believed him and continued being with him.i didnt mind.later on,he told me he wants to break off with me cos he doesnt want to hurt me anymore.he thinks its unfair to me and that he doesnt want me to waste my time on him anymore.he says that its better that i find someone else who can promise me what he cannot.he then said the reason why he didnt pursue the matter on the divorce is cos he knew he didnt have the courage to.he doesnt know how to face the family on both sides if he really does that.he doesnt wish to go thru questionings and those guilt they may inflict on him.i told him i dun care if he divorced cos by then i've already fallen very much in love with him.i m willin to go thru anything.i dun mind.<br><br>his attitude towards me have been up and down these two weeks.sometimes he is very passionate and makes me feel as if he really is willin to do anythin for me.sometimes he says very mean thing to me and it hurts me alot.i really hurt a lot when he says those things.i dun blame him i jus cannot help feelin the hurt.im confused by his moods.he doesnt have a new girl frend that i know cos wherever he is even if he';s overseas he willl call me and constantly messages me all thru the day to tell me what he's doin.i do trust him with what he tells me cos i really have thrown in all i have for this relationship.im only worried if he still loves me or if he has already grown tired of this relationship cos of the stress and burdens it brings.<br><br>he is very busy with his business and he's also a performer so he hardly has time for me.thou wherever he goes and whatever he does he will call me and tells me about it,i really have very little information bout him.<br><br>i have asked bout his home number before but he doesnt wish to reveal.he thinks there's no need to.i didnt push it.i jus let it go cos i dun like to force information out of people.m i very stupid?mayb i should have asked more.the only way i can find him is thru his mobile.that's all.i duno where he stays.only the area not the real address.why so?is he lyin to me?i trust him but can i?<br><br>now..more months into our relationship and every two days he would say he wants to break up.i dun understand thou i never once blame or got mad at him.i jus asked him why.but usually in the end..we didnt end up breakin off.he said he loves me very much and he's worried ill leave him for another better guy one day.point is i understand when he said he's riskin everythin on the line to love me.cos his business is indeed takin a very bad turn since i've been with him.his business partners dun agree on our relationship.i keep reassurin him but sometimes i dun know how to handle the sudden emotions outburst of his moods tellin him he cant take the stress he wants out.i dun understand and i duno how to handle it.<br><br>he cried when i said i cant take it anymore and i wanna go.that was the one and only time i initate a break up but he begged me not to go and cried.he even brought up all the promises i said to him before.i didnt leave him then.and i never brought up that subject ever again.he told me he cannot lose me.he says he doesnt mean to be moody and stressed up and initates break ups all the time.he jus wans my assurance when ever i pacify him and tell him i love him and that i dun wanna break off.he felt reassured.<br><br>im only 20.im willin to put up with alot of things for him but i just wan to be sure that he loves me and he means it.i dun wanna love someone who doesnt love me.i dun mind money i can feed myself.i just feel very bogged down by unknowns.i duno why despite how much i love him,he still wans to break off every once in a while and i must cry so much each time for him to see that in fact he cant bear to leave me either.his wife told him in the face that she will stab him and me to death if she ever sees us together.i have no one to turn to or talk to about this becos they;ve all fallen out with me over him.i have no one else left.and what hurts me most is that he keeps sayin he wans out once in a while.but he says he loves me.he says he has to leave me cos he doesnt wan to hurt me.he doesnt wan me to go thru anytin for him.he is afraid to be hurt should i leave him someday.what should i say to him?what can i do?<br><br>thou ive been with him so long,he has never disrespected me.i dun sleep with him.and he doesnt mind.he doesnt force nor ask nor gets angry over it.he says he wil only do it to me when he can marry me and give me a family.<br><br>there're guys who like me.but i dun go out nor talk to them.i stay home and quit my job cos he feels insecure.i dun go out with frends cos he worries i might run off with another guy.i have done all i could think of.just today..he wants to leave me again cos of a guy.that guy works somewhere near the mall next to my place.he keeps followin me around and leavin things at my doorstep.buyin me breakfast lunches and dinners leavin them outside.he even sends me free mobiles.i didnt take them but my boyfriend hates it and blames me for it.i have tried my best.i feel so bad.i don't know how to please him.Can u help me?now my brother is warnin me he'll beat him up if i still dun leave him.the people i know hates him and he hates them.im stuck in between tryin to pacify both sides.i m not workin now and i have got bills to pay but he doesnt like me workin in places where guys can get to talk or know me.i understand where he's comin from but i really need someone to help me.i love him.and thou he wants to support me.i dun wan to take his money.i dun wan his family to think im with him cos he's flithy rich.they think im a 20yr old girl just hankerin after his money.<br><br>thank you for ur time.i

i love him,he still wans to break off every once in a while and i must cry so much each time for him to see that in fact he cant bear to leave me either.his wife told him in the face that she will stab him and me to death if she ever sees us together.i have no one to turn to or talk to about this becos they;ve all fallen out with me over him.i have no one else left.and what hurts me most is that he keeps sayin he wans out once in a while.but he says he loves me.he says he has to leave me cos he doesnt wan to hurt me.he doesnt wan me to go thru anytin for him.he is afraid to be hurt should i leave him someday.what should i say to him?what can i do?<br><br>thou ive been with him so long,he has never disrespected me.i dun sleep with him.and he doesnt mind.he doesnt force nor ask

I agree with sacredspirits.<br><br>Life is about choices. If you choose to be like this or like that, its all depends on your moral values or attitude that you believe in. So, at the end, nobody can really adjust or change your situation and condition, whether the end result is good or bad, accept your own self. And that particular individual must be willing to change for himself or for herself. All of us learn from our own mistakes and often we also learn from other people mistakes. That is the way we learn, develop and gain knowledge or experiences. That is when growth burgeon within yourself takes place. Life is about growing up and change.<br><br>So, a suicidal individual need to know that their life is meaningful when they are willing to change and face whatever mayhem that lies ahead of them. That is when they really need to communicate with other people to understand the meaning of their existence and why their life is valuable, not worthless.<br><br>Thanks for the insight sacredspirits.<br><br>Joe</div>
