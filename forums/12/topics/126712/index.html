If this matters a lot to you, i think you shld meet her up and clear up the air. But, of course, let your gf know abt your meeting. Unless you still show signs of thinking of your ex, I dun think any girl will mind.</div>

If she's truly agreeable to it, then maybe you can just meet up with your ex for 'dun know wat'.... But if she minds, kindly try to respect her decision as you also don't know what for you need to meet up with your ex yeah...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Meeting up for a catching up session is nothing wrong. Of course, i think you should at least tell your current gf abt the meeting. If she have trust in you, she shouldn't have any doubts abt your feelings or have the unnecessary emotion of jealousness.<br><br>Just my 2 cents, hope it helps..</div>
