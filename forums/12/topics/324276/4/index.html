              <p><br>maxmax12, I think if you really want to know how the universe is being created, then I believe that is a question which you need to ask GOD.</p>
              <p>You may find that your faith relies heavily on facts, and things that you can see, understand, touch physically. But I can tell you if you really need to justify your faith based on all these factors, then you might just be trying to trick and convince yourself that your faith to your religion is real.</p>
              <p>True faith is like a feeling of LOVE. You can't explain why and what and how you can fall in love with another individual, and neither can you explain the terms "Love at First Sight".</p>
              <p>Faith itself is as close as feelings of LOVE, and if you really need to evidence to convince and persuade yourself that your faith is real, then I can tell you that your faith is made-up...it isn't true faith that you are feeling for your religion. This applies to all faith in all religions.</p>
              <p>And one more thing that you need to understand, humans cannot become GOD and can never even come close enough to become a GOD. Whichever religion promises you with "promised powers" are simply feeding on your weakness known as GREED.</p>
              <p>But I can guarantee you one thing that I know is true, GOD is real and GOD exists, regardless of how hard you can try to deny the existence of GOD, and when you read this post, you will know that I'm telling you the truth.</p>
              <p>If your current religion doesn't fills you up completely and you still have that empty feelings lingering inside your heart, it doesn't means your astral powers are not good enough, it just means that you are still deviated from the real religion which you need to fill up that empty gap in your heart and soul.</p>
              <p>You may not believe me, but I've long filled up that missing gap in my heart and soul with my faith in GOD.</p>
              <p>Of course I'm not going to tell you which church I'm in, or else I might get raped.</p>

              <p>taken from parn phrase: You may find that your faith relies heavily on facts, and things

              <p><br>of cause i need to use facts and science to support my points <strong>if not people will claim i am talking rubbish</strong> and astral projection is not really about facts needed to understand no doubt u need skills to do astral projection and other astral abbilites and you need to train your astral skills up too (its not so simple)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>because those astral books,teachings,etc can only teach u how to get out of your body and connect,heal,etc. but they cant teach u how to move around (base on indivial beings),they cant teach you how to explore around,etc etc etc</p>
              <p>its all up to your self(soul) to do that and learn it yourself (even i cant teach u how to fly) but i can float (fly) myself in astral form</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but since u blame me on facts,i want to know how realiable is the bible? how accurate is the sayings?</p>

              <p>isnt this a many sided conflict? because science itself cannot explain much for astral projection</p>

              <p><br>maxmax12, it doesn't matter which church I'm currently attending as I do not represent my church and neither do I speak on their behalf. There are many believers of Christ in church and I will not judge their faith in GOD.</p>
              <p>My faith represents my walk in life with GOD and every believers of Christ walked a different path to seek the same GOD.</p>
              <p>Science can never prove a religion, the more evidence that people seek from science to justify a religion, the less faith those people would have in their lives. Christianity have left it's undeniable footprint on human race and it has been passed down and populated over generations, leaving a very strong lineage among human race.</p>
              <p>You don't even need to be a regular, normal human to seek GOD in your lives, all you need is the willingness and desire and thirst to know more about GOD, pray and beg GOD to reveal, help, guide you into knowing more about GOD's love for you. Your sincere and genuine prayer will definitely be answered, and you will know it.</p>
              <p>Since you, maxmax12 have your own astral projection beliefs. Does your beliefs prevents you from returning back to GOD again?</p>
              <p>If no, I would encourage you to pray to GOD and speak to GOD and tell GOD that you need GOD's help to return back to GOD's LOVE again.</p>
              <p>GOD will help you to realise your own talents and will use you to love other people and also for GOD's greater glory.</p>

              <p>u said that:</p>
              <p>Since you, maxmax12 have your own astral projection beliefs.
                                      Does your beliefs prevents you from returning back to GOD
                                      again?</p>
              <p>If no, I would encourage you to pray to GOD and speak to GOD and
                                      tell GOD that you need GOD's help to return back to GOD's LOVE
                                      again.</p>
              <p>guess what? i have been with higher souls(A.K.A god) always just that in astral way of things</p>
              <p>even with Sananda (jesus)</p>
              <p>they are indeed powerful beings too</p>
              <p>its not about returning back to god in church way as i have always been with higher souls</p>
              <p>i am not a channeler yet so i cant speak to god directly but base on other channelers they help send msgs down to earth form the cosmic(universe)</p>
              <p>and what about christans? i doubt they even heard of channeling with god (of cause some heard of it) and some christans are just christan for the sake of being christans and not for god due to family,friends,etc etc etc (they need help)</p>
              <p>u said more science = less faith in god?</p>
              <p>totally not true u know... i have faith too (thats how i get my gf)</p>
              <p>i requested my guides and helpers and protectors(christ view point:The Holy Spirt) for my soul mate and everything worked out (i am still with my gf/soulmate) well</p>
              <p>i use some science to help support some astral system  ( they dun help much u know?)</p>
              <p>just to prevent people for claiming that i talk rubbish</p>
              <p>i am here to help those to seek and understand the universe in a better way and seek higher souls (god) and well... maybe even to become like them someday</p>
              <p>u get my point parn?</p>

              <p>Death is something that is unexpectable and as the saying goes, death may rob a person at night.. at a time that is least expected. I'm sure everyone fears it, even those who are suicidal, although their thoughts are clouded by negative thoughts, they are afraid of death.</p>
              <p>but.. in my opinion, there's no such worry if we had tried our best in achieving our goals and appreciating each and everyone that is around us..</p>
