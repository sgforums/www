              <p>maxmax12, I'm only sharing from my own perspective and it has nothing to do with any churches.</p>
              <p>Christianity is not about gathering people and trying to convert them in the name of GOD, it is about helping each and every humans that was created in GOD's image and grace to find their own salvation in their lives with GOD.</p>
              <p>Why do people live in this world? What is their purpose here during their lifetime of living? Are they here to earn alot of money? Are they here to be smarter than anyone else? Are they here to be famous? Are they here to be someone great? The answer is NO, people are here to find their way back to GOD's Graces by seeking their own salvation with GOD. GOD loves each and everyone of us even before we know GOD and even before we were even born.</p>
              <p>maxmax12, I'm able to tell you this because I've found my own salvation in my life with GOD and I can tell you 100% that GOD exists and GOD is real. GOD is always watching over us and protecting us and loving us. GOD will still love you even if you're denying him right now, all you need to do is to seek GOD whole-heartedly and pray to GOD and GOD will give you the attention that you seek.</p>
              <p>Sadly your astral projection only gives you the illusion of obtaining some form of higher power. It does not promotes love and does not make its believers a better person. Humans are borned, created by another humans and can never become GOD and will never be comparable to GOD. If your religion promised you that you can become a greater or higher power than GOD, then I'm afraid your own inner insecurity and greed has been preyed upon by other entities that is of suspicious nature and it isn't the truth and definitely isn't from GOD. We are all borned with the ability to love and not with the ability to become a higher power or even anywhere near or comparable to GOD.</p>
              <p>I'm not surprised that you have left Christianity and chose to seek other methods to satisfy your own inner thirst to find the meaning of your life. You need to let go of your pride and be able to humble yourself when you're seeking GOD's guidance. Humble is the first lesson that you need to learn in order to accept GOD into your heart and the ability to be humbled before GOD brings about the obedience to hear and understands GOD's words. If you find that I am right about you, please do open up your heart and humbled yourself in your own quiet time and seek GOD whole-heartedly. And I can guarantee you that GOD will not forsaken your request to seek GOD.</p>
              <p>Christianity is the path and relationship that is shared only between you and GOD. And it is how you have chosen to spend your lives and time to live your life with GOD under GOD's guidance and LOVE. And it is also the journey that you have chosen to love GOD whole-heartedly and to obey GOD.</p>
              <p>I am sad to see that you have been misguided and disppointed by the churches which you have attended and I urged you not to lose your faith in Christianity. Churches is a place where people gathered to worship GOD, and unfortunately no churches is a perfect church in this world. No church leaders is the perfect living example for Christianity, and I hope you can understand what I'm trying to tell you. Churches are full of sinners and that is the truth. </p>
              <p>If you find that your astral projection does not satisfy your soul and your faith, I can tell you the answer why you are feeling this way and unsatisfied. Humans are not wise enough to govern themselves, Humans are meant to obey GOD, Humans are not meant to be GOD. There will be times where you are lost and doubtful and uncertain of your own decision and your future, and this is so because you have tried to govern your life based on your own limited wisdom and you felt that it has failed you on many occasions. The more you tried to govern your own life, the more you will feel that your life is sinking into the depths of helplessness which not even your own astral projection is able to lift you out of your own dive.</p>
              <p>Only by obeying and guidance from GOD are you able to lift yourself out of your own spiritual dilemma and change yourself to be a better person in life and to the people that you loved. We all need guidance from GOD and wisdom does not comes from within ourselves, it has to be obtained and learnt from GOD's guidance and grace.</p>
              <p>I hope you can give yourself another chance and accept Christianity again. Read the Bible and spend some quiet time alone seeking GOD and praying to GOD for guidance and GOD's LOVE. And I hope that one day your eyes will be open like me when you have found your own salvation in life through GOD. Your world will never be the same again and you will never be the same too, cos you will be transformed from the inside out and reborn again to be a better person than you can never imagined yourself to be.</p>
              <p>I'm not lying, and I can guarantee you 100% that GOD does exists in this world. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> </p>

              <p>well parn plz read this</p>
              <p>u are one of those rare christans that talk more sense compared to other half hearted christans</p>
              <p>i do agree with u at some point and of cause not for other points</p>
              <p>parn u meantion that</p>
              <p>I am sad to see that you have been misguided and disppointed by the churches which you have attended and I urged you not to lose your faith in Christianity. Churches is a place where people gathered to worship GOD, and unfortunately no churches is a perfect church in this world.

              <p>100% true with that u said about that even churchs fight over churchs and other realigon fight over other realigon to try to gain more people</p>
              <p>u did meantion about</p>
              <p>Humans are meant to obey GOD, Humans are not meant to be GOD. There will be times where you are lost and doubtful and uncertain of your own decision and your future, and this is so because you have tried to govern your life based on your own limited wisdom and you felt that it has failed you on many occasions.

              <p>i have to both agree and disagree with u (i am still with u in view of god i just want to make things clearer in both view)</p>
              <p>u meantion that we need to well obey god</p>
              <p>there are souls that need realigon to help them and base on true story a friend of mine called terrence from chc use to be a day light street pick pocketer</p>
              <p>but after he met christ, he changed ( in that way, realigon is good for his soul)</p>
              <p>useing the example of primary sch, secondary sch and jc and Uni</p>
              <p>primary are like for lost souls (people like terrence who have no realigon)</p>
              <p>and terrence moved from primary to secondary sch where realigon (for his case christ helped him)</p>
              <p>secondary sch are more for people like u parn where u seek realigon (which is good at some point especially for those at the primary sch level)</p>
              <p>jc are for astral projector who commucate with god and other races out there and seek help from them</p>
              <p>for uni case, its like god level or similar to that level where u belong to higher souls (its not easy to get here) </p>
              <p>there are even higher levels then god's level but i do not have much info on that for now but from what i know even god seek the even higher souls/being for advics or help</p>
              <p>the problem about this system is that people who have a realigon in the secondary sch system when they are fit to leave it and upgrade themselve to a jc, they refuse to leave task its bad for their soul where parn i feel that u are stuck here (includeing many more people)</p>
              <p>i do belive in god even in christ and hilarion,etc BUT i refer them to as higher souls that help humans at this current universe in this SOL system (earth is located in the sol system)</p>
              <p>why? becuase as a astral projector, u can leave your body and come out as your soul and beable to even talk to god yourself and of cause fly around, explore the universe, and do many other more stuff</p>
              <p>u see your human body is like a spaceship and the soul (YOU) is the captain of the ship</p>
              <p>when your human body die, the soul doesnt die. thats where afterlife begins</p>
              <p>the advantage of an astral projector compared to an untrain normal human being(i meantion untrain as IT CAN BE TRAIN) is that astral projector can come out as their SOUL form in the concious mind where elce like any other normal human beings,can only come out as your soul form when u are sleeping and most of the time u reamember very little details or no details of what had happen during your sleep (from now on try recalling your dreams parn)</p>
              <p>in other words, u can be an astral projector and christan at the same time (u got an advantage of commucating with god compared to others) but as for me, i choose to upgrade myself and i still have my guides (my gurdain angels protecting me,my life planners, planning what is to come next for me,etc)</p>
              <p>but since this is all said u notice i never meantion the bible?</p>
              <p>why? cause i belive that its being made by humans</p>
              <p>let me quoto a phrase from the bible itself</p>
              <p>u reamember about god saying</p>
              <p>let there be light, and about him createing earth in 7 days?</p>
              <p>but have the bible ever meantion about other planets,life,souls out there? and do u know there are BILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF OTHER PLANETS OUT THERE!!!</p>
              <p>how can earth be the only planet that supports life compared to billions and trillions of planets,stars out there? (i have met other being while doing astral projection)</p>
              <p>see the good points of it parn?</p>
              <p>parn u have said</p>
              <p>Sadly your astral projection only gives you the illusion of obtaining some form of higher power. It does not promotes love and does not make its believers a better person. Humans are borned, created by another humans and can never become GOD and will never be comparable to GOD. If your religion promised you that you can become a greater or higher power than GOD, then I'm afraid your own inner insecurity and greed has been preyed upon by other entities that is of suspicious nature and it isn't the truth and definitely isn't from GOD. We are all borned with the ability to love and not with the ability to become a higher power or even anywhere near or comparable to GOD</p>
              <p>its not illusion my soul friend and u can learn all this powers to help people even healing (i am sure church also have their own system of healing right?)</p>
              <p>u can obtain new skills too and give u ability to explore without anything affecting u,like gravity</p>
              <p>and it does promote love (i got my girlfriend from astral projection after commucating with my guides and helpers [i told them i need a proper {i have many Xs that arent stable in a realasionship}girlfriend/ soul mate] and between me and her, we have some past life issue together but i have yet to do a channeling with jon.C .Fox about me and her with the help of hilarion) how i know, because i can sense the energy from her and the feeling of she's the one [i have not train to do channeling myself and i am forcusing on projection for now]  and yes so far, my current girlfriend is my longest lasting realsionship i have and we are still together and we are going strong [i keep senseing that she was my past life wife or somthing close to it]</p>
              <p>parn u said that humans are born and created by other humans, yes just like spaceship! they are being build but the captain is the soul itself </p>
              <p>and as i have said before astral projection is not really a realigon its the universe system that not only governs earth but the other billions and trillions of planets and stars and life out there and if u wonder where does god come in, they come in to guide u, but normally for a single soul like me and u, each one of us have a set of team to protect us,guide as,plan our life known as guides and helpers (no doubt it seem like god's the one doing the work for u) do u know that are far more powerful higher souls that even your current 'god' seeks to them for advices at times even for very strange hard to answer questions?</p>
              <p>parn i am not doing this to gain money u know?(some other aliens worlds do not even use money because they have upgraded to the level where they have free energy,free food teachnologies,etc,etc,etc and they are super advance race) i am doing this to help other souls upgrade themselves from the current screwed up earth that we live in so that their next life time can have a better life be it on earth or other planets</p>
              <p>well parn i hope u get the msg about this (that churchs will NEVER TELL U)</p>
              <p>i am not against christ soul or other higher souls (i respect them all) but i am against their way of running church (same goes to other realigon i am against some of their teaching) and i come to offer a better way to seek god for humans and gain superpower</p>

              <p>well parn plz read this</p>
              <p>u are one of those rare christans that talk more sense compared to other half hearted christans</p>
              <p>i do agree with u at some point and of cause not for other points</p>
              <p>parn u meantion that</p>
              <p>I am sad to see that you have been misguided and disppointed by the churches which you have attended and I urged you not to lose your faith in Christianity. Churches is a place where people gathered to worship GOD, and unfortunately no churches is a perfect church in this world. No church leaders is the perfect living example for Christianity, and I hope you can understand what I'm trying to tell you. Churches are full of sinners and that is the truth. </p>
              <p>100% true with that u said about that even churchs fight over churchs and other realigon fight over other realigon to try to gain more people</p>
              <p>u did meantion about</p>
              <p>Humans are meant to obey GOD, Humans are not meant to be GOD. There will be times where you are lost and doubtful and uncertain of your own decision and your future, and this is so because you have tried to govern your life based on your own limited wisdom and you felt that it has failed you on many occasions. The more you tried to govern your own life, the more you will feel that your life is sinking into the depths of helplessness which not even your own astral projection is able to lift you out of your own dive.</p>
              <p>i have to both agree and disagree with u (i am still with u in view of god i just want to make things clearer in both view)</p>
              <p>u meantion that we need to well obey god</p>
              <p>there are souls that need realigon to help them and base on true story a friend of mine called terrence from chc use to be a day light street pick pocketer</p>
              <p>but after he met christ, he changed ( in that way, realigon is good for his soul)</p>

              <p>Let me put in my piece without reference to religion.</p>
              <p>Its irrational to fear death.If you die and your consciousness continues after death,all very well and good.If there is no such thing as consciousness after death and you're essentially 'deleted' with no retention of information,yuo don't exist and you're oblivion,so you won't have to be concerned either way.</p>
              <p>But I generally tend to believe there is something after death,a continuation of beyond the physical,material body. So if its helps here's a website that presents empirical evidence of the afterlife.</p>

              <p>useing the example of primary sch, secondary sch and jc and
                  Uni</p>
              <p>primary are like for lost souls (people like terrence who have
                  no realigon)</p>
              <p>and terrence moved from primary to secondary sch where realigon
                  (for his case christ helped him)</p>
              <p>secondary sch are more for people like u parn where u seek
                  realigon (which is good at some point especially for those at the
                  primary sch level)</p>
              <p>jc are for astral projector who commucate with god and other
                  races out there and seek help from them</p>
              <p>for uni case, its like god level or similar to that level where
                  u belong to higher souls (its not easy to get

              <p>there are even higher levels then god's level but i do
                  not have much info on that for now but from what i know
                  even god seek the even higher souls/being for advics or help</p>
              <p>the problem about this system is that people who have a realigon
                  in the secondary sch system when they are fit to leave it and
                  upgrade themselve to a jc, they refuse to leave task its bad
                  for their soul where parn i feel that u are stuck here (includeing
                  many more people)</p>
              <p>i do belive in god even in christ and hilarion,etc BUT i refer
                  them to as higher souls that help humans at this current universe
                  in this SOL system (earth is located in the sol system)</p>
              <p>why? becuase as a astral projector, u can leave your body and
                  come out as your soul and beable to even talk to god yourself and
                  of cause fly around, explore the universe, and do many other more
                  stuff</p>
              <p>u see your human body is like a spaceship and the soul (YOU) is
                  the captain of the ship</p>
              <p>when your human body die, the soul doesnt die. thats where
                  afterlife begins</p>
              <p>the advantage of an astral projector compared to an untrain
                  normal human being(i meantion untrain as IT CAN BE TRAIN) is that
                  astral projector can come out as their SOUL form in the concious
                  mind where elce like any other normal human beings,can only come
                  out as your soul form when u are sleeping and most of the time u
                  reamember very little details or no details of what had happen
                  during your sleep (from now on try recalling your dreams parn)</p>
              <p>in other words, u can be an astral projector and christan at the
                  same time (u got an advantage of commucating with god compared to
                  others) but as for me, i choose to upgrade myself and i still have
                  my guides (my gurdain angels protecting me,my life planners,
                  planning what is to come next for me,etc)</p>
              <p>but since this is all said u notice i never meantion the
                  bible?</p>
              <p>why? cause i belive that its being made by humans</p>
              <p>let me quoto a phrase from the bible itself</p>
              <p>u reamember about god saying</p>
              <p>let there be light, and about him createing earth in 7 days?</p>
              <p>but have the bible ever meantion about other planets,life,souls
                  out there? and do u know there are BILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF OTHER
                  PLANETS OUT THERE!!!</p>
              <p>how can earth be the only planet that supports life compared to
                  billions and trillions of planets,stars out there? (i have met
                  other being while doing astral projection)</p>
              <p>see the good points of it parn?</p>
              <p>parn u have said</p>
              <p>Sadly your astral projection only gives you the illusion of
                  obtaining some form of higher power. It does not promotes love and
                  does not make its believers a better person. Humans are borned,
                  created by another humans and can never become GOD and will
                  never be comparable to GOD. If your religion promised you that you
                  can become a greater or higher power than GOD, then I'm afraid your
                  own inner insecurity and greed has been preyed upon by other
                  entities that is of suspicious nature and it isn't the truth and
                  definitely isn't from GOD. We are all borned with the ability to
                  love and not with the ability to become a higher power or even
                  anywhere near or comparable to GOD</p>
              <p>its not illusion my soul friend and u can learn all this powers
                  to help people even healing (i am sure church also have their own
                  system of healing right?)</p>
              <p>u can obtain new skills too and give u ability to explore
                  without anything affecting u,like gravity</p>
              <p>and it does promote love (i got my girlfriend from astral
                  projection after commucating with my guides and helpers [i told
                  them i need a proper {i have many Xs that arent stable in a
                  realasionship}girlfriend/ soul mate] and between me and her,
                  we have some past life issue together but i have yet to do a
                  channeling with jon.C .Fox about me and her with the help of
                  hilarion) how i know, because i can sense the energy from her
                  and the feeling of she's the one [i have not train to do channeling
                  myself and i am forcusing on projection for now]  and yes so
                  far, my current girlfriend is my longest lasting realsionship i
                  have and we are still together and we are going strong [i keep
                  senseing that she was my past life wife or somthing close to
                  it]</p>
              <p>parn u said that humans are born and created by other humans,
                  yes just like spaceship! they are being build but the captain is
                  the soul itself </p>
              <p>and as i have said before astral projection is not really a
                  realigon its the universe system that not only governs earth
                  but the other billions and trillions of planets and stars and life
                  out there and if u wonder where does god come in, they come in to
                  guide u, but normally for a single soul like me and u, each one of
                  us have a set of team to protect us,guide as,plan our life known as
                  guides and helpers (no doubt it seem like god's the one doing the
                  work for u) do u know that are far more powerful higher souls that
                  even your current 'god' seeks to them for advices at times even for
                  very strange hard to answer questions?</p>
              <p>parn i am not doing this to gain money u know?(some other aliens
                  worlds do not even use money because they have upgraded to the
                  level where they have free energy,free food
                  teachnologies,etc,etc,etc and they are super advance race) i am
                  doing this to help other souls upgrade themselves from the current
                  screwed up earth that we live in so that their next life time can
                  have a better life be it on earth or other planets</p>
              <p>well parn i hope u get the msg about this (that churchs will
                  NEVER TELL U)</p>
              <p>i am not against christ soul or other higher souls (i respect
                  them all) but i am against their way of running church (same
                  goes to other realigon i am against some of their
                  teaching) and i come to offer a better way to seek god for
                  humans and gain superpower</p>

              <p>lol..</p>
              <p>U into the 2012 ? Crop circles , reptillian creatures and something massive that is gonna change our genetic codes ?</p>
              <p>Astral Projections ? Bible and the billion b billion stars ? The bible has diferent interpretations regarding MAN and the universe. You are using probability to calculate life outside of earth, with even a 0.0001% probability given the nature of the vastness of space you assume that there is life out there.Most people will think like that, especially science students, thats why certain cults, science people are extremely susceptible, because of all the facts and scientific mumbo jumbo only they understand what the hell its about.</p>
              <p>There is also another intepretation that God made us masters of the universe, so the universe may be ours for the taking. Or, we wil never travel to the nearest habitable planet, we are dommed to die in our solar system to await the end of days because of the vast distance in between. By the time we discover the technology to travel to stars, hopefully we have not blown ourselves up to bits first.. thats my thought. And dont u realise that the very nature of every thing is order and mathematics. Earth did not  just bang together n viola.. EARTH. Its like putting bits of cars n banging them out and hopefully they become a Merc. Order and Mathematics seems to point to intelligence. Even science people believe that. lol</p>
              <p>Men made beer , God made marijuana.. who do u trust ? Thats the issue regarding the bible being written by man. But Christian scholars will argue that it was written by man with the divinations of God himself, n he was merely the vessal.</p>
              <p>But feel free to seek answers from Parn. I also wanna know what she thinks. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png">. She has some christian textbook examples spread about but i seriously doubt her conscience into christianity and her daily life is doing anything that is making her a better true christian. </p>

              <p><br>I don't mind replying to your post, but may I know what is the question?</p>
              <p>I have read through what you have posted about your astral projection post thrice and I cannot find the question that you would like me to reply to.</p>
              <p>Having discussion to compare religion against each other is not going to promote unity, love, peace among people and I am not going to do that to your own beliefs in your religion.</p>
              <p>I am NEVER going to accept another religion or change my religion despite all the advantages which you have wrote about your astral projection. I love GOD and I serve GOD and I obey GOD for eternity.</p>
              <p>If you find any religion that requires promised "powers/abilities" to convince people to believe in it and also for it to able to function as a religion, then I can tell you that religion is not real. Take those promised "powers/abilities" away and the faith will also evaporate. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Death is bad. u dun exist after you die, so dun worry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>as one said, it is during the period when u are facing your incoming death or when you are still healthy or alive then you can be frightened about dying one day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When dead, it is <strong>impossible <strong>to think, cos u dun exist, so u dun feel , so you cannot be afraid. Some of you people are quite cavemen. There are so many intellectuals out there in the world working full time on acheveing immortality through science-based and tech-based projects, researchs. They are still far from acheving it, but at least they are doing meaningful things for themselves and future generations. </strong></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for god, and belief of afterlife, I can say that these are just delusional thoughts. Astral projections, If it is really true, the the <strong>govt <strong>would have already set up a astral projection community centers all over singapore so that all elderly can enjoy the amazing experiences of astral projections. ANother joke by mystical people.</strong></strong></p>
