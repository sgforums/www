              <p>Death is what makes life beautiful... It sets your priorities straight and the thought of having limited time on earth makes it even more important to enjoy the present.. Imagine if you live forever it wont matter to to express your love to your loved ones when you can do that in a thousand years</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>THose who long for eternal life paradoxically are least able to live in the present.. Dont fall into that trap and just enjoy yourself... And at the end to be able to say 'I have served the beautiful and enjoyed the adventure of the journey'. That, IMO is a heroic death and a life well lived</p>

              <p>Somehow, I'm not afraid of dying myself. Rather, I'm afraid that people that are so close to me die and it feels like part of me has died. The feeling of not able to see them EVER again, this is the feeling I'm afraid of. </p>
              <p>It's like you usually sms this friend of yours. Both of you can talk about so much things under the sun and then one day he/she passes away due to accident or sudden illness. Your phone will never receive his/her sms again. Your phone will never vibrate because of his/her number again. When you see the new message on your phone, his/her name will never appear on it.</p>
              <p>Or it's like your mum. Seeing her everyday and then when the fateful day comes. And thereafter, you have to face a home without her. You can no longer come home with the same feeling as the past. There is no one to nag at you ever again.</p>
              <p>It's just the fear for close people around me dying rather than me myself dying. If you want to be afraid of death yourself, it's rather the troubles and memories that you are going to leave with those people you should be afraid about. In the world, there will definitely be someone missing you after you're gone.</p>

              <p>the thought of me becoming nothingness one day makes me feel very afraid. even though i know i should not be thinking about this kind of issue because afterall, it still will eventually happens, it still creeps back into my thoughts every other nights.</p>

              <p>it's somehow pushing myself towards depression but i don't know how to let myself feels better. im always trying to convince myself about how there are people living a worse life than me so i should be content that at least i live a good life, or that im still very young and still got a long way to go. But i can't.</p>

              <p><br>Too bad for you, you think your ugly gf is your entire world right now.</p>
              <p>People do die sometimes and eventually people will leave you and you will be all alone left in this world.</p>
              <p>Do you think your buddies is going to lift you up when you're down? Do you think people around you really care about you and your life? Do you think you will eventually get the love that you desire from the people around you?</p>
              <p>The answer is NO, and if you have no faith in any religion like the way you have posted in here. It's understandable that you cannot see people and the world like I see them.</p>
              <p>Think of the bigger picture in your life and don't make me so significant in your life by flaming my posts.</p>
              <p>You are never going to be good enough for me even if you're tall, dark and handsome with lotsa money, cos your FAITH in GOD would've failed you from the beginning. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>and about GOD, (which ever kind u belive) they are other higher souls just like jesus who share the same soul as adam and mosses (i forgot the real name of jesus soul) and base on what i learn from channeling knowledge from others beings</p>

              <p>Look at it from the begining.</p>
              <p>You were born.</p>
              <p>Before you were born, did  you know you are going to be born.</p>
              <p>May be you did, may be you didn't.</p>
              <p>If you did <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span>, then you were just born, and thats that.</p>
              <p>If you did know, if you knew you were going to be born, would you not be terrified, of being born. You were born just the same.</p>
              <p>And so you will die. Just the same. Whether you are terrified or not.</p>
              <p>Every one in history has died, those that has not, will die soon. So will every one of us.</p>
              <p>But before you die, do something. If not for humanity, then for yourself.</p>
              <p>The least you can do for yourself is to have a good life (enjoy), before you die.</p>

              <p>SPEICALLY TO Parn</p>
              <p>its not really about science u know</p>
              <p>its really about the universa itself really...</p>
              <p>i dun want to start a war and say something like christ is not welcome here or somthing (like how you replied) [i do respect the 'soul' of adam,mosses,jesus]</p>
              <p>but ask yourself</p>
              <p>if u really want to seek god go ahead</p>
              <p>besides u guys have been "commanded" to safe humanity isnt it? by bringing more people to church and hopeing to convert them</p>
              <p>of cause i know friends like your type and friends who belong to other realigon and very few who does astral projection (in singapore)</p>
              <p>as for me, i am born in a buddist family and i went to church a few years ago when i am in sec 1 and i left it around mid of sec 3) (i went to youth of god singapore then i moved to City harvest) and during that period i was seeking for answers and rescearching on this type of stuff (its only this year itself that i got the full hold of astral projection)</p>
              <p>and of cause i left the church by now so i know how church operates ok?</p>
              <p>if i were to ask u to bring me to god and not to church can u do that?(since is the lord jesus u seek and not the church) [i may even beable to see it if my third eye permits and i doubt u can see it]</p>
              <p>so do u really wanna know how do church and well the feeling and presents of the holy spirts operates? base on both the soul's explainsion and science explainsion (i can give u both answers just ask and i will post it on the next reply) </p>
              <p>even my elder bro (which my parents thinks he got brain washed by church) have view about my astral projection view point and he wants to see how i do it and of cause i am willing to teach him</p>
              <p>parn u got to view from other view point and not from just the church view ok? try going around other realigon and seek their learning and understanding of life. try different groups and all of that (i suggest try buddist,taoist,islam,catherlic [sorry for the spelling mistake i am just born with Dyslexia] even anti god group and all just go seek the answers [it will be an interesting mission] and personally, it took me a long time)</p>
              <p>if i were to tell u astral projection is the best out there( some call astral projection a true realigon) while i call it the truth (i dun see it as a realigon but i see it as a universal system that not only affects humans but other soul,life,races,aliens,etc out there ) i guess u will say yours is better eh?</p>
              <p>but if u wish to keep to church by all means do so as it will take u many lifetimes before a soul can upgrade itself to astral level due to many factors like karma,past life,past knowledge,past soul,willinness,etc,etc etc and of cause planet earth's majority of human life unlike other civilisation out there in other planets arent ready for this change (just like how christ happened 2008 years ago and still did not successfully convert everyone to become christans)</p>
              <p>to end it off,it will be nice if u do not get other souls to downgrade themselves to church (i know it sounds harsh not only to u parn but to other christans too)</p>
              <p>if u have somthing powerful to shoot at me, by all means shoot</p>

              <p>o yah i forgot to add in</p>
              <p>about heaven and hell, when a soul dies it will reunite with it other self (the main powerful U)</p>
              <p>and u and your guides and helpers(i call them gurdian angels) will meet up to unvial your whole life and plan for the next life (note u can choose to go back to earth, go to distant planets,become a guides to help and watch over others in any form like a human being or animals,etc) and your next life will be plan base on karma,the current universal state,etc</p>
              <p>as i have mention about heaven and hell that doesnt exist, theres this spirit world (i have not been to yet) is nicknamed as 'heaven' base on the book astral dyamics on page 43</p>
              <p>and also, there this higher soul called Hilarion which is being channelled by Jon. C.Fox <a href="http://hilarion.com/">http://hilarion.com/</a> on earth to help humanity have recommanded everyone about this Old movie called What dreams may come (1998) <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120889/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120889/</a> to get a clearer picture (i personally dun think its 100% accurate) about what may come after life and of cause to clear more doubts of heaven and hell</p>
