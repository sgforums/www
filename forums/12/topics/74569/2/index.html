If i were to comment, i would :<br><br>Ask her out for a chat. Tell her that you understand what she meant. If you don't want to involve the other girl, that is not advisable. Tell her honestly. Because what if one day she see you and the other girl walking hand in hand? How would she feel and say?<br><br>After you told her, she might cry and keep asking why.<br><br>We can give you comments on what you should do and say but it's really up to you. Don't follow us, follow your heart. Say what you want and what you think. Because in the end, the one that would have impact is not us but you. You have to accept what is going to happen for the things that you said and do.<br><br>Be calm and say things slow. Take some time to think before starting any sentences. We want to reduce the impact to the minimal right?<br><br>Bad habits should change but she is what she is. I know she would be very happy and willing to change for your sake.<br><br>Really if she's feel like want to change, we can't stop her because if that's what she feels happy about, so let it be. We all say time will heal all wounds and that's true. It's impossible to reject a person without hurting.<br><br>She will still be hurt.<br><br>I hope that she will not change to a worse person, thinking that guys are all cheaters and playboys and start to feel about cheating other guys.<br><br>I can say, do what she wants to do and be happy about doing it. She will be very sad and hurt at times when she think of this matter but over time, things will get better. It's just how long?<br><br>She's always welcome to come in to this forum and tell us about how she feels. We are most willing to listen to her. YuHaiEr will be most willing to give comments.<br><br>We try our best not to inflict hurt to others. But it's really impossible, so we try our best not to leave regrets in other people's life.<br><br>There's happy and sad things in life, it's how we think and treat the things that comes.<br><br>Remember : Don't say sorry. Cause in love, there's no sorry or thank you.<br><br>My point of view, i might be wrong.</div>
