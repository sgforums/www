            <div class='col-md body'>I think its  great you got chosen as a v chairman.   Sometimes, the so called best person is not chosen, you know why? becos that person might not be the best person when it  comes to humility and learning.  No one is perfect, while some people may seem to be born with certain qualities, it doesnt mean they are always far ahead  of others in terms of that aspect.<br><br>You can always learn as you carry out your duties. As  for the name calling, m aybe there are  some vicious people amongst them but i believe most  of them are just joking, so dun take it to heart. The best way to response is that carry out your duties in such a way, that they will come to respect you.<br><br>I believe in servant leadership simply because that will earn more respect from the people you serve and they would be more than willing to serve others.<br><br>Learn all you can in your capacity, be humble, focused and willing to make mistakes and  learn.<br></div>
