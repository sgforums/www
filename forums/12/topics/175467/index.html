When you marry someone you can't live without, it is a decision based on NEED not commitment. And often some people realise that the very people they can't live without, unfortunately they can't live with either.<br><br>On the other hand, being able to live with someone means you share certain values system with that person and you have essentially an affection for him/her which can turn into love.<br><br>If my ex ask me a question like this.. i will ask "u ask me this type of question for what? to boost your ego if i say I did love you or? If in the relationship you didnt know how i feel, then I think now that relationship is over, there's no point telling you."</div>
