            <div class='col-md body'>mei lin and molgax<br><br>Thanks for your thoughts.  Mei lin I have ever thought about what you said.  May be he is "chi qing" or may be he is just playing with my feelings.  If he is really "chi qing" then I will feel bad about it because he couldn't bring himself to approach a gal, it's just pathetic.  I also thought about it before if he needs some kind of assurance that I am interested to make friend with him before he approaches me.  Don't know, these are my guesses according to my observation and senses.<br><br>Think about it again, may be he was frustrated the other day that was why he talked to his friend about me.  Sometimes I just wonder is he that sort who knows how to show care and pamper a gal.  Sigh!<br></div>

My gut feeling tells me it's more of ego problem. He doesn't know how to give proper eye contact. He's getting closer, at least he thanked you.<br><br>doko</div>

If a girl make eye contact with me i might be too shy to eye contact her back, because she could be just staring at me or even staring at something else behind me.

Yes, you seems to read my mind!  If a guy can't approach a gal in the appropriate manner which I think this is really the very basic, then there's really nothing I could say.
