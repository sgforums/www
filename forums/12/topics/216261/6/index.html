Space1999 I agree with you that man should have confident to approach a lady.<br><br>Update -  he is still the same.  Now whatever he does just don't have any positive impact on me any more.  Just the other day, he was still so "wu liao"  I was at the eating place that we often see each other.  He arrived without ordering any food, just sat there and when I happen to look at his direction as usual attracting attention and just kept looking and smiled.  After he caught my attention he went away.  This just didn't turn me on.  I am sick of his ways.    Just find him disgusting, sneaky, coward, immature and hopeless!<br><br>A true coward he is!  I am avoiding him.  To me if a man can't even bring himself to approach a lady in a proper way, I don't think this kind of man is worthy to be given any chance.  sometimes I ask myself if he is really man!</div>

I only smiled at him once or twice that's all, as most of the time it's either he . . . . . ..   or I ......   When I smiled at him he looked away, so so . . . .   I very offended, never come across such a guy b4.  You gotta know gals enough to understand that majority of us want the guys to make the move to get to know us and be friends.  This is very important to me.   As long as he dare not make the move, then I will not bother about getting to know him.  He gotta be a man to make the move, obviously he is not man enough, ha ha ha!  What more whenever there are opportunities, he chicken out instead of taking the chances to make the move.<br><br>To me I doubt he is really that shy, let me tell you why.  If he is able to wait for me to look at his direction to give me that sort of "ai mei" smile then after which when I saw him smile at me he walked away.   His deliberate intent of this smiling really set me thinking is he genuinely that shy that he can't bring himself to make the move.  All he is good at and very fond of doing is attracting my attention.  I am now accepting the fact that he is like that so it doesn't bother me for I find that his coward actions turn me.   The only time it bothers me is when there are opportunities he choose to not make the move.  There is more than 1 tree in the forest, ha ha ha!<br><br>A very true Coward is he!  He puts me off!

I only smiled at him once or twice that's all, as most of the time it's either he . . . . . ..   or I ......   When I smiled at him he looked away, so so . . . .   I very offended, never come across such a guy b4.  You gotta know gals enough to understand that majority of us want the guys to make the move to get to know us and be friends.  This is very important to me.   As long as he dare not make the move, then I will not bother about getting to know him.  He gotta be a man to make the move, obviously he is not man enough, ha ha ha!  What more whenever there are opportunities, he chicken out instead of taking the chances to make the move.<br><br>To me I doubt he is really that shy, let me tell you why.  If he is able to wait for me to look at his direction to give me that sort of "ai mei" smile then after which when I saw him smile at me he walked away.   His deliberate intent of this smiling really set me thinking is he genuinely that shy that he can't bring himself to make the move.  All he is good at and very fond of doing is attracting my attention.  I am now accepting the fact that he is like that so it doesn't bother me for I find that his coward actions turn me.   The only time it bothers me is when there are opportunities he choose to not make the move.  There is more than 1 tree in the forest, ha ha ha!<br><br>A very true Coward is he!  He puts me off!  I am not doing anything unless he make the move.<br><br></div></blockquote>hmmm , u smile at him and he look away ( hmm , seems like no guys will do that esp. girls smile at them ) .. so many doubts n treess arh ..then u can forever dont do anything or u can wait till he became a real flirt and came to know u with intention to get u into something else  ( u know lar)  with him later <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
