            <div class='col-md body'>Rane:<br><br>Sorry  didn't really read every reply posted. My own personal views:<br><br>I think he's probably too shy. Might be just shy or having social problems (don't know how to approach girls). He's trying to get your attention, thinking you might initiate to talk to him. I think you might want to consider doing so. Approach him in a nice way. Don't give the angry or disgusted look, do not make it seem you are interested in him. Talk to him.</div>
