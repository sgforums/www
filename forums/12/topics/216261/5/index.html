I am not surprised that the way you look at him differs from the rest as I share the same thoughts, too (I have thought about this before and think this could be possibly why he behaves the way he is).  Frankly, I have both positive and negative thoughts about this guy.   Sometimes I tell myself to give him the benefit of doubt.  I donÂ’t deny I donÂ’t mind getting to know him as an ordinary friend and somehow I am like what you said strangely attracted to him.   No worries, to date it is the objective side of me taking control.  Some who knows me tell me I am being too objective where affairs of the heart is concerned and this may not be very helpful.<br><br>bontakun:  thanks for your thoughts.  we all learn from what we are going through in life.  some are pleasant experiences, others are unpleasant.   well, will see what's up to know how to deal with it.<br><br>devil1976:  why didn't you edit the text of that Not from Venus from the beginning, I mean his/he 1st and second thread onwards.
