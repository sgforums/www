That may be his way of conveying friendliness, however, you did not smile back and he may have taken it  that you do want to be friends with him. You can't blame him for not making any more moves right? So instead of calling him "bu da fang", you should reflect on how you have responded to him.<br><br>I too feel that you look too deeply into things. Are you sure it isn't just coincidence that you run into him alot? You are in school for at least 9 hours a day average and 5 times a week, maybe more. The chances of running into 1/2000 (perhaps?) repeatly, is not small.<br><br>That's all i have to say. Take it as a frank 3rd-person view/ insult. It's entirely up to you.</div>

He knows where I appear and I know that sometimes he appears to be there to see me (hey, you where is god read other post where I mentioned this).  Of course sometimes it's pure coincidence that we see each other and other times I know he puts in effort to be there to see me.<br><br>Yes, he may have smiled at me but unfortunately I was too down and so deep in thoughts that few times that I didn't know I did not smile back or I couldn't bring myself to smile.  Please, I was so stressed, worried and was so heavy laden because of my rice bowl, so ,,,    where is God so do you think that I deliberately did not smile back.  To make up for it, other times I smiled at him but his expression puts me off.   Many females including myself still believe that guys should make the move, and there is nothing wrong with this expectation.  Nan jiu nu shi tian jing di yi!</div>

Er . . . . er .....  that depends whether I still have feelings for him.  If I still like him I will feel lousy and if I don't like him anymore I may feel neutral  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> and I will say "oh finally he got himself a girlfriend!".    Hao na men !!!     I have also asked the question, what will he react if he were to see a guy holding my hands or sending me back home one day.<br><br></div>

In what way did you approach the girl, did you manage to make her feel comfortable?  Yeah, sometimes when notice too much, the person will also wear the same colour the next time.  Guess this fellow is in the nursery or kindergarten level where relationship is concerned.  I do find him immature and doubt if he can handle a gal/guy relationship.    Good that you finally plucked up courage to approach the girl, bravo!</div>

But he is not exactly a stranger but of course neither are we friends.  He is staying in the neighbourhood and my sis and mum know his parents.  He just missed a couple of chances that's all I can say.</div>
