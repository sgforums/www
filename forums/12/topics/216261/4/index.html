This weird guy has been noticing me for about 2 to 3 years already.   It is his behaviour that sometimes scares me off.  Have many encounters (strange, pleasant, weird, scary, irritating, and unpleasant) with him.    He seems to know the time and place where I appear.  My friends said he is stalking me but I am not sure if he is.<br><br>-    many times see him looking around, when he sees me he stare at me for long as if giving some kind of signal.  He is intense.<br>-    Sometimes when he sees me he looks at me with admiring expression.   Sometimes he looks so hard, aloof, egoistic, or Â“gao bu ke panÂ”.<br>-    few times when he is near me he shows (body language) that he would like to approach me but just canÂ’t bring himself to do so.<br>-    Those few times this weird fellow smiled at me, I was so deep in thought or wasnÂ’t ready to return smile.<br><br>The first time when he and I (only 2 of us) were in the lift, he was moaning so loudly and that scared me a little but at the same time I gave him the benefit of doubt - I was wondering if he was manifesting in this way because of some kind of problems he has.  But my friend told me he could be dangerous as it is possible he may rape me.  I don't think so.<br><br>After the lift incident when I saw him appeared right in front of me smiling at me, I was kind of scared and told my sis that I need to rush off.  The next time when I saw him he shows me black face and he rushed off.   Another time I saw him talking to his friend about me.  His friend looked at me angrily.   Strange, I donÂ’t know his friend at all and for his friend to look at me that way is absolutely unjustified.  All I can say is these are petty men!  I think it is too much of him to behave this way for he and I are not even friends.<br><br>Simply canÂ’t tell all that had happened and is happening here as itÂ’s going to be very long.  All I want to say is this fellow keeps looking and staring, I donÂ’t know what he is up to.  ItÂ’s rather Â“ai meiÂ” for 2 to 3 years and I am really tired about it already.  He is as good as a stranger for I donÂ’t know much about him except that my mum told me he is a bachelor.  My mum is acquainted with his parents.<br></div></blockquote>clearly he is possessed, you better stay away from him, or he is just plain crazy!</div>

It's great that you are no longer like that, how did you overcome your problem?  Thank goodness you realised your problem and did something to change if not it will continue to cause you misery.  Thanks for your sincere comments.  Apreciate it.<br><br>it's a real headache to face this sort of problem from a guy, he is the first guy that I come across with this problem.

Let me give an analogy:<br><br>Adventurers like Indiana Jones and Lara Croft (Ok they are fictional characters...) search for "treasures" in a seemingly "impossible" scenario given to them. They find many possible clues, places, riddles, etc in search of that elusive treasures. Many times they are disappointed as it either goes to naught or leads to more riddles, clues, places, etc but they never gave up simply because of the "treasure" they had in mind.<br><br>We are in search of friends/mates/etc whom we value and we have to look through many different people/etc to find these friends/mates/etc.<br><br>Is it confusing, people?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>ur right on bullseye ,though i dunno if ur using right analogies with Jones /Lara ( which apparently u can see these characters r admirable in their quest for THINGS ) haha..<br><br>ok as u said they r using possible clues --non living things (which r VASTLY different as compared to real human beings) ..its does helps that some can applied to relationship eg. u can apply tests if the girl is really materialistic $$ , insecure , or big mouth ..<br><br>it will b  not so confusing after u realised that the friends /mates r not what  u made out to b n they will not form part of ur life ...then u began to b happier by<br><br>moving on ...there u go bont  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Build up the relationship between us. Know more about friends and vice versa. Once comfortable then decide if the relationship level can be upped. This will take time and effort.<br><br>If you find it tiring, then something is not right and you need to reassess the whole situation again. Never force yourself to build up the level if you still uncomfortable unless you genuinely want to have close, good friends with them.<br><br>Wah... juz woke up so feeling abit groogy... dunno wat I typing oso.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
