            <div class='col-md body'>Just wonder what is it or what are those problems that cause one to behave the way he or she does.  This weird guy has been noticing me for about 2 to 3 years already.   It is his behaviour that sometimes scares me off.  Have many encounters (strange, pleasant, weird, scary, irritating, and unpleasant) with him.    He seems to know the time and place where I appear.  My friends said he is stalking me but I am not sure if he is.<br><br>-    many times see him looking around, when he sees me he stare at me for long as if giving some kind of signal.  He is intense.<br>-    Sometimes when he sees me he looks at me with admiring expression.   Sometimes he looks so hard, aloof, egoistic, or Â“gao bu ke panÂ”.<br>-    few times when he is near me he shows (body language) that he would like to approach me but just canÂ’t bring himself to do so.<br>-    Those few times this weird fellow smiled at me, I was so deep in thought or wasnÂ’t ready to return smile.<br><br>The first time when he and I (only 2 of us) were in the lift, he was moaning so loudly and that scared me a little but at the same time I gave him the benefit of doubt - I was wondering if he was manifesting in this way because of some kind of problems he has.  But my friend told me he could be dangerous as it is possible he may rape me.  I don't think so.<br><br>After the lift incident when I saw him appeared right in front of me smiling at me, I was kind of scared and told my sis that I need to rush off.  The next time when I saw him he shows me black face and he rushed off.   Another time I saw him talking to his friend about me.  His friend looked at me angrily.   Strange, I donÂ’t know his friend at all and for his friend to look at me that way is absolutely unjustified.  All I can say is these are petty men!  I think it is too much of him to behave this way for he and I are not even friends.<br><br>Simply canÂ’t tell all that had happened and is happening here as itÂ’s going to be very long.  All I want to say is this fellow keeps looking and staring, I donÂ’t know what he is up to.  ItÂ’s rather Â“ai meiÂ” for 2 to 3 years and I am really tired about it already.  He is as good as a stranger for I donÂ’t know much about him except that my mum told me he is a bachelor.  My mum is acquainted with his parents.<br></div>

Most women don't like to be rushed into a relationship. Guys are completely different. They are turned on immediately when they see a physically attractive woman. It's like they see Lin Zhiling and "wow! Im going to make her my gf!" That's the guy's perception but women can control themselves even if they see a hot guy.<br><br>If I were you, I want that guy to approach me. I want him to be a man and approach me because that's how things should work.

            <div class='col-md body'>dokono, meilin and all that responded, thanks for your thoughts and advice.<br><br>Meilin, I absolutely agree with you about what you said.  It took me long to accept and only recently that I told myself to give him a chance.  Till this day, I don't know what makes him take notice of me for 2 to 3 years.  dokono, he is pleasant to look at.  Let me make myself clear, I am not one who base on look to make friends.  There are times, I am attracted to people who are not good looking, there are something about them that attract me.  In this case, I am somehow attracted to the way he spoke to a little girl and interested to know him as a person.<br><br>It's somehow contradicting, though I don't mind to get to know him but I still feel a little scary, watched over by him.  It's also a little ridiculous that for 2 to 3 years he still can't pluck up his courage to approach me appropriately.  Bingo, dokono what you mentioned is exactly what I am doing now - wait for him to be man enough to approach me and see how it goes.  Well, he may be pampered coming from a small family that's why . . . . . . .</div>

It took me long to accept and only recently that I told myself to give him a chance.  Till this day, I don't know what makes him take notice of me for 2 to 3 years.  dokono, he is pleasant to look at.  Let me make myself clear, I am not one who base on look to make friends.  There are times, I am attracted to people who are not good looking, there are something about them that attract me.  In this case, I am somehow attracted to the way he spoke to a little girl and interested to know him as a person.<br><br>It's somehow contradicting, though I don't mind to get to know him but I still feel a little scary, watched over by him.  It's also a little ridiculous that for 2 to 3 years he still can't pluck up his courage to approach me appropriately.  Bingo, dokono what you mentioned is exactly what I am doing now - wait for him to be man enough to approach me and see how it goes.  Well, he may be pampered coming from a small family that's why . . . . . . . </div></blockquote>For 2-3 years he did not approach. I wonder what he is up to. Maybe he has a huge ego or he is scared of being rejected. Whatever it is, seems like he has a mental block that prevents himself from approaching.<br><br>doko</div>

Most women don't like to be rushed into a relationship. Guys are completely different. They are turned on immediately when they see a physically attractive woman. It's like they see Lin Zhiling and "wow! Im going to make her my gf!" That's the guy's perception but <span style="color: red;">women can control themselves even if they see a hot guy.</span><br><br>If I were you, I want that guy to approach me.
