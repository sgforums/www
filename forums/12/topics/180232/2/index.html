            <div class='col-md body'>Probably the reason why he's doing the love-me-love-me-not act is because he's trying to make a reaction out of you. He wants you but he can't show it all because he's  not sure whether your feelings for him remain. If he senses that you have already drawn a line between both of you, he can always fall back on the love-me-not excuse, thus causing less embarrassment.<br>I say go for it if you still loves him. Try looking as best as you can. Maybe change your style, show him that you're not the old you anymore. Remember clothes maketh the woman.</div>
