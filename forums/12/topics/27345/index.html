Sometimes when i visualise certain situations and i've given them scenarios before, both will stand by me in certain situations. Sometimes only one will stand by me in a certain situation... and it's not always my bf, nor issit always the other guy. hmmm.. so hard to say lar. But perhaps you're rite. Cos if both of em are thrown in a "life and death" situation, i may just choose my bf.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>To Solitude: Yeah i'm fickle-minded.Yes, I know you have to be contented with what you have. But i'm the type that when i start a r/s i want it long-term. Hopefully with the marriage as the goal. I hope i don't give you the impression that i'm the type that change guys like underwear like dat, cos i'm not!<br><br>To everyone: Thanks for whatever you guys have written down. Just for the record, my bf doesn't treat me like shit and he dotes on me, 'cept on times where he gets his occassional mood swings then he angry and won't talk to me.<br></div>

Unless you wanna label it that way, then ANYTHING can be 'technically cheating'.... A mind is VAST...
