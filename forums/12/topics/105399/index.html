The ridiculous thing is that you're still in a relationship with her!<br><br>Look at it this way, she doesn't treat you like a boyfriend at all. She doesnÂ’t care about this relationship. She's obviously making use of you as emotional support when she needs it, and you rank below her friends.<br><br>The reason why she's still holding on to this relationship is not important, and i don't want to guess. But why are you holding on?<br><br>Please move on, i do not see a future for you with this girl. </span></div></blockquote></div>

You should feel lucky you have one attention catcher of a gf. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>2) It shows her commitment is not in the place you most expect it to be.  It makes you feel uneasy and left out.<br><br>3) I make it a point to reply my dear's sms asap, but really sometimes the situation does not allow me.  The same goes for my dear too.  Some things just gotta give and take. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>4) As in 2), make a check of both her's and your commitment level to this r/s.<br><br>5) See 2) and 4).  I guess this has something to do with this generation of young people getting more wired. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>6) Like in 3), give and take.<br><br>From your last para, it seems this r/s is more one sided.  Its good to know that one of you truly wants to commit from the way you put this post.  You really need a deep conversation with her these days.  Don't drag.  Good chances only come once in life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">hi jus some ideas as ur scenario was quite similar to mine in certain aspects :</span><br><br>2.her friends.how she always put her friends in the 1st place.like sometimes we arrange to go out but she will later say she going out with her friends and cancel our date.<br><br>3.her sms.how she takes very long to sms me.like she saw my sms but she does not reply immediately but only reply later when she feel like it.maybe this is stupid to argue about?<br><br>4.she being sociable with other guys and like to join extra activities.she will be very friendly to her guy friends.like always joking around with them.and she likes to join alot of activities that will know alot of new people.i think if a couple is attached they shouldnt do things that will make the other party angry.since she know i will not be happy but she dont care and still do it.<br><br>5.she knowing guys online.guys message her in wholivesnearyou.com and she gives them her msn and then even her number.she even auto message one of them.she also adds guys that add her in her friendster that are not her friends.<br><br>6.When i ask her go out she always give reasons like i ask her out only on that day and her parents dont allow then never go out.She also say its troublesome for her to go out cause still need to prepare all those.But i dont hear her saying all that when going out with her friends.Though its true her parents are strict with her.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">I dun know abt the NORM standard for most ppl, but personally, i cldnt accept that she was so sociable, having so many frens (&amp; mostly guys) &amp; most imptly, putting her frens at 1st priority rather me.<br>Eg. she goes movies on sat with a large bunch of frens (instead of being with me) &amp; a guy sent home at  ard 3 am plus<br>She goes clubbin till the next morning...<br><br>Its best if u can sit down for a talk &amp; reach for some compromise ( BIZ-- like heez). But as human, we all have some weakness. Hence, if she is really into somethk that u mind a lot, chances are the same prob will crop up &amp; same quarrels etc.</span><br>But the point is i dont treat her good.I always scold her and use vulgarities.She is the one that always cry to me and asked me to patch back after we broke up.But now i also dont really care already.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">This is unacceptable as guys shld NV use vuglarities on his gf...</span><br><span style="color: #444444;"></span><span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>
