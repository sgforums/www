I usually don't like to poke into people's relationship affairs.... But since you asked....<br><br>Like I've mentioned in my earlier post, your 'intellectual issue' may be SECONDARY... OR rather, it might not even really exist at all.... Your course of approach for now is AVOIDANCE.... Personally, from the current situation I think you're still QUITE FAR from anywhere near about BGR and thinking about whether the fact that she's smarter than you is gonna affect the relationship....<br><br>Is this your 1st relationship wannabe? Or you're probably still rather inexperienced...? A girl whom you've like since the 1st day of a JC school...? Seems like till this very day you're still rather far from knowing her quite well...? Besides, she WAS your close friend's gf...? I sense a NATURAL BARRIER here.... The 'natural barrier' has most probably already been identified in the post which I've quoted earlier.... As you've mentioned in your previous post, you probably mind HOW your friend might think of it if you're to take actions in going after this girl.... My suggestion is somehow this matter has gone SUBCONSCIOUS over time....<br><br>This 'intellectual issue' might be something brought up just to fill in the 'hollow barrier' between you and her.... It's only rather linked in the sense that the girl is going for law faculty and she's gonna be exposed to a NEW and large source for a potential bf.... Your mind is already telling you that she's gonna step out of sight soon.... The 'intellectual issue' could be just a casually related 'warning signal'....<br><br><strong>ADVICE TIME :</strong><br><br>Though CHANCES seems SLIM personally in my eyes from a SURFACE ANALYSIS, anything is not always 100% impossible...<br><br>1st thing's 1st... This relationship is for yourself... Though you might treasure your relationship with your friend but between him and her it's somehow ALREADY OVER.... Even if you go for it, it might not neccesarily happen between you and her.... To go through this 1st (main?) barrier, you can either directly go to your friend and express your opinion (also taking into consideration what kinda character your friend has &amp; hence subject to changes in whether you should be straightforward about this...) to him... Try to get his recognition of your feeling for that girl... If he gives the GREEN LIGHT, that's one barrier over...<br><br>Alternatively, you can just go ahead and see how it develop between you and the girl... If things stop there, complications should naturally die down from there... If things develop, you naturally incur a RISK of having this friendship between you and the girl's EX JEOPARDISED.... But note at this point that it's NOT morally wrong as they've already broken up (besides, your friend was the one to dummp her..? Can't expect her to remind SINGLE for the rest of her life just because of that yup...?) If your friend is not understanding to the matter, take a SLOW APPROACH in the RECOVERY of his understanding for your stand... IF he's CLOSE enogh and worthwhile enough a friend, he should UNDERSTAND the situation if not be happy for you....?<br><br>Oh well.... Enough said.... GEE... I think I'm getting TOO WINDY already...? There're alot of things you'll need to find out... eg. 'if the girl attached already?', 'how she could possibly feels about you?', 'is she thinking of going into another relationship?' etc....<br><br>Not that I wanna throw a wet blanket on you... Try if you must but don't pin too high a hope on this one...?</div>

I think you misread my point... What I'm trying to bring across is whether my intelligence (or the lack thereof) is gonna affect my chances of going after her, not the relationship between us (if ever possible). In other words, will she look down on me and choose other people of higher calibre instead?<br><br><blockquote><strong>...Is this your 1st relationship wannabe? Or you're probably still rather inexperienced...? A girl whom you've like since the 1st day of a JC school...?

I wouldn't say we are just plain aquaintance, but there is a certain level of friendship between us.<br><br><blockquote><strong>.... As you've mentioned in your previous post, you probably mind HOW your friend might think of it if you're to take actions in going after this girl....</strong></blockquote>Yeah...<br><br><blockquote><strong>This 'intellectual issue' might be something brought up just to fill in the 'hollow barrier' between you and her....

Our friendship not close enough or my insecurity? I do NOT think that the 'intellectual isue' is just a casaul remark, it is the problem itself.<br><br>As for the rest, notes taken and I appreciate your invaluable help.
