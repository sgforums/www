(btw, some guys know how to appreciate gals, thus they're nice to every single gal they come across.)<br><br>when he said he also enjoy spending time with you, can you see if it's genuine or merely reciprocating back on wat you've complimented him on?<br><br>y not test water by asking him for his expectation as a gf? if he hints to you on things like he wants a gf to be someone of your kind, then i think it's jolly well a clear situation that he likes you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> of coz i'm no encouraging you to play mind games with him, in case he's one who doesn't know the rule of the game and things get backfired.<br><br>dont venture unnecessarily, unless you are pretty sure of the situation. i will suggest y not bid your time in growing to understand him more? you don't need to rush into telling him abt your feelings, coz utimately if he can sense that you like him, it's just a matter of time he'll ask you abt it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>it's too petty an issue to lose your beauty sleep over an issue like this. take it in your stride. don't imagine for the worst yet be prepared for anything that comes along.<br><br>all the best  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
