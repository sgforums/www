            <div class='col-md body'>Ask yourself if your bf did anything to make you doubt him before this incident. Sometimes guys would rather choose to tell a white lie than to tell the truth. Why? So that woman would not kick up a big fuss over nothing.<br><br>Communicate with him that you are feeling insecure and you hope to make this r'ship works. If you're really fine with him going out with his friends, let him know. BUT make sure you do not get angry if he tells you the truth next time.<br><br>Trust is the fundamental aspect to a healthy &amp; stable r'ship. Without that, endless squabbles will arise, destroying the r'ship slowly but surely. Give him the trust that he deserves. If he should break it, then you retrieve it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Trust is a really big word. and it entails a lot of responsibility and understanding.<br><br>I have talked out with him.  Seemed like the issue is more or less settled. Cos he realized how uncomfortable i was.  Den i mentioned to him if he was in my shoes and i gave him the same treatment as he gave me. So he said he wouldn't like it either.<br><br>So i presumed it is ok.<br><br>You know, when you hear too many stories of girls finding their bfs sleeping with other girls when their gfs not arnd, you will know when to trust or not.  Though i might be generalizing, it might be true to a certain extent. No?<br><br>i will keep u guys updated tonight on what happens later.</div>
