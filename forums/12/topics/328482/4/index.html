              <p>I agree a hundred and ten percent with Charlize, true love does exist. There exists unconditional love, I for one couldn't bear to have to raise me... and my mother does it with almost no complaints other than the ocassional naggings, and it's usually my fault. I'd say that is unconditional love, and thus true love. I'd die for my mother...So would I live and die for the woman who can love me unconditionally (other than my mother) </p>

              <p> Aladdin got seduced by money when the price of oil was skyrocketing a few months back.  He dumped Jasmine, sold his house and dumped all his money on some oil company.  You know what happened next.  Price of oil started falling and Aladdin didn't have no genie to help him as he lost all his money as price of the shares collapsed.  Bought them on margin some more. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ariel still had her mermaid's tail.  And she thought the guy didn't mind.  She guessed wrong.  After a while, the tail lost its novelty.  The guy is now into flippers.  Not girls with flippers.  But seals. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After the beast turned into a handsome young punk, he realised that he was now a swinging bachelor all over again with girls swooning over his feet.  Which guy could resist SYTs? You guessed it.  Belle got dumped.  The guy is now a regular guest at Jerry Springer's as every now and then some girl (sometimes even guys) will profess her secret love for him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>As for Minnie, Mickey got sick of her consistent nagging.  Dumped her for Donald.  Apparently, quacking seemed less irritating than squealing.  Go figure. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Charlize!!! How could you! I loved those stories! Besides, you got it wrong...Mickey dumped minnie as she was dating a Rat who was filthy rich, and the guy  from little mermaid figured that he'd be better off, carousing on the beaches with ladies in flippers, than with a single Ariel without flippers.*Grins*</p>

              <p>Ariel still had her mermaid's tail.  And she thought the guy didn't mind.  She guessed wrong.  After a while, the tail lost its novelty.  The guy is now into flippers.  Not girls with flippers.  But seals. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>After the beast turned into a handsome young punk, he realised that he was now a swinging bachelor all over again with girls swooning over his feet.  Which guy could resist SYTs? You guessed it.  Belle got dumped.  The guy is now a regular guest at Jerry Springer's as every now and then some girl (sometimes even guys) will profess her secret love for him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>As for Minnie, Mickey got sick of her consistent nagging.  Dumped her for Donald.  Apparently, quacking seemed less irritating than squealing.  Go figure. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
