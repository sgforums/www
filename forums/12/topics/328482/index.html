              <p>Sometimes matches like these might work, one with high aspirations, while the other is down to earth, at least there is a balance.</p>
              <p>I am not too sure how your guy friend would feel about his ego, having a wife that earns more than him might make him feel inferior to her. Unless he is very open minded and not against the idea of his wife making more money than him.</p>

              <p>It all depends on the couple. If they don't mind personally, nothing others say will bother them. Even if it is against social norms, it is up to their personal belief and principles.</p>
              <p>This is already 2008. Women are no longer condemned to just stay behind a kitchen and slave her life away. So we cannot keep expecting that it will always be men who are more capable than women and will always be the breadwinner. Why can't they just see it like this: the more successful the woman is, the more money they will have collectively as a family, the better chance they will have at living a good life? Who cares who contribute more or less? It all goes within the family anyway.</p>

              <p>He can still continue to work, doesn't mean that his wife is so successful then he doesn't need to work ma. They can just both contribute to the household expenses lor, like this the guy won't feel like the wife is feeding him instead of the other way round.</p>
              <p>My hubby is already doing freelance at home at the moment, and I am guessing he will be the one who spent more time with the kids next time round when we actually have them.

              <p>Well, I think it really depends on how they felt about each other. Are they truly in love? Does the guy often feel stressed and lack self-esteem when they're together? Does the girl think that he is too laid back and lack the drive a man should have? From what you stated, it seems to be the case. I believe you can help them.</p>
              <p>Tell the girl, that simplicity is not a flaw. In fact, being able to slow down the pace and enjoy a simple life with someone you love is romantic. Make her listen to the song "So close". It'll get her thinking...does she really want to give up this chance?</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH8WAoRL1xo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH8WAoRL1xo</a></p>
              <p>She might be a career-minded woman, but inside her, she yearns to be a little girl who is pampered and treated like a princess by someone she loves.</p>
              <p>For the guy, try to address his worries. Help boost his self-esteem and ego. Earning $4K as a banker isn't much, but its sufficient to enjoy a comfortable life..compared to many others who isn't that fortunate. Motivate him to aim higher, but do not stress him like his girlfriend did. Be cautious because even a harmless question like, "where do you see yourself 5 years from now?" may shrink his esteem.</p>
              <p>Lastly, leave it to them. Honestly, I've seen people with different goals in life live happily together, just because love is unconditional.</p>

              <p>It all depends on the couple. If they don't mind personally, nothing others say will bother them. Even if it is against social norms, it is up to their personal belief and principles.</p>
              <p>This is already 2008. Women are no longer condemned to just stay behind a kitchen and slave her life away. So we cannot keep expecting that it will always be men who are more capable than women and will always be the breadwinner. Why can't they just see it like this: the more successful the woman is, the more money they will have collectively as a family, the better chance they will have at living a good life? Who cares who contribute more or less? It all goes within the family anyway.</p>

              <p><br>It's subjective but even if the guy accepts being househusband, there is the issue of social stigma.</p>
              <p>I guess during the last half century, there were lots of economic changes to empower the female species, but social norms have yet to catch up with economic development in the east.</p>
              <p>Making more money and having a higher standard of living is alright, but the issue crops up when the couple have kids. Who would be the one forsaking his career to look after the kids? Economically and ideally would be the guy giving up the job because he makes less, therefore less opportunity cost. If they don't intend to have kids, then it's not a major issue, because both can keep their careers.</p>

                  looking to climb up the corporate ladder as quickly as
                  possible.</p>
              <p>The guy is 31.  Graduated when he was 25, also working a
                  financial instituition with a rank of Associate.  He probably
                  earns 4K a month (guesstimate  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> )  He is just your average Joe, not too
                  ambitious or smart, just wants to eke out a normal living and get
                  through life simply.</p>
              <p>They dated for a while and being friends to the both of
                  them, I get to hear of their progress whenever I meet them for
                  lunch, separately of course.</p>
              <p>Apparently both of them have the same fears, they recognise that
                  there is this huge gap in terms of earning power and have expressed
                  some concern that it might become a bone of contention in the
                  future should they end up being together.</p>
              <p>Being friends to both of them, I am genuinely concerned. 
                  After all, I brought them together.  What should I tell them
                  or advise them?</p>
              <p>And don't give me those fairy tale advice about true love
                  conquering all regardless of money, ambition or educational
                  differences.  Let me hear your views. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>It will be a problem if they 'let it become'/'allow it to be' a problem. It is not a problem if they do not let it or allow it to be a problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nothing to do with true love or what true love is. This is relationship management. You manage the relationship well, you have a good relationship. Otherwise, otherwise.</p>
