I doubt I've ever been clocked* by anyone on the streets who happen to see me. Heck, there're even other transsexuals from America whom would've thought I was born a girl had I not told them.<br><br>But well, no matter what I'd still tell my guy about my past if we were serious about each other. Somehow, I just don't think it'd be fair to him if I didn't tell him, and anyway, I figure my conscience won't allow me to keep such a big secret from the person whom I love the most.<br><br>I do have friends that don't tell though, and they just make an excuse up for not being able to give birth. Well, whatever works for them I guess, though I doubt I'd ever do that. Just imagine what'd happen if let's say, a decade of marriage and he finds out...<br><br>*to be recognized as transgendered.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>trust in a relationship is very important . especially something like this isn't something most guys can accept. while most guys don't might having a TS for a friend, maybe even a close friend. taking it futher isn't exactly something easy.<br>i don't know about other guys, but in my view, i really really have to like her a lot to accept her.<br>even after i do, i have to explain to my family, i have to accept how my friends would look at me. what to do with friends who disrespect me and my other half.<br><br>kinda like marrying someone of another race/religion in a town with only one race/religion.</div>
