            <div class='col-md body'>I guess I should've foreseen something like this happening to me a long time ago, but this is the first time I've ever had to tell my boyfriend that I'm a transsexual (my exs knew about me before we started dating), and it's also my first time to get rejected...<br><br>Anyway, here's how my story goes:<br><br>Quite recently, I met this Malaysian guy who 2 years older than me, by the name of Harry (not his real name). We chatted online, and somehow both of us really seemed to click together, and after continuious chatting for several days, our feelings for each other started to develop.<br><br>He was pretty much the type of guy that I wanted to love. While he may not have been good-looking or rich, he was a really sweet &amp; caring guy, smart, and very capable too. Also he seemed to know way to a girl's heart, and how to treat her very well, and really make her feel loved.<br><br>In his eyes, I was his dream girl, an angel in his eyes. I was everything he looked for ever since he lost his previous girlfriend when she died in an accdient. He loved me lots, to the extent that he wanted to marry me in the future, and had the next few years for the both of us all planned out.<br><br>But here's the problem, as you all already know. I'm transsexual, and I knew I had to tell him soon, before we got too close to each other and felt 'cheated' after finding out. Initially I planned to tell him a week ago, but I was really afraid that his feelings for me will change after telling him, and I really loved the way things were between us at that time.<br><br>Anyway, what I had feared came true after telling 2 days ago. At first he didn't quite believe me, thinking it was a joke, but after i finally convinced him he was left completely crushed. I can't imagine how it must've felt for him then, to find that his dream girl was born a guy, but well, he simply couldn't accept me, and decided to break up.<br><br>We used to look foward to talking with each other everytime we reached home, but now he doesn't seem to want to talk with me anymore. Everything between the both of us has changed completely, and I don't think it can ever be fixed, and the past 2 weeks of lovely times are nothing more but memories now.<br><br>The perfect guy was in my arms, but I had to let him go simply because of who I am. It hurts to even wonder how many more men I'm going to lose in the future because of this...<br><br>Here's a poem he wrote for me 3 days after we met. I treasure this as much as every one of my memories of the both of us.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Ever Wonder When Someone Likes,<br>You From Out Of The Blue,<br>But Yet You Never Realize It?,<br>Never Seems Weird How Love,<br>Could Turn One's Heart and Soul,<br>Into A Boundless Joy Of Happiness,<br>Yet Love Could Even Hurt Your,<br>But Yet Were Not To Blame,<br><br>But I Might Feel That,<br>But I am Just What I Am,<br>An Honest Soul Just Wondering,<br>Holding On To What I Had Before,<br>Yet You Seem Different,<br><br>Where That Adrealine Would Flow,<br>Through My Vains,<br>Is This How I Feel About You?<br><br>What If It This all Just A Dream,<br>but Yet It Seems Surreal,<br>Even Though The days,<br>Werent Suffice,But It Seems,<br>To Be True..You Seem Special.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks everyone so much/ *hugs around* =)<br><br>Well, simply losing him wasn't what hurt, but moreover it was the reason why he left me which really hurt. It's honestly a crappy reason to lose someone, and like I mentioned in the first post, how many more of my future boyfriends will leave me because of this? But hopefully, yea, I hope I will meet someone one day who will really love me till the end of time...<br><br>Ito:<br>Well, I'll tell those whom I'm serious about having a relationship with usually by the first few dates. Not the first one, but most of the time by the 5th - 8th date. To friends however (except for my best friend), I don't really think it's that necessary for me to tell.</div>
