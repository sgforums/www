            <div class='col-md body'>Leaf's departure is because of Wind's pursuit.<br>Or because Tree didn't ask her to stay~<br><br>Tree<br>The reason I'm called tree is because I'm good<br>at painting trees.<br>Overtime I start to use a tree on the right hand<br>corner as a trademark for all my watercolors<br>painting. I have dated 5 gals when I was in Pre-<br>U. There's one gal who I love a lot but never<br>dare go after her.<br>She doesn't have a pretty face, doesn't have a<br>good figure, doesn't have outstanding charm. She<br>is just a very ordinary gal.<br>I like her. I really like her. Like her<br>innocent, like her frankness.<br>Like her cuteness, like her intelligence and her<br>fragility. Reason for not going after her is<br>because I felt somebody so ordinary like her is<br>not a good match for me. I'm also afraid that<br>after we are together all the good feelings will<br>vanish. I'm also afraid other's gossips will<br>hurt her. I felt that if she's my gal, she will<br>be mine ultimately &amp; I don't have to give up<br>everything just for her. The last reason, made<br>her accompany me for 3 years.<br>She watch me chase after gals, and I have make<br>her heart cry for 3 years.<br>She wants to be a good actress and I'm a very<br>demanding director.<br>When I kissed my 2nd girlfriend, she bumped into<br>us. She was embarrassed but smile &amp; say "Go on!"<br>before running off. The next day, her eyes was<br>swollen like a walnut. I purposely didn't want<br>to think about what causes her to cry but laugh<br>at her the whole day. When everybody go back<br>home, she was alone crying in the classroom. She<br>didn't know that I returned from soccer training<br>to get something. I watch her cry for an hour or<br>so.<br><br>My 4th girlfriend didn't like her. There was<br>once when both of them quarreled. I know that<br>based on her character she's not the type that<br>will start off the quarrel. But I still sided<br>with my girlfriend. I shouted at her and her<br>eyes was filled shocked. I didn't care about her<br>feelings and walked off with my girlfriend.<br>The next day, she still laugh &amp; joke with me<br>like nothing has ever happened.<br>I know that she's very hurt but she didn't know<br>that my heart ache is as bad as hers.<br><br>When I broke up with my 5th girlfriend, I asked<br>her out. After going out for a day, I told her<br>that I have something to tell her. She told me<br>that coincidentally, she has something to tell<br>me too. I told her about my break up and she<br>told me about her getting together. I know whose<br>the guy. He has been going after her for quite a<br>while. A very cute guy full of energy, lively and<br>interesting. His pursuit for her has been the<br>talk of the school.<br><br>I can't show her my heart ache but could only<br>smile &amp; congratulate her.<br>When I reach home, the heart ache is so strong<br>that I can't stand it.<br>It's like a heavy weighted stone on my chest. I<br>couldn't breath. Wanted to shout but can't.<br>Tears rolled down &amp; I broke down &amp; cry. How many<br>times have I seen her cry for the man that<br>doesn't acknowledge her presence too.<br><br>During graduation, I read a sms in my hp. It was<br>send 10 days ago when I broke down and cry. I<br>haven't read it since then. It says "Leaf<br>departure is because of Wind pursuit. Or because<br>Tree didn't ask her to stay"<br><br>Leaf<br>During Pre-U days, I like to collect leaves.<br>Why? Because I felt that for a leaf to leave the<br>tree she has been relying on for so long it<br>takes a lot of courage. During the 3 years of<br>Pre-U I was on very close terms with a guy. Not<br>BGR kind but as buddy kind. But when he had his<br>1st girlfriend, I learnt a feeling I never<br>should have learnt - Jealousy.<br>The sourness in the heart can't be describe by<br>using a lemon. It's like 100 rotten sour lemon.<br>Sourness to the extreme limit. They were only<br>together for 2 mths. When they broke up, I hide<br>my strong sense of happiness.<br><br>But after a mth, he got together with another<br>gal. I like him &amp; I know he like me. But why<br>won't he pursue me? Since he love me why he<br>doesn't want to make the first move? Whenever he<br>had a new girlfriend, my heart would hurt. Time<br>after time, my heart was hurt. I begin to<br>suspect that this is a one sided love. If he<br>don't like he, why does he treat me so well.<br>It's beyond what you will normally do for a<br>friend. Liking a person is very heart wrenching.<br>I can know his likes, his habits. But his<br>feelings towards me I can never figure out. You<br>can't expect me a gal to ask him right?<br><br>Despite that, I still want to be by his side.<br>Care for him, accompany him, love him. Hoping<br>that one fine day, he will come &amp; love me.<br>It's like waiting for his phone call every<br>night, wanting him to send me sms. I know that<br>no matter how busy he is, he will make time for<br>me.<br>Because of this, I waited for him. The 3 years<br>were the hardest to go through &amp; I really want<br>to give up. Sometimes, I wonder should I<br>continue waiting. The pain and hurt, the dilemma<br>accompany me for 3 years.<br>Till the end of my 3rd year, a 2nd year junior<br>begins to go after me. Everyday he pursuit me<br>relentlessly. From outright rejection<br>to a point in time when I felt that I'm willing<br>to let him have a small footing in my heart.<br>He's like a warm &amp; gentle wind, trying to blow a<br>leaf away from the tree. In the end, I realized<br>that I didn't want to give this wind a small<br>footing in my heart. I know this wind will bring<br>this badly battered leave far away &amp; better<br>land. Finally I left tree, but the tree only<br>smile &amp; didn't ask me to stay. Leaf departure is<br>because of Wind pursuit. Or because Tree didn't<br>ask her to stay.<br><br>Wind<br>Because I like a gal called leaf. Because she's<br>so dependent on tree so I have to be a gust<br>wind. A wind that will blow her away. When I<br>first met her, it was 1 mth after I transfer to<br>the new school. I saw a petite person looking at<br>my seniors &amp; me playing soccer. During ECA time,<br>she will always be sitting there. Be it alone or<br>with her friends looking at him. When he talks<br>with gals there's jealousy in her eyes. When he<br>looked at her,there's a smile in her eyes.<br>Looking at her became my habit. Just like she<br>likes to look at him.<br><br>One day, she didn't appear. I felt something<br>amissed. I can't explain the feeling except it's<br>a kind of uneasiness. The senior was also not<br>there as well. I went to their classroom, hid<br>outside and saw my senior scolding her. Tears<br>were in her eyes while he left. The next day,<br>I saw her at her usual place, looking at him. I<br>walked over and smiled to her. Took out a note &amp;<br>gave to her. She was surprised. She looked at<br>me, smiled &amp; accept the note. The next day, she<br>appeared &amp; pass me a note and left.<br>Leaf's heart is too heavy and wind couldn't blow<br>her away<br>It's not that leaf heart is too heavy. It<br>because leaf never want to leave tree<br>I replied her note with this statement and<br>slowly she started to talk to me &amp; accept my<br>presents &amp; phone calls. I know that the person<br>she loves is not me. But I have this erseverance<br>that one day I will make her like me. Within 4<br>mths, I have declared my love for her no less<br>than 20 times. Every time, she will divert away<br>from the topic.<br>But I never give up. If I decide I want her to<br>be mine, I will definitely use all means to win<br>her over. I can't remember how many times I have<br>declared my love to her. Although I know she<br>will try to divert but I still bear a small ray<br>of hope. Hoping that she will agree to me my<br>girlfriend. I didn't hear any reply from her<br>over the phone. I asked "what are you doing? How<br>come you didn't want to reply?" She said, "I'm<br>nodding my head". "Ah?" I couldn't believe my<br>ears. "I'm nodding my head" She replied loudly.<br>I hang up the phone, quickly changed and took a<br>taxi and rush to her place &amp; press her door<br>bell. During the moment when she opens the door.<br>I hugged her tightly. Leaf departure is because<br>of Wind pursuit. Or because Tree didn't ask her<br>to stay<br></div>
