            <div class='col-md body'>Recently, i get to know an older  girl (by 1 yr)whom i like very much.  She is smart (going for a part time degree now, while i "o" levels only), successful (owns her own business), pretty, and with a lot of admirers(much more successful in their carreer than me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> ~)  etc.<br><br>In all matters of life, you can say she is pretty much stronger than me..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>There are times when we can chat through the night for one week, and then all of a sudden, she ignores me another week.  Every now and then, she will just call me and talk to me.. at other times, she wont even reply my smses.. She is also  kind of tempermental and like to win.. she get touchy about certain topics easily.  i nv even say anything offending and insulting..  But she did tell me her character is like tat. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Even with all that, her personality is the sort i have been looking for.  And i do like her a lot.  Only a few girls can make my heart pound~ :shes one~ oops:<br><br>Any idea how should i go around this?  She knows how i feel.. But I cant figure out what is on her mind..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems like she treat u like a fren, who happen to be able 2 click quite well... but nothin special<br><br>But fret not, there is always possibilty..<br>there are also few suggestions 4 u :<br><br>1) Improve urself to match her better... like study higher. If that's not possible due to intelligence or lack of interest, can consider improving ur outlook... get a better haircut, dress casual smart... physical appeaarance is impt... dun care what others tell u<br>Alternatively, find a powerful mafia gang to join, work hard so u achieve fame &amp; wealth.. u stand a much better chance. Gals are attracted to powerful men..<br><br>2) U hav a car? That will increase ur "eligibility" too...To create a impression of wealth,try to stuff some folded newspaper into ur wallet to make it thicker, hav some credit cards jutting out ur of breast pocket etcc.. then jus appear nonchalent &amp; say casually... " Damm.. i hav so much money no plc to keep, they keep spillin out.. "<br><br>3)Last resort.. jus find a temple wher u pray sincerely &amp; hope for a miracle... they do happens sometimes</div>
