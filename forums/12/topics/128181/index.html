I've never believed that a person could take on a special liking towards someone even before meeting up with her face to face, until it happened to me.<br><br>Got to know this girl through friendster through a very unexpected manner, and became friends with her, frequently chatting with her on msn and sms, and occasionally on phone. It came to a certain stage where I realised that I've got a crush on her.<br><br>Yea, seems naive, absurd, and whatever you want to call. Guess such feeling is uncontrollable. I really need to hear you people's views on this issue. Anyone had a similar experience before? Care to share how did you deal with such a problem?<br><br>Getting real bothered by this man..<br><br>Thanks guys.</div>
