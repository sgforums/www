            <div class='col-md body'>Virtual communication is very different from face-face. I have frens who know each other in real life but could only clique on the internet. They believed that they were soulmates and understood each other as they could chat for hours (daily) on the net about everything. And they are not willing to miss a single session. However, the "relationship" could not withstand the test of time. It ended after a few yrs...<br><br>On a more positive note, I have a fren who is getting married to someone whom she got to know on the net.

It starts before you fall in love with someone, but maybe sometime during then, you will understand him/her enough to be in love with them. But this process doesn't stop even after they find out that they have been in love with each other. It will go on as long as they are still together...<br><br>Of course you can't love someone you dun understand, but it doesn't mean you have to understand his/her entire self before falling in love with him/her. Because I believe new discovery is always there day after day, till the end of their life together. In fact the real discovery begins after falling in love, because that's when all the flaws/imperfections will start to show.<br><br>Therefore when I fall in love with him, I would not say I understand him 100%, but I understand him enough to know this might be someone I want to be with, and the process of getting to know each other is still going on right now. If we already know everything about each other, then where will all the excitement go?<br><br>i.c.y</div>
