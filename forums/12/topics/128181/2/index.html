            <div class='col-md body'>Hello grief00<br><br>Have read your message, many others as well and think about it as well.  Love is a stage of mind, feeling and emotion.  If a blind man or woman can fall in love without seeing each other, I guess able to see the other party is not an issue in love.<br><br>However, in cyberspace thing get more complex.  We can see, touch, feel and hear him/her in the cyberworld.  But we can get close to her mind and characters.  Slowly I believe many of us do that, we began to paint a mental image of him/her fill it up with detail we like.  I wont be surprise knowling we are falling in love with this mental image.<br><br>But in order to a real relationship to start, you have to meet her.  Not telling her you love her or what.  But at least meet her.  No real relationship (I am refering to relationship not feeling) can start if we are not physically available to each other fo rthe plain reason that we are living in a physically world.<br><br>Regards<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by grief00:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi pple.<br><br>Well, couldn't believe I've fallen into such a situation. I've never believed that a person could take on a special liking towards someone even before meeting up with her face to face, until it happened to me.<br><br>Got to know this girl through friendster through a very unexpected manner, and became friends with her, frequently chatting with her on msn and sms, and occasionally on phone. It came to a certain stage where I realised that I've got a crush on her.<br><br>Yea, seems naive, absurd, and whatever you want to call. Guess such feeling is uncontrollable. I really need to hear you people's views on this issue. Anyone had a similar experience before? Care to share how did you deal with such a problem?<br><br>Getting real bothered by this man..<br><br>Thanks guys. </div></blockquote></div>
