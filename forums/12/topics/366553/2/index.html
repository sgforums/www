              <p>Please give me some life advices or experiences.<br>I need them sincerely !<br><br>1. My life<br>I am currently suffering a bad life.<br>No dreams or goals.<br>Totally no talent in any sports.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Too bad... u think you're the only one.</span></strong><br><br>2. Friends<br>I do not really have real friends.<br>All the ones that I am having are just fake friends.<br>How to really have real and proper friends?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Fake friends? Wat the fark is that? You make friends with computer AI that kind ah?</span></strong><br><br>3. No dreams.<br>I want to be a athlete competing for my country.<br>Heard that there is Youth Olympics Game.<br>But they will only select people who play nationals or inter - schools.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Haha... good luck with that... you got talent anot?</span></strong><br><br>4. Low life.<br>Someone called me "No life , Low life"<br>Because I always play the computer<br>I neglect school - life<br>Social life.<br>And every thing. Sadly to say. I am a pure class loser.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">No life worse than no low life... cos low life still got some life... see my comments for point 2... u play too much computer and make fake friends.</span></strong><br><br>5. Being poor<br>Family is poor.<br>Have to keep scrimp and save.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Cant say anything here... too bad for you... ask Bill Gates adopt you la.</span></strong><br><br>6.Popularity<br>I need popularity.<br>I must be a popular guy in school.<br>I don't want to be alone.<br>When teacher ask to find groups.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Wanna be popular? Just tell you entire school you like cocks... sure popular in 5 minutes time...</span></strong><br><br>7. Acceptance<br>I need that.<br>I need everything that boost me up.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">What you need is a cock down the throat and some cum as dessert.</span></strong><br><br>8. Self - esteem.<br>I don't have any , seriously speaking.<br>I am afraid to talk at times.<br>Lazy to talk at times too.<br>Afraid to make comments.<br>Don't dare to speak up or talk to pretty girls.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Than talk to ugly girls... you seem to have some fucking esteem in AA forum.</span></strong><br><br>9. Athletic skills.<br>I need to be able to play every sports well.<br>Or just average to win myself.<br>How can I do that?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Average to win...? see Point 3? Wanna be national team, but wanna be average... wat the fark you trying to say...?</span></strong><br><br>10. Am I really a hopeless loser?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">I dont need to answer this... there is a potential remedy though... what you need is a gun and a bullet through the head.</span></strong></p>
