She made me promise not to make her sad, i did... only to break it.<br><br>2/29/04 The message came... it's about breaking up... During the unstable period, she began to be close to her good friend who has been trying to court her for years. A week before we broke up, it already felt like the end, so that guy went to her house to console her. I didn't know, I went over as well only to see him. I was pissed and walked off. She ran after me and said "He's not my bf! It's impossible between him and me! Let's not break-up. I still care for you as my bf"<br><br>The whole week was awkward but I never do anything to upset her. I even surprised her with a gift. On 2/28, we even kissed.But on 2/29/04... the message came...<br><br>She said she made up her mind. When asked about that guy, she says she doesn't like him.<br><br>The following 2 days, they went out together... she rode on his bike... ignored my call... It was during my common test week. I felt she was a totally different person.<br><br>3/3/04. He went for BMT (NS). Me and her kept contact, like close friends. When asked about how she felt about the current situation, she say it's still good between us as good friends.<br><br>Today, 3/6/04. He called her, says he doesn't like her talking to me... and she listened. However, when I was still with her during that shaky period. I told her i dislike her talking to him or going out with him even as a group. Nothing went in...<br><br>I'm pissed now... really don't know what to do... I still see her in school everyday, same lecture and same class for one module. We still have 2 projects that is to be done between us. I still love her alot... I'm very lost...<br><br>Why is my break-up always so screwed up... why can't it just be a normal one where we walk our own way... in that way I'll only be sad.<br><br>But for this ex and a previos ex, the instant the relationship ended, the girl's with another guy. That makes it difficult to be even friends. And both are serious relationships that lasted for more than a year.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding the part that I'm upset about now.<br>She said that I broke my promise ( not to make her sad ), why can't she break hers ( talking and going out with him ). It's really unlike her to say such things. If a relationship is about revenge/ an eye for an eye. What's the point? I've always thought I'm the cause for this ending. But to think of it, if she had listened to me, I wouldn't be jealous and get pissed and she wouldn't be sad. But even if I were to talk to her about this now, she'll just give me an arrogant reply like "Okay lor, my fault lor" and ignore me. Is there really no way to make things clear? A reflection maybe?<br><br>It was really nice being a good friend with her until just now. Good for her she has a new love so soon... no need to feel sad. I'm stuck here in my own sorrows. All she can say is move on. It's alot easier to say.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Doesn't she feel anything now? Except being in love with another guy?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sounds like she wants to give it up.. but she can't bear to let the past go.. Obviously you guys have done everything together for like a few years. With all that sweetness and cream rubbish, she can't bear to let it go.. what if it doesn't work out with the other guy. What if..you 'improve' yourself and she missed out. I dunno, just seems to be the case that she can't bear to let it go.<br><br>But in actual fact, the problem is dragging it for longer doesn't help anyone else. You need to get her it's over and not talk to her at all if you feel like you're in despair all the time.<br><br>Hmm.. that's all i can say.. personal experience.. dragging it for longer was the worst thing i could have ever done. It is the one regret in my life for messing around with him for so long.</div>

I never support going after people you are working with (be it project mate/classmate/colleague, etc). If there is a must, then consider your options and consequences well.<br><br>So you are sad because you can't remain decent friends with her? The existence of her bf make things difficult for you? Knowing that the rose has thorns, you still try walk through a bush full of roses? <strong>Firstly, is there a must to remain contact when remaining contacts signfiy and suggest more suffering, more hurts and more to torments</strong>?<br><br>You said you wanna walk away but are you truely walking away? Or you merely move off somewhere safe and try to peep as you follow her? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Regarding to the promises she gave to you - all I know is such promises can almost never be kept. Promise to never make her feel the blues? Name me someone - anybody whom you deemed has a successful relationship without experiencing any sorrow phrase throughout the course of their relationship over say one year? Such love utopia never exist.<br><br>You said you wanna move on, but can't because you wanna to treat her like a buddy, the way you always did before this relationship was born - seriously speaking, do you think things can revert back to what it was? No right? Then it remaining friends is difficult - why not learn to let them go? Your speech is contradicting - even if you see her in school, so be it. You can <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CHOOSE</span></strong> to lead your own life and ignore her - but you don't want that option. I am telling you it's going to be difficult - but it's a way to leave the ruin village.<br><br>P.S: Not every relationship will revert back to friendship. I suggest you give yourself some time. Don't force a friendship to appear just because you want it to be. Let fate do it's job - if truely, nothing can salvage what you desire, then so be it.<br><br>Are you a Libra?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

As for me, i don't think it's possible to become good friends overnight. I mean, it takes about a year to move on and forget about your ex (well for me anyway).. i'm not a superwoman. Well.. cos when you asked for a clean break, she said that loved you blah etc..<br><br>It's like.. when starting to see a new guy, she wants you as her security blanket. BTW, this is just from experience.. not that i know what she feels 110%.. it's beacause when the new relationship fails, she knows you are there on the sideline cheering for her, holding a tourch for her. You know what i mean? It's all about attention hun. If it's really torturing you so much to be at her whims and fancy. Just ignore her phone calls and stuff until she treats you like a real friend would do. Put you in the #1 position even though she has a boyfriend. If my friends rang me up and they are depressed and upset on the phone.. i would drive down and be with them and my boyfriend would understand.<br><br>Hmm.. are you catching my drift?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GwenSilvz, my way of seeing things is probably going to seem oversimplified, but it's from being through the traps enough times to know how to focus only on the essentials.<br><br>You're putting effort in, and she's not.  Not only is she not putting effort in, she's taking your effort for granted as and when she pleases.<br><br>Bottom line: in this relationship/friendship, you're the asset and she's the liability.  Whatever positive energy there is, you're providing it, and she's draining it.<br><br>Her reasons, be it PMS, youthful idecision or what not, matter jack squat - the net effect is that you're in a losing situation.<br><br>Walk away and cut your losses.  From the sounds of it, you'd be worth much more to yourself if you were with someone who actually gives a damn about what you put in, instead of paying lip service and playing games.  Your effort's better spent looking for someone who deserves you, instead of bailing water out of this sinking ship.  Life's too damned short to be agonising over some nickel-and-dime game like this - you owe it to yourself to be good to yourself.</div>
