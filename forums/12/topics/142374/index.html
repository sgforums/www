            <div class='col-md body'>Hm... not informing is truely bad.<br><br>My situation is that me and my ex had some quarrel, broke up in Jan. Then i chased her back, cosrt of like wanting to patch back. So in May, I asked her for a patch which she agreed.<br><br>But guess what?? The nxt day she sms me to say she did not wan to patch cos she feels that she wasnt ready so commit her self in a rls and also she wans freedom! I was in camp that day and it was a Monday! Super Monday blues siah!<br><br>I think that she was playing with my feelings cos I ever told her if she not ready, dun accept anything.<br><br>One year later wh en I went into Uni, I saw her with another guy holding hands. Upon confirmation from frens, told me she was attached sometime ago. I realised what she told me was actually a pack of lies.<br><br>So besides informing the guys, pls also do tell them the true reasons.</div>
