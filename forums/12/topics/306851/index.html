              <p>Since your hubby cheated on you once, your heart felt like you had the license to be unfaithful too. But all that is left now is regret.</p>
              <p>Why did you check into a hotel for? Just to watch DVDs only? The atmosphere is almost poisonous enough for such an incident to happen.</p>
              <p>That guy sux. He knows you're married and he still tempted you to commit the wrong acts. For a place to chat, there is always the park, the cafe, the beach etc.</p>
              <p>Come clean with your hubby. Both of you have committed adultery. If both of you can't forgive each other <span style="text-decoration: underline;">AND</span> forget this past, then I'm afraid divorce is not far in the horizon.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ae3cee;">who (especially a married woman) in the right mind would go hotel with a man thinking it's purely watching dvd?</span></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ae3cee;">I think it would be only fair to tell him if he ever confessed to u abt his wrongdoings. From there, seek each other's forgiveness and hopefully after this crisis, u two will learn how to be truthful and cherish each other more.  </span></p>

              <p>Your that good friend is fuck up.....</p>
              <p>1 advice</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>DO NOT BOOK HOTEL</strong></span> , you can always visit places like cafe... open places, dont ever meet at night, something will happen and you will blame this blame that.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Personally i hate people who blame others, when they started this themself.</span></p>
              <p>And also, <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">do not find a GUY at NIGHT</span></strong>, that is most preferly, find a <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>female friend</strong></span> to talk about this.</p>
              <p>Hope you know your mistake.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="COLOR: black" lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I don't seriously think anyone in the right frame of mind would initiate a 'catch up' with a friend in a hotel room. Obviously you weren't in the right frame of mind at that point of time, but I think you are far too naive to assume that it would an innocent catch up with him in a hotel room. And also, I reckoned that your friend is truly some wolf in sheep's clothing and it would do you good to eliminate contact with him.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="COLOR: black" lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>

Such behaviour will only fuel more misery in your marriage and ultimately benefit the 'external vultures' that seek to capitalise from your turmoil relationship. </span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="COLOR: black" lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="COLOR: black" lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Your friend is like vulture - circling around the sky, secretly hoping to see if there is any good chance for him to earn an uncommitted sexual relationship through your misfortune. He represents a classic cosmic lesson - that if our relationship is flawed and if we are not evolved spiritually, emotionally and psychologically, the cracks in the relationship will reveal to us our inability to handle crisis positively and trigger a karmic reaction, like how rain water would slipped through those crevices and flood your interior. <span> </span></span></span></p>

Firstly, I think there's a critical need to understand the rationale behind his drifting. The possibilities are numerous, but if you don't seemed to understand it, this situation might just reiterate in the future. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="COLOR: black" lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="COLOR: black" lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Secondly, you probably have to establish if he still wants his marriage to work out - this goes the same for you. </span></span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="COLOR: black" lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Then, there must be a mutual decision to steer away anything that would breed disharmony OR disloyalty between husband and wife. I think there must be a common understanding that if this cannot be done, then there is no reason why one should still remain in the relationship, yet spare no effort to revive it.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Marriage is nothing like BGR; the need for greater maturity, wisdom and tact is much more crucial to ensure that you can enjoy a contented relationship.

              <p>wirdan21,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now that you know how it's like to be in his shoe when he cheated on you. What do you think ? Was it purely innocent ? Was his/your excuse a valid one ?</p>
              <p>In your heart, you already know the answers.</p>
              <p>It wasn't an innocent mistake.</p>
              <p>Let's face it, what's done is done. There is no need to tell him what you did.</p>
              <p>Telling him will only hurt him, and his trust for you will be gone. Just like your trust for him was shattered when he cheated on you.</p>
              <p> Forget this marriage, it's over.</p>
              <p>If you want to keep it, it will take many years to mend the cracks.</p>
              <p>Do you really believe he will trust your claim about not having sexual intercourse with your friend IN A HOTEL ROOM ?</p>
              <p>Once he knows, it will be his PUSH for a divorce. You WILL BE the adulteress NOT your hubby.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sometimes, ignorance is bliss.</p>
              <p>Sometimes honesty is NOT always the best policy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A divorce nowadays, can be fast and painless.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't sink deeper anymore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just let him know the marriage is down the drain, and file for a divorce soon.</p>
              <p>However, if you want to keep this marriage.</p>
              <p>The best thing you can do, is to keep your mouth shut and bring this secret to your grave and pray every night that he will never find out.</p>
              <p>Learn to live with this guilt, by yourself, forever.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Aiya, causal sex only mah, it ok, as long as there is no love, not a problem. But I think you a bit weak in yourself to be easily seduce into having sex with guys which is their ultimate objectives, if I am in your shoe, i will rather go dating and have plenty of fun than sex, let your hubby feels the pain of being cheated, if he wanted divorce so be it, no remorse needed.</p>

Only married one year and thing go heywired, i think you made a damn big mistake in love, next time, check it out before marrying ya.</p>

              <p>It takes plenty of strength n courage to face the fact that the other half cheated on you...</p>

              <p>TS as you can see, no matter how much you would like to say to convince "us" that there was no intercourse during your brief encounter in the hotel with your friend, there is still a tinge of disbelief in the air.</p>
              <p>I must remind you that there are somethings better left unsaid than said, and undone better than done. I think you should understand what my point is here. Right now, I think you are feeling confuse and let down which is natural. However, I would like to remind you that the both of you will need to work things out if you all would still want this marriage.</p>
              <p>In the 1st place, you mentioned that he has cheated on you before, are you sure that he is still cheating? Sometimes, when someone tells you of their past especially your husband here, many a times it means that he wants to come clean before you and is telling you that he treasures you. He does not want you to misunderstand when you happen to see him with his girl colleagues and/or clients. You cannot just bring on the past on him and I do not think that is fair and has any good for your marriage.</p>
              <p>2ndly never find a person of the opposite sex to pour out your sorrows and woes. No sane counsellor will do that too. Don't you have close g/fs of your own where you can relate well and talk to? Besides, it will do you some good to go to your own home with your parents for a weekend to relax and gather yourself. And the last thing will be to check into a hotel room? Sg is so small...just how and what are you going to say when you are seenï¼ŸAgain, I know there is nothing going on but......who is going to believe you? On what basis?</p>
              <p>I think in all r/s one must always give and take. Always able to forgive and always able to see things from a different perspective.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              Well, talk to yr hubby and make thing clear to him that u r not happy at all. Speak yr mind and clear all yr doubt with him rather to find a guy to release yr stress.
              
              Taking short cut and not facing the problem is not the way. Family problem still need face to face to solve it.
              
              
              The worst thing in life is to be regret, regret u did the wrong thing, regret u didn't try yr best, regret taking short cut.
