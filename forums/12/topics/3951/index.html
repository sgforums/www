            <div class='col-md body'>just a ridiculous relationship to share with u people.....<br><br>guy A met this girl B online. in irc. these 2 pple kept losing contact on and off for over 3 yrs. and finally, one fine day, B sends an e-mail to A, requesting for a re-intro.....and miraculously, this time, they managed to maintain contact.....after a few weeks of daily communication, A "proposes" to B...as in asking B to go steady with A...(this is the dumb part) albeit not knowing A thoroughly/well enough, and not having seen A b4, B agrees, after much persuasion/sweet talk from A.<br><br>had quite some bit of fun times together........(ok, i'm gonna skip the details..) den, after going steady for 1 mth, A broke up with B....saying that he is just not ready for commitments....B was very upset......oh, by the way, this was B's first time meddling in affairs of the heart...anyway, B begged A to patch with her.<br><br>2 weeks later, A agrees to patch with B... ah, B thought it would last.....sweet sweet times......a week later, alas, A broke up with B again.....in between, there was always this girl, C being the mediator.....C was sort of the good friend of B. always standing up for B infront of A, speaking up for B, and asking A to take good care of B. any problems with A, B seldom tells A, coz she doesn't know how to tell him, and instead, B tells C, and C in turn tells A..and asks A to do something bout it....(ah....confusing...)<br><br>anyway, after the 2nd break, which lasted for 2 days or so, they patched again.....(i've even lost count...sighzz..) but well, as expected, after another 2 weeks, they brokeup. and yesh, this was the very very last time they broke up...<br><br>anyway, A broke up with B the first few times......and for the very last time, B broke up with A....reason being......she felt that A didn't love her anymore.....bottom line, she was jealous of C, who seemed to be spending more time with A than B was....and well, A kept comparing B with C, and so and so....<br><br>ah.....dumb story.....pathetic......<br>oh ya, latest update on this pathetic n ridiculous pair, A asked B for a patch after more than 1 yr from their final break.....with no apparent reason....=) *s|lly gW|nZ* spastic......<br>matters of the heart.....*sarcastic luff* wat's the point man.........so ma fan....<br><br>[This message has been edited by t|rEd (edited 09 September 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think I can beat that for lameness...<br><br>There's this boy X, who's secretly been in love with a girl for 5 and a half years.<br>The 1st year, he doesn't do anything, except go around in a daze and be really stoned.<br>2nd year, she leaves to study overseas. X is totally unprepared for this. Somehow he gets on with it.<br>Year 3, the dream starts to fade away, he hasn't had word of her for almost 2 years.<br>Middle year 4, he gets to see her at a class gathering. They talk quite a bit. A few weeks down the road, he wins a pair of movie-tickets. He knows he will never forgive himself if he does not ask her out. Sweating over it for 3 days, he manages to pick up the phone and contact her. They go for the movie. His 1st date ever, X is barely coherent. Miraculously, this does not piss her off. She flies off.<br>Middle year 5, gets to see her again. But only for an hour or so. She flies off again.<br>Present day, this time she asks him out via email. He is finally stable enough to have a 1/2 decent conversation with her. She can't stay long though, hardly past an hour. She flies off, - yes again.<br><br>So there he is, X, a boy desperately lonely for a girl he can only see for (about) an hour a year.<br><br>How's that for lameness. (Esp since there's a whole year to go...)</div>
