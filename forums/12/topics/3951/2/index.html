X is totally unprepared for this. Somehow he gets on with it.<br>Year 3, the dream starts to fade away, he hasn't had word of her for almost 2 years.<br>Middle year 4, he gets to see her at a class gathering. They talk quite a bit. A few weeks down the road, he wins a pair of movie-tickets. He knows he will never forgive himself if he does not ask her out. Sweating over it for 3 days, he manages to pick up the phone and contact her. They go for the movie. His 1st date ever, X is barely coherent. Miraculously, this does not piss her off. She flies off.<br>Middle year 5, gets to see her again. But only for an hour or so. She flies off again.<br>Present day, this time she asks him out via email. He is finally stable enough to have a 1/2 decent conversation with her. She can't stay long though, hardly past an hour. She flies off, - yes again.<br><br>So there he is, X, a boy desperately lonely for a girl he can only see for (about) an hour a year.<br><br>How's that for lameness. (Esp since there's a whole year to go...)</div></blockquote>Wow.. I think I was bad enuff.. To see my gf once, for a couple of hrs only in 3-4 wks. Never knew that there are pple who are worse off.. I'm really impressed, and touched by ur determination, and sincerity towards that ger. Furthermore I am listening to a Chinese song, 'dan ni gu dan ni hui xiang qi shui' and believe me, my eyes actually well up, after hearing ur story, and also thinking abt my own situation. Maybe the song, ur story, and the quiet ambience, and my tots, created the senerio, but I'm really impressed. Makes me feel that there is hope in the midst of darkness... We're on the same boat, just that I'm slightly better.<br>Call me 'a weak man' if u want, but feel that guys haf feelings too.

But U can it's not so openly like wat u said. Most of the time it's by actions, rather than thru' words. Maybe, he can juz offer u wif some of ur fav snacks. It's also his way of telling u that he loves u. Many will just take it as he gets something for me to eat. But toi him, he knows that it's ur fav food. and thus he gets it for u.<br><br>Anyway if everything is so straight, then there will be no joy or surprises. Having a little twist, a little hidden meaning, I think will let u haf something to do. But I know it can be pretty tiring and irritating if u not in the mood at that point of time. Of coz I'm also not saying that he let u guess his intemtions all the time lahz.<br><br>Actually sometimes u can do the same too.. Think guys wun mind a little fun. But do bear in mind that many guys are less-sensitive than girls. Hence, u might haf to put in a little bit more effort. On the other hand, to a guy I think it's becoz of our less-sensitive nature, we tends to over-emphasize on our actions, and made our gfs suspicious of us... haa haa..<br><br>I dun think it's that hard to find guys who are expressive.. Different guys haf different ways of expressing themselves. Just like u, sometimes u feel that this is ur way of showing ur love for him, but he just dun get ur meaning. Communication do play a part here. U just haf to know each other's way of showing love, care, and feelings. Actually, we haf all sorts of guys as well.. There r those who will cry like babies.. and those who just well up quietly in their eyes.. It's not true that guys dun burst out like fountains. It's all just feelings.. think pple who dun cry dun haf feelings.. hee hee..<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>somehow, when i say rexpressing themselves, pple take it to be saying "i love u". well, it is one of wat i meant, but also, u noe when talking bout certain things lo. as in take for example: a ger wrote this poem for her ex-bf, telling him that she still loves him, and will continue to love him forever. then, the guy somehow lost the poem, and was just asking the ger if she could give him another copy. the ger just asked y, and the guy shut up..... just like that. the ger asked him y in a teasing way la anyway.......but the guy just kept quiet and moved on to another topic.<br><br>cannot ask y issit? i mean, wat's so difficult about saying the reason??? i dun understand lo........haizzz......<br><br>actually, this scenario like quite familiar leh. hahaha =) usu guys would ask wat the ger wants and so on so forth, and when the ger dun say , the guy would go ask his freind wat the ger thinking, bla bla bla....haizzzz........<br><br>humanz.......they just like to complicate things dun they? sorry for my negative point of view of humans.......just basically sick of life and people.......<br><br>or mebbe i'm just into one of my other moods......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually I think it's not becoz cannot ask 'y??' It's more becoz the guy is afraid to tell the ger that he has misplaced it, becoz it may mean that he treats the ger and her stuff like dirt.. can be easily thrown away or lost... it shows that the guy will not cherish the ger indirectly.<br><br>Well... not all humans are that bad... there r those who really gaf their entirely life to help others.
