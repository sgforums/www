            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all...<br><br>Even though i really truely love my bf, and he loves me, we still often get xian... like sometimes i say something wrong, he will xian the whole day. Then i know he xian then i more xian. Like yesterday, we played maple story. Then cos his level higher than me i quite xian but nevermind can train then i keep jokin say his character die better or his internet connection dc then i can catch up. Then he told me that he keep dc already very xian no need to rub it in. Then i was thinking last time when he ji siao me other things he got think i will sian a not. He can say pple then pple cannot say him? Then today, wanted to accompany him go tm to do something. He woke up call me, ask me wan to go with him now, dun go, or he come my house then we go later. I said anything and i meant go later or dun go, not go now. I know my fault din say properly but i just woke up keke. Then in the end he went himself and when he reached home, he said if next time i dun wan go out or lazy go out can just say. Thanks. To me its like.. i dun mean that.. but he say till like that i also xian. Haiz<br><br>Now i see so much differences in us. I know when u're in a relationship longer u will see more differences. I dun know if its my fault or his fault that most of the times we quarrel. I know i have a past that is horrible but he told me he dun mind its over. But in the end it is still affecting us. I think ya its my fault too but sometimes some things i know its not my fault but i listen to him until i will think its my fault.<br><br>I really dun know. Its so tiring to be in a relationship like that. My thoughts about him, over protective, posessive, always wan me listen to him like everything i dono or wrong. But he has his good points which made me be with him in the first place. But it seems that all these bad points are more and more nowadays. He was'nt like this when we first started.

If you're really not comfortable with some things, just let him know..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>How old are you btw? It's really quite meaningless to brood over small things...<br><br>Let me use myself for an example... Because of 'certain things', my gf reacted in a certain way... Then I thought it really bother her, hence the way she's reacting (not reacting) to me...? Coincidentally, she needed to let me in on some information and I simply MISINTERPRETED IT because of the way she was behaving all these while..<br><br>In fact when I think over things... I find it quite a COMMON scenerio for many couples... Because of some tiny things then got bother and give each other a hard time or pulled face.. When other issues roll in at such vulnerable moments, the relationship is just very vulnerable to 'attacks'...<br><br>Hence I feel that in your case, you shouldn't really let the little things bother you too much... And if they really bother you, you should ideally have an 'established' (need not be formal one, but rather an effective one which in the style you deem fit for both of you...) conversation / discussion...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
