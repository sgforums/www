            <div class='col-md body'>Just to share with u.<br><br>I have had social problems since a very young age, right from the beginning of my schooling life. Even till now when i am working, my social circle has been very small no matter how hard i try.<br><br>New people around me would think that i am just being quiet. (The fact is i dunno what i can talk about, i am quite the passive type when it comes to socialising. When i try, things get real odd). As time passes, people will have different perceptions of you, some will still think u are just a quiet character, others may develop negative impressions of you like 'being dao', being 'unfriendly', wierdo.....etc. Believe me, such sentiments spreads around fast, and sad to say, natural extroverts tends to pour down on introverts (not all are like that though).<br><br>No matter if the impressions are negative or not, being the 'not so fun' character, you will eventually be left out of subsequent activities being planned. When people are inviting ppl around to join in certain activities and yet you being the omitted one even when u are standing right there, I can tell you the feelings ain't so good. Thats just one of the situations you may encounter. As much as I would like to mix around, i can't function properly when i am with them. Its a very contradicting emotion.<br><br>So while you are still young, try hard and get wild (within your own moral limits of course). I was too strict on myself when i was younger, i believe that sort of partially contributed to what i am today. I do not wish to see another like u to walk my painful path, i hope you walk out of your current predicament, even if it will take years.....<br><br>And if you want some medical point of view, go google Asperger's Syndrome. This was at a point when i thought i had some kind of autism and i spent some time doing some research. Of course, most cases its not medical, just a character issue.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Secondary school<br><br>Actually when I was in secondary school, I was quite popular in class. I managed to know a little of everyone in each small clique, and never felt lonely.<br><br>JC<br>However when I went to JC, it was a different story. Everyone seemed to know each other (E.g. during the 3 mths pre-JC entrace time / ex-secondary school mates / ex -school mates) except me. I became a loner. Is like there is nothing I can talk to them about rite, when u do not know anything about them  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> . It was such a sad time, and I cliqued with only one gal who was more sociable than me. I was really counting down to the end of my JC days.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Off course I was teased in every possible way, but seriously wat could I do.<br><br>University<br>than I went U and luckily came to know my colleagues' (From part time work) daughter . From there came to know her friends etc. But the social circle was still limited, coz is the same gang (there was quite a bunch of us).<br><br>Work life<br>Come work, I had a great time with my colleauges coz all are young (1/2/3 yrs older), share the same horrid seniors (So we complain etc), share the same work horrors. Whenever I wanted to have dinner, I just had to ask around and just go out and have eat / just go gym together. Even than I was the quietest in my unit, and I am thankful they accepted me.<br><br>New job<br>Now I have a new job. There is no one I can talk to . Sometimes I have to convince myself I am normal. I can hardly find someone to lunch with / talk normal topics with. Its so bad that i tell myself I was born mute and deaf, and its okay not to tok.<br><br>After reading my long story, I hope u get the point that environment plays a large part . I never changed much from the beggining. One way to look more appealing is SMILE  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> . Look happy= will feel happy. Or do a count-down like me, and know that in your new school there is new hope. Or read self-help books. Or find activities where others share your same interest e.g. some ECA.</div>

People in general, just do not like to do anything that may look "funny" to others.<br><br>my advice will be the same.<br><br>"I always feel left out of groups and don't talk to people around me in school"<br><br>When you are in gps that you feel comfy in (as in you know them well enough to know they wont judge, or gps that are full of crap themselves) don't be afraid to speak out.<br>What's the worst that can happen? -u say something, they laugh? they distance themselves? well if they laugh, laugh with them. if they distance themselves, then they are not your friends to begin with.<br><br>I can remember so many things i did, that made ppl laugh.... the difference is I LAUGHED WITH THEM TOO.....<br><br>Remember, <span style="color: red;">they all say and do the wrong things at times too.... </span><br><br>"have been having low self esteem and im always thinking people are looking down on me."<br><br>Well this is a demon that only you can fight. every one have times when they think shlT about themselves, some more then others.....<br><br>I too have a huge demon of that nature. but i fought it. I told myself (b4 i entered Poly) that this was a fresh start. no one there knows me. and i do not want them to meet the "outcast" "shy" "scared" me. I want them to know the "friendly" "brave" "hack care" me.<br><br>and so during the freshmen orientation meets, I stepped out. in a gp, I'm the first to introduce myself, to gals and guys too. and i realised, eveyone is feeling the same. they are also feeling scared, shy, afraid of making a fool of themselves... but when someone with them loosen up, they do too.<br><br><span style="color: orange;">It is a change you have to force upon yourself. </span><br><br>Even if i have battled the demon and won, the demon is not vanquish. it is merely sitting at a corner waiting for the time to strike.<br><br>When you are feeling sad, and esp when you just ended a relationship, this demon will strike again... the key is to remember the faces of all your friends and loved ones, ppl who just accepted you as you are, not wanting you to change.<br><br>it is really about the courage to change yourself. I changed. I have learned that sometimes making a fool of myself in front of others may not be that big a deal.... that most of the time I just have to learn to take a step back and look at the situation.... it is really quite funny... and you laugh, along with the others, laughing not AT you, but WITH yourself.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Of course there's times when you do something really stupid, and really embarassing..... but who here have not?!</span><br><br>Take courage my friend.</div>

I never changed much from the beggining. One way to look more appealing is SMILE  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> . Look happy= will feel happy. Or do a count-down like me, and know that in your new school there is new hope. Or read self-help books.
