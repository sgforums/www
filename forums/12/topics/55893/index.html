At least that way if something goes really wrong one day, you'll be the one who live to regret your decision... Not to regret because someone else has made the decision for you... When you're firm and mature to make the decisions yourself you should very well do so... Don't be afraid of failures... If you never try, you'll never know... And you'll never learn...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there are more and more ladies being more prominent in the engineering field already.. so don't worry about it.. you may need to work a bit extra hard just to prove yourself.. but it is true that the aeronautics industry has only few players here.. it depends on what u really want to do in the industry..<br><br>think hard and long if u really want to be a flight attendant.. it's fun and quite an experience to be flying around.... but my friends say it's not a long term job to be in.. some do make it well as a flight attendant.. many just go for the experience and stop after a few years.. if u don't want to fly long term.. prepare yourself to have a way out after life as a crew..<br><br>lastly, sometimes, parent's advice are good to follow becos, they've been thru life.. listen and decide on your own.. it's your life to live for <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
