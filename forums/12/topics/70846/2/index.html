If you have been here long enough, you would have realise that this problems of his has been around for almost as long as he came, at least that I knew of. It is neither the subject of NS that he feared nor anything else that NS would have brought forward - it's isolation, a man on the island, and not even a single soul that he can speak to, even in school now. You people have been through NS - but have you been through isolation? A world of your own? This poor guy probably only has sgforum to communicate and NONE of you nor me fall under such stress.<br><br>I have three steps for you:<br><br>I) Open up, release your fear and gradually talk to people. By being weird, you appear weird and under theory of initial attraction - you probably only can attract people who are weird. Don't. Look at my signature below. Determine which gender you would feel better around with and always start communicating first.<br><br>II) Art of seduction, Phrase one, Separation: Enter their spirit. <span style="font-style: italic;">Most people are locked in their own worlds, making them stubborn and hard to persuade. The only way to lure them out of their shell and set up your seduction is to enter their spirit. Play by their rule, enjoy what they enjoy, adapt yourself to their moods. In doing so, you will stroke their deep-rooted naricissim and lower their defenses. Hypnotized by the mirror image you present, they will open up, becoming vulnerable to your subtle influence... </span><br><br>In simple; <strong>when in Rome, do what the Romans do</strong>. Anywhere you go, people who assimilate into other's culture always works because you consciously reduce that psychological gap between you and people.<br><br>III) Seek similiar interest and start from there. Used to play CS back in my younger days and with that similar interest, everyone's knitted - irregardless of nationality, etc. Common interest foster similiarity - which is a good ground for friendship to build on. <strong>Friends always have something in common at first</strong> - so understand your personal interest and probably focus and expand into it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Guys, there's a lot of stuff that isn't represented on this thread, and it's not mainly about race even though it could look that way.  Now I know it's a mouthful coming from me, but please, let's not flame here.<br><br>Okay, men_@_arms, we know that renouncing PR is a possibility, and maybe Bear could either confirm or disprove that.  On the safe side, let's look at the possibility of you entering NS.<br><br>kopiosatu's got it pretty spot-on there.  In BMT, what you're going to get is a bunch of bewildered recruits, with maybe a couple with enough of their wits about them to get the rest of the guys organised.  As such, they're not really going to have the time to discriminate.  However, there are a couple of other things that you do need to look out for, and I'm writing this as a description of the situation without reference to your personality or abilities - that's something for later.  Yun's already covered the important stuff, and the objective of my post is to cover practical survival skills in BMT.<br><br>First and foremost, you need to be a team player (as cliched as the term sounds).  Be alert and always make a point to know what you're supposed to be doing.  Everybody's in the same boat and most of the everything that you do requires everyone to work together, so if someone isn't on the same page as everybody else and things go wrong, whoever dropped the ball is going to cop it from the other guys.<br><br>Second, it's not a very intellectual environment - talk about anything other than what's at hand and chances are that you'll be pegged as a gobby git.  Referring back to the first point, focus upon what's "right here, right now", and you'll be OK.  In the unlikely situation that there's nothing for you to do, keep an eye out to see if anybody needs a hand with anything - for example, if a bunch of guys from your platoon are tasked to move some funiture/equipment and you happen to be available to help, jump in and help moving even though you weren't asked.  It comes back to the team player thing: do what you can to help make things easier for everyone and you're guaranteed to get a lot of friends.<br><br>Coming back to the lack of an intellectual environment, learn to speak the language.  I'm not talking about Hokkien, I'm talking about the issues that are of immediate concern to the guys around you.  Don't intellectualise it, but instead translate everything into actions that can be carried out immediately or within the constraints of the situation.  That's the language that all recruits speak - practical solutions to the problem at hand.  If it's too conceptual rather than concrete, or if the suggestions are too vague of impossible to carry out, they're just going to tune out because it does not offer them hope of solving the problem.<br><br>Perhaps your biggest concern will be the principle in BMT of breaking you down before building you up.  You will be harangued, teased and insulted, but don't take it personally.  The object is to level out differences between the recruits and then mould them into an integrated unit, and it will be done through equal-opportunity discrimination.  At the end of the day, the quickest way of getting people off your back is to focus on what's been covered in the three paragraphs above.<br><br>Remember one basic working principle: the nail that sticks out will be hammered in.  Be the "gray man" and blend into the background - if you either fail to pull your weight or try to be the hero (which I doubt you'll be motivated to do, but it requires mention nonetheless), you will be noticed, and attention is the last thing you could possibly want.<br><br>This next one is a tall order: don't whinge and moan, and don't lose your temper.  Like I said, everybody's in the same boat and they've got to grit their teeth and bear it.  The last thing they want to hear is someone else's complaint.  As far as everyone else is concerned, the only thing to justifiably lose your temper about is something that affects everybody, not just yourself.  Again, it comes back to the team player issue.<br><br>Remember, what you've got here is a bunch of guys who are very unwillingly lumped together and required to work as a team.  Nobody's happy about it (although probably to a lesser extent than yourself), but everybody's just trying to make it through.  It's a very Darwinian environment and if you're a a team player, your ethnicity will not be an issue and as a bonus, you'll make some fast friends.<br><br>I know that the above is a tall order, but it's coming from someone who had to learn it, and learn it right quick.  I got dragged kicking and screaming into NS (yes, kopi, you do need your head checked - $142 for professional consultation services please! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ), didn't know the meaning of being a team player, thought much more in conceptual than concrete terms, and whinged nonstop.  Thankfully for myself, there were a few guys who did the same thing more obviously than I did and ended up at the bottom of the food chain, so I managed to vicariously learn what not to do.  Right now, especially with the luxury of time, I'd encourage you to do the same.</div>
