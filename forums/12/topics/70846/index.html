I've seen eurasian in the army who can mix well with anybody. You only get "mark" when you try to show off or act smart. If not, you are just like any of the guys who got to suffer the same bullsh!t and time wasted for 2 years. If you think it's not fair to you, try to lodge a complain or something. They might just listen cause you are white. duh. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

The army is a place where everyone helps everyone unless you meet some idiots who only care for themselves.

            <div class='col-md body'>i think the bigger picture is y u r unable to socialise with local ppl , not the recruitment thing .. dun meant to push u off the edge ( since u mentioned that u r suicidal ) , but maybe it's u yourself that causing ppl to stay away from u , i's true that some local ppl tend to avoid foreigner at all cost , but a lot of locals r nice to them too .. well as long as the angmoh dun throw any racism shit at them .. somewhat i can't envision so many local ppl avoiding u juz cos u r not a local ..<br><br>nothing against u personally but juz my take on the whole thing ..<br><br></div>

He got PR cos he works here, and so my mum and I automatically become PRs as well. We are foreign citizens, I have only been in Singapore for 6 years schooling. And i might actually have to serve NS?!! I am pissed because it just does not sound fair, how come all the other white PR's children dont have to go?<br><br>But NS itself is not the problem. Its just that I am already struggling with suicidal and homocidal thoughts in school cos of my lack of socialisation. I dont think I can bear to spend 2 years (mondays to fridays full TIME), in a barracks with a bunch of local people, in the same sort of "-segregatory-socialisation-thing" which i currently face in school now. I fear out of anger, from being dissed by sergeants and ignored by fellows, i fear I may really lose it, already its hard to find weapons in school, yet alone a barracks? Haha I can imagine the headlines "Psychopath Foreign Eurasian freak kills Singaporeans in Army barracks. Minister says this is the result of letting ANYONE go into National Service".<br><br>Help me. I am suffering now, i dont want to suffer even MORE later on. This is psychological suffering, not a physical thing, dont tell me i am weak physcially, I could take on anyone of you small people! </div></blockquote>well well.. calling US small ppl hor??? who the racist one here.. but nvm.... dun worri lah singaporean are good ppl... as long as u can prove that u are good we wont treat u as outcast.... thats one thing good about ns..... coz u will be together with alot of chinese and malay and u suffer together, so race dun matters.. but attitude does... if u everything also take cover than u die lor.... if not the tougher the training the better u will bond ... trust mi on that....so just go in there and enjoy the suffering together then book out time go chiong together lor..</div>
