            <div class='col-md body'>waiting for ur reply to mod.<br><br>at the moment i can ask u a few questions<br><br>Who started the relationship?<br>Why did u start this relationship?<br><br>If u really love your gf, you should realise that you should respect/understand and most importantly trust her.<br><br>You must also search yourself. what gives you such insecurity that she has other bf outside? Is it that your are feeling inferior or is your GF such a beauty that she stuns everyone who walks down the street? There are signs which will make u feel this insecurity, what are this signs? please specify them. when u are able to say out this signs, then you are able to figure out it.<br><br>Sleeps. Yes sleep is essential to us. I ask u smth, how long do your know this GF of yours?You know her for 1 year plus already!  you should roughly know whether she is a person who sleeps long/short. For example, I myself is a person who can sleep from 1am til 5pm wake up, eat dinner, watch tv, den turn to bed at 1am den wake up at 5pm again. It is down to individuals. there are also people who sleep at 1am wake up at 9am and unable to continue their sleep. is this just another sleeping pattern of hers or just your insecurity? or she may have problems sleeping due to some reasons.<br><br>Going out late. There are various reasons why she is able to come home late with her girlfriends but not with you. firstly, she may wish to hang out with her girl friends longer and therefore choose the day to hang out when her mom gets home late. and she may also feel, i been hanging out with u so frequently, if we dun spend that much time tonite, we can spend more time tml. Secondly, her parents may give her a curfew while hanging out with you, but do not give a curfew while hanging out with her girlfriends. maybe because her girlfriends are closer to their parents? you may not know.<br><br>a lot excuses from her de... sometimes i really feel like asking her... does she still loves me... or she had other bf outside... cuz i really don like the feeling... fancy meeting me almost everyday... either sleeping or rushing home at nite after she woke up.... really hate it...<br><br>regarding the above paragraph, wad excuses she give? If she have BFs outside, and me believeing that she is a very long sleeper, how could she have time for other BFs?.<br><br>Sorry for my LONG newbie post. hope it is helpful.</div>

She might find you too boring, but chose to stay on with you as she is too used to the relationship. When a guy she fancies more than you enters her life, it is likely that she will leave you for him.<br><br>Essentially, you've become her door mat. You're being too nice to her.
