Friends that gives me the cold shoulder are just people who crave for attention, so I don't mind.<br>BUT WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THAT?! It is like ON and OFF. And I'm really confuse with her intentions. Sometimes, she sounds SO NICE. Sometimes, she sounds like she wants to KILL ME or something.<br>She will say sarcastically, "Oh hello Weiling" if I say hi to her. But she will say "HEY WEILING!!" sometimes too, shouting like she needed me NOW and NOW and NOW.<br><br>What is she trying to tell me?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm 11 going to be 12 this year, December 17th.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Anyway, thanks for all the advices.<br>Today, she totally IGNORED me. "Hello sucker." she said. Then after recess, guess what? "HELLO WEILING!!" and so cheerful.<br>I don't think it is mood swings, because she is NOT like that with her other friends. For example, Yuan Ying.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> That time, we were TRAINING on our 1.6km run when Ashley accidentally pushed Yuan Ying to the ground and thus, she (Yuan Ying) couldn't run very fast. After the run, she (Yuan Ying) ignored Ashley when she (Ashley) asked her if she is alright. I asked Yuan Ying afterwards whether she like Ashley or not. She said "NO." and I asked Ashley how she feel. "I feel very upset leh...I pushed her down! But it was accidentally, I swear!! Now she won't talk to me..." and then walks away dejectedly. The PE teacher let us have a 5 min rest and then started training us for the bean-bag run. He divided us into our Houses group (Red, blue, purple and green), and I was in Red House and so is Ashley. She ran quite slower than usual and I asked her why after she came back (I was in front of her), she said that "I still feel upset..what if Yuan Ying don't friend me anymore?!?!" and moped around.<br>But in the end, of course, Yuan Ying friended Ashley and she (Ashley) was happy. Apparently, even though Ashley said a thousand and one "SORRY YUAN YING!" and a million and one "ARE YOU OKAY, YUAN YING?", Yuan Ying still ignored her. But I made them PATCH IT UP by saying some "magic words".<br><br>See? She treats her like this but ME?! It is so totally ON and OFF and ON and OFF.<br>What IS she trying to TELL ME about?!</div>
