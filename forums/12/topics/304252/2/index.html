It the same thing, blame yourself, blame others. Blame here.. blame there.. blame everywhere, anyone and everyone but in the end, cannot change a thing.<br><br>People are not perfect person and they always make mistakes. Be gentle to yourself too. Learn from your mistakes and you will grow wiser. After learning the mistakes, you must also learn to let go of the unnecessary sh!it that associated with it. There the key of learning too. Sometime, some people just love to carry there excessive baggage around. Worst, they love to climb uphill with there overload "bigger than life" backbag. If you want to go uphill or anywhere else, it is best to learn to throw away the unnecessary invisible baggage.<br><br>It is not healthy to hate someone. Hating someone is like hurting yourself and on the contary, it does not hurt others as much as it does to you. People often mistake anger and hatred as a form of self-defensive mechanism but it never was. Let go and stop resisting.. so that better things in life can flow into your life smoothly.</div></blockquote>Blaming is a act of self protect and ignorance.<br>But it sort of "protect the user from harm" &gt; self blame etc</div>

How much are they worth?<br>Isn't it a weakness for your benevolence.<br>The world will not stop building weapons for peace.<br>But they will still build to protect themself.<br>Peace is just an idealogist. Will you throw away your weapon in the face of your enermy in war time?<br><br>Who will stop by and stay by your side when you are wounded by your benevolence?<br>None, because the world will not stop. Everyone has a life of their own.<br>They can listen but they cant do much.<br>Some may even laugh at our stupidity.<br>Is it our failure to react to situations? or our pride on doing it the "right" way that hinder our every move?<br><br>Can we possess something if we cant protect it?<br></div></blockquote>Hey boy have u been bullied or what ?<br>You seems to have hidden anger when you wrote this yeh.<br><br>But hor, please also look at the bright side of life to have a balance and holistic view about life. Everyone has a life yeh and they are people who make a differences and changed their own life for better. Don't generalise.<br><br>Regarding whether life is fair or not, different people have their own perspective about it. I think it is 50-50. Sometime life is fair to me and sometime life is not fair. There life for me. So how .. u think it isn't fair but i think it is fairly fair.. so what does that make life of?<br><br>Yeh don't get too caught up with your life experience or ur view about things should be really are. There is no such things as should be.<br><br>I think the word the :right: way is rather subjective but whatever you do.. there will always be consequence and sometime there consequence can't be contained and will leads to sequence of events.. whether be it bad or good.<br><br>I don't understand what u mean by failure to react. You can react the situation with wisdom or you can react with hatred and get the same response from others which lead to unnecessary conflicts. If the conflict is necessary to address a point, for me i think it is okay but it shouldn't be overdone.. overcooked.<br><br></div>

              <p>Hate is when you know for a fact the world will be a better
              place without that person in it and the only thing keeping you from
              making the world a better place are the consequences to
              yourself.<br> <br> Signs of hate include freely talking bad about them and not being
              concerned with slander or libel, making sure they have no friends.
              When you make them cry you're happy because you helped punish them.
              When they are in trouble you want to find out more so you can make
              it worse. When they die you offer thanks to God for being just.<br> <br> That's hate.</p>

              <p><br>Yes, if you flatter people they either will start being nicer to you in response to your flatter or behave worse towards you.</p>
              <p>If they start being nicer to you then what you saw as their dislike towards you was because they were reacting to your poor social skills.</p>
              <p>If they behave worse then it's not you that is the problem, it's something you represent in their minds that is the problem. That's more complex situation and requires a more complex solution.</p>
              <p>But polish their apples first and you'd know at least if it was the first or the second situation.</p>

              <p>If you hate a person and it does not harm you then why not...let nature take its course. becuase every1 is different.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>human emotions are such diversity and endless color....the beaty of it all. If there is no hatred in this world then there consequently will never be love and vice versa. No love no hate where got fun.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for every hate, there will be love. therefore your hatred meant another person will obtain love at the same time....</p>

              <p>i more selfish than liking to hate hence choose to love instead...hehe</p>
