              <p>As saying goes, once your parents forever your parents, once your mother, forever yr mother, once your papa forever your papa.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like it or not, divorcing is not their faults, but once they loved you, they still will do, there nothing to address them as per papa and mama as a form of respect of the highest honour.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you current bf dun understand, it show he do not have a open heart to except your once divorced issue. If he truly love you, he will take it as respect you. Jealously is a man weakness</p>

              <p>i think there's nothing wrong with it. be at peace with yourself. in fact, i think it's awfully sweet, because it shows us the person you are. a very respectful person, and you won't burn bridges just because you're not related anymore.</p>

              <p>I've divorced for a few years. Whenever I see my ex-hubby's parents, I still call them Pa &amp; Ma. My friends were surprised when they knew about it. But I think its nothing wrong since we've gone through the chinese customary last time, though we are divorced now. I have a boyfriend currently and he wasn't very happy about it too. He thinks that I should address them as auntie and uncle now, as to make it clear that I'm not their daughter-in-law anymore. Should it be in this way? Any advice?</p>

              <p><br>My ex-wife remarry and still calling my parents pa n ma, also celebrate birthday for them. I still call my ex-wife's parent ma n pa. My present wife's parents, i don't even want to address them anything bcos i don't like them, what i know is i like n marry only their daughter that's all. For so many years, we are so used to it to address these ways. Physically we are divorced but deep in our heart we still have a feeling for each other, we are still good buddy. Divorce is the same as bgr breaks up, just that one is officially signing of paper and one is not. So sometimes, i would want to marrying a divorcee with only one man who has seen her body before is better than marry a single who has many man n gone through many r/s b4.</p>

              <p><br>so what are you trying to say . .....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>u mean you dun like your present parents in law but you love their daughter .</p>
              <p>u still call the previous parents in law ( thumbs up for the filial piety ) because you respect them  but you divorce their daughter .(in another way let her down )</p>

              <p>You divorce the son but it nothing wrong between you and your parents in law... so continue to call them.. it is out of the respect and they are so old already i suppose.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for your bf... why he so<span style="font-size: small; font-family: MS-PGothic;">çœ‹ä¸�å¼€.... it only an addressed. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small; font-family: MS-PGothic;">He can take the fact that you are a divorcee but he cant it when you are just showing your basic manners of calling some elderly?</span></p>
