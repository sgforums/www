All the points you mention are those classified under good to have - which speaks nothing about the person's character and attitude towards relation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In reality, such people don't really exist and you will be making a grave mis-preception is you think that these factors is going to get your girls. True, people might be interested, crushes, etc - but God is always fair - gives you something, takes away something. (But not necessary bad character.)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: By the way, do you happen to know that Cassnova and those playing the field are versed in Art of seduction, eloquence, air and self confidence they give instead of the points you mention? I know of alot of people with history of ex, they looked just like anyone of your people (perhaps worst), but the feel they exude is very much different. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>My point?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Why not you work on something that is workable than something that is impossible to achieve? If you ain't rich - you can't pray and hope that you would strike a million the next day Or you can't change the way you look. It would serve you better in the long run and I gurantee you that could still get woman.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Cheers</div>
