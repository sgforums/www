            <div class='col-md body'>Answers to:<br><br>Qn 1: Nothing much, it's a decision only she can make.  Her bf can only let her know about his insecurities, &amp; hope that she loves him enough to take care of his feelings.  Being in a relationship doesn't mean we're Not occasionally physically attracted to other people.  What matters is whether we can resist the temptation.  We can never be the most beautiful/handsome/desirable person in the world what.  But I digress...  If after her bf talks to her about his feelings &amp; she still doesn't do a thing about it, perhaps the bf oughta consider whether it's worth the pain of staying with her.<br><br>Qn 2: Learn how to FLIRT.  Use the correct body language, &amp; girls will fall at your feet.  But bear in mind that this does Not bring lasting fulfilment, nor does it bring happiness.  And also, people who do Not condone this kinda behaviour will really despise you (with good reason!).  In addition, you'll hafta take care of your grooming, blah blah blah.  I don't wish to go into this, because I personally do Not like guys who wanna cast their nets so widely.<br><br>Qn 3: I used to think I wouldn't want a guy who's too good-looking because I'd always feel weird when other girls stare HUNGRILY at my partner.  But suay suay I fell in love with a stunner.  Dunno how come he fell in love with me also, but love works in mysterious ways.  He hasn't cheated on me.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Xlashes:</div><div class="quote_body">This girl in her early 20s has a very good bf which she is very happy to be with.
