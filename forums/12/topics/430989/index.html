              <p>Hi all...</p>
              <p><br>Been quite abit since I've last posted here. Almost a good 2yrs+. Finally completed my NS last year and am working full time. Sighz, I just started my part-time degree course with Kaplan. Today's the first lecture and I'm already feeling so very lost. I feel like my head's going to explode and the lecture is like being "force fed". Is this normal? I feel like I've become v.lost after NS. And though I'm able to get along with my day to day work fine, I feel v.displace dispite this being only the first lecture. Sighz.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ps. advise...</p>

              <p>The first lecture is always like that. You pay 100% attention trying to absorb everything that is said. You end up mentally exhausted.</p>
              <p>You have embarked on tertiary education. No more like school days. Teacher guide you all the way.</p>
              <p>Now you are on your own. Even with the lecturers, class mates and study groups you are really on your own. They are there for you to use. Virtue vice, if you help your class mates, you help yourself also</p>
              <p>So from now onwards, prepare ahead  Read up on whats going to be taught before going to the lecture, so that you only spend part the time listening, most of the time making sense of what you have read, and asking question on what you don't understand.</p>
              <p>Remember you are on your own.</p>

              <p>Thanks...the thought of using the 20k to start my own biz with some friends did cross my mind at some time...but now that I've started on this path, its best I stay on this and rough it out. But really, I feel that I lack the confidence and determination in this.Constantly feeling tired after work. Not motivated to do my assignments.</p>

              <p><br>1) Are you sure you are stressed studying at Kaplan? I thought they are very lax especially on student assignments? Studying at Kaplan also means you'll take a much shorter time to graduate, so why are you complaining?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2)  For what are you studying university when you are already earning 2.8k per month minus CPF? That makes your Basic Salary 3.5k !! Many private uni grads dont even have a starting pay of 2.5k to begin with loh.</p>

              <p><br> 1) Are you sure you are stressed studying at Kaplan? I thought they
              are very lax especially on student assignments? Studying at Kaplan
              also means you'll take a much shorter time to graduate, so why are
              you complaining?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2)  For what are you studying university when you are
              already earning 2.8k per month minus CPF? That makes your Basic
              Salary 3.5k !! Many private uni grads dont even have a
              starting pay of 2.5k to begin with loh.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your words of encouragement man. Will psyche myself up to the mindset that there's only forward gear and no reverse gear. KPKB...but still do. And yes, blood is forever thicker than water. Temptations of society are great, but I will always keep family and those close at heart a share of it. And as for women...lets just say, I'm no longer a believer of "forever and always".</p>

              <p>Guys' lives are pretty much fucked up by the govt's regime.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>$100 extra for every 5 year growth package is never going to
              compensate for our 2.5 years youth lost. Not to mention the 13 x 2
              weeks reservice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In all actuality, its not just our youth's thats lost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Other than that, we lost our innocence, plenty of opportunities,
              our pride, our dignity, our free will. I honestly felt a part of me
              was lost because of NS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I lost a girl I love also because of NS.</p>

              <p>Well...kpkb about NS, also time served already. And the growth package and all...can never return our youth. But I really hope that they can relook and allow guys to finish Uni.even if its private uni. before serving. This allows continuity. And as for the lost of girl...so be it. I was with the ex gf for 5yrs, she fell for her colleague in his 30s. Am happy that things happened now rather than later, though tragically, a part of me has been altered and I now no longer believe in r-ships. I rather believe that even in a r-ship, both parties have their own agendas to fulfill, its no longer the sweet innocent love of yesteryears.</p>

              <p><br>What is your profession? 2.7k is also a very good paycheck for a non-grad le. You honestly dont need that degree loh. You are merely wasting $. Might as well concentrate on your current career.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5 years with ex gf? Wah lao, hey, such a long courtship you guys should have gotten married le loh. I think the longest i can tahan is 2 years then i will propose le. I can understand why the gal left you. I guess you guys didnt work out is because you really dragged it too long le lah. The gal needs some form of assurance bah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good to hear that you are making full use of your time and take advantage of every opportunity that comes your way. Most pple including myself only hold one regular job and do not think of doing anything extra besides that to boost our income. I think pple have a lot to learn from you.</p>
