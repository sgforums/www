Why should she be so bother with what's already in the past? Shouldn't she be treasuring the moments and relationship with 'B' now?<br><br>2. If she's harbouring 'shadows' over how her bf can be interested in another girl while he was trying to get her back, and she's still holding that as a distrust against him now... I think she can open up and talk to her guy about it... But NOTE and UNDERSTAND what is the PURPOSE of that TALK... If it's for quarrels or break up, then I say DON'T BOTHER... Just BREAK UP for short. Otherwise I would suggest she try to understand her bf's stand THEN and NOW. And decides for herself if she wants to forgive him and let things OVER.. If this stone is not overturned and LET GO, the relationship would not be allowed to sail on for much further...</div>
