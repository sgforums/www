Just that maybe cos the intake is of large numbers, it makes it much easier to admit and thus the perception of dumping ground.<br><br>If you are totally not interested in engineering, then I would advise against studying that as it would be a torture for you and for your career as well.<br><br>Choose something you have interest in, even if it might not be your desired varsity.<br><br>All the best!</div>

I am both an engineering graduate from NUS and also an accounting graduate. You can refer to my post about NTU engineering being a dumping ground and also the difference in accounting/business/finance vs engineering<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=278939&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=278939&amp;page=1</a><br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=288403&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=288403&amp;page=1</a><br><br>WIth regard to TS on this post, I guess your 'A' Level grades should be around BCC, or BCD if I am not wrong (guess).<br><br>I cannot guarantee that for the next 10-12 years that what you choose now will determine whether you regret/not regret taking that decision. The most important is to choose what you like to do and subsequently if you want to do a switch (but not too late) you can do it.<br><br>If you want to do engineering or feels like thats what you want, by all means pursue your interest cos I feel accountancy/business/finance can be picked up later. I did a switch from engineering to accountancy but never heard of anyone doing vice versa.<br><br>If you want to do business course by all means. Do not be put down by the starting salaries. Most accounting grads from big 4s earned little in the first place but their progression and salaries rise is much faster.<br><br>What I mention has both its advantageous.<br><br>However, besides the point mentioned above, I would like to highlight a situation below.<br>I knew someone who is presently working in one of the big 4s and that time like you, he can opt to go to NTU engineering but chose to do accountancy in a private university. His friend that time advised him against taking engineering in NTU and right now, I feel that his friend made an important decision for him cos the exposure that he has while in big 4 is much bigger and better.<br><br>All the best in your studies and career.</div>
