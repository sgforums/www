            <div class='col-md body'>My advice is to shop around and try to get opinions from pple who has taken the courses rather than depend on the selling of the school. Make sure that the degree is relevant and more importantly, recognised in Singapore in the area that you are studying.<br>Anyone here that has taken such courses can maybe provide better advice?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes make sure that the degree is recognised in singapore. However that is often not the case. I dun noe but i am just afraid that a degree may only be recognised as a diploma in singapore. So it's rather risky to do a foreign degree in sg without flying over to the actual country</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thankz for replyin...i've chk out quite a few sch dat offer me the coz dat i wan.and i have my mind on one particular sch. i've asked abt the credibilty of the degree and the reply they gave me is dat all schools offerin foreign degree must first be approved by MOE. and some advices that frens have given me is dat whether a degree is recognised depends solely on the individual company itself. ie. some companies may take in graduates wif degrees not recognised by MOE.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dont think you should worry that much. Though i may not know much but i have seen enough of these questions and also answers from professionals that singapore does not have a rule that only recognise certain university. The most important thing is to find yourself a reputable university where there might be other singaporeans or asians studying there. The answers given by the professionals are that it's up to the employers to recognise/appreciate your degree or not so make sure you have a degree from a university which they(the employer) might have some idea of. That's my opinion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Wynter<br>^^^^^<br>*nOnE sO bLiNd Or DeAf As ThOsE wHo WiLL nOt SeE Or HeAr...*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm sure most companies would accept degrees from any reputable universities. Those universities would be those that often visit singapore, whether at world trade centre or some complex to recruit students. I'm certain that if there are any such events coming along, they would be happy to answer your questions. And i think employers in Singapore don't think THAT much of the degree but of the person, so get a degree from the common universities from the common countries(Australia, UK, US etc.) and let them judge you. I know this is a big decision and a simple answer like mine is not helpful enough so the next alternative is to check the web for the overseas universities or wait for the recruiting events. My sister wanted to study abroad too and visited the exhibition they set up for students and came home with a full bag of brochures and stuffs. That would be the best form of information.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Wynter<br>^^^^^<br>*nOnE sO bLiNd Or DeAf As ThOsE wHo WiLL nOt SeE Or HeAr...*</div>
