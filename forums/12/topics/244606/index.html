            <div class='col-md body'>Hi forummers,<br>Just hope to seek some comments from those who had similar experience as me. Tomorrow, I will be embarking on my second job of my life. Although I should be feeling excited, alas, it is not how I feel for the past few days.<br><br>I just feel so uncertain, with a tinge of nervousness..just don't know what to expect tomorrow..of the environment etc. Ironically, this job is something which I have looked forward to and successfully attained it.<br><br>What bothers me now is how come I am feeling the above uncertainty, even though I should feel excited? For the past few days, the nervousness and uncertainty just weighs in.<br><br>Anyone has the same experience as me before? And how do you try to overcome it?<br><br>Appreciate constructive advise..thanks..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's rather common to feel that way.  Think it's just the "unknown" that you're feeling nervous about.......<br><br>Just relax and do your best and I am sure after tomorrow you'll feel much better.  It might take you a while to get used to the new environment but just take it one step at a time.  You'll be fine!<br><br>Good luck and congratulations on your new job!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
