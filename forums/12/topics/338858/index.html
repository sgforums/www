              <p>Wtf. This resembles my scenario. I started working during the
              hols since november and developed a crush for this gal who was also
              a student employee. We are both telemarketers but recently she got
              transferred out to do the admin stuff at the computer opposite me
              and I've been seeing her a lot more. Sometimes she would smile at
              me or occasionally stare at me but I just lack the courage to say
              hi or offer her a sweet. 1 month more for me to get her number but
              the prob is she's coming to work with 2 other male classmates and 1
              female friend. Those 2 idiots always stick with her during break
              time and i hardly have a chance to talk to her. _|_ them. and im 16
              shes 17. any chance?</p>

              <p><br>you are only as ugly, stupid and useless as you think. change your thinking, and you change your entire being.</p>
              <p>don't be an online "stalker". just tell her in the face that you like her. fear not of being rejected. rather, regret over your inaction, like me.</p>
              <p>i was like you before. and i really regretted not having expressed my feeling for a female stranger who used to pass me by almost every morning. it was love at first sight.... i had my chances, but i didn't grab anyone of them. and now, i couldn't find her liao, as i've shifted.</p>
              <p>now, i can only hope to see her again. and this time, i will make it right.... if fate allows.</p>

              <p>Well even if you are ugly, stupid or useless why don't you just go up to her and say hi? You don't need to say directly to her "I like you or Whenever I think about you, I get wet at night"... Just ask her whether you can get her msn to know her better or just ask general questions.</p>
              <p>I wouldn't say your in love with this girl, you just got a <strong>crush</strong> on her. If you can somehow get her msn, you can know her better but then don't ask your friends though. Ask it for yourself so that at least to show you ain't a chicken.</p>
              <p>Not all girls go for looks and cash, some girls out there still go for the personality and characterstic. As long as you ain't a jerk, you should be okay =) If your a dickhead, don't even bother saying hi to her.</p>

              <p><br>If you have really fallen in love with her, at least take the efforts to visit every branch available until you find her branch. But that's only if you are shy and not comfortable with going up to her and SMILE and say HI and SELF-INTRODUCE your name to her and ask her for her name to give her the opportunity to know that you actually exists in the same school with her.</p>
              <p>Let us know once you have successfully know her, and I'm sure many people here will be happy to help you on the next step. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
