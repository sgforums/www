              <p>Dude, now you need to get her attention.</p>
              <p>Don't approach her directly, don't use the pussy method of online chat. Get close to her friend. One day, walk up to her friends while she's around then talk to her friend only. Since you are in sec sch only I presume, it should be a walk in a park as they are not "smart" yet.</p>
              <p>Say something like "Hey, you're blahblah from whatever cca/class/course" then start a conversation, but don't ever look at the one you like, when you leave say goodbye and have a quick glance at her and give a weak smile.</p>

              <p>Experience would say otherwise, but usually girls like a guy who has the balls to approach her but choose the right situation, if you ask in front of her friends, you have a greater chance if she's a egolistic/vain girl.</p>

              <p><br>When I was in secondary 3, I fell in love with this girl. I thought she was the most beautiful women in this entire world, the most perfect a person can get. She was an angel to me.</p>
              <p>The problem is, this girl don't even know who I was. For two years, I cast myself into my own world of agony because I depised myself back then. I thought I was ugly, a pimply-faced skinny teenager not worthy to be with her. She was too perfect for me.</p>
              <p>So I did not get to know her until the O'level was finished and she had a MSN account. I talked to her once or twice. She even came up to me to talk to me when we went back to get our O'level results.</p>
              <p>But I still didn't dare to take this further. Everything stopped there. She went to her poly and got a boyfriend afterwards, I went to my JC.</p>
              <p>Who will actually believe that 5 years later, now that I've already served my NS for one year, I actually still think of her from time to time, wondering if my life would had been totally different if I had the courage to approach her back then. After this girl, I have not really fallen in love with another girl.</p>
              <p>And seriously, I realised too late that it was NOT just mere puppy love!</p>
              <p>A cowardice during my secondary school days turned into perhaps a lifetime of regrets. I don't know why so many guys are like me...cowards.</p>
              <p>Chose yourself. Do something or regret it.</p>

              <p><br>well... if u wanna know where she work, STALK HER! (jkjk)... if ur friends are friends of hers. Force them, Torment them or just ask them to do a "face to face introduction"!</p>
              <p>" i am ugly,stupid and useless who will ever notice me" you say..? i feel the same... my looks are so-so... girls wont notice my good points!(lol) and actually.. im a super shy guy-_-. er.. if u have no guts! i suggest u search for her friendster and ADD her. Then slowly but surely(not sex....) comment her, chat with her online and finally!~ wave to her or say "hi~ oh so ur class is at the blahth floor? wow my class is below urs, then!" and again, slowly but not surely(not stalking her), both of u will be good/normal friends :D~.. but if she has no friendster, then facebook(to me, facebook sux), add her in msn and do an intro. hope this helps, if it doesnt. then u can really tell the world that you really are, useless....(not scolding lol)</p>
              <p>trust me, it will be fine! but u can tell her this "actually.. im in love with u, if u dun have feelings for me then i hope u can forget wat i said just now and continue to be great friends!" although this method would be considered as Dangerous! take care, LOL</p>
