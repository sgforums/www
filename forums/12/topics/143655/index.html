            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Folkz,<br><br>I seldom ask for help on AA, preferring to help others.  Now, I need a little favour from the kind souls around here : )  It's kinda sad, actually...<br><br>My guy's dad is dying from an aggressive form of cancer, &amp; his grandma called yesterday to ask him to fly over soon, to see him 1 last time.  He's preparing to go, trying to book a ticket at such short notice isn't easy.  Anyway, I'm preparing for the week whereby I won't see him for dinner...  I'm Not the clingy sort when he's around, I know that he'll be just a phone call away, but this time, he'll be away for about a week...<br><br>I know he's only gonna come back grieving, &amp; it really breaks my heart Not knowing what I can do to comfort him apart from hugs, kisses, you know...  So, I would like to make his return extra special by filling his place with little things, stuff that he likes, for everyday of the week that I'll miss him.<br><br>So when we get back from the airport, I'll tell him, "Look in the fridge..." then "Look on the bed..." then "Look in the cupboard..." that kinda thing, &amp; each time he looks, he'll find a little something...<br><br>At the end of it all, I'm gonna tell him how much I've missed him (I just KNOW I'm gonna go crazy all week)...<br><br>So now, the help needed.  I've come up with a little list of somethings that he likes, but it's Not enough for 7 days (my poor head feels like something's pounding on it, with all that thinking, I'm Not exactly smart)...  Here's what I've thought of so far:<br><br>1. A whole pile of Mentos in every flavour.  Don't ask <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  He's nuts about them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>2. A box of his rum balls from his favourite shop.<br>3. A box of Kinder Bueno.<br>4. A Dri-fit shirt (for the damn heat now)<br>5. An issue of his favourite magazine<br><br>2 more?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">   The above is what he likes &amp; needs, but I can't find anything more leh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">   Can someone, anyone, just give me some ideas?  It'd be much appreciated  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>FeowFeow</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Heavenlyfire,<br><br>It's Not good, in fact, the prognosis is downright horrible <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  In short, the doctor has handed his dad the death sentence.  The family has taken the dad home from the hospital for his final days.  Initially, I thought of going with him, but since I'd just started on my new job, he asked me Not to.  After thinking about it, it was probably for the best that I didn't accompany him.  His family will be grieving, &amp; he'll need all his energies (emotional, mental &amp; physcial) to comfort them, I'll probably only be in the way.......<br><br>I know that what I do won't be able to erase the grief, but knowing him, doing little things for him won't make it worse.  Instead, it'll give him a little comfort, which is better than Nothing.  I understand him well, &amp; if doing these things makes it worse for him, you can be sure I won't be in here asking.  AA isn't a place for me to air trivial problems : )  The only time I'll do it is when I seriously want to make things better for my guy in times of real need, like this instance.<br><br>It's ok if you don't know how to advise me, it's a difficult situation I know.  But thanks for replying anyway : )<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by heavenlyfire:</div><div class="quote_body">you sure it will be alright? your guy dad will definitely emotional after the trip... how serious is his cancer? confirm go? then that is even worse..its like aids..<br>you know when you are going to die..how does he feel about the whole thing?<br><br>i don not know how to advise...anything that you guys do will make him more touched and of course more emotional...the photo album..even worse..remind hime of his happy days and now he has to go...how would he feel?<br><br>i would rather not do anything and just be normal, just fetch him from the airport..the most important is his attitude towards his illness..if he treat it postively, there is no need to do such things..if it is negatively, you might want to get books on religion, on their ideas on death and so on...<br><br>even if previously, he treat it as postively, after his trip, he may turn emotional....so ask your guy family to spend more time with him as a family...<br><br>hope that help, cheers!</div></blockquote></div>
