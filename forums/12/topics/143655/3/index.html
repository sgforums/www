Now, I need a little favour from the kind souls around here : )  It's kinda sad, actually...<br><br>My guy's dad is dying from an aggressive form of cancer, &amp; his grandma called yesterday to ask him to fly over soon, to see him 1 last time.  He's preparing to go, trying to book a ticket at such short notice isn't easy.  Anyway, I'm preparing for the week whereby I won't see him for dinner...  I'm Not the clingy sort when he's around, I know that he'll be just a phone call away, but this time, he'll be away for about a week...<br><br>I know he's only gonna come back grieving, &amp; it really breaks my heart Not knowing what I can do to comfort him apart from hugs, kisses, you know...  So, I would like to make his return extra special by filling his place with little things, stuff that he likes, for everyday of the week that I'll miss him.<br><br>So when we get back from the airport, I'll tell him, "Look in the fridge..." then "Look on the bed..." then "Look in the cupboard..." that kinda thing, &amp; each time he looks, he'll find a little something...<br><br>At the end of it all, I'm gonna tell him how much I've missed him (I just KNOW I'm gonna go crazy all week)...<br><br>So now, the help needed.  I've come up with a little list of somethings that he likes, but it's Not enough for 7 days (my poor head feels like something's pounding on it, with all that thinking, I'm Not exactly smart)...  Here's what I've thought of so far:<br><br>1. A whole pile of Mentos in every flavour.  Don't ask <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  He's nuts about them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>2. A box of his rum balls from his favourite shop.<br>3. A box of Kinder Bueno.<br>4. A Dri-fit shirt (for the damn heat now)<br>5. An issue of his favourite magazine<br><br>2 more?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">   The above is what he likes &amp; needs, but I can't find anything more leh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">   Can someone, anyone, just give me some ideas?  It'd be much appreciated  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>FeowFeow </div></blockquote>I'm quite sure you've got plenty of ideas for now...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>To add... Moderate the situation? I'm not sure about your bf, but some guys need a bit of 'cooling period' for such things... He might be what he appears to be on the surface... BUT don't be TOO SENSITIVE about it... Just be sensitive in moderation would do...<br><br>Not forgetting the fact that he should be quite tired from everything after his return..? So a good way to start is perhaps more relaxing..? For example...<br><br>1. Good relaxing bath (psychologically speaking, it's good to avoid aroma candles..)<br>2. A simple but decent meal preferably prepared by you?<br>3. A good massage?<br>4. Some mild catching up sessions?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi DRX,<br><br>Sorry for such a late reply, I'm so touched that people here have been giving me advice, etc.  Every little bit helps, &amp; I'm grateful.  Yes, I'm aware that there'll be times when he needs to be left alone.  I'll definitely do that the moment he displays any body language that indicates so.  But I'll take your advice &amp; be there for him whenever he asks..  In fact, I'll go running!<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by drx:</div><div class="quote_body">I think your bf is mature enough to understand that you love him a lot and is willing to do lots of things for him.<br><br>But sometimes it may be just a listerning ear that he needs. If your bf needs some space along just leave him for a while, i know this maybe hard for you but at times like this even if you give him everything he will not respond to you.<br><br>Just be there when he needs you is more than enough, is not the things that you do that is important but be there when he needs you most, and giving your tender loving care to him, is the most important thing for your bf.<br><br>Let him cry!  Tell him that is alrite to cry it out loud and to let his feelings out.<br>The more he holds back the more pain he will feel.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hiyah MC : )<br><br>Glad to say that he's taking it better than I'd expected, but it's still affected him deeply.  He hasn't sobbed or anything like that, but his eyes do get red at times &amp; he appears downcast.  Actually, most of the time when I'm with him, we just sit there holding each other for a very long time.  I can just imagine how he feels, went through the same thing when my beloved granddad died.<br><br>Honestly, everybody reacts to death in various ways, so his ways are very dissimilar to mine.  Thank goodness we have an understanding enough of each other to know instinctively what each other needs...  For now at least, it seems he just needs to be supported.  And I'm there as much as I can.<br><br>Sometimes I tell him about the forum people &amp; how the kind souls have extended a listening ear &amp; advice.  You won't believe it, but it helps.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MÂ©+square:</div><div class="quote_body">You two very funny or i should say cute.<br><br>How would you know if he will cry or feel pain?<br>You think every person will cry when their father passed on? He might need Feow's support to take him thru this time of grieve. She could be a pillar that cheer him on.<br><br>I'm quite confident Feow's bf is prepared for the worst. And she knows best what is the situation now.<br><br>I found out that dealing with preparation of the death of your loved one is much easier than dealing a sudden lost.<br><br>Think about it?<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey,<br><br>As long as there's a genuine kindness shown to my bf &amp; me here, I'm very grateful.  So please don't get upset nor argue on my account.  Even if the ideas are Not taken up, it's received with much gratitude : )<br><br>By the way, I DO intend to take him to dinner at Changi Meridien when he's back : )  I'm so Not looking forward to him going, as I know he'll feel depressed by the time he returns.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Ilpsy,<br><br>Your opinion is noted, thank you : )  Don't worry, I know him well enough.  Just his body language will be able to tell me what I should do during that time.  I'll just have those things prepared &amp; play it by ear.  But as far as possible, after that day, I hope to resume a "normal" routine &amp; take it from there...<br><br>It's never easy dealing with such a difficult, Not to mention painful, situation...<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ILPSY:</div><div class="quote_body">Erm... Before you really do all this, can you first cool down a bit?<br><br>I have been thru wat your bf is going through. And seriously, the last thing I needed at that time, is to have ppl fuss over me. I tried to keep it cool as I needed a period to settle my emotions first. Anything too drastic will have the wrong effects.<br><br>I do know you mean well to let him know how much you care about him and that he will feel loved. But, if he is like me, I would like to keep everything as per normal.<br><br>However, fetching him from the airport will be nice. Dun tell him how sorry you are abt his father's death. He may feel frustrated. A hug whenever you see him pondering at a corner will do.</div></blockquote></div>

Moderate the situation? I'm not sure about your bf, but some guys need a bit of 'cooling period' for such things... He might be what he appears to be on the surface...
