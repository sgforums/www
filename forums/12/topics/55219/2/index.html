Try to tell him how hurt you are by his action. Also try to listen to his side of story and try to tolerate if he get rage up. TRY to bear with it. Trust me, when a guy gets very vexed, he can do all sorts of funny stuff. If he really loves you, he will make a effort to think through what you have said. DO NOT ask him to do what you EXPECT of him. Let him decide the best course of action what he must do if he cherish this relationship.<br><br>Personally, I feel that a real gentleman should not resort force on female..... no matter how bad the situation is. I never ever hit a female before (except my sister, HEY that's call discipline) and it is VERY VERY wrong to do that.<br><br>If your bf doesn't repent, maybe both of you should cool off for a while, STAY apart from each other so that nothing terrible will happen because one or both parties does irrational stuff due to this unhappiness.<br><br>I know you love him very much, but does he love you as much as you do? I always believe that when both people fall in love with each other, they love their partner more than theirselves. You have done it, but have he done it? If not, just break off. It's useless having such relationship. You are only going to be a victim, not him.<br><br>If you are very unhappy about the whole thing, you can always PM me to tell me all about it. I am all welcome for such stuff. Just don't follow my path that's all.</div>

No....there's no third party in between us.... the thing that cause breaking up issue is a game.....just a online game.... he tell me that i control too much of him..... but what for.... i don't want him to keep playing this game... cos the game really know how to let ppl spend marnee in it... and other side he complain that he dun have enough marnee every month... as he's still in ns.... he keep saying i'm childish....... i remember the first time..... when i say he's childish...guess what he reply.... " then you go look for someone that's not childish to be together with lor "</div></blockquote>Dear Hiroyuki Takei,<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 1990 - If I am correct, you are only 13 years old and you mentioned that your bf is in NS. (At least 5 years older)<br><br>Seriously speaking, you do expect a marriage to happen even what he claims as 4 to 5 years later? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You are so young and so naive; matters of the heart shouldn't be a problem in your life now because of your inability to make good emotional decision and see/understand what man really is. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>He mentioned that he wants to break off with you because of an online game - this again throws in very strong hint that he isn't anywhere mature enough for a relationship, let alone something as sacred as a marriage.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You truely believe what he claims about marriage? Lady, don't read too much into his words. Just listen listen, then happy happy. <strong>DO NOT expect anything.</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You mentioned that you quitted smoking, drinking, remove piercing, etc - seriously speaking, even if you don't do it now - you would probably have to quit later. Such habits are NOT MEANT to be there - there is nothing too great of a sacrifice. In fact, its for your own good.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Why do you want to go back to the relationship? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Just solo because you loved him?<br><br>What future do you think you can see when you and him patch? And what makes you think that with your Love alone is sufficient to upkeep the relationship with immaturity and 'puppy-love element' present? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You would probably learn alot from this.<br><br>P.S: He initiated a break off because of a small lame reason. Imagine if there was a bigger problem - wouldn't he be the first to run off, again? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry Im this late. Anyway, what I'm going to say next is definitely not going to be pleasing to the ear. As always, I believe the best medicines always taste bitter. So here goes...<br><br>I'm not going to tell you about what guys generally will do, coz I'm not one. I can only tell you about how I view this whole thing (from your post.. so it's going to be quite superficial)<br><br>Take it with a pinch of salt and no offence intended whatsoever.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Firstly, I concluded that you're being contradictory. Reason for that could be, you're unwilling to let go, yet dont wish to be subjected to further humilation.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Next you mentioned in one of your post, 10 mins after breaking off, which is what landed yourself with all the negative points of your 'ex' (I'm calling him your ex bf coz from his viewpoint both of you are no longer together) But surely if you've indeed loved him as what you claimed, you'll be full of praises for him, telling us all how fabulous he is so that we can encourage you to go for it, isn't it not? When you posted all his acts (negatively), little wonders why people ask you to move on with life... it's as simple as that.<br><br>How long have you guys been together? Your heart is aching becoz you know soon you'll be faced with loneliness, having to lead a single life again and having to bid your time to find your Mr Right or you're aching becoz you don't want to let go? But then again, if you can't let go, why hate him? Shouldn't you try to convince him to go back to you?<br><br>It's your call girl.. we can only offer advice and it's only this much we can go.. You have to decide what you indeed and truly want for yourself. Like you mentioned you're still young, why the hurry?<br><br>Bid your time...<br><br>Cheerz<br><br></div>
