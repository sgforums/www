Even if you found one, she may not be your number one choice and normally you will not even consider her.<br><br>You also have to take note of those who are with you just because you can provide them with the security and comfort in material sense. These people (regardless of guys or gals) only see the the material benefit (its a realistic world, everybody is trying to "survive" out there) and once you lose that, they will leave you even if you say you are devoted and committed to her alone.<br><br>What I think is that: You should focus more about yourself than getting a GF. Do you want to have a partner before you embark on your career? Or do you want to establish yourself first? What you yourself wants is more important than what they want in you.<br><br>I believe that when you have decided what you want, things will naturally go your way, regardless of you having a career or not.<br><br>One question though: Do you look for a GF purely for the sake of having one? Or are you looking for a partner or soulmate?</div>
