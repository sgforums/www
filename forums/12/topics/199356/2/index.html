            <div class='col-md body'>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Originally posted by parn:<br><br>It actually depends on the age group of the girls you're talking about. Cos when they're young, they just want a cool bf to show off to their peers. As they go to poly/univ, they want a cool bf with a car to drive them around and also to show off to their peers. As they start to work, they want to have a cool bf with car who has good career prospect and some money for them to rely on..and also to show off to their peers. After they've worked for a while, they want a successful bf with car and house and alot of money for them to lay their eggs for...and also to show off to their peers.<br><br>There's no loyalty in love anymore in this world that has evolved dramatically over the time.<br><br>It's similar for guys too...so don't think guys can escape. When they're young, they wanna look for a girl to go to school and go home together. When they go to poly/univ, they wanna get a pretty gf for dating after school and sex. When they go to army, they wanna get a pretty gf for just plain sex...cos they will be too tired to enjoy anything else except having bookout sex with their gf. When they go univ, most of them will have already been dumped by their gf. They go to univ and bragged about their own army stories and their dreams to pian xiao mei mei......for "love" and sex. When they graduated and began to work, they will want a more mature gf to understand their needs (more sex) and stress (better sex) and their dreams (dreams as a univ grad to be successful). If xiao mei mei still haven't mature yet, then it's bye bye. When they become more successful (at least to themselves and their peers), they will want a younger but still mature gf to love them, take care of their needs, stress and dreams...and probably will want to marry them for more years of sex and show off to their peers. At this time, the guys will probably think that they're some sex-expert and will want to prove themselves capable to the girl and their peers.<br><br>Is this the world in Singapore that we're living in? Hope you realised why there are so many agonies in your world, Singapore. It's just that different guys/girls will have different agonies in different stage of their lives. Can you see the vicious pattern?<br><br>I won't be surprised if I've to be single for the rest of my life.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>tts a good one.. hahaha<br><br>Getting a gf is a form of motivation to concentrate on your career but then again if you have the time and money..</div>
