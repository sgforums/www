Cannot publish real names here)<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Geraldine</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color: green;">Francis</span></strong> were in love with each other.  <strong><span style="color: blue;">Geraldine</span></strong> (my friend) loved <strong><span style="color: green;">Francis</span></strong> wholeheartedly and was willing to love <strong><span style="color: green;">Francis</span></strong> for the rest of her love.  She had many suitors and dates before.  But when she was in a relationship with <strong><span style="color: green;">Francis</span></strong>, she stopped going out with other guys and turned down all the courtships to stay faithful to <strong><span style="color: green;">Francis</span></strong>.<br><br>As time went by, <strong><span style="color: green;">Francis</span></strong> (an ambitious guy, a workoholic) worked and worked and worked.  He neglected <strong><span style="color: blue;">Geraldine</span></strong>.  They hardly talked to each other as much.  <span style="color: blue;"><strong>Geraldine</strong></span> began to doubt <strong><span style="color: green;">Francis</span></strong>' feeling for her.  She tried to talk about it.  But <span style="color: green;"><strong>Francis</strong></span> wasn't too keen to talk (probably his mind was too occupied by his work and money making).  <strong><span style="color: blue;">Geraldine</span></strong> was heartbroken cuz she suspected <strong><span style="color: green;">Francis</span></strong> was seeing someone else.<br><br>One day <span style="color: blue;"><strong>Geraldine</strong></span> met <strong><span style="color: red;">Simon </span></strong>and both got along very well.  Soon they fell in love with each other.  <strong><span style="color: green;">Francis </span></strong>got to know about it.  He realised that he could not lose <strong><span style="color: blue;">Geraldine</span></strong>.  He realised his mistake for neglecting her.  He apologised and wanted to win her back.  He explained to her that those time he was neglecting her because he was facing some difficulties at work and in finance.  He didn't want to tell her his problems (or maybe he didn't know how to tell her).<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Simon </span></strong>is a great guy... loving and caring.  But <strong><span style="color: green;">Francis </span></strong>has been with <strong><span style="color: blue;">Geraldine</span> </strong>longer.<br><br>For some time, <strong><span style="color: blue;">Geraldine </span></strong>didn't know what she should do so as not to hurt both guys that she love.

Tough hor?<br>I also dunno what to advise her.  sigh[/b]</blockquote>This is such a common classic case I will always hear from time to time. But regardless, here it goes.<br><br>First of all: Geraldine MUSTN'T accept Simon's proposal at all - or at least the time being (But that doesn't mean she has to accept Francis's one) - probably if she did in haste - she will never know if she accepted it on the basis of substitute of company (until maybe later, such thoughts and feeling will be clearer)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Secondly: She shouldn't accept Francis's proposal, yet - because Francis proposal because he is AFRAID of losing her - not because he feels that the time is right, love is strong, financially stable, etc and wanted to be with her till death do them part. This is unstable grounds - avoid if possible.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Then what should she do?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>She needs time for reflect and ponder over what they really meant in her heart WITHOUT the interferance of their actions, words, etc. Which means these guys must respect her decision to remain alone for a period of time to think. Basically: this also allows the guys to think and cool down, at least they would be more rational in a way. She should go out with close girl friend, to shopping, etc and could probably seek their views too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>After the period of rest - suggested time minimum 2 weeks - She should speak to the both of them, individually on one Vs one basis. About what she should speak leh... post a new topic or pte msg me.
