            <div class='col-md body'>Not going to give long answer.  She has every right to choose either one and in a case like this, one party has to suffer.<br><br>Not the guys but her.  Since MOST guys are only interested in a cute face and a nice bod.  In the end, she will always be wondering "Could have been Simon.... then I'll be happy." or "Should have married Francis... then I'll be happy."<br><br><strong>If she CAN'T DECIDE on this for herself then she should stay single. </strong> Stop letting people force her into making a choice that she doesn't want.  Ever encountered Insurance Agents, they always give you an option of "Can we meet Thurs, or Fri?"  There's a third option and that's none of the above.  So will it be Francis, or Simon, or NONE of the above!!!!<br><br>For goodness sake!!!  The only decent thing is to "Set one guy free!" and things will be less complicated from there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Otherwise, I think she should "Long Bia Si".<br><br>ps. how's that problem with the HAM-SUP boss.  Check out the article on Bullies last saturday in the Recruitment Section.  Quite good.  Cheers!!!</div>

It does happen when the gf gets neglected, esp. if the gal loves the guy alot and all of a sudden, he "dun seem to be there" anymore. Not when she's down, happy, crying....along come this great guy who loves to do things for her....ur fren prob. feels justified she fell in love with someone else cos her bf did not care for her. The thing is, yes, maybe she's wrg, he loves her alot but is not the kind to express his problems to her....at the end, ask herself, who can she choose to live without? though she may be sad leaving one guy, the love for the other may be stronger still.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>your friend must be really stressed up being in this position..<br><br>in anyway, it's not time to point the finger in who is to blame..<br><br>in a relationship, from time to time, we will neglect our loved ones..  it is not desirable, but it happens..<br><br>i think your friend has to find this answer by herself..  that is, her feelings for simon..  is it really a liking for him?  or was it because in the time where she felt neglected..  someone comes along and gave her the attention she needed, and hence she feels obligated to return this friendship in kind?<br><br>in any case, their relationship did not sour because francis was seeing another girl..  it's just a matter of building trust and having transparency in the relationship.. that i believe is not a big problem, and it can be solved..<br><br>so my thought is not to give up a relationship so easily.. it takes time to understand and trust someone..  a relationship will only grow stronger if 2 of them oversome problems together..</div>

Cannot publish real names here)<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Geraldine</span></strong> and <strong><span style="color: green;">Francis</span></strong> were in love with each other.  <strong><span style="color: blue;">Geraldine</span></strong> (my friend) loved <strong><span style="color: green;">Francis</span></strong> wholeheartedly and was willing to love <strong><span style="color: green;">Francis</span></strong> for the rest of her love.  She had many suitors and dates before.  But when she was in a relationship with <strong><span style="color: green;">Francis</span></strong>, she stopped going out with other guys and turned down all the courtships to stay faithful to <strong><span style="color: green;">Francis</span></strong>.<br><br>As time went by, <strong><span style="color: green;">Francis</span></strong> (an ambitious guy, a workoholic) worked and worked and worked.  He neglected <strong><span style="color: blue;">Geraldine</span></strong>.  They hardly talked to each other as much.  <span style="color: blue;"><strong>Geraldine</strong></span> began to doubt <strong><span style="color: green;">Francis</span></strong>' feeling for her.  She tried to talk about it.  But <span style="color: green;"><strong>Francis</strong></span> wasn't too keen to talk (probably his mind was too occupied by his work and money making).  <strong><span style="color: blue;">Geraldine</span></strong> was heartbroken cuz she suspected <strong><span style="color: green;">Francis</span></strong> was seeing someone else.<br><br>One day <span style="color: blue;"><strong>Geraldine</strong></span> met <strong><span style="color: red;">Simon </span></strong>and both got along very well.  Soon they fell in love with each other.  <strong><span style="color: green;">Francis </span></strong>got to know about it.  He realised that he could not lose <strong><span style="color: blue;">Geraldine</span></strong>.  He realised his mistake for neglecting her.  He apologised and wanted to win her back.  He explained to her that those time he was neglecting her because he was facing some difficulties at work and in finance.  He didn't want to tell her his problems (or maybe he didn't know how to tell her).<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Simon </span></strong>is a great guy... loving and caring.  But <strong><span style="color: green;">Francis </span></strong>has been with <strong><span style="color: blue;">Geraldine</span> </strong>longer.<br><br>For some time, <strong><span style="color: blue;">Geraldine </span></strong>didn't know what she should do so as not to hurt both guys that she love.  She started seeing both guys at the same time.<br><br>And then.... recently, both of them proposed to her!!!!<br><br>How leh?  What should my friend do leh?  Tough hor?<br>I also dunno what to advise her.  sigh[/b]</blockquote>well, think the most important thing now is that who geraldine loves. Doesnt mean that francis is together longer with geraldine and geraldine has to be with him.<br><br>Love is selfish in a way. U cannot haf 2 things at a same time. The fact tt ur fren has 2 boyfrens is a unwise choice as if she doesnt handle it well, all 3 will get hurt. Now i guess the best situation is to really ask herself who she loves and want to be with. Once she has made up her mind, do everything that is possible to forget the other guy. (As far as possible, do not have any contact...)<br><br>If she cant make up her mind, then choose no one. I feel that ur fren should get her mind clear and feelings clear abt what she wants and who can give her. If its a 50-50 thing, i would advise her not to choose any of them...... (Its the best of the worst situation...)<br><br>Rem 1 thing: Love is also cruel in a way and by ur fren's situation now, its either 3 get hurt or one get hurt deeply. So make a wise choice.... Juz my opinion, no offence meant.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To my personnal view, i think your gf have 2 major mistake in handling is suitation.<br><br>1.) First relationship not ended and rush into second relationship, causing her to have 2 bf ( x2 headache). <strong>Just [b]suspect</strong> [/b]the 1st bf of unfaithul, than jump to the hands of 2nd bf If one day she suspect the 2nd bf also then what. Jump to 3rd bf. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>2.) Don't want to hurt her 2 bf, what happen if the 2 bf find out. Telling the truth now is better than lying to them. Imagine, the 2 bf have purposed marriage, showing truths and love in her. In the way, your gf betrayed that truth and love. Man, the hurt is X100 times. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>I hope your gf have the rational to think, cause she is heading towards a pit of bottomless headache. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
