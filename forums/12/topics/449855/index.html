You see its like the govt got it all planned out for us, first education then ns, after that maybe get a degree then go work and finally find a soul mate get children and grandchildren then get cpf money and die. </p>
              <p>Like seriously wtf. I really don't wanna live my life like a worker ant but are there any other alternatives out there? Probably i'll migrate or smth once i save up enough money when i grow up. </p>

              <p>The group I was invited in on FB is a young entrepreneur's club where I recently saw this post about a 15 year old girl, being a self made millionaire. I haven't read the details, but let's see how different our lives can be compared to hers.</p>
              <p>She can choose what degree she wants, and not what she needs. She can choose if she want to work for others or she want to continue making millions off her own businesses. She can choose if she wants to have fun for a couple of years here and there. She can choose to travel the world wherever, and whenever she wants.</p>
              <p>Majority of us - we can choose to drink or not. Maybe that's the only thing she can't for a couple of years =)</p>
              <p>Btw, I believe many people been thru this crossroad. It's not the ah-gong who determines you're the top 5% of the population or you're the rest of 95%. I chose my path to be judge by myself for who I am, who I want to be, not by some other people. I choose my life. Seaweed bro, you've got your choices. =)</p>

              <p>As you mention, our life is pretty much study, NS, work, marry and die. But for someone who have no ambitions to be mega rich and am content with following what the norm is, I instead try to enjoy doing more things I like outside of the whole "study-NS-work-etc". I want to travel more, experience more food/culture and then go back to work, rinse repeat.</p>
              <p>That way, life is still fullfilling for me without trying to compete with the clever/rich/handsome/famous.</p>

              <p>Ultimately everybody have to work for somebody. Even if you are biz person you still need to work for your customers. You think Steve Jobs didn't work hard?</p>
              <p>The question is not how hard you work - it is do you enjoy doing what you want to do?</p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong with starting a family become a grandpa and die. A lot of people find their life rewarding when they have children. You sure say cost of living high this and that. But some dads are happy because they get to see their children grow even if it means lots of hardship.</p>
              <p>But you can still enjoy single life if that is your choice. The world is your oyster.</p>
              <p>Unlike the old days you have more choices. Yu don't have to be stuck in singapore. You can always go overseas. Yes there are obstacles and restrictions but today the world is more flexible than yesteryears.</p>
              <p>Sometimes seeking the things you want may not be easy. It may entail hardwork and frustration but that is life. You cannot avoid frustration.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your insights, but I still feel that singaporeans should not be trapped in this mundane cycle that the govt has created tbh , after going thru a decade of horrible singaporean education system, i can safely say that this society has no place for me, nor the family that i'll be having in the future</p>

              every stage of a country's development face special problems of its kind ....
              
              i think 50's, 60's and 70's was an era when the top most priority has been the economy..back then singapore was very very much poorer...and all academic programmes were rigid towards what was needed at the moment....there were practically no jobs, and chinese schools were rife with communists, education was strictly and simply only the conventional subjects to serve an impoverished new country - unlike now, when all kinds of programmes and flexibility of study were opened....
              
              what happens now is the discordance between policies and ground issues...different problems altogether....
