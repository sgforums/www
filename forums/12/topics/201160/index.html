My results have suffered but I still manage to graduate and is now thankfully employed by a local bank. A piece of advice is that do not dedicate your whole holiday to CCA. I know its the busiest period with all the orientation and the CCA needs manpower to organise camps etc.  But if you have to or you want to , you must still try to work part time and get some working experience. You can have a lot of friends but in the end , you will know only a few of them are dependable. Many others are perhaps just a working relationship which I have learned.<br>If you really wana do internship, write in to the company with ya resume. Ya CCA record will help a little but after getting yourself to the interview stage, your future is in your hands.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

But i met with the same situation as you a year earlier. I like to share my experience with you. Perhaps it was because i stayed in hall and life was faster. I took part in facuilty camps, hall camps, made alot of friends, mugged for exams to get the grades my mum wanted but as time passes, i started to feel the same way you did. It's especially when the so-called friendship made in uni become nothing but an act and true friendship losing its existence.<br>I looked back at my uni life and realised i had done nothing productive nor constructive at all. I'm living off my parent's money to just play through Uni. Just when i was feeling as though i was an useless pile of shit, my friend got me to apply for this holiday job during the 1st holiday of my 2nd year. It was just a normal sales job, not directly relevant to my course of studying which is engineering. However, i must say it was the wisest decision i ever meant in my life. It was a totally different life from studying. You get to see the other side of people, of companies. Sorry if i offended anyone with my next sentence but it really went to show that alot of tertiary educated people like you and me are a bunch of pampered and sheltered asses. My working life was just like in the army where i served together with the hokkien "bin". The world was so different. While we were playing, having fun, enjoying life while studying, people out there are slogging their lives out to lead ,ironically, a better life. We are so lucky that we could go Uni and in future get better paid jobs that we don't need to slog as much but we do not cherish.<br>Perhaps you may think i'm getting off topic. Hang on, the story i mention so far actually explains why we had the "emptiness" feeling. We were all too pampered and sheltered. After my holiday ended, i went back to school and started seeing things differently. Suddenly, i'm studying for my own future, working my ass off for my own bread and water and then, the emptiness feelings are gone. From that holiday on, i study and work part time not as much for the money but for reminding myself that i must cherish my studying in Uni.<br>For you, i'll advise you to find a job. It's never too late. I have a friend who also only started working when he is in yr 3. There are many advantages. One thing, at least when we graduate in a few years time, we will have money in our pockets to tide us over when we look for jobs. Second thing, we will not so get a culture shock when we step into the working world.<br>Don't email. The basic courtesy is always to call up or walk in for interview. Success rates are higher. Maybe after you find a job, you will feel the way i did. I wish you success in your job finding.<br><br>Cheers</div>
