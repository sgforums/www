            <div class='col-md body'>Please lah I hate girls who expect guys to do and pay for everything when going out... All they want is a boyfriend they can force to pay for all their trivial expenses like a whole cupboard of shoes and clothes they only wear once, etc... I have this friend who is pretty rich, and he had this girlfriend for 2 years. He spent around $20,000 on his girlfriend during those two years and when his girlfriend went to JC, she broke up with him for another guy and told him that she "doesn't have feelings for him anymore" He was by no means trying to buy her love, but rather he saw money as something he was willing to sacrifice for her, since he had enough of it, but in my opinion I think the girl obviously took advantage of him.<br><br>Moral of the lesson is: Don't invest too much in a boyfriend or girlfriend cos when he/she dumps you its gonna hurt more. And when I say "invest", I don't just mean monetary investment...other stuff like emotional investment, etc, etc.<br><br>blurgirl: If you're really into a true and lasting relationship with your boyfriend, I think who pays for who and what the cashier thinks of him asking you for money is a pretty trivial thing...ditto for him though.<br>Anyway good luck with it.<br><br>I also agree the best way is to go dutch.<br><br>[This message has been edited by chamenos (edited 14 April 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its hard in this situation cos u don't want to appear stingy yet at the same time you don't want to keep on paying all the time. its cool to go dutch but beings girls i'm sure there are times we prefer the guys to foot the bills rite? maybe you want to check if he is working - if he's serving ns..come on give &amp; take. he's paid a measely S$240 for a mth. if he is working &amp; still 'makes' you pay. then the next time round you guys go on a date leave your wallet &amp; bring enuf cash for transport. that way he's force to fork out some cash. if this attempt to make him dram cash willingly fails..have a good talk..failed? get a nicer bfren orait?</div>
