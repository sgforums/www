Best is to go school. Expensive but I think is worth it. School training is more comprehensive and they really care abt proficiency. If u take private,all they care abt is their earning and if u learn slow a bit,they will become impatient and scold u like mad. From what I see. It is not worth taking private if money is not an issue. I switch to school after attending the horrible private car tutor. In school,they only allow u to go on roads once u are attend certain standard.</div>
