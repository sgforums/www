I hope this perception does not change after you obtain your license.<br><br>Anyway don't despair mate, yours is a small problem. All it takes is a little practice and more confidence to be road-worthy. Try to focus when<br>you are driving and try not to be distracted by the instructor barking beside you. Unfortunately our roads are filled with many irresponsible<br>motorists. Please do not be discouraged when these ppl honk at you, tailgate you or whatever unpleasant actions. You need to build your<br>own comfort zone before you can effectively function as a driver. All it takes is some determination and relevant practice.<br>You will make it!!  Good luck<br><br>Driving is very fun, but please do not forget your statement of road safety to others and yourself when you drive eventually.<br><br>Cheers</div>
