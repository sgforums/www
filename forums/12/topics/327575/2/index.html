              <p>Actually, the problem isn't with u liking A, it's with u wanting to be with A.</p>
              <p>And becos A probably doesn't like u, it makes u feel terrible.</p>
              <p>Perhaps then it means u should not try to cross that line, at least not at the moment... The time just isn't right yet.</p>
              <p>(Then again, the time may never be right for the 2 of u... That's just life.)</p>
              <p>Still, I think what matters most is staying true to urself and ur feelings.</p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong with liking someone and not being with him/her.</p>

              yes the time will never be right. it just gets so frustrating when B msges me just to ask me how my day was, when deep inside i hope A was the one doing it.

              <p>Maybe you know it deep inside that A cannot give you what you want? Perhaps A won't respond to you or fall in love with you or give you even a hint of hope? Then move on ba. Usually if guys are interested they'll chase you de. I'm sure your female instincts are already telling you A is a complete waste of time. Trust your gut dear. </p>
              <p>Just hang out with B and get to know others, expand your social circle. You don't have to be in a relationship or be answerable to B just because he is showing you some interest. Live a little more. Life is too short to hanker over the what ifs and could have beens.</p>

              methanol: its the exact opposite. B is the more 'hot guy'. not more good looking just the more interesting and outgoing one. A is the 'good on paper' one, more highly educated, with a better family background. (but i like A not cuz of these material stuff okay).

              yep. things i do with B are just friend stuff. like dinner and movies. the thing is we dont have common friends, so its always one on one. but im sure ive kept my distance well. im not someone who enjoys part time flirting and misleading him.
              
              rednano: haha, A's bonsai, a funny way to put it. i guess hes just the wrong guy at the wrong time. just cant help it.
