You are always capable to give some sound advices. It's AA's loss.<br><br>I guess no matter how real is that incident, we all witness how the pen is mightier than the sword.</div></blockquote>As much as you people might be thinking that the 'pen is mightier than the sword', it's not really even close to the story...<br><br>I do really wish to help AA all along but I have a greater wish that the community would be able to help out each other than to depend on a handful of characters alone... And the truth is I've always prefer a more carefree life.. Being a Mod in AA is just like having an extra burden (which I seriously didn't mind much at all for the benefits that it can give) and too many restrictions... I know that somehow I would be sort of like a 'role-model' and that would indirectly impose many extra 'rules' on me... But I must also admit it was quite an experience, hence I would thank Jason for giving me that opportunity to experience it..<br><br>In fact I've already expressed my wish to leave my position before all these happened, many times before to Jason... That's why like I've said, to those who know... Using 'AA Mod status to my own use' would sound more like a big joke...?<br><br>And it's also true that work is catching up with me in life.. There're other areas in my life which I should be making my 'contributions' to too... Sad to say, AA is no longer really one of them. Though often in the past I've questioned and I've asked sometimes... Those people who I'm helping... Are they really worth my help...? After Bee_gal's incident, which I really didn't ask for any kind in return (just like for the others)... But see what I'm getting today just because of her? And she's not even stepping forward to speak up for me (I'm not really blaming her that much as I know she must really have her own difficulties for that to happen)....<br><br>And 'personal attacks'.... So many personal agendas... Hatre... Set up... Even over the most tiny of things... Selfish thoughts of selfish people.... Really sour me. To tell you the truth, I've gone through all these before. Just that I've thought all these while... Hopefully that people might change for the better one day.... But perhaps some things just cannot be changed...? Or perhaps just that some things would take more time to change....? People who would stay away from you when you're in trouble... Or people who just blindly join in to accuse you for the fun of it...? Because it doesn't hurt them to do so...? Despite I've taught time and over again to them not to jump to conclusions based on groundless accusations... Or just shoot and discriminate people just because they feel like it...? Just too hard to learn and change...? Hope they would after I've left...?<br><br>Nonetheless... There're also some VERY GOOD FRIENDS and PEOPLE AROUND with me all these while... I think I need not repeat myself here the things I've said in my 'thank you' thread....<br><br>Last but not least... With regards to my previous position as a Mod in AA... I think I was doing the forumites a service... But I also believe that people shouldn't use one who they cannot trust.... If they cannot trust me, I think I'm most undeserved of this position...<br><br>So I thought my decision should be a most balanced and 'satisfying' one to almost everyone...?<br><br>Take care.</div>

Well, I thought the effort and time you put in to oversee the AA went down the drain; it's just unfortunate that incidents like these arose to blemish your good service.<br><br>Pertaining to your case, I choose in the past to keep to myself so I could avoid giving others the wrong impression and to invite flaming. But having correspond with you afew times in private, I'd like to believe in your integrity as a person. And it has always been my stand that people weren't there to witness what actually happened and they should refrain from laying judgement.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Devil1976:</div><div class="quote_body">As much as you people might be thinking that the 'pen is mightier than the sword', it's not really even close to the story...<br><br>I do really wish to help AA all along but I have a greater wish that the community would be able to help out each other than to depend on a handful of characters alone... And the truth is I've always prefer a more carefree life.. Being a Mod in AA is just like having an extra burden (which I seriously didn't mind much at all for the benefits that it can give) and too many restrictions... I know that somehow I would be sort of like a 'role-model' and that would indirectly impose many extra 'rules' on me... But I must also admit it was quite an experience, hence I would thank Jason for giving me that opportunity to experience it..<br><br>In fact I've already expressed my wish to leave my position before all these happened, many times before to Jason... That's why like I've said, to those who know... Using 'AA Mod status to my own use' would sound more like a big joke...?<br><br>And it's also true that work is catching up with me in life.. There're other areas in my life which I should be making my 'contributions' to too... Sad to say, AA is no longer really one of them. Though often in the past I've questioned and I've asked sometimes... Those people who I'm helping... Are they really worth my help...? After Bee_gal's incident, which I really didn't ask for any kind in return (just like for the others)... But see what I'm getting today just because of her? And she's not even stepping forward to speak up for me (I'm not really blaming her that much as I know she must really have her own difficulties for that to happen)....<br><br>And 'personal attacks'.... So many personal agendas... Hatre... Set up... Even over the most tiny of things... Selfish thoughts of selfish people.... Really sour me. To tell you the truth, I've gone through all these before. Just that I've thought all these while... Hopefully that people might change for the better one day.... But perhaps some things just cannot be changed...? Or perhaps just that some things would take more time to change....? People who would stay away from you when you're in trouble... Or people who just blindly join in to accuse you for the fun of it...? Because it doesn't hurt them to do so...? Despite I've taught time and over again to them not to jump to conclusions based on groundless accusations... Or just shoot and discriminate people just because they feel like it...? Just too hard to learn and change...? Hope they would after I've left...?<br><br>Nonetheless... There're also some VERY GOOD FRIENDS and PEOPLE AROUND with me all these while... I think I need not repeat myself here the things I've said in my 'thank you' thread....<br><br>Last but not least... With regards to my previous position as a Mod in AA... I think I was doing the forumites a service... But I also believe that people shouldn't use one who they cannot trust.... If they cannot trust me, I think I'm most undeserved of this position...<br><br>So I thought my decision should be a most balanced and 'satisfying' one to almost everyone...?<br><br>Take care.</div></blockquote>talking about bee_gal again, i thought u r already said that the account is used by others n the real bee_gal will be under pressure to talk bad about u.<br>u still want to say that bee_gal will testify for u?? what bullsh!t!!<br>that's the ultimate lie liao, nothing i heard can be so absurd.<br>discriminate ppl or just simply there r ppl who can't be fooled by yr lies!<br>there r ignorant ppl but there r oso those who can think, don't assume that everyone here r as foolish as those who believe yr lies.<br>of course u r undeserving.<br>Selfish to the very core, always have an agenda for helping gals!<br>u can't do a job w/o trying to gain something from it!<br>in the past, i don't care how u misuse yr position to score points with gals, it may be immoral, but that may be yr only tactic. but to outrage a gal's modesty, that is the last straw for me!<br>go to hell n rot  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br>PERVERT cum LIAR cum MOLESTER<br></div>
