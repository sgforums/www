            <div class='col-md body'>Just read what u mention. U know ur bf for 10 mths and u are 20 yrs old.<br><br>No one can tell u whether u shld or shld not marry him however, all our advices will be different.<br><br>Being attached and being married is 2 different things, there are alot of things u shld consider:<br>- Finance<br>- Time spent<br>- Future plans (sometimes accidents might happen. Change of job, shifts, stress, etc)<br>- Housing<br><br>Questions:<br>- After marriage, where are you staying?<br>- Financially, how stable are two of u?<br>- Intending to have a full-blown wedding and customary? (Will affect finance ALOT)<br>- How well do you know ur bf and family (in case u intend to stay with in-laws)?<br>- etc.<br><br>There are countless of questions.<br><br>But on the hind side, I have nieces and nephews that are got married at 21 and 23. But they know their spouse for long and were already working.<br>There is also not much issues on whether u are studying OR not, what is important is ur allocation on time. For myself, I married at 22 right after I graduated. I know my husband for abt 15 mths (physically together probably max 9 mths, was overseas studying at certain time frame).<br><br>JMHO: Get engage first if u are really keen on getting married but unsure. See how it work out for 1-2 yrs. If things work out fine and u have planned ur future, then probably u can go ahead with the marriage. (i.e. financially stable, housing secure, etc) Don't see things as simple as get married and not bothered. Alot of things CAN happen which is unpredicable.</div>

Have ya read the objectives of that site on it's homepage?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>As much as I'm being skeptical of the source of the 'statistics' and how they're being carried out... The 1st statement doesn't really show a very high difference between 30% and 57%?<br><br>Not to mention that often such 'numerical statistics' which is looking at and justifying relationship outcomes are often looking at quite limited vectors(?).<br><br>From a psychlogical point of view, those who cohabits should have a more 'open' form of mindset... Possibly more of younger age as compared to more elder ones which generally contains more 'setting' form of mindset....<br><br>It is hence not surprising at all that people who have a more 'open' / direct / younger mentality would be more ready to accept divorce as an option when things don't work out as compared to the latter.<br><br>To add, staying in a marriage when things don't work out also doesn't necessarily mean it'll be a better option all the time.</div>
