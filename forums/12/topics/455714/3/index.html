              <p>If you can't identify the hurt, it will keep on affecting you.</p>
              <p>Keep quiet and think, what is the hurt.</p>
              <p>Most likely she humiliated you in someway, and you took it silently, becuse you don't want to rock the boat. Now there is no boat, and you want to blast out at her, becuse it is what yo wanted to do all along. This is what you can't let go, more realistically don't want to let go.</p>
              <p>Revenge is not good, it hurts you greater than the other person. Just think about all your suffering until now, is it worth it. </p>
              <p>OK you blast out at her, then what? You think you will be happy or at peace. No you will most probably be talking to yourself about all the things you want to say but did not say.</p>
              <p>Just let it go, and stop the self torture.</p>
              <p>Find out what is the hurt, and you will find it is nothing.</p>

              <p>Having said this, you should not close all doors to relationship. If you do, then you be alone for the rest of your life.</p>
              <p>It is already tough with all these competition and low salary problems in spore. You effectively shut down any opportunity of you reaching out to the opposite sex.</p>
              <p>I can imagine that you will complain all you want and that you want to be a single for the rest of your life. Then when you reach 51 and kanna heart attack and in hospital, lets see who is bothered to visit you at the hospital. Nobody - if only you have a family. I've seen this before. I have visited a friend at a hospital and found a 51 year old uncle sharing a ward with my friend, all alone - nobody visit him because he got no family.</p>
              <p>Its hard but that's life. A lot of people learn from many many failures to be successful. Steve Jobs himself was kicked out of Apple, via a boardroom tucscle. But Steve Jobs worked hard and restarted his own tech co, Next. Many years later, the same board that sacked Steve Jobs was removed because Apple wasn't performing. The new Apple board decided to bring back Steve Jobs and buy his company Next, in exchange for controlling shares in Apple. And you see Apple today.</p>
              <p>Gist of the story is - don't let some bad experience make you give up on girls. You are a guy - act like a guy. Guys like Gurls. You are not Gay. So you say this bad experience prevents you from finding gurls. Then be smart, find a way out. You are a singaporean right? You are trained to be resourcesful and intelligent (whether in school or NS) ? So put those skills into good use.</p>
