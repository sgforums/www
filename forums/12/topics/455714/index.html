              <p>Its ok to feel hurt ....Who doesnt feel hurt by their ex crush/relationship is not human..or in denial.</p>
              <p>It just takes time for it to pass.</p>
              <p>Sometimes I still think of the girl I was with 3 years ago even thou I'm starting to forget what she looks like...what I remember are the emotions involved...and that makes me feel sad sometimes.</p>
              <p>These are what I call bitter sweet memories :)</p>
              <p>However know that life has plenty to offer you...look forward bah.</p>
              <p>Dont deny yourself the chance to move forward and experience something new. Like wise don't let such sad thoughs deny you a chacne to experience something new because you are just being unfair to yourself!!!!!</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I had a colleague whom once who behaved the same as you. She was left emotionally distraught after breaking up with her philandering boyfriend. (My coll was not only pragmatic and down-to-earth person, but a 'giving soul'.) Words went out and another guy in her social circle came along, offering "his shoulders to cry on" (so to speak). My coll taught this's a chance for her to forget about that ex-boyfriend, and sure enough, she went into this new BGR without waiting for her 'emotional scars' to clear up, and dragged this new guy along into another roller-coaster ride. A ride that she paid to get in onto despite several warnings we - other colls - advised her against. Barely 4 months into the new BGR, she had enough and cited "lack of chemistry" the reason for their breakup.</p>
              <p>I don't know about some of you but when you are close to someone for years at work or anywhere else, you can sense a person's mood through outward appearance, behavior and routines. All that years, there's lack of enthusiasm in her and with her then-new BGR the way she confided in us. When it was over, I had wanted to give her that "I-told-you-so" look but what's the use? She's the one who's in control of her fate (and the other guy's too).</p>
              <p>Old memories these are but valuable lessons they turned out to be. So coming back to you, I'd advise you to refrain from another BGR while you are still in the recovery stage. Detox yourself by engaging in social activities like friends' activities or go out with family. They would get you back to your feet and in the midst of this, you would learn a thing or two from them.</p>
