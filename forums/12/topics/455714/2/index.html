              <p>actually i've stopped all this, just that last time she tld me let's stop for a while and talk abt it next time as she's isn't in the mood for this.</p>
              <p>i respected that and contacted her again only aft 6 mths.</p>
              <p>i'll be direct to her this time and tell her tht she's lying.</p>
              <p>for me, i got nothing to lose since i do not need her anymore.</p>
              <p>PS: actually if she's like what u mentioned, i really wonder how come she bothered to reply me when i asked her whether she wants to talk abt it now.</p>
              <p>frankly, i was surprised that she replied as i was prepared to send a final msg, giving it everything i have. i won't give a dam abt her reply and if she did, i'll tell her to fark off</p>

              <p>u are full of contradictions. Yet u act like u know what u want.</p>
              <p>A relationship breaks because both party at fault. Yet all u do is point your finger at her.</p>
              <p>Your So called "friends" will support u because that's what clansmen do. But a true friend will tell u the truth so u not make the same mistakes again.</p>
              <p>I sense u are the passive aggressive type. These type of people , their relationship seldom last Nor happy.</p>

              <p>No wonder your relationship failed. </p>
              <p>yes your friend thought u are one tough guy.. Because u pretend to be one. Then u laments why people can't seem to understand u, and u feel so alone. </p>

              <p>Passive aggressors tend to be cryptic. They don't tell the whole story most of the time. They spin the story so people won't know the truth. That's how they protect themselves when they act passive aggressively, by denying the truth.</p>
              <p>U keep saying she did stuff to hurt u, but u refused to say exactly what. Are u afraid to face the fact that u deserved it ?</p>

              <p>good one darkie, red name is in the early phase. </p>
              <p>However, understanding the process does not prevent another failure.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em;">Denial – The person getting broken up with is unable to admit that the relationship is really over. They may try to continue to call the person when they want to be left alone.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em;">Anger – When the reality sets in that the relationship is over, it is common to demand to know why they are being broken up with. This phase can make them feel like they are being treated unfairly and it may cause them to become angry at people close to them who want to help aid the situation.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em;">Bargaining – After the anger stage, one will try to plead with their former partner by promising that whatever caused the break up will never happen again. Example: “I can change, please give me a chance”.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em;">Depression – Next the person might feel discouraged that their bargaining plea did not convince their former partner to change their mind. This will send the person into the depression stage and can cause a lack of sleep, eating and even disrupt daily life tasks.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em;">Acceptance – Moving on from the situation and person is the last stage. The person accepts that the relationship is over and begins to move forward with their life. The person might not be completely over the situation but they are done going back and forth to the point where they can accept the reality of the situation</p>

              <p>I don't think redname's really over this girl. Pretty sure that he really invested his time and effort for the relationship and the fact that it just didn't work out well enough in the end pissed him off. It's never healthy to get angry and vent on the other party, though.</p>

              <p>i'm prepared to be called ungentlemanly (like who gives a fark) and if the heat is too much, i won't pull my punches back on a b!tch.</p>

              <p>Look pal. Its a trap. I can smell it far away.</p>
              <p>She's nice to you so she can lure you to pursue her even more. She's gonna collect evidence from you such as your sms text, facebook mssg, yahoo mssg and phone conversations. Then she's gonna bring out her new boyfriend to shame you.</p>
              <p>If you have interested in her, how long would it take for other guys to pursue her?</p>
              <p>Whether you like it or not, stay on and you'll see how she will make you look like a fool.</p>
              <p>Only way is to move on and forget about her. I dunno if this is a school or work environment. Just sit there and act like nothing happen. Like she's not important. Then all will go away. If any friend ask you, how are you? just pretend nothing happen and talk about something else.</p>

              <p>perhaps i shld tell u guys why i'm so angry.</p>
              <p>i've actually accepted the fact tht we can't be together and I won't pursue tht matter again.</p>
              <p>she at an early stage have lost interest in this but continued to flirt with me etc, thus leading me on.</p>
              <p>when i thot of this, i felt very angry cause my feelings for her increased thru out tht period tht she was leading me on.</p>
              <p>had she stopped this at the early stage, then the damage wldn't b tht bad cause i wldn't b so emotionally attached.</p>
              <p>i feel angry tht it's unfair tht i have to be depressed for so long just because tht attention seeking b!tch haven't had enough of her share of attention</p>

              <p>She won't be the last person who is going to do this to you.</p>
              <p>A lot of girls are like this.</p>
              <p>If you are a player, you got to take it easy.</p>
              <p>If you full of emo...go seek new girlfriend at your nearest dating agency. Emo people won't survive in social circles.</p>

              <p>good one darkie, red name is in the early phase. </p>
              <p>However, understanding the process does not prevent another failure.</p>
              <h3 style="background-image: none; border-bottom-style: none; padding-bottom: 0.17em; margin: 0px 0px 0.3em; color: black; font-size: 17px; font-weight: bold; padding-top: 0.5em;"><span>Grieving a break-up</span></h3>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0.4em 0px 0.5em;">Denial – The person getting broken up with is unable to admit that the relationship is really over. They may try to continue to call the person when they want to be left alone.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0.4em 0px 0.5em;">Anger – When the reality sets in that the relationship is over, it is common to demand to know why they are being broken up with. This phase can make them feel like they are being treated unfairly and it may cause them to become angry at people close to them who want to help aid the situation.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0.4em 0px 0.5em;">Bargaining – After the anger stage, one will try to plead with their former partner by promising that whatever caused the break up will never happen again. Example: “I can change, please give me a chance”.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0.4em 0px 0.5em;">Depression – Next the person might feel discouraged that their bargaining plea did not convince their former partner to change their mind. This will send the person into the depression stage and can cause a lack of sleep, eating and even disrupt daily life tasks.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin: 0.4em 0px 0.5em;">Acceptance – Moving on from the situation and person is the last stage. The person accepts that the relationship is over and begins to move forward with their life. The person might not be completely over the situation but they are done going back and forth to the point where they can accept the reality of the situation</p>

              <p>hey you got your definition wrong.</p>
              <p>Its not a break-up.</p>
