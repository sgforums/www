I know the ger now have a choice, it is not tat i am the only suitor... Even if i am the only suitor, if she tink we are not compartible she wun choose mi also.... I can only hope she is still in the considering part and see which guy she likes more....</p>

              <p><br>there is the losing point, NO confidence in yourself, i hv met many guys, and by the look in the eyes and the way they talk, i know whether they got self confidence or not, and i hate those with no self confidence. Your lack of self confidence will shown in the eyes of your gal, it just that she dun point it out, but for that alone, you lost 20points out of perfect 100pts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you love her, go for it, nevermind being a thick skinned person just for it, cos in the end you get what you want, who cares what other pples say or think, you get your love gal and that is it. Do you see ugly fat guy with a beautiful gal, do you see ugly short pimples faced guy with chio gal on the street??? you tell me why?? why they can match, why the gal love him?? Because characters and thick skin play an important role in tackling gal ya.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And furthermore, as a guy, you should be able to take disappointment even if it fail. The ability to take it and the ability to leave it.</p>

              <p>Be prepared to lose a good friend. But that doesnt mean u can never reconcile right ? This should boost ur confidence . Competition is good. Just use any means necessary. Once ur good friend knows of your intentions , its just a matter of who sabo who first .</p>
              <p>If you survive the sabo , by all means.. give it everything u got. He started it , you finish it.</p>

              <p><br>ya, the fundamental of it is that most playboys also settle down once they found a good gal who can control them and make them a guaiguaiboi</p>

              <p>but then again.. some playboys with reputation liaw hard to get girls. Especially get girls that are of different  characters.. maybe like those other kind of girls. Then its hard to woo them if u are known playboy. It will diminish ur chances of hooking up with those girls. Greatly.</p>

              <address>First, you act as playboy, get her attention, go out with
              her, lesson 1: we gals like it hot and playful guys too, but we not
              serious with them. Then later when she ask you about your
              life,..you act and tell her you want to stop being a playboy,
              you want to be a guai guai boy, (which you are actually),
              you want her to help you to be guai guai and love forever,
              you say to her, you believe she is your savior, i
              <strong>guarantee**</strong> you, she will fall for you. Lesson 2:
              We gals like to have belonging love, someone to care for, and
              someguy who kind of soley need us and open to us. We feel very
              owned and madly in love with him.</address>
              <address>OOps, am i betraying my own gender here??</address>
              <address>**guarantee only for one year period, excluding break
              up due to sex incapability and disatisfaction.</address>

              <p>u know why most sg guy also get no love and marriage, because most of them their character suck, i am sori to my own gender. Within we gals, they gossips here and there, then in front of boys, they act tao tao and proud, got for 3 in 1 types, where can you find a guy who is rich, handsome and muscular in 1 go?? So choosy and picky, some of them show their nice looking bfs to me, and i alway had a feeling their bfs must have regretted having them after seeing me. Not that i am pretty, but my sociable and alway laughing and smiling characteristics can make any man happy if not horny.</p>
