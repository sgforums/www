            <div class='col-md body'>ahkico...don't feel sad about it. There are still some good guys and gals avaliable around. Think telly-tubby is a nice guy, but just too overly nice. That's is probably why A has so much power over him, cos she knows that he wouldn't dare to offend her. And I also felt that telly-tubby is too weak as a guy, not man enough to take the reins in the relationship.<br><br>Either way, I wish them all the best.</div>

The underlying reason for all these bad marriages/relationship are nothing but relationship born of karmic bonds.<br><br>He has probably knew about these bad traits/characteristics throughout the course of their relationship way before the actual marriage take place. One's love definitions and personality carries forward into their marriage, therefore if the BGR relationship were torn with holes, marriage will prove to be difficult if they don't evolve their wisdom in love.<br><br>Stay strong for Telly? I say he will do much better without her? Seriously, what kind of wife will she make by charting the years prior before marriage and decide when to end her marriage for her own self-absorbed goals?

Is not a kid playing with toy.. dun like it liao.. jus dump it aside.. she's selfish.. wasting telly time and effort.. toying his feelings around.. *sorry if i sounded rough*<br><br>Poor telly.. all he wanted is so simple.. he knows that this is getting no where.. but he still hangs on to it.. thinking that one day she might changed and come back to him.. If her mind is set.. nothing can change... she doesn't appreciate what he does for her..<br><br>People doesn't consider marriage as a serious matter.. they get married for many reasons.. but how many end up happy?? is that wat they wan?? Only status and in name of husband and wife.. other than that there's nothing ese more to it...<br><br>In that case.. ppl always end up divorcing.. cos both cannot compromise to each other.. marriage is about commitment.. howmuch can you give to this family.. not only thinking for yourself.. but now you have to think for your spouse too! is not only one person.. it becomes 2 now..<br><br>Tell telly what he really wants.. if he only wants to see her happy and that it.. living with someone who she doesn't really love me now. why not let her go.. dun waste anymore time.. maybe like this.. this will do both good.. but of cos. as a friend.. it hard to suggest a divorce to them.. cos there's always a better alternative to it.. beside signing papers... talk to telly tubby.. let him understand the real situation.. he more like running and avoiding the reality.. that's wat you can do.. other than that.. the both parties have to talk about this oso..<br><br>Cheers...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

But  you should have known that things might get tricky or complicated given the position you are in.<br>a) Tell him, he might nt believe (given tt his sucide attempts history shows how much he loves her) and if A found out, accuse you of betrayal.<br>b) Dun tell him, feel sorry for him for he is really a nice guy.<br><br>Here's one perspective - they must sort it out themselves (just between two of them only) as marriage is a two-persons affair (unless if they have kid/s, they might play a role as well). Moreover, A is divorcing him anyway,just a matter of time, so it's actually her loss and telly tubby deserves someone better and suitable for him.<br><br>Have my say, it's all up to you.<br><br>P.S: If I were you, I will tell him straight and knock the sense out of him. I dun mind losing frens like your fren A. Heck it man!!! But I am a guy, so might be diff.</div>
