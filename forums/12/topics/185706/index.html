            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mitgalant:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi guys, currently ther is this situation, John is havin a long (exp:2yrs) relationship with Sher. Things are very nice in the first 2 yrs. However things starts to get pretty serious durin the past few mths. John is unable to stand Sher short temper and "Gals Domination". Juz as when John is out with his friends, he begins to take note of his ex gf, Jes. Jes in the meantime is also havin some problems in her own relationship.<br><br>John develop a crush on his ex-gf Jes yet cant bear to break off with Sher. But he is in a dilemma, cos he cant stand Sher character.<br><br>What must John do nw?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Give real solutions only pls. Dun make a fool out of it. Thanks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>John has experience what many of us has experience before.<br>He may have put lots of effort on Sher but what he got back from her is just her short temper and negative feelings.<br><br>Imagine putting effort on a person but realise that he or she might not be worth the effort. Thats wat John is feeling now.<br><br>Actually is John heart which is changing it might be Jes or someone else but the most impt thing is that he tired of doing so much for someone who is not worth it.<br><br>For John or who you are.<br>This is just a few answer to your questions.<br><br>1) Do a offical break with Sher. It will help you clear the air that you are serious with your actions and people will respect you for it. Being single will help you go for someone else without any worries and if Sher can get another chance to find someone who loves her.<br><br>2) drag and hide until Sher finds out. She scream and shout. Cries and call for a breakup. Both breakup then you are call a bad person cos you are the bad one who ran away.<br><br>3) Go with jes and once confirm with her dump Sher. The worst type who cares for only his own feelings and everyone calls him a playboy behind his back.<br><br>Actually is up to John lar<br>this is open end answer which only John knows the answer.<br><br>stay and suffer or go ahead and try a new route.<br></div>
