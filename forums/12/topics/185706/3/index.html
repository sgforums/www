He will only change if he feels that it is for his own good, and only then, the change is permanent.<br><br>In a relationship, before you asked someone to change for the sake for yourselves, do you seriously think that you have no flaws at all? She may be tolerating your flaws as best as she can.<br><br>I feel that John is still immature. Just judge by the situation that he is having now. A mature person will know how to deal with his problems wisely. He will not complicate matters by adding more problems to the current situation, nor will he find an excuse to justify his actions.<br><br>If I am allowed to give harsh advice, I would advise John to break off with Sher coz his indecisiveness will cause pain and hurt to Sher later. I would also sincerely hope that Jes will not get together with John coz it seems to me that John is still immature to handle relationships.<br><br>By the way, a 2-year relationship is not long.<br><br>Cheers.</div>
