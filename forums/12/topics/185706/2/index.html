As suggested by choco B, relationship between John and Cher should be another matter altogether with his feelings with Jes...<br><br>Note MCSquare's words... Are you John or are you just a friend of john? It's quite unlikely that you would be able to properly convey advices we have for John or to speak from his stand of view well enough for us to properly analyse the situation... Are you JOHN? If you're not John, how close you are to John or John's close ones to worry so much... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>Notice advices already given by our kind forumites again... In a relationship, it's most likely that there would be a sweet (honeymoon?) period to it... It's never practical to just indulge in them... It's just like telling us that when you were born as a baby, your mum provided you with milk and heck... There're the least worries in life... Sad to tell you, a relationship as a product of time grows just like you do... Analogous to working in order to get yourself fed and the things you want in life... Fruits in a relationship often doesn't come without working for them especially after a considerable period of being together 'closely'....<br><br>What's between you and Cher can only be resolved when both parties' truly aware and willing to resolve it... And though it may seems very much a personality problem with Cher... You could very well be using the relationship youre both still 'in' at this point FOR it... Not AGAINST it... In other words... As a partner to Cher... HELP CHER OVERCOMES her shortcomings... Make her understand that it would not only be beneficial for the relationship but also for herself... Instead of telling she has got a problem and shooting her in her feet, ENCOURAGE HER and GUIDE her along to OVERCOME THINGS.... SHOW her how you REALLY wish to HELP HER... Don't make it JUST HER BUSINESS... Make it BOTH YOUR BUSINESS.... In doing so, not only would you have Cher handle her temper and personality problem (note that it's quite unlikely that a person would have totally no temper or clear all of them off just like that. Learn to be content for the genuine effort your partner puts in for you to achieve what you hope for) but it would could also bring both of you closer and to a next level in the relationship....<br><br>As for Jes, I would just like to remind you that she's still in a relationship at this point. Even if things are not working well for her, are you sure she would be able to clear her thoughts and get along with you... Live happily ever after...? Hmm...<br><br>Also, I would like to know what was it that you mentioned about Jes being able to provide for but Cher is not able to?<br><br>Thus, last few questions in this post... Why did you broke up with Jes before? Who initiated it? How did she feel about it? How long ago was that? How many relationships (BGRs )you've had since you're born till today? Jes being your number what relationship? How about Cher? How long were you with Jes? What age both of you broke off? Remained as friends after?<br><br>How is Cher feeling about your relationship problem with her now?</div>
