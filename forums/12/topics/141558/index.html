I'm sure u have experienced it for yourself.  Money is a BIG issue.<br><br>Ur mum is ill and ur dad dun earn much.  As part of the family, it's only right for you to support your family.  It seems that your gf is not understanding enough.  You are only together, not married, and she oppose to you forking out money for your family.  It seems to me that she has high Ego.  break up or not is up to u.  Family and her, which one will u choose?  It will be best if u can have both.  But what if u can't?  You have to come to a decision.<br><br>18, 19 is still too young and not mature enough to settle down.  There are too many things to think about.  I would advise u to concentrate on ur studies first.  Dun let a girl ruin ur future.  </span></div>

Your family faces financial difficulty, but that doesn't equate to a wrecked home. Many household are going through what your family is going through - your rebellious strike out is a choice that promise final despair, stress and dead end. Very loving to stay together in co-habitation? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You soon realise that your level of love cannot cope with the pressing problems thrown at you constantly like whirling blades in air. </strong></span><br><br>Logically speaking, you do not even have the finanicial ability to even maintain life, family and relationship all at a go. Furthermore, you are still studying - even if you push for part time, your income will barely be sufficient.<br><br>Moving out in your case is not a sign of maturity (or trying to be independent as you may thought of yourself), rather a form of escape to somewhere which you thought love could substitute whatsoever element that is missing in your home. You tried to build a 'home' of warmth in this new 'home' - so pray tell me how does this security of your new haven work to keep itself stable? You can't... &amp; you finally see the cracks and flaws of your young love-cohabitation idealogy, crumbles like a house of cards in face of cruel reality.<br><br>Standing at the crossroad, the future of your love looks bleak. Having to break up with your girlfriend is probably the same as having to admit all the willful decisions you made is a huge mistake afterall. Who would want to go through ALL THE MILES and end up coming back to square one? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>You can continue your current way of life, although its probably not doing you any good... for if it does, you would never had to come here in the first place. How now brown cow? Do you still want to carry on false hope, impractical love and motes of delusion? Or would you chose to humble yourself, acknowledge your plight and work towards ending it, even if it means having to sacrifice?<br><br>P.S: You have been living in short-term vision; learn to equip with some foresight with wisdom. It can save you alot of tears and hurt in the long run. Make sensible decisions for your life NOT because it seemed great-at-the-moment - but exercise them with enlightenment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Luckily, I am not your parent. Your parent have spend so much money and effort to grow you up. Now they need money not because of gamble. You should help them. Ask yourself, what has your girlfriend done for you? She has no right to ask you not to help. If you and your parent position turn around, what will you think of such child. Money that spend on 'want' and 'need' are different. 'Want' can be avoid. There will be more other trouble you have to face when you grow older. To me a partner is a companion, one who can go through thick and thin with me, share my joy and sorrow. Life got lots of up and down, is impossible to be happy forever. If she is there who is prepared to share your happiness and not sorrow. Then you better give a second thought about your relationship with her. You can change many girlfriends in life but you can't change your parent. In other words blood is thicker than water. Tell her you need to help, if she love you she should respect your view. Meanwhile, concentrate on your study, with good qualifation you can earn more money and solved your current problem. Good Luck.</div>
