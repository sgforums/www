            <div class='col-md body'>There is this scenario..<br><br>There is this girl, he likes her alot. After going out for months, he decided to tell her that he likes her. But alas..he was not given a yes or no. Just a 'not now' . Thats cool, but the thing is , ever since he told her his feelings, she comes out more often with him then before. In fact , they go out so often that people think that they are together. When asked is she the gf..or is he the bf.. they both deny..but then they do things any couple in a r/s will do. They hold hands, light kisses etc.. but they are NOT together.. everytime if asked the question she will use the same answer. She doesnt go out with other guys but just with him for the next few months until she left for overseas to work for a while. She says she is the kind that will remain faithful even in a long distance relationship but the thing that is frustrating is why does she act the way she is towards him. She cant be using him as she is well off herself, playing his feelings? but she is always telling him which girl is pretty..or he should go after this or that girl.. it complicates matters for him as the girls thinks he got a gf already, but when he tells them he doesnt..they dun believe him. He told her that this has to stop as it is confusing him, but she insists saying that she doesnt want it to change...she wishes it to remain as it is..Some more there are at least 2 other guys going after her n she seems oblivious to it all.  she keeps saying she really likes him.. but Like n Love is 2 different things dont u think?<br><br>Do you think the guy is being played in the balls or what ? what possible answer is there in this kind of situation!  Just need some opinions and suggestions. cheers</div>

But more importantly, if the guy still likes (or already begin to fall in love with the girl, who is now overseas) it may not turn out to be so easy, isnt it?<br><br>Fair enough the some ppl out there are afraid of commitment... but if the guy is looking for someone who can commit, isn't it time to move on to other options since he has already ask her a couple of times and she is not ready to commit yet.<br><br>However, if the guy loves her and thinks that she is worth the wait... its not wrong either to keep his patience in waiting to the relationship to bloom, but of course he have to be prepared for all possible outcomes....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Is he willing to take the risks?</div>
