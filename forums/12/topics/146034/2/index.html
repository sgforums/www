She had already decided since the day you reveal your inner thoughts. This form of non-committed relationship is a variation to the usual kind we always thought one would be and in fact, this model can exist without the interference of guilt. This can co-exist with AOS (Art of Seduction) theories, for the only solo weakness of AOS is that its potential is severely limited with the clashing of conscience.<br><br>Conscience and Desire is like fire and water - either one give way, or you can find a way to balance it without reacting with one another.<br><br>Understanding this, you will also discover that you two see two different definitions in Love. You want something concrete... something practical like a relationship with the existence of love. She desires the feeling-of-the-moment - one who lives for the moment and treasure what's shown presently and not too much into the future.<br><br>She gauge the risk of a relationship (probably from experience from past relationship), and decide against taking it.<br><br>Then, her current experience with you is simply... beautiful.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>This will arouse inner conflicts from within. The answer of 'Not now' is simply a poor excuse to buy her time. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In fact, no amount of time will suffice</strong></span>. 'Not now' is simply a response from her to maintain the current status quo <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>because this 'beautiful moment' may change if she decides to change the variable. </strong></span><br><br>It's not a question of liking/love for you; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>she is in love with her own girly fantasy</strong></span>... imagination... romantic dream.<br><br>If you are looking for committed relationship, you probably have to start looking elsewhere, since there is no official attachment with her. I mention two different definitions - it is virtually impossible to switch definition as and when one feel like. When you begin something on a certain definition, very often, it stays with you until the final chapter (depending how you see this final chapter).<br><br>P.S: My best friend, often, begin her relationship from a non-committed/fulfilling love, but ended up claiming that she fell 'too deep in love' and seek for a committed version of it. She, later, finds misery, sorrow and much daunting challenges, seeking to drown the relationship.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I told her:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>'You so SURE you begin on a non-committed relationship based on non-committed mindsets? And not hoping for a committed, good relationship, using non-commitment as a facade to shield yourself?' </strong></span><br><br>She is a Pisces - the sign most vulnerable to self delusion, among the twelve zodiac signs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

This form of non-committed relationship is a variation to the usual kind we always thought one would be and in fact, this model can exist without the interference of guilt. This can co-exist with AOS (Art of Seduction) theories, for the only solo weakness of AOS is that its potential is severely limited with the clashing of conscience.<br><br>Conscience and Desire is like fire and water - either one give way, or you can find a way to balance it without reacting with one another.<br><br>Understanding this, you will also discover that you two see two different definitions in Love. You want something concrete... something practical like a relationship with the existence of love. She desires the feeling-of-the-moment - one who lives for the moment and treasure what's shown presently and not too much into the future.<br><br>She gauge the risk of a relationship (probably from experience from past relationship), and decide against taking it.<br><br>Then, her current experience with you is simply... beautiful.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>This will arouse inner conflicts from within. The answer of 'Not now' is simply a poor excuse to buy her time. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]In fact, no amount of time will suffice</span></strong>. 'Not now' is simply a response from her to maintain the current status quo <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>because this 'beautiful moment' may change if she decides to change the variable. </strong></span><br><br>It's not a question of liking/love for you; <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>she is in love with her own girly fantasy</strong></span>... imagination... romantic dream.<br><br>If you are looking for committed relationship, you probably have to start looking elsewhere, since there is no official attachment with her. I mention two different definitions - it is virtually impossible to switch definition as and when one feel like. When you begin something on a certain definition, very often, it stays with you until the final chapter (depending how you see this final chapter).<br><br>P.S: My best friend, often, begin her relationship from a non-committed/fulfilling love, but ended up claiming that she fell 'too deep in love' and seek for a committed version of it. She, later, finds misery, sorrow and much daunting challenges, seeking to drown the relationship.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I told her:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>'You so SURE you begin on a non-committed relationship based on non-committed mindsets? And not hoping for a committed, good relationship, using non-commitment as a facade to shield yourself?' </strong></span><br><br>She is a Pisces - the sign most vulnerable to self delusion, among the twelve zodiac signs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers[/b]</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  that was very.. fullfilling~ i know what u mean.  Her desillusion and his.  Well, she is a Leo. I am not very into this Zodiac stuff but just to let u know.</div>
