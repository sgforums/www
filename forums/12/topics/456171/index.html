              <p>So, i like this girl in my class. I can't really find a chance to talk to her until one day when we're in the same project group. So we talked for about... 2 weeks? Then i confessed to her out of rash while we were texting. Firstly she said she is afraid of guys making use of her again, because of her past encounters with other guys and then she said she's not rejecting me but we should take it slow since we only started talking not long ago.. </p>
              <p>But now we hardly talk in school, just one or two sentences maybe. She doesn't talk to me in school, and we just text everyday, that's all.</p>
              <p>I really don't know what to do next, it's been 5 days since i confessed to her. Any advices? Thanks for reading :)</p>
              <p>UPDATE:</p>
              <p>I asked her if it was ever possible for us to be together. She said she don't know and told me that she's horrible and stuffs, and that i should stop torturing myself and look for someone better than her. It is really over? :(</p>
              <p>UPDATE#2:</p>
              <p>It's over. She's attached. Idk why i feel so cheated it's like all the words she said were excuses from the start. I wasn't even an option in the first place. Maybe i should just be a jerk. Peace out</p>

              <p>She just told you the plain truth. She treat you as a friend.</p>
              <p>She sounds like she doesn't have a lot of experience in relationships. Wonder how old she is. Maybe she just hit puberty and start to blossom with nice long hair.</p>

              <p><br>Sounds like she never had a boyfriend before. She's really inexperienced. Usually when guys get near the girls, the experienced ones can sense it whether the guy is interested or not. In her case, she was so caught offguard, likely that she never had a relationship or was never contemplating that you were making your move.</p>
              <p>If she is 15 or 16 then I estimate that she must be beautiful and most guys salivate at her, like Paris Jackson. But since she's 17, you most likely fell for her because of the ease you were able to talk to her. For sure there must be some chemical attraction but don't think she's on top of the league in terms of chio bu prestige.</p>
              <p>You are still young. Go out there and hunt more. Gain more experience. Gain prestige points. Concentrate on your studies and get good grades. Asian chicks dig on smart guys because smart guys give them security and better future.</p>

              Look on the bright side.
              You are not a stranger, but part of her life as a friend.
              Maybe you should have put yourself self in her shoes when you confessed.
              She may not have known you that well at the time.
              You should start being a better friend before you can even consider love.
              In other words, narrow the relation distance between you and her first.
              You should know her well too before you yourself could say that you actually like her,insted of being a case of '''love at first sight''.

              <p>Its already over when you started it.</p>
              <p>I am not sure if her attachment is true or not. But all I know is teenage relationships never last long. They normally break up before they even reach Poly.</p>
              <p>However, I am not telling you to keep her in mind, just move on.</p>
              <p>There are many other fishes in the sea.</p>
