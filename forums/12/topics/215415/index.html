            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, Marmalade boy<br><br>Sorry to read your predicament.  May be you could be subtle to threaten the nasty company that you will seek legal help to get your pay.  There was once I resigned and my ex company refused to pay me my salary.  I gave them grace period after which I did not receive any pay cheque from them after I left, I called to threaten them.  thereafter I received my pay cheque withing 2 days.<br><br>Sometimes we need to be assertive and aggressive to companies which make it dfficult for ex employees to receive their pay.  Understand that it is confidential that's why you did not mention the name of the company, otherwise it will do all of us good to know which company this is so we could avoid working in such company.<br><br>The other alternative is if you and your ex-boss are still on good terms, may be you could seek his help to get your pay.<br><br>MOM exists to protect the employers and they do very minimal to protect the employees.  This is the loophole and many companies in Singapore are taking advantage of this by exploiting the staff or terminating their services without good reasons.  MOM is hopeless, and don't think it will get any better with this present Minister of MOM, formerly working in a govt hospital.<br><br>Good luck!</div>
