            <div class='col-md body'>TRust.. Is important in this case. You can never really prevent all this from occuring. Confide in your boyfriend your worries, tell him how much you meant to him, tell him how those drugs would affect you and his future together. After telling him all this, he would have a strong reason to reject those drugs, if offered by his "best" friend. If he doesn't, either, he doesn't love you that much to refuse loyalty, or hes suffering from stress that you didn't know. There could be other possibilities, but those two are the major factors. Again, i emphasize, trust, is the key to all problems when apart. take care, and hope for the best.</div>

That kind of amateur rubbish. And everyone just sits there and falls asleep. Geez.. that's really bad.<br><br>Okie... listen to what you have wrote (typed). You want someone that you can rely on.
