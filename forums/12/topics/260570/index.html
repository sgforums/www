            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, i just needed an advise.<br><br>You see, i've been liking this girl since last year. I know I'm an idiot for not taking so many chances but just hear me out. Last year, after a party for the exchange students, it was really late at night, around midnight if i can remember correctly, we were walking as a group and she wanted to take the taxi home since there was no bus. (that day is weekday so no NR). I told her don't waste the money lah can walk mah. Not that far. Her hse is at Paya Lebar there. So as the others went their own way, I told her that I would accompany her to walk home. That was the first time that I found out that I got a thing for her.<br><br>As time went by, i think my affection for her grew and she was there for me when i had a conflict with my mum and my ex-gf betrayed me. I was so down at that time that I wanted to commit suicide but then she saved me.<br><br>Well, just last week, after a late night movie, we were waiting for bus outside with our group of friends but she was sitting on the steps alone. I ask her in sign language why was she sitting on the steps alone. She just pointed to the space and said, "can sit down". Hmmm, I'm really an idiot for not taking the chance there and talk to her.<br><br>I've been friends with her for 2.5 years already and i don't want me asking her out to have an effect on our friendship in case she reject because it happened to me before and the girl like never really talk to me until now.<br><br>What should I do????<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

At least, u n her feel comfortable together... Just wait lor... Wait for more chance or wait till next valentine lor... Anyway, girls are sensitive creatures...

I know I'm an idiot for not taking so many chances but just hear me out. Last year, after a party for the exchange students, it was really late at night, around midnight if i can remember correctly, we were walking as a group and she wanted to take the taxi home since there was no bus. (that day is weekday so no NR). I told her don't waste the money lah can walk mah. Not that far. Her hse is at Paya Lebar there. So as the others went their own way, I told her that I would accompany her to walk home. That was the first time that I found out that I got a thing for her.<br><br>As time went by, i think my affection for her grew and she was there for me when i had a conflict with my mum and my ex-gf betrayed me. I was so down at that time that I wanted to commit suicide but then she saved me.<br><br>Well, just last week, after a late night movie, we were waiting for bus outside with our group of friends but she was sitting on the steps alone. I ask her in sign language why was she sitting on the steps alone. She just pointed to the space and said, "can sit down". Hmmm, I'm really an idiot for not taking the chance there and talk to her.<br><br>I've been friends with her for 2.5 years already and i don't want me asking her out to have an effect on our friendship in case she reject because it happened to me before and the girl like never really talk to me until now.<br><br>What should I do????<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>All what u mention is positive but doesn't mean she likes u and want to start a r/s with u. She might be friendly and helpful gal. It is nothing wrong to develop liking affaction from all this event. But from what u wriiten,she did sounds like a good friend material. I warn u,if u confess to her and fail. She might forsake this r/s. So think very carefully abt confessing to her. Only confess to her when u are very confident or obtain very clear hint from her!<br><br>If u really interested in her and attempted to develop further. U can ask her out fro outing or sms her to know more of her. It might to develop further but no gurantee. Weight yr cons and pros before u make the next move! Regarding to rumours abt she liking u or what. PLs ,PLs!! Never trust rumours! Trust until u heard or seen....</div>
