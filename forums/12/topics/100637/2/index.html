Yes, they are still being violated. It is a biological response. We don't know how individually we react to a situation . However not everyone act the same.<br><br>No way to judge because we don't know who she is . Probably could be guilt eating her up - we don't know.  Point being : none of us know except for this person who posted it on. What we can do is just direct her to the authorities and her parents and that is what aunt agony columns are about.
