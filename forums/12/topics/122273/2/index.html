            <div class='col-md body'>interesting topic.<br><br>men and women will never be the same! why? cos GOD made them different. other then physical apperence of cos. physically, men are suppose to be stronger then women if both went through the same kind of physical training. Physcologically women are suppse to be stronger then men if both went through the same kind of phsycological training.<br><br>then there is the different in growth pattern for both male and female. women tends to develop faster in physical sense from baby to teens. at late teenage, guys start catching up and develop faster then women.<br><br>so if u pit 2 competitor together 1 male and female in a physical challenged activity with both receiving the same training, at lets say 20 years old, the guy will win. but if they are oni 10, the gal will most likely to win.<br><br>So tell me how can guy and gal be the same? but talking about making money. eh... i think its a fair playing field since we receive both same education level. guess its the amount of work and effort you put in that counts. but then singapore guys lugi by 2 years.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> TMD<br></div>

You must keep her on a tight rein..<br><br>Women want total freedom or rather to call things by their names - total licence.. If you allow them to achieve complete equality with men, do you think they will be easier to live with? Not at all.. Once they have achieved equality, they will be your masters..<br><br>In fact the scene have changed drastically.. Last time, a man choose a woman for its gentleness, demure kind but now its different.. It is the girl who accepts / doesn't accept a potential suitor.. And guys compete with each other to impress the girl..  A guy's eligibility is determined by how many C's he possessed..<br><br>I don't know what it will lead to.. But, it will be catastrophe if it continues.. Sometimes, I just can't fathom whats going on in their pea brain.. They want equality yet they won't accept being in a stronger position.. The men in Singapore dont have the privilege of assuming a weaker position and demand the other sex to do the work yet when a guy like my friend Peter comes along, he is often label as a wimp or not assertive enough for the local ladies..</div></blockquote>got rejected again? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
