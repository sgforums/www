              <p>and this is the price to pay - your own agony.</p>
              <p><strong>guys should always be the less calculative party.</strong></p>
              <p>it's not about forgiving mistakes and stuffs.</p>
              <p>it's about having a big heart to swallow every unhappiness - no matter who caused it.</p>

              <p>&amp; this relationship is not complicated.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hi everyone. i had posted a few times earlier. dunno if u guys
              remember me. but anyway i am back once again to seek some clarity
              in confronting my problems. hope i can get some feedback from the
              different people and their views. :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Me and my gf have been together for like 6 yrs now. during this
              6 yrs we had our ups and downs and we broke up 3 times before. each
              time after the break up, i got into a rebound relationship where i
              enjoyed the company of the new gal but never did i love them.
              nevertheless i did my utmost best for the gals giving most of my
              time. but each time whenever the one i truly love(my gf let's call
              her 'A") contacts me, we actually patched back because we missed
              each other alot. i am actually of a different race from my gf. my
              gf is chinese and she has been my first gf ever. The first time we
              broke up was because after 3 yrs of being together with her, she
              persistently sought a breakup as the solution to our problems. i
              had endured enough for the 3 yrs and just after
              an accident i went through, she asked for a break up yet
              again. this time i complied because i decided i had enough.</p>
              <p> A month after this, i had another gf 'E' who i had lots of
              fun with. she brought a new meaning to my life because i was
              enjoying getting to know another gal. i had previously devoted my
              self n time to just 'A' and didnt mix with other gals at all. but i
              was unhappy deep down in my heart because i knew 'E' was never
              gonna be the gal i am going to settle down with. and finally 3
              months after being with 'E' i mustered the courage to break up with
              'E' and reconciled with 'A' after 'A' had gotten into contact with
              me. (<em>i admit i am a soft hearted person where i can take care
              of a person and am prepared to live with the person and take care
              with her even though i do not like her. it's due to my stupid
              feeling of being responsible for my actions</em>) that's why i say
              that i <strong>mustered the courage</strong> to break up with 'E'
              because 'E' was a very good and nice gal. she never angered me nor
              showed any signs of bad temperedness that 'A' exhibited. but still
              i left her n got back with 'A'</p>
              <p>After getting back with 'A' i realised that things were never
              going to be the same. i tried as much as i could but i just took
              the relationship for granted. i never wanted to see her as much as
              i used to want to see her. i just enjoyed the intimacy that we had
              and also the fact of having someone whom i loved beside me. also
              during the breakup prior to this, i got into contact with many gals
              and realised that there is a whole wide sea out there. there are
              indeed so many gals who are better than 'A' and i wanted to make as
              many female frenz as i could. i didnt wanna be stuck in the same
              situation as to hafing a frenz circle with no gals in them at all
              again. so i kept in touch with all the gals i made frenz with. i
              didnt like them but just u know, keep in touch and the occasional
              lunch/dinner kinda thing.</p>
              <p>My gf 'A' was extremely unhappy that i wasn't giving my all in
              the relationship. i admitted to her that i couldnt give my all
              after what had happened and that i will try my best to spend time
              with her. but that wasnt enuf for her. she wanted me to stop my
              clubbings(with guy group..no gals inside and my gf A knows my 2 guy
              frenz). she says that i will be stolen by other gals. to me, i am
              an average person and being from the minor race, i dun fancy anyone
              of my race and also the chance of me getting together with ANOTHER
              chinese gal is extremely slim and so i told her not to be afraid.
              despite that 'A' was still worried and would follow me on my
              clubbing sessions. one day on my bday, she got so angry that a gal
              was dancing with me when i swear that i didn't. the gal who was
              dancing close to me was a fren who was dancing with ANOTHER gal.
              this set up another storm of fights between her n me. even my fren
              who wasnt drunk vouched for me that i DID NOT dance with any other
              gal. so after those arguments we broke up again.</p>
              <p>after this breakup, 2 months later i got involved with another
              gal of the same race as me. again i felt very unhappy and this gal
              'G' had a bf who she was not happy with also. so we spent much time
              together. i told myself that i will leave when i find someone who i
              really love and i hope that it had better be soon. 'G' had also
              told me that she liked this relationship to be open in the sense
              that either of us could leave anytime and we would respect the
              other party's decision. 4 months later, G and me broke up because i
              could not stand the idea of 'sharing' her with another guy because
              when her actual bf was ard i could not contact her. her promise of
              choosing either one of us was also taking a longer time than she
              said so i decided to end it. i felt good about it because i knew
              she was not who i loved.</p>
              <p>suddenly by god's grace, the very next day, 'A' contacted me
              saying that she was drunk and asked if i could send her home. after
              like 6 months of no contact, i decided that i shall go and see the
              one whom i really loved. after sending her home, she confided that
              she loved me alot (in a sober state of course) and that she has
              never chosen anyone else despite our breaking up for so long. (she
              is a very pretty gal being sought after by many many guys) so we
              got back together. things were fine at first. she really had
              changed for the better by so much! she was very mild tempered. she
              was very into her new found religion. but she never trusted me. she
              was always suspecting that i was chatting up other gals etc. yes
              it's true that i do chat on the irc and msn. i haf tons of contacts
              whom i do not know and am just a virtual fren with to them. so
              whenever ppl have problems i tend to lend a listening ear to
              them.</p>
              <p>there was this once where this gal was having prob and i told
              her that not to worry so much. even me haf a gf but i am not happy
              in the relationship. there are many ppl out there who are much
              better than her ex-bf etc etc. and my gf stumbled about thissaved
              msn chatlog. we argued abt it and i told her that i was only
              coaxing the gal. why didnt she read all those other msn msgs where
              i so happily told to all my frenz that i patched back with my gf n
              i really love her alot etc etc. from then on after seeing that msg
              she has never trusted me.</p>
              <p>she will always read my frenster msgs and get angry whenever i
              add any gal. when she asks me why i did tat, i just tell her that i
              do not know the gal at all. which is true. i just add becoz she
              added me. is this wrong?.even the status of being 'single' in
              frenster got her angry. but i put as 'single' becoz we always break
              up n reconcile. whenever i change everyone in my list knows what
              happens and my lifestory become public. i hate that and so i
              decided to leave it as 'single' forever. this one also is wrong in
              her eyes.!!! anyway after having so much problems with
              frenster i deleted it away for her. the latest problem was today
              when i tried to get a client for my brother.(this client is my fren
              whom my gf 'A' and me and her together with another 5 frenz
              went ktv singing togther on friday) in doing so, she read
              a conversation sms i had with another female fren. in it i
              playfully told my female fren liek this "ya lor.. i msg her coz she
              wan buy thing from my brother wat. u wanna buy thing from my
              bro meh? thats y no msg u but msg her instead. no la.actaully
              i love her i just realised today. thats why i msg her. haha" i and
              my fren always tok like this.. but my gf upon seeing this sms she
              got angry. and she started showing me face and wanted to break
              up again. i started to coax her and i could see that she was really
              very tired of being in this relationship. i tried
              explaining myself that if i did have anything to hide i will
              not even be keeping that msg in my hp. in fact i should be the one
              doubting her because she is the one who is in sales and always haf
              customers sending her lovey dovey gdnite msgs. but i have
              never doubted her nor always check her hp. but she always do this
              to me.</p>
              <p>now i am in a predicament. i dun wanna continue arguing all the
              time. but i also do not wanna break up. and i am always the
              playful type who will joke and tok alot to gals infront of my
              gf. i feel that toking in front of her means that i got nothing to
              hide. even so, those gals all know that my gf is there with
              me. and i am really tired of always not earning my gf's
              trust. she never trusts me and it seems that checking on my
              email,frenster,hp is becoming a daily affair. so can someone
              pls tell me what i should do? and she always thinks that i haf alot
              of gals going after me when in fact most of my free time is spent
              with her.</p>
              <p>is leaving her the right thing to do? in that sense,
              she will haf a chance to learn to trust another person
              who might become her bf. because she never trusts me so when
              we get married this will certainly pose a big problem.</p>
              <p> but if we breakup i am damn sure that i will be very
              unhappy. i dun even think i can learn to love another person again.
              i just wanna study and earn more money now. btw i am 26 and my gf
              is coming to 25 so pls dun think we are those small boy small gal
              dunno how to think and get into love etc.</p>
              <p>i thank those for giving constructive points for my complicated
              relationship.</p>
              </div>

              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Interestingly, there are also significant percentage
              of people in their late adulthood, suffering from what you deemed as 'small boy
              small gal' problems, especially when earlier stages of love development wasn't
              mastered or completely avoided by the individual. And apparently, your
              relationship is not even close to harvest, despite, surpassing the age of
              adolescent, having full autonomy of your personal life and leading a
              relationship of six years. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">What I am trying to bring across is that our
              understanding in Love and our chronological age can be quite mutually
              exclusive. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Also, I would like you to understand that
              Love doesn't flow in a linear format, dictated superficially merely by the
              length of time. The eventful journey in which you have arrived at - is largely
              due to the cause set by your past circumstances, which tripled in strength and
              smashing you with karmic crisis after crisis, because they is a blatant lack of
              wisdom, in aspect of Love and relationship.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Because she is your first love, chances are, you
              will always have a soft spot for her. Enduring initial three years of nonsense
              might have seemed to be a long frame of misery, but not when your world only
              revolves around her. Problem only comes after you gain this short independence -
              you start to realize that the world is larger than what you could ever imagine. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This discovery is like a overstretched rubber
              band that cannot restore itself back to its original shape because there are indeed
              many fishes in the pond and there is absolutely no way you can now delete that
              knowledge. There is a distinctive kind of 'damage' dealt to your emotional self
              and your overall experience in Love, just like a kid who has been barred from
              playing outside his house. Upon first breath of freedom out of his house, he will
              run straight towards the soccer ball that has been lying outside the field all
              these while (as he has been observing quietly through the window while
              remaining 'captive' inside the house).</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This is exactly what you did; you entered
              into meaningless relationship for relative comfort and happiness upon hasty
              exit of your previous relationship. Also, there is a gnawing fear infesting
              within your soul, you actively kept a horde of female friends, subconsciously
              forming a kind of 'safety net' because fear has taught you not to entrust your
              world to just one person. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Can you love without trust?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Surely, your fear is dominating you much more
              than you realize - it has probably transformed into a phobia. You will probably panic
              the minute you do not feel 'alternatives' around you. Don’t get me wrong; it's
              actually healthy to keep friends of both genders, even if you are in a relationship,
              but the difference lies in your mindset in adopting female friends. And it has
              nothing to do with whether you are interested in them or not; the reason why
              your relationship never walked out of turmoil upon second and third patch is
              because you remained uncommitted yourself. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The act of constant sourcing reveals your
              inability to remain committed to YOURSELF, yet subconsciously demanding this
              quality from your other half, in face of your relationship. This creates a
              inevitable distance and pressure on your relationship, creating more suspicion
              and mistrust in her attitude towards you.</strong></span> Then when you sense her wrath of god
              every other occasion, it actually fuel your self fulfilling prophesy in NOT
              having to invest commitment to just one individual, while you rationalize that
              you did not cheat her in any ways. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This is actually bi-directional. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Your flippant ways triggered her insecurity
              and caused her to lock her grip on you. In response, your fear to be imprisoned
              is triggered and you constantly shape-shift your position to resolve this fear
              of being blinded to only one person. <span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Why would I claim that you are uncommitted,
              yet demanding commitment from your partner subconsciously? Upon careful
              examination in your relationship with G; you have shown an intolerance towards
              this her natural MIA whenever G is with her bf. Take note that the clauses you
              have set for yourself are mutually agreed, that this is an open relationship, yet
              you are unable to stomach this very set of rules you have lay down.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">If you noticed, after the intense break up
              after the clubbing incident, you attracted G, whom is also non-committed
              herself. This is a reflection of an old law in CloUdiSm, where we attract the
              quality we exude. Simply put, if you are uncommitted, you attract uncommitted
              partners. And I must stress that 'commitment' doesn't mean that you are
              promiscuous and cheat on your other half - it simply means that you find it
              arduous to meld into love, holding conscious, deliberate reservation. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You adamantly felt that she is the only one
              you will love and stubbornly decide that no one else can give you happiness.
              Ironically, I don't see you being very happy in your relationship right now
              though. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Do something right for once; should you
              decide to break off, do it neat and don't ever look back to patch for the
              fourth/fifth/sixth times. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You are probably just delaying the
              inevitable. <span> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">But if you are bend on staying, then you really
              got to talk about this love and fear that has been circulating throughout your
              six years relationship. Lay terms and adjust what you and her ought to should
              do to allay the stress on this relationship. She is probably just as unhappy as
              yourself, so make it a point to discuss the root of this unhappiness and seek a
              mutual solution to dissolve this. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Chances are, she doesn't feel that you are
              spending most of your free time with her. And chances are, you don't really
              understand her phobia in seeing you walk away from the relationship (it is
              likely a self fulfilling prophesy on her end and now she is paying through her
              misery as this relationship has already 'walked out' on her three times). Since
              you have said that this is not a 'small boy small girl' problem - then learn to
              exercise some maturity and wisdom in ending your plight once and for all (be it
              leaving or staying). </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>

              <p>it is obvious that your 'playful' character adds on to make your gf to feel insecure.which for other girls,it might be hard to accept too,unless the girl is also of the 'playful' type you see.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>trust is very important in a relationship.but during the frequent breakups with your gf,have your gf also went around accepting guys to be her bf?as you mentioned,she's pretty and guys are going after her right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but from what you've typed,indeed you've put in alot for the relationship too.i believe so does your gf.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if you loved her so much,why not put in some effort to change the 'playful' character of yours?you knew alot of your actions are what that actually triggered your gf's jealousy isn't it?spare a thought for your gf's feelings,even if you think that joking and talking ALOT to other girls in front of your gf means that you got nothing to hide.what if she's the one who always like to joke alot and talk alot to other guys infront of you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>trash whatever unhappiness both of you have with each other,and make effort together to get them out of the way,only then trust can be slowly build up between your gf and you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and,don't go accepting other girls when you don't love them!</p>
