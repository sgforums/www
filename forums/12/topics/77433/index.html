            <div class='col-md body'>alright, I asked this because there is currently a guy I like. He is my close friend. We used to be very close; he would tell me his thoughts that he would not tell others. But the problem is he likes another girl. He told me about her and although it hurts me a lot, I still tried to help him to go after the girl. I helped him to select gifts for her, wrote love letters to her (which he never sent actually), a lot of silly things that I know I shouldn't do. But he is my best friend and I promise I will always help him when he needs it. I always feel so comfortable with him, we have gone to movies, dances, watched sunset/sunrise together, and the best thing is I can talk to him for a long time and never get bored. He was there to calm me down when I was sad and made me laughed again. However I do not know whether he likes me or not. And I do not know if I should tell him that I like him a lot because of fear it will ruin our friendship. Any ideas??</div>

Things not said out would never be known to the other party.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>At least let him know that there's a girl right beside him waiting for him, and let him ponder about the choices he had before him, you or the other girl. If he choose to wait for the other girl, then fine, say you will be a friend and support him all the way. No hard feeling and no more guessing where his heart is. If it's you he choose then congratulations. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Since you are such good friend with him, I'm sure it would not break just because u confess your feelings to him. Pick up tthe courage and ask, or in time you may regret the day u didn't.<br><br>Live a life without regrets, it's hard but attainable only if you try.<br><br>Hope this would help.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Nothing.<br><br>He waited the girl for 5 years and of course, the girl he is waiting doesn't really give much damn about him. Somehow, people never realise that plain waiting without vision of plans will attribute to complete failure. Friendship wouldn't be ruin overnight because of the expression of feelings - rather, it is how two parties handle the situation.<br><br>Tell him as in an informative way. By letting him know and you not expecting anything. You could can still remain good friends and everything - as long as you don't act like a weirdo and everything else. Be yourself even after expressing - trust me; if you are not going to do that after say 5 years already - <strong>when are you doing to do it?</strong> Anyway you just wanna let him know, it doesn't mean you two has to be together ya? Well, if he feels that it is impossible, then so be it. Close this chapter and move on with life.

He has waited for dat girl for nearly 5 years. I don't think he will change his mind just like that. I don't know when this will end. Sometimes this hurted so much that all I want to do is to just forget him. Forget every single memory that we have shared, it will be easier that way. I have even tried going out with another guy who likes me. But nothing works. A year later I am still in love with him. Even more so now. I have no idea why....</div></blockquote>I dunno wat r U doin... but if I were YOU, I wld hint again. Maybe somedae let him noe of it, subtly NOT suddenly. I dun bother to decipher wat he doin, wat U doin. Hiao NOT even wat da gal he waitin for 5 yrs doin. I juz wan U to noe dat to try, U get 50%. No try = 0%.<br><br>Yr move, pwincess.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>easier said than done actually. Maybe because I am someone who think a lot about the consequences of my actions.  I know by telling him there is a chance he might accept me as more than just a friend..but there is also a chance I might lose him. And so many of my friends who have tried this before said they ended up losing the friendship. Both parties will agree that nothing will happen to the friendship but...somehow the declaration always will do something to it. I don't know. I am afraid of losing him I guess because even though he might not know it, he means a lot to me. And I am going to live next to him this summer break (by coincidence)...but after that I would move away already so I won't see much of him anymore after this summer. So it is either I have to take action fast or just let time erase all the memories...</div>
