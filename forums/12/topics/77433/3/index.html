            <div class='col-md body'>This is just to update...I am actually crying as I type this in now...I think I have lost him..wait no, you can't lose something you have never had..where have I heard that before? I feel so alone right now. Listening to Jacky Cheung's 'I can't forget you' and trying desperately to drown my sorrow and anger...<br><br>So what had happened? Well today there was a special lunch in my dorm. I can go to that special lunch because I stay in a special dorm and he does not. So today the dining hall food just sucks. But I got all the nice food cos I can go to the special lunch area. Then he told me he wanted to eat something that is served in that area. I have already finished eating at that time and because of him, I made my second trip to that area ( I can't actually do that, I can only go in once) and begged the person guarding the door to let me in. Luckily it was sumone I know and she let me in le. Then I got the food already and was about to bring it to him but then the normal dining hall people won't let me in! So I can't bring him those stuff, I was quite disappointed but then when I got back I asked him if he still wanted it. He talked to me for a while and then suddenly stopped talking to me. I was puzzled because he had never done that to me before. An hour later, I saw that his sign in name has changed. To "Dearest (fill in the gal's name here) it is so nice to be able to talk to you again." Yes it is that girl. The one he likes.<br><br>So why am I angry? See after all I have done for him, he dropped everything he is doing at the moment to talk to that girl. Who has ignored him for months. Who has been listening to his problems, listening to him bitch, cheering him up, supporting him in everything that he does?? Definitely not her. What I am angry at is...he didn't even seem grateful for the trouble I took during the lunch time. He didn't even say thank you. I can't stand the thought of that. I hate him now. Even if we are just friends, can't he jus show that he is just, well, grateful? It is like he will forget all about me once that girl appears.<br><br>I am just going to try to let go. I guess it is pretty clear who he likes now. There is no need for me to ask. I dun think he has ever liked me. Suan le ba.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I finally told one of my friends here about what had happened. At first she thought the problem was regarding B. But I haven't told her who the person is..but I am guessing at the way things are going now, she will know sooner or later.<br><br>I am acting according to plan. But I am thinking about should I delete all the pictures I have taken of him and with him. I just opened my albums just now and I saw all the pictures we have taken together during our vacation and during those times we have spent together. We looked so happy together. Who would know things would turn up this way? As I look at each picture I was crying. I wanted to delete them but then they were really precious to me...<br><br>I realize I can't stop loving him this fast. I am taking small steps now. Maybe one day I will finally have courage to just get rid of all those pictures.</div>
