Some of them are now divorced.<br><br>I have a strong belief that marriage should take place only in our mid twenties. By then, we would have been through a fair bit in life, and generally have a better idea of what we want. My gf was really desperate to get married initially. She thought she was sure she wants to be with me for the rest of her life. But 3 years down the road, she is suddenly unsure.<br><br>All this while, i am sure that i want to be with her the rest of my life. I didn't expect her to be hesitant now. I guess this shows that people's expectation and direction in life can change with age. Maybe she wasn't mature enough when she was younger. </div></blockquote>you're rite, i agree with you that ppl 's expectation changes in the course of life. It's just like your financial goals. As one grows, your needs and wants and thinking starts to change and evolve together with the environment.<br><br>Well, im sure you'll find someone as good or even better in time to come.. yeah! jia you...</div>

Therefore, it's vital that both parties must be mentally ready and prepare to face all problems and fulfil all obligations together...</div>

I am not sure about other places but Singapore is all about $$$$$.  As a couple, both may have all the love for each other but when you walk down the aisle, both are also begin a journey of debt (house lah, bills lah, loan this, loan that, later have kids already even lagi need $$$$$)<br><br>I am not pouring cold water on people who want to get married earlier but I would caution them not to rush into a marriage without being financially fit first. This is Singapore after all.<br></div>
