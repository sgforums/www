            <div class='col-md body'>Everyone keeps saying " forget the person". I mean, why should we forget the person we once loved? It is part of our life experience. Do you try to forget your pet which died 5 years ago because it brings sadness when you think that it can't be with you anymore?<br><br>Do you try to forget a dead sibling, parent, grandparent (or anyone special to you)? No. You keep them in your heart.<br><br>The more you try to forget that person, the more you will think of him/her. NO! Don't forget someone who has made a big impact on your life. You should thank him/her (or to those holy people, thank God) for crossing paths with you.<br><br>Ask yourself: you will, and have met millions of people over your lifetime. Why is it that he/she is the only person to make such impact on your life? Admit it. This person is special even if he/she is no longer by your side.<br><br>Use your experience to improve yourself. Make sure you don't repeat that bloody mistake that caused you to lose this person.<br><br>What we can do is admit that this person will NEVER accept you again, no matter which god you pray to. People who ask for advice on how to forget a person are actualy in a denial stage. They refuse to believe that this person is gone forever!<br><br>Ask yourself: do you think you would be able to cope better if you lose this person through his/her death instead of you being dumped?? If the answer is yes, you are still hoping for a reconciliation. As long as you still has this false hope, you will never be able to climb out of this abyss.<br><br>Welcome to the real world.</div>
