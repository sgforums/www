            <div class='col-md body'>Hello everyone. I feel that this little problem is going affect my girl and I greatly in time to come. Just wondering what can I actually do.<br><br>My girl and I has been together for like a month plus. She has been though quite a few failed relationships which has affected her way of thinking towards love.<br><br>She said she took the courage to get into this relationship because she feels that we will last. However, as time pass, she continues to have fears about promises by guys. This has always result in a low mood between both of us.<br><br>What's more ''interesting'' is that she doesn't really trust my ex who is also her friend. And an ex of her is still waiting for her for about 3 years and still waiting.<br><br>Basically this fear thinking of hers is eating into our relationship.<br><br>I feel lost. I don't want to lose her, I tried means to address her fears but still the cycle repeats.</div>
