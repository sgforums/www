            <div class='col-md body'>recently found that my life is very meaningful and seriously i feel like something is missing, a sense of loneliness....and this feeling occurs the most at night.<br><br>before i sleep, i think about tommorow. what is there to be done? den followed by " what have i done today ", den " whats next for the future?" when these questions start coming in, i feel very lost and feel VERY VERY lonely. i wonder if any of you guys here have experienced this before.<br><br>my days are very occupied. in fact, it's rather busy. i wake up for school. and on a few days i have tuition. on weekends i have badminton training and usually on a friday afternoon i would train more badminton with my group of friends. and usually my nights are spent chatting online or doing some work.<br><br>i told my brother about this problem. (younger bro). even though his like younger i still sometimes talk to him, usually when he shares his problems wif mi i share back wif him (sharing iz good afterall rite?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ). sometimes i juz get amused by his cute replies and some were surrisingly quite enlightening...<br><br>i was taken aback when he told me that this feeling of loneliness is because i don't have a gf..or more specifically, someone i like.<br><br>i remember posting somewhere down here about my problems in this area, thanks to all for the advice, i have gotten over it....., and have not liked anyone for almost like half a year.., it was tough at first, to accept rejection, but finally it got really better after i got over it.<br><br>i indudged myself in badminton during this period. playing like 4-6 hours everyday during the holidays. i do rest enough dun worrie. and from someone who is regarded as a novice i managed to play up to somewhere like say, school team level? not the best though but somewhere around there.<br><br>recently been in slumpy modes, juz games where your brain juz switch off and you can't continue moving. and when i think about badminton i get depressed. (for this period of time, badminton used to be my thought of inspiration)..and when i think of school, i feel even worst. (who likes school anyway?). i do have my friends, and my best friend, who is tons alot better than me, is progressing SO quickly and every time i feel the gap widens by a siginificant space. he even broke up with his gf to indulge himself his badminton and aims to be a national player someday. lol, about that, im not really sure if that is possible, for him, not to mention us..<br><br>life without some happy memories, without any inspiring thoughts can be really painful...., i mean how does it feel when everytime you submerge yourself into thought and a quiet moment with yourself, you get bombared with negative things. it can be really really painful..<br><br>true i do feel that i'm not the extreme end of the unfortunates..., and i should be happy with what i have, but life seems meaningless.<br><br>back to the point (sry if i'm goin in circle) and before someone may accuse me of beating around the bush, this is my process of thoughts at the moment, whatever i think of, i type......what you're reading is my thoughts at this current moment.<br><br>okie, (again), back to the point. about what my brother said. he mentioned that i feel this is because i don't have someone i like, (or love?). usually at worst cases when you're feeling down, juz thinking about the person you like, can totally reverse all the positive thoughts into negative thoughts..., juz by seeing her face in your mind it feels like you'r revived.<br><br>i used to experience this, but since rejection i told myself not to like other girls. and been goin around with this motto " love no one except my racket " for sometime..<br><br>i'm approaching 16 this year...., and i believe all thw aunties (and uncles?) in this forum would advice me not to go and waste my time to like someone etc..<br><br>any solutions to my problems, i feel kinda lost. once in a while, i nid something good to think of.  thanks in advance<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well is good to actually ponder over wat lies in your future but i feel you are quite pesstistmic (*dunno how to spell*) over your life.<br><br>What i suggest is maybe you like to join some groups outside your sch .. not those gangs haa but maybe adventure groups that go for hiking or camps and make new frenz.<br><br>There is no point finding a suitable one for yourself now as you are just so limited by your own school girls. Maybe after enlarging your social circle, you will now what type of ladies you like as well.<br><br>I was like you in the past, training badminton for my sec sch and sat just go to NPCC for training but i guess my circle of frenz are quite big and they always think of funny ideas to spend the weekends like night cycling from west to orchard etc.<br><br>As a teenager, just enjoy yrself man! *so sad..my teenager life passed away le*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... maybe you want to try doing something meaningful in your life? I dunno... 16 years old? Just have fun I suppose... I have a 15 year old brother who seems to be able to take life very easy, literally very easy... Nothing to think about... Just go study... Play will do...<br><br>Perhaps you might want to try learning something new? Learning process can be quite fun( Not School Topics i mean  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) That helps and at the same time it will allow you to understand more about yourself, in terms of potential and interests...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks everyone for advice.<br><br>ya actualli in my thoughts i eventually (somehow) start to think of what i'll be, what i'll be doin when i reach adulthood. and sometimes i worry about things such as:<br><br>i'm borned into a family that is considered rich. well, not filthy rich but at least able to make ends meet, give all of my brothers more than the average pocket money..., have a big house and a maid to serve all of us. sometimes i worry about " what if someday all these were taken away from me and whether i can get used to living in conditions that were not as comfortable as my current life "<br><br>unfortunately, i have never done housework in my entire life. all my meals were served from first level all the way up to my room. i use to spent many hours on the computer, playing com games the whole day<br><br>BUT<br><br>that was my lifestyle in the past. when i started thinking more i realized respect cannot be earned even if you played the best warcraft game ever, even if you own everyone in the neighbourhood, in school, people will see you as a geek, a nerd or juz a computer addict. which is somehow...., how most people sterotype good gamers.<br><br>i began to realize at least sports, by playing well in it, gain you a considerable amount of respect. the society gives more credit to it than at least, com games. but that wasn't the only reason why i took up a sport and seriously started playing it..it was because i loved it so much.<br><br>over these months i tried goin down and take my own food (self service). I still didn't take up any housework or chores since my parents didn't wan me to do them. i feel so....pampered and spoilt by them..i get almost everything i wan and i feel like there is nothing to work for. which adds on to the feeling of meaninglessness..<br><br>i feel terrible. not to the "painful extent" but it feels more like " a pain in the ass"...it doesn't bite and ache but it stings occasionally......<br><br>i wonder if the average 15-16 yr old in SG does housework, (for guys), and are there any consequences if a guy doesn't know how to do simple things like.....(cant gif any examples since i dun do anything at home)..<br><br></div>

If you find life meaningless, go search for that 'meaning' in your life...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  And then think about how are you gonna work towards it...?<br><br>With regards with your 'gf thing'.... I think you don't necessarily need a gf.... Maybe more friends could do the trick too...? Anyway, it's really up to you to choose...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
