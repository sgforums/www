If you know what is best for you and you calulated - you have all the rights to make the decisions. In relationship and love - if you both are meant to be together, you will be, regardless of how far the distance, how long the time. You want to improve yourself, to strive on forward for a better tomorrow, without her in the picture - you earn my admiration.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>[b]<span style="text-decoration: underline;">1st Stage:</span></strong><br><br>You mentioned you will stop smoking - eventually after some time, tell yourself that you will go sleep 'that' day without alcohol. It is like a pit you are inside - you have all the time to remain there and you have all the power to get out from there.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2nd Stage: </span></strong><br><br>After ceasing all these smoking and drinking - for guys, I advice you to invest your time into training your physique. Drain your energy into your work, studies and extra time to the gym or exercising. It will only shape yourself with better bod, you will also use all this restless energy into something.<br><br>Things to do or watch out everyday.<br><br>In any situations when you got to look at the mirror, <strong>MENTALLY talk to yourself</strong> that you will succeed in the attempt to improve yourself. Throw in words of encouragement to yourself before you leave the loo/toliet.<br><br>When people stir the anger in you, don't reply to them first, hold ten seconds before replying. If it is things like bad customers service - learn to communicate like a gentleman to get your message across. 'I wan to see your manager, etc'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If people is looking for trouble and lure you into picking a fight with him. Pause, look at him, and tell him this.<br><br>"<strong>If you can hit me, I won't hit you back, because I am not going to degrade myself. The most we can go to the police</strong>.'<br><br>Cease using vulgarities - limited yourself to only F.U.C.K. in extremely case. Genitals calling or summoning of parents to quarrel spolits images and increase your heat of anger.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>When people say things that brew this temper - <strong>ALWAYS PAUSE 5 to 10 SECONDS </strong>before answering. It gives you time to think and react in better position.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Not reacting to hostility, with brains, trains your character - reacting in the wrong way makes you a loser.<br><br>Cheers<strong></strong>[/b]</blockquote>I will try to control myself but as for releasing the energy... I really dunno how. I've been listless and I can't get things done. Forced myself but it doesn't seem to work... and worst is cannot concentrate in office too.</div>
