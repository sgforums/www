I don care if she has a new bf. Like you said, why create chance for others by having a poor image? I have been drinking and smoking long before I knew her. I wanted to quit bcuz of her. Was trying to. From a large pack a day to a small pack to only 5 sticks per day. Progressively cutting down. Stopped clubbing as I wanted to save money for our future...  so no drinking except for the occasional beer once a month when I go watch soccer. That's it.<br><br>Now for me it seems there is no point trying to reduce all these now. All my fds are smokers. It was already hard to cut down amist them and now without the motivation its worse. I am drinking again as I can't sleep if I don now.<br><br>Finally, winning her back is something I didn't think off. I didn't abuse her. I never use any vulgarities on her. I was v harsh and like wat u said, it was straining my relationship wif her. Y I so harsh and scold her? I'm a v straight forward person. If wrong means wrong. I know some of the things she telling me was way not the correct way to work there and I cannot afford to let her make the mistake. I love her so much I would not bear her to suffer when she make those mistakes.<br><br>I only hope she's happy there even wifout me but I don think I can see her again. What I need now is how to help control my temper. As in my 1st post, she already scared of me and say I too fierce. As a human being, I do feel that I should change it as no one should be afraid of another human. I jus wan to make sure my freaking temper is gone. My smoking and drinking dosage has increased but this I really dunno how to put them down again. There's no one left to try for. No one left to strive for. No one to care for.<br><br>I'm a bloody aquarius. Bloody cuz I feel my soul is bleeding now.</div>
