It's like seeing a glass of water on the table. You're sitting away from the table feeling very thirsty and wanting badly a sip of water. Thinking about it won't help unless you have telekinesis. You've got to get up from your seat and walk over to the table in order to get to the glass of water!</div>

We kept in daily contact and all. Then she started to have late nights... cuz her project can't be finished... but it was really avoidable...<br><br>Being the hot tempered man I am, I kept scolding her. I was ok that she has to use all her time to do the project... but it cannot be that its like everyday mah. (up to the extend she was falling sick) So I didn't heck care that she is the fragile type (mummy's gal) who cannot take verbal abuse one... and this continued for 2 months...<br><br>Finally she cracked... and we have broken up... she told me she was scared of me... when ever she call me I would scold her. I really did it out of her own good but I didn't realise it was hurting her... and when I offered to go there and settle this face to face... she almost screamed... in her mind she has already taken me as a monster...<br><br>I've never hit her before although I am harsh wif my words... and I know its my fault. I can never be with her again.. and she has also said she never want to see me again...<br><br>I'm seeing a shrink for dis as I really can't take it. I already tried to change for her... she don like me to smoke so i cutting down and I intend to quit before she's back and surprise her. I  stopped gambling and I stopped drinking. I use to belong to a triad gang but she worry I get into fights so I left all my fds whom I've grown up with for 15 yrs as they all from the triad gang. Now I really no mood to do anything... scold my boss for nothing, almost get into fights... cannot sleep... haiz... the shrink not really helping much... and now if IMH got sars I cannot go see the shrink....<br><br>I hate my temper for this... I hate it really... cuz I really love her. But I wan her to be happy too so I'll stay away from her life from now on... and I need to curb my temper... how do i do it? I wan to lose it!! I wan to kill it!!<br><br>It has made me lose my most beloved one and I don wan it anymore!!! I wan to get rid of it!! I really let my ex down ah!!!<br><br>Sorry for venting but I didn't know who I should speak to... I really don know... Pls if there's anyone who noes whom can help pls let me know... pls.... I don tink the shrink helping me... I'm smoking more now and I drik every night else I cannot sleep... pls help...</div></blockquote>To be honest bro, it ain't really about your temper. One way or the other you gotta let go of her.<br><br>I've spent 3 yrs in australia studying and personally withness many break ups in particular, "long distance" relationships. Either parties tend to "stray" away and have themself a bit of flirting action going on.<br><br>You have to realise that while she's there and your here, there are guys out there whom are after her should there be any. Whether or not she intends to stray is up to her. Her ideals would be much more open rather than before due to the society westerners live in.<br>Soon you'll realise she isn't the person before or perhaps she would grow to treasure you more.<br><br>But I won't b*llshit you. Those things you watch on TV ain't the same as the real world. Its pretty much straight forward, once she's gone she's gone. only 0.0000000001% will stay strong. Unbelievable ? sure. This is the truth I have to offer.<br><br>I always like to think of it in a way that should your partner love you enough to be strong enough to reject those "beautiful, handsome" people, than my friend, she truely deserves you. There's no point patching things up if she's made up her mind to go with some cute and hot caucasian guy whose gonna go to bed with her and dump her the following or perhaps ......... few weeks later ? reason why is because if say you manage to patch things up with her by making her forget about the hunky dude, your gonna have to experience much more of it. defeats the purpose of true love if you ever intend to have one<br><br>It doesn't matter if your perfect or she's perfect. What matter most is whether the 2 of you are perfect together.<br><br>anger is inevitable. it takes days, weeks bla bla bla to heal, so be it, but this day my friend is your 1 step towards understanding reality.

She's playful and wild. She likes to play so I will not be surprised if she has a new bf now. I really love her and hope the best for her.

I'm deeply hurt and this is like the 2nd time I shed tears since my primary school days. I thought I am incapable of that but she proved me wrong. The top piority now for me is to control my temper... I don wan to hurt anyone anymore. I will do anything for it to be cured.<br><br>Finally thanks to all of you who tried to help cheer me up... I greatly appreciate this. I promise that one day when I'm fine, I will in turn stay around this board whenever possible to help others too.<br><br>Pls.. if anyone noes of how to cure this temper of mine pls advise.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually....where does your anger stem from? ask yourself that. where did it come from? maybe you couldn't accept yourself for who you are. you improved yourself after you met her... it means you know that "hey... i cant go on living this kinda life. in other to make my future significant other happy i have to stop doing this and start doing that."<br><br>maybe it means that you cant accept the current state of your life. and you dont want to? perhaps that's where the anger is from? you're angry at yourself for not improving your life. you just directed that anger at others?<br>try addressing the root problem.<br><br>just my 2 cents worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Healin:</div><div class="quote_body">Thank you. I don care if she has a new bf. Like you said, why create chance for others by having a poor image? I have been drinking and smoking long before I knew her. I wanted to quit bcuz of her. Was trying to. From a large pack a day to a small pack to only 5 sticks per day. Progressively cutting down. Stopped clubbing as I wanted to save money for our future...  so no drinking except for the occasional beer once a month when I go watch soccer. That's it.<br><br>Now for me it seems there is no point trying to reduce all these now. All my fds are smokers. It was already hard to cut down amist them and now without the motivation its worse. I am drinking again as I can't sleep if I don now.<br><br>Finally, winning her back is something I didn't think off. I didn't abuse her. I never use any vulgarities on her. I was v harsh and like wat u said, it was straining my relationship wif her. Y I so harsh and scold her? I'm a v straight forward person. If wrong means wrong. I know some of the things she telling me was way not the correct way to work there and I cannot afford to let her make the mistake. I love her so much I would not bear her to suffer when she make those mistakes.<br><br>I only hope she's happy there even wifout me but I don think I can see her again. What I need now is how to help control my temper. As in my 1st post, she already scared of me and say I too fierce. As a human being, I do feel that I should change it as no one should be afraid of another human. I jus wan to make sure my freaking temper is gone. My smoking and drinking dosage has increased but this I really dunno how to put them down again. There's no one left to try for. No one left to strive for. No one to care for.<br><br>I'm a bloody aquarius. Bloody cuz I feel my soul is bleeding now.</div></blockquote>Since you don't have the intention of trying to win her - then why post this? Just as simple as trying to resolve your bad temper? I doubt so.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So what if you had been smoking and drinking since she knows you, etc - that's why things will go wrong - you never attempt to do something practical during your relationship. You know you have bad temper - you CAN curb it. EQ (Emotional quotation) - is very different from IQ, in which you are born with it. You never choose to improve it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Now I mention about quitting these past habits of yours - you blabber about your friends being all smoker and she is already gone what. Its easy to give excuses for yourself and simply say: Yes, she is gone, so whats the point. Exactly the same way about the thoughts of trying to get her back - your will is so weak and half-hearted.<br><br><strong><blockquote>You are a straight forward person - wrong means wrong. </blockquote></strong><br><br>I mention alot of times in the forum before and would continue to do it as long as I am around posting - Frank is a virtue while blunt is a flaw - in your case, you are absolutely under blunt characteristic. I have several friends who are frank and straight forward person - HOWEVER, when it comes to many issues - they are tactful - which you totally lack in your communication. The Aquarius's need to speak out and communicate is strong - just that you are doing it the wrong way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>What's use if your motive is for the greater good, but you express yourself as if you are a jerk bf?  </strong><br><br>YOU WANT TO CURB YOUR TEMPER, you would need a load of willpower. Its not just a a one time thing and forget about it. You have to begin someway and start. You know why its totally and utterly useless and of no help when you go seek all these help, etc? Because even you yourself doesn't want to attempt your first step in walking a mile.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The thought of winning her back doesn't cross your mind - I can't think of any motivation for you to work towards because even your friends ain't being helpful, rather a negative impact on you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If you can't cease smoking and drinking - you will never be able to curb your temper. Where's the willpower and determination shown in going back to negative habits? Rather a 'zi bao zi qi' attitude that wouldn't improve your situation and probably make you feel worst.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: I am going to hell of a frank with you: If your gf knows about you being in such a sorry state, she will feel gulity, but at the same time, she will be scared of you - and probably feel that the decision to leave you is right. You could change this: its within your means. You said that she is happier without you - oh, if she sees her bf so bu cheng qi - come on, you are making your own comment come true.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>My challenge to you: Show me the determination and willpower to get over it and I will try my best in planning for a way to get your gf back - CloUdiSm style.

Yes... You're reckless and you're fearless &amp; you thought you can fight this 'monster' within yourself which you can't see...? Well... Guess what...? Everytimes you want so much to SEE it, you're only giving it more STRENGTH.... Seems like since you've got so much trouble controlling your mind... (thanks so much to the alcohols and medications you taking..) You should CONDITION your body... Ever heard that being a vegetarian would help control your temper...? Well.. Ain't exactly... But it does work INDIRECTLY...? I'm not asking you to become a vegeterian here... But you can begin by taking more PLAIN drinks like H20... More fruits and vegetables... Don't eat too much unnecessary food (especially high energy ones...)... Don't OVEREXERCISE yourself... Enough is enough... Don't be to physically active.... Just enough to keep yourself healthy..? UNTIL you learn to CONTROL this MIND of yours.... With DISCIPLINE...? So a little discipline to start with in all activities suggested would bring you a LONG way to come...?<br><br>2. Learn to LOVE. Not asking you to find another girl to love or go back to the old one... But LOVING the people around you... The world you live in and YOURSELF.... YES.. You have EVERY REASON to HATE them, but that DOESN'T mean you don't have any reason to LOVE them...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Once you've learnt this well, ANGER has no reason to be with you.. Not to mention a chance to display its 'abilities'...?<br><br>3. Work on TECHNIQUES.... There're SO MANY books which would give you self-help on how to CONTROL your temper... If it really means so much for you to control it, READ all about them and be DILLIGENT in practising them... It's YOUR LIFE, nothing really comes free.. You've got to WORK for what you wanna achieve...? In the end, it'll be YOURS to benefit...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  Some of the techniques you'll come to learn might be MORE USEFUL for you while othrs might not... Try to weigh for yourself...? But don't give up totally on them so easily because you won't know what you might be MISSING...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Good luck with that for now...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">&gt;<br></div>

With that, I offer you... My e-mail address Devil1976sg@yahoo.com which you can write to me with... OR if you deem it better if you wanna chat with me over the phone or even see me in person one day (perhaps at a later stage...?) please do let me know too....?<br><br>Some things which you should try doing meanwhile...?<br><br>1. Yes... You're reckless and you're fearless &amp; you thought you can fight this 'monster' within yourself which you can't see...? Well... Guess what...? Everytimes you want so much to SEE it, you're only giving it more STRENGTH.... Seems like since you've got so much trouble controlling your mind... (thanks so much to the alcohols and medications you taking..) You should CONDITION your body... Ever heard that being a vegetarian would help control your temper...? Well.. Ain't exactly... But it does work INDIRECTLY...? I'm not asking you to become a vegeterian here... But you can begin by taking more PLAIN drinks like H20... More fruits and vegetables... Don't eat too much unnecessary food (especially high energy ones...)... Don't OVEREXERCISE yourself... Enough is enough... Don't be to physically active.... Just enough to keep yourself healthy..? UNTIL you learn to CONTROL this MIND of yours.... With DISCIPLINE...? So a little discipline to start with in all activities suggested would bring you a LONG way to come...?<br><br>2. Learn to LOVE. Not asking you to find another girl to love or go back to the old one... But LOVING the people around you... The world you live in and YOURSELF.... YES.. You have EVERY REASON to HATE them, but that DOESN'T mean you don't have any reason to LOVE them...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Once you've learnt this well, ANGER has no reason to be with you.. Not to mention a chance to display its 'abilities'...?<br><br>3. Work on TECHNIQUES.... There're SO MANY books which would give you self-help on how to CONTROL your temper... If it really means so much for you to control it, READ all about them and be DILLIGENT in practising them... It's YOUR LIFE, nothing really comes free.. You've got to WORK for what you wanna achieve...? In the end, it'll be YOURS to benefit...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  Some of the techniques you'll come to learn might be MORE USEFUL for you while othrs might not... Try to weigh for yourself...? But don't give up totally on them so easily because you won't know what you might be MISSING...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Good luck with that for now...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">&gt;<br></div></blockquote>Thank you... I will try some of ur advise and let you know the outcome.</div>

I don wan to hurt each other anymore. Anyway, ur words are very inspiring. I will take up ur challenge and cure this freaking temper of mine. I will quit smoking but now if I don drink I cannot sleep... I do not wan to take relaxant or sleeping pills anymore.<br><br>And yes. I fight and is v aggressive but I'm not a coward. I cannot fight against the unseen. But I will try. I don need to win her back or prove anything. I jus need to be a better person. If I'm lame I wouldn't even be in the relationship. Too many things has happened for me to type here... even her fds say ke xi but who cares now? I cannot tink bout patching up wif her or I'll be stuck forever. I wan to move on.</div></blockquote>I respect your decision in moving on. If you know what is best for you and you calulated - you have all the rights to make the decisions. In relationship and love - if you both are meant to be together, you will be, regardless of how far the distance, how long the time. You want to improve yourself, to strive on forward for a better tomorrow, without her in the picture - you earn my admiration.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1st Stage:</span></strong><br><br>You mentioned you will stop smoking - eventually after some time, tell yourself that you will go sleep 'that' day without alcohol. It is like a pit you are inside - you have all the time to remain there and you have all the power to get out from there.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2nd Stage: </span></strong><br><br>After ceasing all these smoking and drinking - for guys, I advice you to invest your time into training your physique. Drain your energy into your work, studies and extra time to the gym or exercising. It will only shape yourself with better bod, you will also use all this restless energy into something.<br><br>Things to do or watch out everyday.<br><br>In any situations when you got to look at the mirror, <strong>MENTALLY talk to yourself</strong> that you will succeed in the attempt to improve yourself. Throw in words of encouragement to yourself before you leave the loo/toliet.<br><br>When people stir the anger in you, don't reply to them first, hold ten seconds before replying. If it is things like bad customers service - learn to communicate like a gentleman to get your message across. 'I wan to see your manager, etc'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If people is looking for trouble and lure you into picking a fight with him. Pause, look at him, and tell him this.<br><br>"<strong>If you can hit me, I won't hit you back, because I am not going to degrade myself. The most we can go to the police</strong>.'<br><br>Cease using vulgarities - limited yourself to only F.U.C.K. in extremely case. Genitals calling or summoning of parents to quarrel spolits images and increase your heat of anger.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>When people say things that brew this temper - <strong>ALWAYS PAUSE 5 to 10 SECONDS </strong>before answering. It gives you time to think and react in better position.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Not reacting to hostility, with brains, trains your character - reacting in the wrong way makes you a loser.<br><br>Cheers<strong></strong></div>
