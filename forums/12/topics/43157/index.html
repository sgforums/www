            <div class='col-md body'>Dan, Greg, me were good friends.<br>Dan is good looking. Greg has ways with girls. Joyce is the same school as Dan. She is so adorable that almost everyone sees her, like her.<br>Alan is Dan's cousin. He is quite a bastard from my point of view.<br>Dan's dad is a Big time gangster, so big that "zhongs" have to give him face. I used to respect him, but now....<br><br>Dan found Joyce, and like her. Joyce had a boyfriend but had breakup. Then they had sex but they were never boyfriend and girlfriends. Dan then introduces Joyce to Greg and I. After a while Joyce patch back with her boyfriend and didn't contact us anymore.<br><br>Months later, when Greg was at home, he call Dan over to his house and happen to talk about Joyce. Then they invite Joyce over to Greg's house. When Dan's sleeping, Greg and Joyce fell in love or something. Then they did something close to sex. Dan didn't know.<br><br>The next few days Greg and Joyce have been meeting each otherÂ’s and they had sex. Greg wants to tell Dan about it but did not know how.<br><br>One day, when Greg, Dan, and Alan went to Ktv. Greg asked Dan, do you like Joyce?<br>Dan: Â“ai ya, now got no girl to fark, try to get lar."<br>Greg: Â“So have you got her?Â”<br>Dan: Â“Hard to get lor.Â”<br>Greg: Â“You know why? Cause you lousy!Â”<br>Dan: Â“You try lar!Â”<br>Greg: Â“If I get how?Â”<br>Dan: Â“You can get you get lor.Â”<br>Greg: Â“You say one ar.Â”<br>Dan: Â“YA!Â”<br>Greg: Â“Okay I fark her already.Â”<br>Dan: Â“Ya right.Â”<br>Greg: Â“She even gam my lanjiao all this already.Â”<br>Dan remained silent and nods his head. He decided not to pursue this matter but this conversation was over heard by overheard Alan.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alan went to tell Dan's dad and Dan's dad went to ask Dan, is it true that Greg stole Joyce from you. Dan was shocked that his dad knows about this.<br><br>Dan's dad and Alan keeps bringing it up and it seems to be affecting Dan. Influenced by their words Dan begin to feel angry, sad and as if Greg really stole Joyce from Dan. Dan's dad then asked Dan to call Joyce to over to their house.Then Dan's dad said that he want to talk to Joyce in private and they did.<br><br>The next day, Joyce called Greg and said: Â“You go and tell around to everyone that you fark me all this already is it?Â” Greg explained to Joyce that all he wants is just to let Dan know and he admitted that the way he put it is wrong but he only told Dan. Alan is the one who overheard and goes around telling.<br><br>That night, I went to meet both of them. At that time I know nothing, but I know something was going on. We all went to DanÂ’s house. I manage to dig out everything from Joyce and I felt sad hearing from her. Joyce cried to me and said: Â“ I feel like a biatchÂ… Greg and Dan 13years friendshipÂ… I spoil it allÂ… and now I even got something to do with Dan's dadÂ… I really donÂ’t want! I really donÂ’t want all this things to happen one.Â” She told me that Dan's dad wanted to teach Greg a lesson but Dan and Joyce stopped him. She also told me that Dan's dad says that Greg is spoiling her reputation by telling everyone; if he loves you he should care about that. I asked her what happened and what did Dan's dad do to you but she refused to tell me.<br><br>The next day, Dan's dad ask Joyce to go to their house for drinking but Joyce seems afraid so I followed her till morning, then I left for tuition. After I finished my tuition, I call her and she told me that the moment I left, his dad asked her to the room. I felt bad so I apologies, but she said: Â“If got thing happen also happened already lor.Â” From my point of view is that nothing happen that day but something had already happened. I suspect that Dan's dad fark Joyce by using his power and threatened to beat up Greg if she doesnÂ’t.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now all Joyce is asking just Greg &amp; Dan back together. I think that sheÂ’s the most painful in the game. But that will not happen because Greg &amp; Dan is trying to get her. She didnÂ’t intent to get attached after all this things had happen. She just wants to remain as friends and forget about the sad things.<br><br>I donÂ’t know how to help her too. She doesnÂ’t tell me maybe because itÂ’s a shameful thing to a girl. And even if I want to help, that have to be revealed and it sure will make her feel sad.<br><br>Even she tells me and allows me to do something, there's another problem. Dan's mother had passed away, now his dad is his only kin. Dan knows nothing about this and he always thinks his dad as a great one. He and his dad's relationship will be broken.<br><br>Alan said that GregÂ’s the one spoiling her reputation but what I feel is that Alan is the one who is spreading it around.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hinted to him before. But heÂ’s like you worry what? HeÂ’s with my father. Then I said I only trust my friends. Then he said donÂ’t be ridiculous lar, adults are more sensible than us. Then I said if anything happen to her when you are around I first one come and find you. Then he thought I like her. He said you her who? Guardian huh?<br><br>Something important here. I do not know what Joyce and his dad do together because she refuses to tell me. These are only what I presume. I canÂ’t do anything unless she really tells me.<br><br>We have no prove too. In the Law, if you are raped, you are not suppose to change and bath. That will remove the evidence. And if itÂ’s a threaten, and she did not resist at that time, we will have no case.<br><br>Seems like a die die situration.<br>By the way IF it's time to end this, how to delete this forum?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Finally, I see the story and how this story evolve into such a lame scene and let me tell you this frankly - this whole damn thing is because of a girl, who is not only immature, but rather foolish. Let me do an analysis for you and I am sorry, but I feel that the heat of furiousness is brewing - <strong>I will be frank and firm</strong>.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br><strong>'Dan and Joyce have sex and was never gf/bf' </strong>- this statement already spoke much of Joyce's character and I wouldn't elaborate any further.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>'Then they invite Joyce over to Greg's house. When Dan's sleeping, Greg and Joyce fell in love or something. Then they did something close to sex. </strong>' - This statement further confirm my above comment. You said Joyce was so aborable everyone sees her likes her, and I don't understand why she would be so easy with herself. Well, in the end, its all boils down your own childhood psychology and karmic relations.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>'The next few days Greg and Joyce have been meeting each otherÂ’s and they had sex. Greg wants to tell Dan about it but did not know how.' </strong> - from here, a third confirmation of Joyce easy nature and one new point: Greg is such poor friends. Seriously speaking, would anyone fark their own good friend's (13 years eh?) potential gf, crush, or gf? If so, Dan needs to look at him from other angles. I don't believe in years of friendship = better as it ages. I believe in how the friend conduct himself with him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The reason why Greg would claim that Joyce bj him is because of men ego. I was in a guy school for 10 years and understand every single bit of that part. All part of guys talk.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Alan and Dan's daddy is such an extra. Seriously speaking - what the hell does it got to do with them. People always try to get involve in one another's relationship problem and ended up laming this whole issue.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>And I don't believe this: After so much happening, all she was crying about is that Gerg and Dan's friendship is falling because of her and she felt that she was a b|tch because of that. OH MY GOD! Didn't she realise that the ROOT of the problem was because she was so farking easy with herself? If I was her, I would slap the hell out of Gerg and destory all contacts with him. Its ok when one is easy with her body (if she was the willing party) - but integrity, one has to protect.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>'Dan's dad ask Joyce to go to their house for drinking'  </strong> - obviously, even in my preception something was wrong and his dad's character &amp; motive leave much room for questioning.  As a friend, how can you even leave her in a lurch and left for tution? You must bring her out too! Isn't she your friend too?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>This scenario - has come so complicated is of lust. She(4) zhi(4) tou(2) shang(4) yi(4) ba(3) dao(1). (Direct translation: Lust is like knife hanging above head.)<br><br>Advice?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>She is the source and root of all problem: She cannot be use to solve this crisis. She needs to avoid all these people. Before avoiding - she must either write a letter explaining everything to Dan and Gerg about her decision OR meet them (IN PUBLIC PLACES AND NOT IN EACH OTHER HOUSE FOR GOD SAKE - Oh no, I am screaming because she is so naive.) and spoke to them (not together, but as individuals)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>You as a friend, you have to watch over her and MAKE sure she don't go over to their houses and especially any form of meeting for Dan's daddy. And do you know that all these happening is sufficient for you to dial 999 and scream rape at the Dan's dad face if our preception of his motive is true? Of course, she didn't say a word about it and therefore no point to dial either. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>She hope that the both of them can patch back their friendship? Can... but she must disappear because her appearance will bound to trigger memories and resentment. Take action as soon as possible - use all woman's tactics of avoiding - I am sure she will know how.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: The profit from a girl is often an expense of a friendship.... - CloUdiSm -<br><br>Cheers</div>

Then she also defended, Â“Dan also not my stead lor. IÂ’m not attach also lor. Why canÂ’t I have sex with Gerg? Why must I be under his control?Â”<br><br>Well actually I don't think she's cheap or what lar. These things happen in monthÂ’s lor.

But this time I think He's serious. He's had only done so much for a girl before in the past. He makes a card, which can pop up when opened, for her. I had never seen him like this before in the past. He usually flirts.<br><br>I asked Dan before, Â“If you really like her why did you tell Greg can fark fark lor all this?Â” But this is what he tells me, Â“You know Greg one lor, he will always disturb me when I am serious with girl one lor. I donÂ’t want to be disturbed by him thatÂ’s why I say those words one lor. (We used to say never be serious with girl, will spoil relationship and burn yourself.) You know I donÂ’t mean it one lor. I just say it for face only lor.Â”<br><br>I also scolded Greg before but this is what he tells me, Â“It takes two hands to clap lor. If she doesnÂ’t let me do anything, I also cannot force her one what. I tell you, Dan doesnÂ’t like Joyce one, he just want to snatch with me only lor. You tell me lar, if you like someone, will you still go and Â“poo charboÂ”?Â”<br></div>
