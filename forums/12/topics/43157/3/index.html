But perhaps she really knows what she's doing EXCEPT that you're not quite getting her side of the picture.... Anyway, just an ASSUMPTION.... Based on a few of the simple facts.... Tell me she's a CANCER and I'll say that's a BONUS FACT....<br><br>Dan, his dad, Alan &amp; Greg... I don't know much about them... Someone said something about his dad taking advantage of things... Was it you or who...? CALIBRE of Dan's dad and Alan.... Though it's not a guarantee that they're wiser than you but in terms of EXPERIENCE I bet they have PLENTY.... Do NOT mess around with FIRE. Matched with their BACKGROUND, you're BETTER off standing FAR... Or you might end up 'dead' without even knowing what happened....<br><br>In time to come you might be seeing more of the picture...
