Before avoiding - she must either write a letter explaining everything to Dan and Gerg about her decision OR meet them (IN PUBLIC PLACES AND NOT IN EACH OTHER HOUSE FOR GOD SAKE - Oh no, I am screaming because she is so naive.) and spoke to them (not together, but as individuals)<br><br>You as a friend, you have to watch over her and MAKE sure she don't go over to their houses and especially any form of meeting for Dan's daddy. And do you know that all these happening is sufficient for you to dial 999 and scream rape at the Dan's dad face if our preception of his motive is true? Of course, she didn't say a word about it and therefore no point to dial either.  </strong><br><br>It's very hard for her not to meet them. As I say she's too softhearted, so soft that <strong>IF</strong> I say things like, Â“You never go out with me today... I felt so lonely.Â” She will feel so bad till she want to cry then go out with you whole day, paying everything for you and apologies the whole day! Imagine, if they say things like, Â“I really miss you all this.Â” SheÂ’ll be melted. Some more same class as Dan. If he asked why avoid me, do you know how much pain IÂ’m getting when I donÂ’t see you all this, she will sure go. She can even try to forget what his dad done to her (I donÂ’t know what); I really donÂ’t know how to help. I canÂ’t be 24hours with her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am so <strong>utterly disgusted </strong>by how she could reply you. Let me ask you one question: How old are all these people? My advice is to wash your hands on her unless you are her good friends. Because:<br><br>I) In the first place, her personal valves are in the bins. She couldn't see that the problem in this damn issue is because she is so easy with herself. Woman that bu zi ai (self love) will never find a man who loves her truely, because such woman ain't worthy of such man's love (Psychological explaination - I getting to pissed to type it down.)   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>Â“You canÂ’t put all the blame on me lor. For girls they donÂ’t get as horny as guys lor. ItÂ’s only when guys touch that part then we will what one lor.Â” </strong> - You know, when woman come sleeping with guys and come up with REALLY poor excuses like this: it really speaks volumes of their moral and social ethics and it goes way down like a plunging plane.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>IÂ’m not attach also lor. Why canÂ’t I have sex with Gerg? Why must I be under his control?Â” </strong> - WHY CAN'T SHE SLEEP WITH GERG? Of course she can... *ahem* cheap *ahem *wh0re*. Come on, Iori let me ask you something very frankly: You do respect woman whom you pick from the bar, etc? Respect as in the way you give to your TRUE LOVE - the girl you loved most in your life (No neccessary Gf). HELL NO RIGHT?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You think any girl next door will go around sleeping with other guys and ask WHY they can't? Its their life and they have all the right too, well, since I am analysising this situation for you - You <strong>have </strong>to understand this point: The cause of this whole issue is because she is so easy with herself (Repeating for a thousand times and still repeating.)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>I asked Dan before, Â“If you really like her why did you tell Greg can fark fark lor all this?Â” But this is what he tells me, Â“You know Greg one lor, he will always disturb me when I am serious with girl one lor. I donÂ’t want to be disturbed by him thatÂ’s why I say those words one lor. (We used to say never be serious with girl, will spoil relationship and burn yourself.) You know I donÂ’t mean it one lor. I just say it for face only lor.Â”<br>I also scolded Greg before but this is what he tells me, Â“It takes two hands to clap lor. If she doesnÂ’t let me do anything, I also cannot force her one what. I tell you, Dan doesnÂ’t like Joyce one, he just want to snatch with me only lor. You tell me lar, if you like someone, will you still go and Â“poo charboÂ”?Â” </strong><br><br>Lame... lame and so lame. Iori, one warning for you, you will do better without them man.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>And the part of her softhearted thing: she wants to listen all the sweet talks they do to get her to bed, etc - let her. Iori you have done enough as a friend and the problem lies within her. My warning and caution for you is that Dan and Gerg are poor friends -if possible always keep an eye about them. As for Joyce, do what you can and after you did what you can and she is still like that (I don't want to explain what-with-the-like-that) - LEAVE HER and let her be.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Experience will be her best teacher and True love will be a myth to her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

I donÂ’t think I should tolerate such things.<br><br>As for Greg, I will not leave him. So far he had not attacked me or stab me in the back before. JoyceÂ… I usually choose me friend and IÂ’ve accepted her as a friendÂ… I will not take back my words or ignore her unless, she do something bad to me. I believe she have her reasons and painÂ… If sheÂ’s a b|tch and heÂ’s a bastaÂ®d, then they are my b|tch and bastaÂ®d friends.<br><br>Once a friend, forever a friend, I will keep it in that way unless they stab me in the back. I accept what they are, forgive what they had done, accept their opinions and views, and go through their pain with them, defend the negatives way people look at them because I feel for them, never asking for much in returnÂ… I may be a fool but at least in this way, I didnÂ’t let anyone down. This is the way I make friends and these are how important friends are to me.<br><br>WellÂ… now, both of them are my only true friends. Maybe that is why I donÂ’t want to lose them. ItÂ’s hard to find friends, who will really take you as friendsÂ… In the past, I had experience them, the girl friends will treat me good but actually, they treat me like this for the liking and love. The guy friends will treat you good but actually, they treat me like this just for the fun and company. They back stab when they had found others, they gossip when you are not aroundÂ… even my birthday, when I think for them, booking a restaurant for them, asking them to tell me in advance if they canÂ’t come but yet, they give lame excuse. Oh I canÂ’t find the placeÂ… bla bla bla.<br><br>All I ask is just Â“be true to friends,Â” but they canÂ’t do it. They will look at people at colour, wealth, studies, looks and statusÂ… I just hope now is that Greg and Joyce are not people like this. As for her, IÂ’ll try to do as much as I can.</div></blockquote>Damn!

I am not saying that you must give up this friendship, rather to take a second look and to see things more than the surface when it comes to fishy issues around them. You are a good friend and fiercely loyal, but not neccessary they are to you.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>If sheÂ’s a b|tch and heÂ’s a bastaÂ®d, then they are my b|tch and bastaÂ®d friends.</blockquote>*Claps* However, I have a modification to it. If they are my good friends, I will change them and if over the time I failed to, most likely this good friendship will revert to causal friends. It takes one to know one; I will not stand by and just accept plainly - going by my nature, probably I will nag them to death.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>One piece of advice: You can't seek for true friends - it comes to you naturally.

You can't defend someone who is really the cause of this trouble can you? Because you just have no stand to. Don't be just a honest woodhead - be witty and adaptable.
