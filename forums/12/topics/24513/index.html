You can continue to help her as a friend 1st and the same time let her haf a better opinion of u. The reason maybe y she dun accept u is maybe of a past relationship or crush that left her bad memories. Give her time and im sure she will slowly get to knoe and accept u.

Thats all. But once u cross that, u can do it. The first step is the hardest and that is to tell her how u feeeel towards her. Trust me, u wun wanna regret confessing your feelings cause when u confess at least u know u either pass of failed but if u dun, u will alwaz be thinking and sleeping on the thought whether or not she likes u or not. Be a man, go tell her. U wun regret it.<br><br>I once confessed my feelings for some girl i liked but she rejected me in a friendly way that our friendship got better after that cause we set out our direction of our friendship in which it should go, we talked well and good that friends betw us would be good enough and i really appreciated that cause i am now a closer friend to her and she actually thanked me for that cause she was really too shy to tell me she was interested in me as a fren only(sometimes we guys too thick-headed to sense!). It realised alot of social tension betw us and it felt much better. Be truthful and speak from the heart.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Seventh_Signs:</div><div class="quote_body">got a problem  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> hope everyone can give me a good suggestion<br>PLSSSSSSS!!!!<br><br>i know a girl for going 4 years... she always part of my life...<br>i chase her before rejected before<br>i tried to forget her before<br>i remember her again..<br>we are such close friends that even we are not lovers we still are good friends.. but i just want to tell her really love her..<br>i can stop thinking of her.. i smile i cry i laff angry over her...<br>i want to protect her for life which it never occurs to me to any other girls.<br><br>i was thinking even it cost me a life time i am willing to love her deep...<br>she is a good girl.. caring, sweet, and my mind is blank now...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> .. she is too lovely  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br>p.s she is not consider pretty type...<br>i alway feel that she is lack of love... but why wont she let me come to her life?<br><br>we are both 21 .. she owns her own shop... recently i help her out.. i feel so happy to watch her work.. help her keep her shop and buying her lunch and dinner watch her eat, when her business issit that good .. i feel sad very sad..i wanted to help her but then .. even think of save money open account for her..  maybe when she needs i can really help her...<br><br>... yah i feel i am abit stupid over alot of things maybe i still not familar with the stock in and out.. where to place it...<br><br>well i am going to ns soon . i know my allowance will be super low.. maybe i can choose to sign on something.... but really scare of losing her.. but i know i wont lost her as a friend.. but sometimes i really want more.. even go thru the red carpet... this is my fantasy or is this my reality...  i am a very responsible person.. up to now i never give up things easy even i own it i treasure it..<br><br>i really believe this love for her is very pure.<br><br>ps: joan if u see this but i know u wont..<br>... remember i make u a promise...my promise never meant to be broken..<br>when you need someone i will always be by your side..<br><br></div></blockquote>You mentioned that you're scared of losing her after you've gone for your NS, but not as a friend...? But just to remind you again, since when have you been more than a friend to her....? (As you've revealed it...)<br><br>It doesn't matter if you're a responsible guy, it doesn't matter if you're willing to do alot for her, and that your <span style="font-style: italic;">love</span> for her is very pure...? It all <span style="font-style: italic;">doesn't really matter</span>..... What matters of much concern now would be what she wants? No point giving someone a branded watch if she doesn't need a watch, a delicious meal when she's all full...? Abides by her ways as you're playing her game now..... Even though you know that you might end up with nothing... Even though it <span style="font-style: italic;">might</span> be hurt in return....<br><br>If <span style="font-style: italic;">lady's luck</span> was not on your side, situation <span style="font-style: italic;">seems</span> like it sure isn't much so now that you're heading for your NS....? Do you think you can really change her heart...? Only she can tell, if she bother to notice...?</div>
