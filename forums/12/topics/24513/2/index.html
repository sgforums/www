Ever heard of how people are always having problems with their relationship when the guy is going NS...? Talk about a YOUNG and WEAK relationship....? And what's more yours...? I guess you can say that it's a blissing in disguise that your relationship with her is not starting now... What a torment and a CHALLENGE that would be...? A young plant which just meet the storm and hardly make it to the next summer...?<br><br>Why don't you.... Take this opportunity to nurture and STRENGTHEN your relationship with her instead...? Though there're no 'official certificates' to announce you bf and gf, but that doesn't make <span style="font-style: italic;">love</span> any less of a significance anyway? (If it exist...) Think of it this way... If you're meant to be together, this 3 years or so would be a great time of bringing you CLOSER to each other... (with all the difficulties piled up between you and her &amp; more time to miss each other?) If you're not meant to be and 'force starting' this relationship would only mean that this 3 years' gonna tear your relationship apart and DESTROY EVERYTHING(?) between you and her.... LOST, PAIN for you, HURTING your LOVE one.... Worth it? Think about it....<br><br>Somehow I've got a 'hinch' that she might wanna concentrate on her business for now....? (Just a 'hinch', not on any logical basis..) Is she the ONLY child? Is her family experiencing much financial problem..? Is she quite close to her parents or at least love them alot...?<br><br>Additionally move (take it slow and easy ok...?) you can make within this 3 years... If her parents are comfortable with you, perhaps you can talk to them more often and learn more about the 'situation' for this girl of yours...?<br><br>3 years... I bet you're one of the closer person with her now..? Being unattached might signifies that she would like to concentrate on something else (her business, her career?) or perhaps have no interest in you.... Take the '3 years' plan' and see how things go? If she falls for another within this 3 years it just mean that she feel nothing more than the obvious for you... Don't be discouraged? This is just the way Life goes, moreover LOVE...? If she remains UNATTACHED, HIGH CHANCE is her mind is PRE-OCCUPIED with something...<br><br>CONCLUSION: Take things easy but don't let go (unless you want to?). The fact that you're helping her out in her business is a PLUS. Her parents might have shown concern for her future (relationship), but she's more concerned with something else. 3 years after NS should make you a more mature guy. Take this chance to strengthen the 'TIES' between you and her (and her parents too?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) Hopefully when stars shift for her, it'll be more obvious for you? Have an OPEN HEART about it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

He said,<br>"Boy, you might not understand, but a long, long time ago,<br>Grandma's daddy didn't like me none, but I loved your Grandma so."<br><br>We had this crazy plan to meet and run away together.<br>Get married in the first town we came to, and live forever.<br>But nailed to the tree where we were supposed to meet, instead<br>Of her, I found this letter, and this is what it said:<br><br>If you get there before I do, don't give up on me.<br>I'll meet you when my chores are through;<br>I don't know how long I'll be.<br>But I'm not gonna let you down, darling wait and see.<br>And between now and then, till I see you again,<br>I'll be loving you.  Love, me.<br><br>I read those words just hours before my Grandma passed away,<br>In the doorway of a church where me and Grandpa stopped to pray.<br>I know I'd never seen him cry in all my fifteen years;<br>But as he said these words to her, his eyes filled up with tears.<br><br>If you get there before I do, don't give up on me.<br>I'll meet you when my chores are through;<br>I don't know how long I'll be.<br>But I'm not gonna let you down, darling wait and see.<br>And between now and then, till I see you again,<br>I'll be loving you.  Love, me.<br>Between now and then, till I see you again,<br>I'll be loving you.  Love, me.</div>
