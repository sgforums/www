              <p>My wife has been "detained" by her 2 brothers since Saturday 24 Sept.</p>
              <p>They had brought her for SOKA chantting sessions at Tampines. But had decided not to bring her home thereafter. They had  decided to let her continue chantting at his house in Hougang Ave 8</p>
              <p>I have asked for police assistance on 2 occasions on Saturday 24 and Sunday 25. But the police would only say that she had told them that she had wanted to stay on.</p>
              <p>They did not allow me or any members of my family to talk to her.</p>
              <p>Now the brothers had brought my wife to issue a PPO on me for violence on a certain day and time. But it is not true. I really cannot understand how she can swear on oath to the judge for the said violence when her NRIC is still at home.</p>
              <p>The brothers are just trying to break up my family. Is this such a SOKA behaviour. It seems like they are trying to get us divorced and then perhaps enjoy the gains from my wife.</p>
              <p>My wife has early dementia symptons. Are they trying to take advantage of the situation.</p>
              <p>Please help me.</p>
              <p>I understand the other brother is an insurance agent from AVIRA in River Valley. which is perhaps why he is initiating all these</p>
              <p>I have tried to seek help from all various channels but no avail.</p>
              <p>They feel that I have been "fierce" to my wife. Such excuse is an intrusion into my personal life. We are in our 50s and have been married for more than  30 years with 2 graduate children. We are retired.</p>

              <p>TS, since we only get the partial truth from you, i believe we can only offer you advise based on what you said which may not eventually help u. I believe you should clarify Hermit's question as i feel that it does make sense.</p>
              <p>Since we do not have the full facts yet, i believe we shld not word lash TS first and blame him for everything that had happened since we do not have any prove of who's right and who's wrong. Probably we shld stay objective on this issue if we wld sincerely like to help TS.</p>

              Right or wrong is always subjective n situational/cirumstantial.  most of all what is expected of the other is usually the cause of such emotional turmoil and chaos. It is so very easy to lambast anyone without being in her/his shoes and worse still not bring privy to events or ... that culminated in these state of affairs.
              Self-honesty is the only panacea and it presupposes that one is willing to face up to one's ....

              <p>As I have said. My wife is suffering from dementia. All I want

              <p>Due to her dementia,I never let my wife do housework. Yes, I
              wash, clean up the house, do the laundry, wash, clean up the
              toilets and the kitchen after every meal. Sweep the house, up &amp;
              downstairs. She just only prepare simple dish and watch TV. I also
              prepare breakfast for her. </p>

              from prevention of and coping with dementia, to the impact of diet and

              <p>Ya, actually, I suggested to change to Angel Agony, but mods insist to carry on, so be it. Good that you make a remark here, at least to prove I am not wrong after all.</p>
              <p>As I said again, stupid old man, how on earth is the court going to award yr wife a PPO went she has dementia, she dun even be fit to attend court, not to mention a libel suit.</p>
