            <div class='col-md body'>This sounds like my experience with my ex... I was like the guy, not willing to accept changes in the relationship and in the end ruined everything...<br><br>I think that you should try to ask him out to have a heart to heart talk. Try to let him understand that love, is never smooth sailing... there will always be conflicts and these conflicts are there for the two of you to resolve together so as to go a level higher in your relationship. Maybe he is still young and have the idea that love MUST be sweet and never bitter. So that when he found that things are not the way they "should be", he starts to steer away from you... and i see that he is trying to avoid speaking his heart. However, if he is still unwilling to speak up... i think it is better for you to let him go and move on...<br><br>Its good that you are sensible enuff to learn how to give him his own space...<br><br>Wish you luck on your effort to revive your relationship  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear |Uv`-f|UtE-`<br><br>You never mentioned much about why did your ex left you (or you left them) and my guess would be that its takes two to clap. (Mutually contribution).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>From your post, your words, it sprout alot of emotions in it and basically how you feel in this entire relationship. I noticed when things happen and you always tell yourself that it was your fault (although it is, partially) - and you always try to change.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Your official unsubconscious, psychological problem comes from the weak foundation, the both of you had before coming into this relationship. Few days later after you knew him and come together? What much can you possibly know about him? You may ask why - let me tell you this thing: <strong>A relation easily gotten, is a relation easily lost.</strong> There must be a precise balance between advancing and taking your time to know someone during the period of courtship. When in doubt - always choose the latter option.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Your third paragraph speaks about your jealousy - which in fact, I believed, has always been there since your first love. Then you had a minor crush on someone and felt gulity? The guilt should comes only if you DID something practical and not just because the feeling just come - you cant control your feelings, and you recongise it as a crush. So be it, unneccessary for guilt and the promise to remain faithful to him till the end of time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You missed you guy and wants to spend every single available time with him. CloUdiSm remix III - Posessivess is like sealing a candle in a jar - eventually, the candle flame will snuff out and dies. This time round you failed to see and understand why this has turn to such a major route - your possessive has made you see as in...<br><br><strong>(the guy) cope with the pressure in his work and pacify her off work , it must have been tiring for him. It was solely her fault , she blamed herself for it. </strong><br><br>Empathy and understanding is there - but the real source of problem is invisible to your eyes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Your fifth paragraph has alot of hidden meaning and now I am going<br>analysis for you: Your womanly instinct told you that the relationship will drift when he has to work continuously for two weeks. Let me ask you this simple question instead of pushing it to another girl existence or work, etc - what has causes him to do that? Everything happens for a reason. When things happened, you swear to everything every single aspect for the sake of him - no guys in the end will appreciate, trust me. Because you have changed far too much and it isn't the same old you, just like when you mentioned that he wasn't the same as before.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You don't CHANGE for the sake of someone - you improve the situation, while retaining much of yourself. From your post - it is obvious that you always sink into unstability mode and trying all your best to please him. In love - both of you has to work it out. In the first place, he did - you recongise it and appreciate, thats good. However, in the end, your fear of losing him overwhelms every single rational sense - its dangerous to a relation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>He mentioned he like a girl and in the end he said it was just to test your feelings for him? What an excuse - come on, can't chase that girl then throw in such lame excuse to get back on his present relation? Your anger is justified - but then again, your fear of losing in comes in - things you are suppose to trash out - you din, things ain't, you did excessively.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Let me tell you this: after this incident, it would be a turning point of your life. He has shown to you what he is capable of doing - you further lose yourself. You seen how drastic this relationship declines - you questioned him and discovered your worst nightmare - he kept things from you (Hint that this relationship is doom - trust department destroyed.) And guess what? Because of the fear of losing him - you ACCEPT the change in him - you are killing this relationship with your own hands, but wishes him to do go back? Tell him, trash it out with him? Why didn't? Fear of losing him? *The more such essential things you wouldn't say - the likelihood this relationship would decline*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>If I was you - I would throw my last coin in trashing the right things with him and not unneccessary stuff that you know he wouldn't say "why have you change so much? etc' Well, if he does change, in the first place, you think he will tell you about it when it happens? I believe that honesty plays an essential role - without it - this relationship just lost is main pillar to stand.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>He likes another 2 girls. TWO GIRLS? Open your eyes to see your present bf - he wasn't the same old guy anymore. There is no reason for this relationship anymore - feelings disappeared, past hurts accumulates and explodes, essential elements gone. Even if he gets back to you, how can you run a car without its fuel and wheels? How can you build a house without the equipments and the materials?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>"A boyfriend to her is someone who is going to share her happiness and sadness , someone whom she love with all her heart , someone who is willing to lend her a listening ear. He has to be the guy that gives her a whole new sense of direction in life which makes her feels like the most wonderful person in the world to have him. And that no matter how sad or sorrow she is , whenever she looks into his eyes and sees his wonderful smile will make her worries disappear. Not forgetting , someone she can trusts , be affectionate and committed to." </strong><br><br>P.S: To source for the correct guy - never enter into a relation in just mere days or weeks. Get to know someone better. You are easily hurt, but understand why you already have 5 bfs even thought you ain't very old? There is a need, craving and desire to love and be loved in you. Because of that, you heed strongly on your first instinct (love at first sight, good impression, etc and past memories to substain a relation (he was a good, nice, etc guy in the past) Forget about possessivess and learn the art of communication and not just treat everything as a blame onto yourself and everything. Love is give and take - expecting your own share of rights and not accepting fate as it is.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Btw: Are you Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
