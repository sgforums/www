            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Well , in this story , we have this silly girl ... She is just a simple girl , having an average life. Basically , studying , going for religious activities , being with friends and seeking true love like many other typical singaporean girls. After four failed relationships , she had lose confidence in guys as they had gave her nothing but hurt , leaving deep wounds across her fragile heart.<br>A boyfriend to her is someone who is going to share her happiness and sadness , someone whom she love with all her heart , someone who is willing to lend her a listening ear. He has to be the guy that gives her a whole new sense of direction in life which makes her feels like the most wonderful person in the world to have him. And that no matter how sad or sorrow she is , whenever she looks into his eyes and sees his wonderful smile will make her worries disappear. Not forgetting , someone she can trusts , be affectionate and committed to.<br><br>Two years ago , she met this guy on a special occasion. It was love at first sight for the girl , she was mesmerized by the way he smiles , the way he speaks and his innocence which totally melts her heart. Anyway she manages to get his contact no. , it was the first time that she dares to get a guy's number face to face , especially he was someone she loves. They hit it off  very well and as time goes by , she realised she had fallen head over heels with this guy. A few days later , they were together as an official couple as the guy gave her a chance to love him. This guy was very faithful , trustworthy , someone whom she can rely on which is nothing like the past few relationships of hers. Her life was full of love , care and concern. She vowed never to leave this guy for no matter what happens in the future.<br><br>At the start of the relationship , the couple was really happy , enjoying each other's company and love. However , the girl was very possessive , she was afraid of losing him , she just simply gets jealous so easily that she creates quite a few problems for him. But the gal knew her mistake , therefore , she tries her very best to control her jealousy because she don't wish to create anymore troubles and add on to his burden. She did hurt him as a result of her ignorance and immature ways. When they went out together with their friends , she often left him alone with his own batch of friends as she don't want to be left out of the conversations that her own group of friends are having. She thought that he won't be lonely because he has his own friends to talk to , but she was wrong , he wanted her accompaniment more than anything else. Whenever the girl can't control her jealousy , she will ignored the guy as she does not know how to cope with her feelings. Perhaps this has caused the guy to be tired after some time as he had to coax the girl over and over again , slowly , his love for her started to get weak. She seems to feel it too , hence , decided to ask the guy about this. After his feelings were made known to the girl , she felt so guilty and sorry towards him because she does not have the intention to hurt him repeatedly. There was once she started to have a liking for another guy in her class , it was a minor crush which ended after a few days. Guilt overwhelmed her , she knew that it was terribly wrong to like another guy when she was still with her boyfriend so she told herself never to let any guy enter this relationship from then on. She was to remain committed to the relationship and stays faithful to her boyfriend<br><br>Things began to get better between the both of them but it only lasted for some time. When the guy found a part-time job , she was so happy for him , she even accompanied him to the interview and gave him moral support. Meanwhile , she was concentrating in her 'O' levels examinations , both were busy with their own stuffs but they still make it a point to call each other now and then. After her major exams , they still went out together , enjoying themselves whenever the guy was not working. The girl felt that it was not enough , she felt neglected. Even though she had her friends accompanying her , she still missed the guy a lot , yearning to be with him more then ever. She complained to her guy that he had little time for her , this led to the frequent quarrels and unhappiness. As time passes by , the girl admitted that she was in the wrong after some self-reflections on her part , she apologised. She knew that her guy had to cope with the pressure in his work and pacify her off work , it must have been tiring for him. It was solely her fault , she blamed herself for it.<br><br>About two months later , during January of this year , she started working full-time in suntec city and the time she spent with her guy is even lesser. But she still insisted on finding him every once a week , which was her off day , she did not take into consideration how tired and lethargic she was. The girl was contented even if they could only see each other for a few hours. Her tiredness and stress was being taken away every time her guy smiles at her , showing his concern for her , telling her how much he loved her. He was simply her everything , her pillar of support , her whole world. Without him , she felt as if she was only someone without a soul. After two weeks of working , the girl was told that she had to work continuously for the next two weeks for eleven hours everyday. She was devastated upon hearing this because she knew that it would mean that she had no time for her guy at the mean time. On the other hand , the girl had an stinking instinct that this is putting their relationship at stake. It proved to be correct , they drifted apart and he had fallen for another girl. She felt that her world had collapsed , but she still had some hope that things will get better. At that time , the girl's attitude towards the guy started to change , she felt very very exhausted , hence , started to talk lesser to the guy. The guy talked to her about the changes in her personality , she felt that she was in the wrong so decided to change for the better because of him. She was sure that her job resulted in all this changes so she sacrificed her job in order to save the relationship. On valentine's day , the guy told her that he was just testing her feelings for him and he don't like the other girl at all. She felt so relieved and happy to hear this but anger was also present at the same time. The girl did not tell him about her being angry because she fears that things might get worse.<br><br>However , slowly , things started to change again. While what seems to be a nice guy , turns into a nightmare at times. He had problem controlling his temper. As the girlfriend , the girl tried her best to endure him and be tolerant. The guy seems to have double personality , really really nice at times and very bad-tempered at other. Over a short period of time , he started to change into another person. No more the caring , loving , faithful , loyal , good-tempered guy that he was at the beginning. The girl was extremely upset about this , she questioned him the reason behind this change , but he told her that partly he was influenced by his friends. She gets the feeling that he simply do not want to let her know the truth. After sometimes , she slowly more or less accepted this change in him , she wanted very much for him to be like how he was in the past , hoping that he would change for her , but he accused her for being demanding. The past memories of them being happily together still haunts her now and then. As a result of this , she lost her sleep , her appetite and things began to fall into monotone. He would not listen to her , slowly , the girl felt so dishearten and utterly disappointed. The guy even lied to her on some occasions , she told herself to give him more trust but , again and again , he hurts her deeply , till she lose hope in him. He dealt her another blow by liking two other girls and even went to the extend of telling one of the girls that he likes her. The girl no longer knows if he is still serious about her , she felt miserable , felt that her world has stop revolving. She felt the betrayal even though vows were not made between both of them. This girl only wanted a relationship with commitments , love and concern from the other party. She wanted to be there for the person she loves. All she wanted was the guy to be faithful and loyal to her more then anything else. But sad to say , its not within her control ...<br><br>What can this girl do to save this relationship ? She e-mailed the above story to her guy but he did not seem to want to solve the problems in their relationships. When the girl told him her fears and her insecurity over the phone , he treated it like a joke and started to make some unwanted noises or started to sing. When its time to be serious , he joked around , giving the girl an impression that he did not take what she said seriously. The girl wanted to understand him better but he did not give her the chance to do so.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;"></span>(Guy'S veRsiOn oF tHe sToRy)<br><br>A guy, love's this girl very very much... even after<br>his school being so tired and bored he still happily<br>changes his clothes and went to pick up the girl from<br>her school... despite of waiting long hours out side<br>her school just for the few hours of togetherness, he<br>still willingly went to looked for her having great<br>dinner together even it was a simple one... even the<br>guy was really that tired, he don't mind how far he<br>has to walk from her house to the bus stop and<br>travelled the long distance home lonely as he thought<br>that when the girl is safety reached home,he'll be<br>very happy. often the parents of that girl called him<br>to told him off cause he had been with that girl but<br>he still accepted the scolding but he did not despite<br>of that and leave the girl.<br><br>Soon after, the girl was so nice that she<br>accompanied him to a job interview near the girl's<br>house and the guy did gotten his job. the guy's reason<br>for finding a job so far away from his house and near<br>to the girl's house to work was simply because of a<br>reason. to let the girl able to study and see him when<br>she wants during the guy was working but it came out<br>to be just dreams,the girl only find him only three<br>times and she had never find him there anymore.<br>everyday the guy went to work seeing her not there, he<br>felt so much pain in him just like nails nailing him<br>at his heart but the guy knew that her parents doesn't<br>allow her to go anywhere after school and so the did<br>not ask for more. Soon after that, the girl had<br>finished her 'O' level exams. Being so the girl had<br>complained that he worked and did not have time for<br>her but the guy had still accompany out in the morning<br>even the tiredness he had due to he have to work till<br>11.30pm and because of the far distant from his house,<br>he always reached home at 12.45am or even later but he<br>did not give out any complain and the next day, early<br>in the morning he had to get up from his bed without<br>having enough sleep just to get himself ready and went<br>to look for the girl as the girl wanted... Soon his<br>cca had started and his time was even more packed up.<br>From early in the morning,he have to go to his cca<br>till evening and rushed down to work and the next<br>morning he'll go and look for the girl.even the girl's<br>parents had called to talked to me but He know's that<br>is the most that he could do to please the girl just<br>for the love he had for her. During that time, he<br>starved himself everyday just for the money to buy<br>something for the girl. For every single cents his<br>mother had gave him, he save them all up without even<br>eat a single thing from morning till night only  get<br>to eat the left over food at his work place but he<br>don't mind drinking just plain water to fill the<br>stomach just for the girl he loved. He know that the<br>girl would be hurt cuz he has been starving but due to<br>his poor,that's the only way to get something for the<br>girl. Soon school started, think of the venlentine's<br>day that was coming on the next month, he still<br>continue the starvation while the girl had gotten her<br>job. He always thought of buy a huge bear and a boquet<br>of flowers for her during valentine but he had gotten<br>his hp bills for the previous month and he used all<br>the saving to pay for it and there goes his dream.<br>although it was very sad for him but he didn't tell<br>the girl. He also tries to make the effort to look for<br>her 2 times at her work place. he uses his money that<br>had been saved for the previous day and the day he<br>went to find her to buy some food for her. he also<br>didn't even mind that he reach as early as 6.30pm in<br>the evening wait for her break at 7-7.30 and wait for<br>her there at suntect city doing nothing till she had<br>finished her job at 10pm or 11pm and sent her home<br>while he could have been at home enjoying or taking<br>his rest.<br><br>The girl was also very nice that she went to look<br>for him during her day off every week but at that time<br>he always feels sad as when he goes out with her, he<br>cannot don't have his dinner to save the money for her<br>present as the girl will also don't eat if he did. Due<br>to his big appetite, he always used more then he had<br>been given to eat and everytime he gotten very sad.<br>But he just have to see the girl eat and not starving<br>herself just like him. As time pass, the guy's friends<br>get to know that his girlfriend is working at suntect<br>city and everyday they would tease him of him letting<br>a friend of him saw that he bought rice for her<br>waiting for her outside the shop. Everyone said he was<br>silly to do such thing for a girl. But he did not care<br>so much about it and carry on with it... everyday he<br>just starve and suffers terrible pain but no one knows<br>only himself. Due to his cca was band, he needs lots<br>of air but with empty stomach, he get giddy almost<br>everytime but he did not care so much for it. As soon,<br>he felt that she love him lesser so he made up a lie<br>to test on her if she really love him lesser as she<br>would leave him if that's the case. He is willingly to<br>sacrifice his heart to be shed just for the truth but<br>although the girl said she loves him but she had also<br>said that she had like a guy before... the guy was<br>very sad to know that and started to love her lesser<br>as he never though that she was such a person. in his<br>eyes she was so good... soon he did not went to find<br>her lesser cuz of that but he still insist of giving<br>her that surprise in valentine's day. When that day<br>reached, due to the truth that most of his saving gone<br>to the bill of his hp, he had only left with $50 as<br>that was all the time he had to save that much of<br>money.He then went to buy a bear which cost him $40+<br>but he is willing to do so. With the left money is<br>less then $10 , he added the money he had for dinner<br>on that day just to buy a pink rose which is nice to<br>him.. he then again starve for the day. He then went<br>to look for her at her work place.
