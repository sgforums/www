            <div class='col-md body'>halow xiao peng you,<br><br>to summarise, it means your friend is trying to abandon you right? And you think you cannot click with the clique. And that, worse of all, u look down on your ownself, thinking that her other friends are more capable than you.<br><br>firstly, get rid of your low self-esteem. Who wants to make friend with some1 who always looks gloomy, sad or unhappy?<br>Probably you are right. Some people just cant click with certain people (diff frequency u know?) Start finding new friends. I mean, you cant possibly just have her as your only friend in the school right?<br><br>Or since that you are in her clique, try and mingle more often, find topics to talk...if really you cant fit yourself in, dun force lah..make yourself happier by leaving the group or your friend...<br><br>Happiness is the greatest gift on earth, be it to others or to yourself.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You got quite a situation here with your personal life at the moment, but do not fret over it as it happens to everyone...including me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I understand your dilemma over here...you do not want to lose your best friend to other friends whom you're not close to. Fear of losing a friend whom you can trust and hang around with is indeed terrible as nobody likes to be alone in this world and it's almost like the feeling of betrayal, jealousy and disappointment.<br><br>Friends come and go in our lives, so why does our friendship with our good friends turn sour? The reason is because both us and our friends lived differently, have different priorities in life, have different difficulties/burdens/commitments in life, and of course...different personalities. When two people became friends and come together and walk down the friendship lane, there is always a reason that brings both of them together. Sometimes you'll wonder why he/she is friend with you after being friends for a while...and you search for a reason before you actually admit that person to be your real friend. So...what was the reason that brought the two of you together? If you're confused about this, then "Houston, we got a problem". <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>The reason behind good/best friends is that they both can't live without each other's friendship and knowing that they are at least still real friends even though they don't contact or hang around each other every single moment/opportunity. Oh...and don't use the term best friend unless you want to go after that best friend. Best means only one, so when it is said to the opposite sex, the meaning is changed to "I like you and I want you to know that I'm your 1st runner-up in your queue. So if there's a vacancy in your relationship throne, please let me know." <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Okie..if you have already thought through thoroughly that you die die must own this good friend of yours, here's what you can do. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>I called it "Infiltrate, Take control and Eliminate" Hehehehe.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Infiltrate will not be easy cos her friends will be shooting at you on sight and poisoning her mind like Poison Ivy would. So please make sure you got your extra skin on as it gotta be thick enough to bulldoze into that fellowship of the ring. Since your situation is such, I would suggest an apology is necessary to restore her friendship with you. Do not tell her the truth behind your actions that you're feeling insecure, jealous and you can't live without her. Cos that's going to make you uncool. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Hehehe...I forgot to tell you, you're supposed to be her cool friend once again. And she should at least be thinking of you as such...gracious and cool. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Your friend will of course graciously forgive you and kiss and make up. (If not, maybe you're not a friend to her afterall and should go bang your head against the wall for feeling so bad over it) Although things will be slightly different as you can feel it so, but do not worry about it cos things are going to get better from here on. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Next, you need to blend into her group of friends. Not that difficult if you do take a genuine interest in her friends. The keyword is "Listen" and paying attention. Everyone got their own stories to tell, gossips, sharing news and tips. Do not ask wide-end questions like "What DVDs do you own?" (provided the target is a dvd/movie fan). Because this question is going to force the target to generate so much answers and it's going to give her a headache that's going to put her off after that. Instead, ask specific open-end questions like "What's your favorite DVDs?". &lt;- That's just an example so don't go around asking people that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Once you've blend into her groups of friends, it is time to Take control. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Take control is easy. It involves in organising activities for your good friend and her invalid friends. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> If you have been "Listening" and taking some genuine interest in her friends, you should be able to know what kind of activities would interest them and bind them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Note that participation level need not be 100% as you simply cannot babysit everyone. But please make sure that participation is at least 70-80% provided she has 10 friends. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Keep everyone happy, satisfied, enjoying with some laughter and smiles. (Treat them Happy meals if you really have to) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> And please organise fun activities several times until you're sure that you're undoubtedly their unproclaimed cult leader and recognised friend. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If you have achieved that level...well, you're already a queen among them isn't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Although it's time for Eliminate and Elimination of your former enemies, I won't tell you how you're going to do that. So..do that at your own discretion ok? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If you can do half of what I'll advised...you won't lose your good friend. But even if you decided not to do any of those, you can still salvage your friendship. Afterall, she's just a phone call away isn't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>You see, friendship and relationship are similar in some sense. Both have to be voluntarily...and that's is a very important key. Both have to be interested to becoming each other's friend to begin walking down the friendship lane. So do not be demanding to your friends, do not even expect them to hold on to their promises or an agreement. Disappointments hurts and it hurts even worse in the friendship department. So...to have a healthier friendship with your friends, eliminate this disappointment disease from your system for good. Just remove expectations, holding onto promises and such...cos we aren't living in a fairytale.<br><br>Just one more thing before I end this...You need to feel good about yourself at all times or nobody will feel comfortable being your friend...<br><br>Anyway good luck, I wish you all the best and have a pleasant year ahead. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

So please make sure you got your extra skin on as it gotta be thick enough to bulldoze into that fellowship of the ring. Since your situation is such, I would suggest an apology is necessary to restore her friendship with you. Do not tell her the truth behind your actions that you're feeling insecure, jealous and you can't live without her. Cos that's going to make you uncool. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Hehehe...I forgot to tell you, you're supposed to be her cool friend once again. And she should at least be thinking of you as such...gracious and cool. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Your friend will of course graciously forgive you and kiss and make up. (If not, maybe you're not a friend to her afterall and should go bang your head against the wall for feeling so bad over it) Although things will be slightly different as you can feel it so, but do not worry about it cos things are going to get better from here on. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Next, you need to blend into her group of friends. Not that difficult if you do take a genuine interest in her friends. The keyword is "Listen" and paying attention. Everyone got their own stories to tell, gossips, sharing news and tips. Do not ask wide-end questions like "What DVDs do you own?" (provided the target is a dvd/movie fan). Because this question is going to force the target to generate so much answers and it's going to give her a headache that's going to put her off after that. Instead, ask specific open-end questions like "What's your favorite DVDs?". &lt;- That's just an example so don't go around asking people that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Once you've blend into her groups of friends, it is time to Take control. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Take control is easy. It involves in organising activities for your good friend and her invalid friends. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> If you have been "Listening" and taking some genuine interest in her friends, you should be able to know what kind of activities would interest them and bind them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Note that participation level need not be 100% as you simply cannot babysit everyone. But please make sure that participation is at least 70-80% provided she has 10 friends. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Keep everyone happy, satisfied, enjoying with some laughter and smiles. (Treat them Happy meals if you really have to) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> And please organise fun activities several times until you're sure that you're undoubtedly their unproclaimed cult leader and recognised friend. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If you have achieved that level...well, you're already a queen among them isn't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Although it's time for Eliminate and Elimination of your former enemies, I won't tell you how you're going to do that. So..do that at your own discretion ok? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>If you can do half of what I'll advised...you won't lose your good friend. But even if you decided not to do any of those, you can still salvage your friendship. Afterall, she's just a phone call away isn't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>You see, friendship and relationship are similar in some sense. Both have to be voluntarily...and that's is a very important key. Both have to be interested to becoming each other's friend to begin walking down the friendship lane. So do not be demanding to your friends, do not even expect them to hold on to their promises or an agreement. Disappointments hurts and it hurts even worse in the friendship department. So...to have a healthier friendship with your friends, eliminate this disappointment disease from your system for good. Just remove expectations, holding onto promises and such...cos we aren't living in a fairytale.<br><br>Just one more thing before I end this...You need to feel good about yourself at all times or nobody will feel comfortable being your friend...<br><br>Anyway good luck, I wish you all the best and have a pleasant year ahead. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div></blockquote>Wow dats a long one..thx for ur llllllooooooooonnnnnnnngggggg reply.. i appreciate it however the method u mentioned seems like war strategy...i want her truely to be my fren and not using method dat erm i dunnoe how to say...makes me feel like i have no dignity...thx for yr "gd luck" and u really hit the nail rite on the head...yes i m now fearing of losing such a gd fren who hardly comes by...yes i admit i m jealous..ok hold on for all those who wan to quote dis...jealous as in not those bad attitude its erm...i m jealous of her frenz who had so much time with her...and of cuz the time they had with her...<br>betray? not really la not so serious..anyway if u says she had betrayed me den i wun be trying means to salvage the frenship... i hate traitors!haha...she is really nice =)<br>disppointed..? of cuz will haha no one will jump for  joy to see ur frenz with others so happily and erm u urself is so sad...somewhere near her but cant share the joy with her...i think i really have to congratulate her frenz for finding such a gd fren...actually i dun mind losing her to  a fren whom i noe well...mb sort of close...at least i noe where did i go wrong...why did i lose to her...den i will admit defeat...but now i dunnoe de situation..however i noe her frenz treat her nicely...i lost half..but i wun gif up till i noe truely dat they r tons better den me...i m really have self esteem like wad u all say..and yes earth will still rotate without her...but the earth will be a better place to live with her around... to me la..to u all... are other ppl.. no one wants to be alone...i had dis fren...she was alone for home econs( we r suppose to be in pairs and do practical which is cooking)so erm so i have already decided to pair with my best fren(ok erm i noe dun use best rite but let me use for the moment dunnoe wad to use for de time being) so dis last min...my fren came forward ask me to pair with her...i dun blame her..no one wants to be alone...<br>and her frenz...erm i dunnoe how to say...dere is one whom i think is very selfish...she was my fren gddy buddy actually...she was suppose to pair with her den in the end she pair with other  ppl...so in he lesson dere is 19 girls 1 boy...s she dun want to pair with him...she came to beg me...i dun wish to reject her...so erm in the end i decided to partner the boy..but in the end still partner my fren cuz she is really like devastated...cuz she du nwan to pair my best fren...so when my best fren do practical i will help her the best i can l =)<br>Life is more colourful with her around =)</div>
