                          this is a faceless forum, but in term of integrity, I think you let
                          your family down...go discuss all these with you family, they can
                          help you internal instead of coming here and bla bla blacksheep
                          behind your sister. If i got such brother, kick him to singapore

              <p>Firstly, this is aunt agony where people try to help each other with their problems (of course u wouldnt understand what is the true purpose of having aunt agony). I can ensure u that within these many pages of aunt agony, there's bound to be one thread similar like mine.. not exact, just a similar scenario. "i think you let your family down.."? what, seriously? is this some joke u made? u make it sounds like im the ONLY one that post this type of family problem in here. i pity your ignorance.</p>
              <p>Secondly, "go discuss all these with your family, they can help you internal instead of coming here and bla bla blacksheep behind your sister" omg.... i literally facepalm at those idiotc sentence u typed. Since i can tell u didnt read the source of my problem, i just repeat here again. My sis dont want people to know... thats why its a SECRET. She dont want me to tell our parents so i agree. Even if i tell my parents, my sis will show her total negative side and wont talk to us or probably run away or whatever. </p>
              <p>Thirdly, u just said it... this is a faceless forum. what "ashamed" are u talking about? who the fk are u? u dont know me... u dont even know who the fk is my sister. can u really picture us? that avatar from u.. is probably fake, u trying to make yourself look pretty. i have no idea what integrity u talking about here. i have no one else to turn to so why not posting my problem in here. since people dont really know who am i and u come in here and show your stupidity.  U think singapore only got 10-12 people only? there are millions of people... u think u manage to find where am i within all these people? wow if i know such person, i feed her to gorilla</p>

              <p>First, pple also dun understand if you are talking about yr sister, lesbian or anime, what is the shit about buying anime for her, if you dun like, dun buy for her lah, and secondly, secret can also be discuss with your parents, they are matured pples who know how to keep a secret and may find you a responsible brother who care for yr sister by telling them the issue.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, now I really know why your sister alway shout and scold you, with your this type of nerdy thinking, sure get shouted lah. Yes, Aunt Agony can be a place for asking help, but you are not helping yourself by settling it within yr family first, and moreover, what is the problem here, what is so bad about reading anime, i do look at animes alot from comic and net, and lastly, you hv no right to invade the privacy of your sister room and things, do you know what is the meaning of permission. No wonder your sister never respect you. My brother also never touch me thing, nor do i touch him unless permission granted.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>by reading that second paragraph of yours, if ppl dont understand..  u will see a shit load of ppl misunderstanding me. but as u see on the previous page... most ppl do understand and follow up by their logical replies unlike u (of course, u wouldnt understand.. what am i thinking). Like i mention before.. u still dont get it do u? This is aunt agony. AUNT AGONY. ppl with problems coming into this forum for help. They way u reply about that is really stupid... its like saying to all those topic created in aunt agony like for example, financial problem thread, love relationship thread (countless of topic is abt that), family problem etc. And your thinking with all those problems are "why post here? stuff like this can disgust with your parents wat. no use of posting here.. just go discuss with yr parents". seriously? it just shows how moronic plus heartless u are. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>another thing, dont act like u know my sister.. its like saying that i know yr mom from geylang. u dont know shit abt her.. dont act like it. She is born with that type of attitude, and u expect ppl to be nice 24/7 ? of course i would be mad if u say something pathetic like that. who wouldnt? no wonder ppl is mad at u for over the past month. I feel sorry for your friends to have u..... if u have a friend that is. U are totally missing the point.. omg. Since when the fk i said reading anime is bad for u?  since when the fk i said i invade her privacy in her room? wow that dude was right... some idiotic ppl do not think before they talk. good for your brother nvr disturb u... with u.. no ppl in a right mind would like to be near u. I said that i needed help and explaination that shud i help her or not.. if i help her, isnt it encouraging her? if i dont, will she think it other wise and such? thats all. Its clear to me that u are just bored with yr life and u blurted out crap to make yrself look good by making others go mad. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"please lah, look inward first, dun come here and wash laundry in the public lah" hahaha.... are u talking to yrself? those sentence are actually projecting of wat u are doing there. I only ask for help. u ask for attention thus attention seeker so that sentence are more suitable for u obviously</p>

              <p>I try start of as a normal conversation. If she trust me, then i

              <p>glad to be of help.</p>
              <p>well, since the problem is with her group of own childish male peers around her..</p>
              <p>get her to join school clubs, keep her busy..sign her up for some external sports that will train her mental, patience to prepare for adulthood..abacus, calligraphy, music,dancing, tennis, golf..</p>
              <p>depending on the financial ability..show her the right door..since her mental maturity is still low on the kid side, but already showing signs of early puberty..so ya..</p>
              <p>show her the right door, how to behave like a lady in time to come, with that comes practice..dancing teaches the right posture, elegance that refines a lady..</p>
              <p>tennis, golf..just alternatives to sports that wealthy play in..brighter future..</p>
              <p>abacus, calligraphy, music each train individual patience, hardwork via tons of practice..hopefully that will wear her down mentally if not let her gradually realize that it's not the right time to be of interest to sexual related stuff..</p>
              <p>as for counselling..only use it if her condition worsens..use it only as a last straw if she shows no signs of improvement la..for it means you no longer can control or have her obeying you..</p>

Since when the fk i said reading anime is bad for u?  since when the fk i said i invade her privacy in her room? wow that dude was right... some idiotic ppl do not think before they talk. good for your brother nvr disturb u... with u.. no ppl in a right mind would like to be near u. I said that i needed help and explaination that shud i help her or not.. if i help her, isnt it encouraging her? if i dont, will she think it other wise and such? thats all. Its clear to me that u are just bored with yr life and u blurted out crap to make yrself look good by making others go mad. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"please lah, look inward first, dun come here and wash laundry in the public lah" hahaha.... are u talking to yrself? those sentence are actually projecting of wat u are doing there. I only ask for help. u ask for attention thus attention seeker so that sentence are more suitable for u obviously</p>

              <p><br>I never say you gal mah, i said you gay in the making.</p>
              <p>Usually guy who bother sisters things and problem are sissy in nature. Guess you are no exception, guy dun argue with a gal like me for so long, they are more open and gentlemen unlike Gay guy.</p>
              <p>And my mother had long gone, so dun speak bad abt her, no good for you, I never said abt other people parents, no matter what happen. This show your imaturity in dealing with discussion.</p>
              <p>First and foremost, this is a family matter, you need to let you parents know, they are the best to settle your sister or your problem. That is why i said, seek inward before go outward. In lots of time, youngster like me and you love to seek outside advises and solution, it is good to listen and learn, but at the end of the day, you parents need to know about it, and they are the best people to solve your problem, of course you can provide option solution from what you gather from outside to them. And if you tell them that an Angel told you to seek parent advices, I guarantee you, they will tell you that Angel gives you the best advice.</p>
              <p>That is already my help, still dun get it?</p>
