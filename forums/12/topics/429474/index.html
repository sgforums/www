              <p>Ok she is my small sister. She is quite popular among her friends and probably her school. u know as in the well known type. We dont quite get along very well, as a matter in fact she is really mean to me. Ignore me when im trying to be nice, talk down on me even. So basically i really hate her guts. She seems very friendly and fun to hang out with when she's around with her friends but she never reacts that way towards me. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ok one day, i left my room to get a drink then she came in, she just got back from work. She was in a hurry or something because she was running and accidentally bump into me. As usual, she call me stupid blah blah and then on her way to her room. Then i saw this book on the floor. It is obviously hers because i saw it drop out of her bag or something. I picked it up and look at it, it was some kind of anime comic. I dont watch anime though but i know its an anime through observing its drawing and stuff besides its really a well known culture in japan. But its awkward to see my sister are into anime, because its not those oridinary anime. its some sort of like those pervert anime more like a lesbian type. I saw these two girls cuddling each other on the bed at the cover and as i flipped the page, its getting more and more obscene. Seriously i was all like "wtf?". </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It will be a really weird if i pass her back the comic. So i just put it back on my room for awhile and wait for her to leave her room then i put it back without her noticing it. Its night time and i go out to a mama shop to  buy something then when i left the house i saw my room the light got turned on. My parents were out at that time so it has to be my sister. I go back in the house and found my sister looking for something obviously is that anime comic. And i said to her why is she here? and she replied its none of my business. Well you're in my room... of course i will care, thats my response to her. She give me some cold stare and i told her about that anime comic. She was shocked and she die die trying to give excuses but finally she admitted it that comic is hers. i can tell she was dead embarrassed but i told her i wont make fun of her no matter what. But this is just the beginning, now she's like want me to play this stupid little sister anime game with her and buy her some of those lesbian anime comic... people were looking at me when they saw me bought it. If i didnt do as what she said, she will think that im just all talk and on a further note, i feel sorry for her because she's the only one that are into this thing. She told me her friends dislike this kinda thing and not to mention mom and dad. But i dont want to do all these errands for her... HELPPP </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and btw am i in a wrong? because she gives me attitude lots of times. should i even help her?</p>

              <p>thanks for your advice. </p>
              <p>well she said she's into this kinda thing because honestly she dont know herself. She just love them before she even realize it. Its like a love at first sight. She told me its cute and its addictive. I've never catch her doing weird stuff before and she's normal towards her friends so i dont think she's really a lesbian. </p>

              <p>but if i quit helping her, she will think me as those "all talk no action". And as much as i hate her, i really feel sorry for her because i think she is the only person around her (families and friends) that interested in this. I saw her friends before and i over heard that her friends dont like to be associate with this anime type. so yeah, i dont want her to feel lonely. u get what i mean? </p>
              <p>yea about that she did manage get the comic by herself, i asked her that. She said she sneakily take it. She told me she always wear this cap and pull it downward to hide her face whenever she bought it. sometimes wear different clothes just to buy it and she's getting tired of it. </p>

              <p>well she said she's into this kinda thing because honestly she

              Its like a love at first sight. She told me its cute and its
              addictive. I've never catch her doing weird stuff before and she's
              normal towards her friends so i dont think she's really a

              <p>Ok she is my small sister. She is quite popular among her friends and probably her school. u know as in the well known type. We dont quite get along very well, as a matter in fact she is really mean to me. Ignore me when im trying to be nice, talk down on me even. So basically i really hate her guts. She seems very friendly and fun to hang out with when she's around with her friends but she never reacts that way towards me. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ok one day, i left my room to get a drink then she came in, she just got back from work. She was in a hurry or something because she was running and accidentally bump into me. As usual, she call me stupid blah blah and then on her way to her room. Then i saw this book on the floor. It is obviously hers because i saw it drop out of her bag or something. I picked it up and look at it, it was some kind of anime comic. I dont watch anime though but i know its an anime through observing its drawing and stuff besides its really a well known culture in japan. But its awkward to see my sister are into anime, because its not those oridinary anime. its some sort of like those pervert anime more like a lesbian type. I saw these two girls cuddling each other on the bed at the cover and as i flipped the page, its getting more and more obscene. Seriously i was all like "wtf?". </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It will be a really weird if i pass her back the comic. So i just put it back on my room for awhile and wait for her to leave her room then i put it back without her noticing it. Its night time and i go out to a mama shop to  buy something then when i left the house i saw my room the light got turned on. My parents were out at that time so it has to be my sister. I go back in the house and found my sister looking for something obviously is that anime comic. And i said to her why is she here? and she replied its none of my business. Well you're in my room... of course i will care, thats my response to her. She give me some cold stare and i told her about that anime comic. She was shocked and she die die trying to give excuses but finally she admitted it that comic is hers. i can tell she was dead embarrassed but i told her i wont make fun of her no matter what. But this is just the beginning, now she's like want me to play this stupid little sister anime game with her and buy her some of those lesbian anime comic... people were looking at me when they saw me bought it. If i didnt do as what she said, she will think that im just all talk and on a further note, i feel sorry for her because she's the only one that are into this thing. She told me her friends dislike this kinda thing and not to mention mom and dad. But i dont want to do all these errands for her... HELPPP </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and btw am i in a wrong? because she gives me attitude lots of times. should i even help her?</p>

              <p>Give her one tight slap. Show her your power.</p>
              <p>Don't run errands for her.</p>
              <p>About lesbian comic, it is not your problem, she is old enuf to make decisions of her own. Doesn't mean, she buy an anime comic on lesbians means she herself is a lesbian.</p>

              <p>hey thanks for the help. I did try to make in a close conversation between us. Doesnt really work out well though because she's still mean to me. she said that she dont like to hang out with guys because she explained that how they stand so close to her and often touching her (im not talking abt molesing, just touch at the shoulder, etc). It brings out a negative image of guys u know.. so she said its best if she stay out of it. </p>

              <p>but i need her to tell me more details about her. She wants me to bring her to a cosplay event next time but of course, its risky for her but she still want to go. i have no choice on that</p>

              lols TS, tink u shld jus ignore them and return back to your topic which is to help your sister or to solve your issue.
              
              Actually, have you tried to persuade her for a counselling session? Attitude problem and sudden interest in lesbians are not right and i guess you know about that which is why you are here. Point is to bring it up as a session but not to get her to go for it yet. Definitely she's gonna say no but probably slowly introduce it to her? Other than that you wanna wanna read up a little about psycho and try for a cognitive behavioural therapy? I am no pro here but just hoping that it helps you out.

If i got such brother, kick him to singapore river.</p>
