They think by providing the basic (roof, schooling, etc) for the family is already very good in fulfilling their responsibilities. There is no emotional sharing, nor do they really listen to their wife and kids.<br><br>As a result, it affects the upbringing and personality of the children...they won't feel really loved and secure.  The children must learn to be more independent and responsible for their own lives, coz the father or parents won't be there to molly coddle them if anything goes wrong.</div>

I think culture and biology has it that men find it harder to display their emotions. They've been taught how to conceal their feelings, if your dad came from such a generation and upbringing, it's no wonder he's the way you think he is.<br><br>Just try and talk to him, respect him, in time to come he may speak to you like you're a young man. You're a guy, not a ballerina. It won't help pointing a finger at your dad for stunted growing years. You're responsible for your own life, not your dad.<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth.
