If the girl you like who also look at you this way, then I do not think she deserves your attention. Same goes to the friends.<br><br>Of course you have to start asking why they look at you this way.

            <div class='col-md body'>on 1 hand, i want to strangle the person who is saying all this about me. why do they not want to give me a 2nd chance. why if they dont know, why spoil my reputation. why make my life miserable even when it does not benefit them?<br><br>on the other hand , i dont want to find out who. because i fear that the person might be someone i trust. or might even be a person who is on friendly terms on me now. i fear that if i find out that the person backstabbed me, or is still doing so, i will not be able to control my anger.<br><br>why? even after 1 whole year, people are still spreading the same stuff? why? humans...only people who have worked with me, will have bad things to say. so if they forgave me, why wouldnt the rest do the same? and yet do they still seek my help when they are backstabbing me? only my class people will got things to about me. but why in their times of need, they still come find me? humans...greedy lot.<br><br>Human : a race that is so desperate on its own extinction.</div>
