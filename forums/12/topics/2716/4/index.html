            <div class='col-md body'>reverse psychology tactics, darlings? it doesn't work with me. check out my other posts and see if i'm a trouble maker like you guys. it's so bloody obvious what you people are doing to FireIce, it was a co-ordinated, but unwarranted, personal attack. to achieve what purpose, i've no idea but i'll stay and watch and entertain you if i feel like it.<br><br>but not only that, you people have to bring a hint of suggestion to the "so-called" reliable source who may have or may not have betrayed FireIce's trust and since you're able to list who saw her and chief, that effectively brings a hint of doubt to all of those listed.<br><br>brilliant, i must say, simply brilliant. killing so many birds with one stone, you people are indeed worthy of being Machiavellian's successors. i, undecided, decidedly without hesitation, salute your group's deviousness and viciousness.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

So do not attempt to feed the fire if you dun know how big this fire is.<br><br>You might think that the internet is just a place to have fun, I totally agree with you. But not in this forum, the problem here is almost everybody knows everybody, we have met and we are real life friends. We are not just the other person in this void whom you have never seen before. And when things comes to this level, it is real, and people do mean something behnd their words. What do you think about the friend who bad mouth you? The friend who stabs you in the back? The friend who is so plain jealous about what happens, and plots to get back at you? Tell me? Is this person a friend anymore? And in this case whenther he/she is virtual or not does not matters, simply because I know them in real life, and they know how much damage they will cause by doing what they do. It is not like talking to a net friend anymore, because it means something when you know the person behind the screen. And we are talking about real life events here, not just some vaginas and balls! Why not I make fun of you when I caught with your pants down and that I know you personally and that I am your friend. Tell me how you will feel, and I dare say you will not said what you just said anymore. So wake up that idea of yours and not comment if you dun know what the hell is going on. And if you do, all the more you will not say any of those thigns you have said, becuase I most probably think you will not even have to balls to do what I am doing right now!<br><br>Phoenix:<br><br>You say people have been talking about the couplesthat exsit in the forum, so tell me, who are these people who normally talks about them, or should I say initiate them? go think about this and you will find a similar pattern. Well why not I dig some wounds and ask you how you felt when people talked about you? And how you felt when your privacy was breach.<br><br>You said that no harm was caused? Well, that is in your point of view, remember that everyone has their own boundaries. And if no harm were cause, she would not feel upset at all. You might think she is makign upa big ufss out of nothing, well, let me tell you that you will make a big fuss out of nothing if I do something to you too, and I am not just warning, I have the intentions to do what Iclaim I want to do, all you need is to push me enough, and you see a gentleman no more.<br><br>Maestro:<br><br>Dun worry, I am now on a crusade, becoming more and more fanatic by the moment, you just sit back and watch me kill them softly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh yah, I am not bring any thing new out now...but I just want you people to recall how people jumped to Lex's defence when her picture was postedright here in this very forum? People were crying out loud for privacy then? Tell me how much difference this scenario is. And Remeber how pheonix was famed? Now let me ask again, how do oyu tihnk people felt when they are misunderstood? And did she cry out loud for justice too? People simply are too stupid to learn from their own experience ain't they? Do I need to dig wounds to make them remember?<br><br>And who are the people who went to chief crying for help when they are injustified? And now these people are crying foul, saying that he has too much power to ban people? So iti s a dog eat dog world huh? And so you take chief to be a tissue paper huh? Clean your damn big smelly ass and throw it away huh? I dun think I have to judge what type of people you all are. I have said enough for the rest of the world to judge. And I dun think they see you all in very good light.<br><br>and now, someone is actually doing something that she has been thorugh herself before.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Madman:<br><br>I dun think you know anything about what is happening. It doesn't matter how much you know a person, they will still make use of you. Many a time, this has happen, and you dun want tht to happen. you are dman right I am making people feeling uncomfortalbe to post anything. That is simply becuase I want to think before they even want to blurt out something unintelligent. People who knows me, know what I am capable of, and they dun want to fark around with me because of that. Yes I am using this as a reminder again to whoever is reading this.<br><br>As for chief wanting to ban me or not, it is up to him, and I think he will make a correct decision. I am not makign a fuss out of nothing trust me, that this is what I call accumulated anger, and you will not see what I see, unless you know the whole history of things that has happen, you will not understand my anger.<br><br>There is much more ot what you see, and I urge you not to comment if you do not know, for it will only make you fall deeper into this hell hole.<br>And I dun care if people thinks that I am narrow-minded or petty. I dun care how people think of me, why else do you think I dare to admit that I am the one who did it? As for the forum, it will continue to survive, I sun want to explain to you why, but I just put it as that socail behaviours in the present society depicts so.<br></div>

If you think my view are not right, just tell me. And not try to gather some person insult like pokemon have done. Hey I seen some of his poke, he is not tt childish before, I wonder why now. Does he have some against chief or FI i dont know. If i find it as unfair, does it mean i dont have the rite to voice out?<br></div>
