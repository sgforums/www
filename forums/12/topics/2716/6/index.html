            <div class='col-md body'>Pokemon:<br><br>Dun try to be a historian. Your facts are incomplete. What Russia had was an internal war. A civil revolutiuon that over thrown the Czar, the Bolsheviks who overthrwn the Czar(and had his family executed) was then taken over by Lenin, upon which he sign Russia out of the war by an armistice with Germany. This is because by then during those 3years of war, it had already suffered more than 1,000,000 casualties, and with the people totally demoralised the war could not go on. If it was Czar who was still in reign and or there was no civil war, Russia would has continued to fought.<br><br>but all in all I dun see the relevence of your reply to Undecided.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun understand. These ppl are condemned juz becoz they do this openly. Wat abt the destruction those ppl did to the rest behind others' backs? Juz becoz they do it silently doesn't mean dat ppl have to suffer in silence too. If u're here to stand up fer them; If being open abt it means getting a lecture and looks from all as a retribution in the end, where do they seek their justice then?<br><br>------------------<br><strong>NOTHING'S GONNA CHANGE MY LOVE FOR YOU<br>YOU OUGHT TO KNOW BY NOW HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU<br>ONE THING YOU CAN BE SURE OF<br>I'LL NEVER ASK FOR MORE THAN YOUR LOVE </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Callan:<br>Good point taken here, you helped open the eyes of the "Blind". But it seems that they are unable to take the Brillance of The Light aka "Truth". We do what we can as TRUE friends to care and to give support, as what our 'liang xin' tells us to.<br>If these ppl rejects our help to help them see the truth, due to some silly reason such as their inflatable EGO tells them or their incorrigible stubborn nature, then these people are not worthy of our help.<br>I salute thee.<br><br>Pokemon:<br>I just one to tell you one thing, you say that you will never disclose the person who told you the information. YOU already have done so by disclosing the information, Whoever told you the information is not important, Its the information that has importance. Even by not disclosing the informer, you already lost the TRUST of the informer.<br>Take care of yourself when you grow up and go to the real life battlefield. If you continue as you are now, your ass gonna blow.<br><br>Phoenix09:<br>Same goes to you, when your privacy was invaded by some peeping tom, when you were sleeping. How does it feel?<br>WONDERFUL!!!!! That you actually have something that other ppl will want to see? I dun think so.<br>So dun tell me the crap about "...i post wat i want and wat i like, and no point toking senses into me. if u know me well, u will know that i am a very stubborn person.i have my own views ...".<br>We are not talking sense into you, we are opening up a new perception to you that we think you have missed. Most people miss it until it is too late... so help yourself. USE your heart and soul to SEE and THINK. NOT your brain.<br><br>Madman76:<br>Not that i oppose your mad ways, I also very crazy many a times. But as one grows and matures we need to be responsible for every single word that comes out of our mouth, or out or our keyboard in this case.<br>There will come a time in life when, your words will be of severe importance, Where each and every word may cause millions of life and dollars. If you watched "Rules of Engagement" and think about it, its not just about war, and rules of engagement. Its the IMPACT of ones WORDS, ORDERS and ultimately ACTION. Be it right or wrong, we got to take responsibility for all consequences that happen.<br><br>Lex:<br>Dun need me to tell you what happened to you in the past right. Even though you din't see me for a long break last time, I know what happens in here. And the time when everybody will just get pissed with the mention of Lex. WHY?!?!?!? Same old thing...... So think a bit, Gossip sometimes does not work in the way you want it to.<br>You are also not getting any younger, be sensible and think things right, dun act on impulse unnecessarily. Life is not just as simple as it is.<br><br>Stringray:<br>Thanks I can tell you are a swimming creature with a intelligence of a Homo Sepien. Alas there are some Homo Sepien with intelligence of a fish......Hahhahaha!!!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>and my little worm,<br><br>no one tells me to shut up, if you feel like shutting up, you're perfectly free to do so, but kindly do not <strong>ever</strong> presume to tell me what to do.<br><br>now what did i do that's so wrong? the fact that i pointed out their actual motives? had i not done so, FireIce would have to suffer more indignities at their hands. it's their sexual attacks on her that drew me into this fray. that and the fact that some people love playing politics in this forums, for reasons best known to themselves. i hate politics and i've seen enough of it on this forums to hope that it will be stopped once and for all.<br><br>if in processing of telling it like is, i showed up some of them, then that's too bad because you reap what you sow.<br><br>or is it the fact that none of you knows me that makes what i pointed out such a hard pill to swallow?<br><br>[This message has been edited by undecided (edited 08 November 2000).]</div>
