            <div class='col-md body'>FireIce needs to grieve the fact that she's seeing chief, that is if the rumours are true? huh? er, what galaxy do you in? having a boyfriend or girlfriend is nothing to be ashamed of, but the people involved has the right not to want to announce the fact. makes you wonder why nosy third parties are so intent on helping them announce it right?<br><br>beneath this seemingly benign facade of extending their joy and congratulations to FireIce and chief for their "couplehood" is actually a cruel set up of possible flamings or to nip the blooming courtship in its bud or to destroy some friendships. as Callan has indicated, the inhabitants of sgforums are not just nameless nicks behind a monitor screen, most are friends in real life and even if they aren't, most of us have an idea how some look like.<br><br>then just look at the way it denigrated into suggestions that FireIce and chief may be having sex or that FireIce is an easy gal who grant sexual favours, see the way they bantered among themselves about her skills or a lack of them. ALL OF WHICH ARE TOTALLY UNCALLED FOR AND UNNECESSARY, but this vicious group of rumour mongers did so, its aim is to destroy the reputation of a female forumite or at least to sully her reputation and that's what pissed me.  you see, sexual reputation works differently for guys and gals, guys who have bedded numerous gals are considered studs while gals who do are considered sluts, it's the possible slur on FireIce's reputation that made me join in this fray.<br><br>and did FireIce say anything about banning anyone or getting her possible boyfriend who incidentally owns this forums to ban anyone? i think it's that group of hyenas who brought the topic of being banned into the conversation to throw off its stinking scent, ie, its true purpose: to hurt FireIce and possibly the one referred to as chief.<br><br>a couple of drones, worker bee/s and a queen but what a jealous, vicious and cruel queen she is!<br><br>i'm very happy that after so many flaming wars that finally a group of trouble makers has been "possibly" identified. now readers, just ask yourself, doesn't it set you thinking that they (this same group) may be behind some of the other wars?<br><br>SEE? that is the power of suggestion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>reputation is the same, people defend theirs when it's being challenged because if you don't, the power of suggestion will colour everything you ever did before, what you do now and what you'll do in future.<br></div>

A purpose of a forum is to post your opinion regardless of it being right or wrong.<br><br>Just some things to keep in mind:<br><br>If FireIce had not dropped so many hints in the forum about her and her love life.  This would not have happened.  She herself created attention for herself.  And attention is what she will get.  It's just too bad it have to resort to this type of attention.   FireIce wanted to keep everyone in suspense by dropping hints every now and then, by doing so, she had stirred up tension for herself and what does she expect people to do once they find out the truth?  Keep quiet about it!?  HA!  She herself is playing a mind game. Once you started the game, just be sure you can take the consquences.<br><br>Callan making all these threats, what are you trying to achieve here?  If anyone is guilty of adding oil to the fire he should be guilty for lighting up the fire.  Who is the one that opened their mouth first?  Why make threats to others and try to appear noble when you, yourself is the cause of this evil?  He had betrayed his friend, and how is wants to make up by doing the damage control?<br><br>It's not helping by making all those threats and false accusations.   You are as guilty as anyone else here, if not more.<br><br>------------------<br>You are poison... poison running through my veins...<br><br>Poison... I dun wanna break these chains... poison...<br><br>[This message has been edited by lexelle (edited 07 November 2000).]</div>
