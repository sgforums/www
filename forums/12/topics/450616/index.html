            <div class='col-md body'>over the last few months i grew emotionally attached to a woman that i know in my job. the problem is that she is married with children and i am 15 years younger than her. she was just a client i had to meet regularly and we began to meet at her house occasionally. she is a foreigner that came to live in sg with her children but her husband still resides at their hometown. from what i hear, her husband is a workaholic so he could not come due to job commitments and he had very little time for family even before they came over to sg. her children are very close to me and they like me a lot especially the youngest. during daytime, i often took time off from my work to go out with her since her children will be at school. it was only recently that i felt that she grew a feeling towards me but i'm still not entirely sure about this. we see each other very often now, mostly on weekends and i have hinted many times about my feelings for her. i have considered about what could happen if we really got together and how our society frowns upon this sort of relationship and how my family would react. but i have decided to give it a try. how shall i ask her to become my girlfriend?</div>

              <p>over the last few months i grew emotionally attached to a woman that i know in my job. the problem is that she is married with children and i am 15 years younger than her. she was just a client i had to meet regularly and we began to meet at her house occasionally. she is a foreigner that came to live in sg with her children but her husband still resides at their hometown. from what i hear, her husband is a workaholic so he could not come due to job commitments and he had very little time for family even before they came over to sg. her children are very close to me and they like me a lot especially the youngest. during daytime, i often took time off from my work to go out with her since her children will be at school. it was only recently that i felt that she grew a feeling towards me but i’m still not entirely sure about this. we see each other very often now, mostly on weekends and i have hinted many times about my feelings for her. i have considered about what could happen if we really got together and how our society frowns upon this sort of relationship and how my family would react. but i have decided to give it a try. how shall i ask her to become my girlfriend?</p>

              <p>Hi rouko,</p>
              <p>Being in love with a married person spells disaster. I was in love with one once, but he never loved me back.</p>
              <p>There are just too many things to consider by having an affair with a married woman. Are you prepared for the consequences? Sure, if it is just for a fling, it is between the two of you as consented adults.</p>
              <p>When you step into the relationship zone, it is a serious business. It is going to be a long and perilous journey if you both decide to be together. I figure you have already considered all factors and people involved in this relationship. I wish you luck if you still plan to proceed on being serious with the lady.</p>
