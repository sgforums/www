            <div class='col-md body'>Deep inside, I am someone who feels pretty competitive, therefore I will feel disappointed when I feel like I am not performing up to standard compared to my other friends. So lately, I have been hearing a lot of success stories from my friends who are the same age as me...like how many of them are getting offer to work here, etc...this provokes me a deep sense of envy in me...cos I am not doing as well as them.<br><br>I know I am not supposed to be feeling this way, and I might have even become unfriendly to them because of this. Not that they would care, cos who am I to them? Just a good-for-nothing, an acquaintance, nothing more than that.<br><br>Somehow, deep inside me, I am convinced that I will do something great one day, but at this point of my life, it seems like I am banging my head against the wall thinking about what that might be. I can't find any proof to support my conviction, but somehow my heart just believe so firmly in it. Even when my mind tells it that that is just a dream and nothing else, it is still there. I do not know why my instinct is stubbornly holding to something I think is false dreams because it will only disappoint me in the end when I do not do something great after all.<br><br>I am confused and depressed over this, especially when more and more of my friends are coming up to me to tell me about their interviews and success...I even had to resort to blasting my music so that I do not have to listen to my roomie talking to her bf about how her interview went when they are both in the room...<br><br>How to control my feeling of envy before it eats into me further? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> Sorry for the long post...</div>

I feel envious of the Super Models. I feel envious of the rich people in my office.  I feel envious of even my relatives/colleagues who are rich and had better PR and have a good life while I slog away for nothing. But, its just a feeling - it does not have to take over your mind and your life.<br><br>Cause I know this feeling will eat me away and make me feel useless and depressed.<br>I realised that using these external measures, I can never be happy with myself and whatever I have. So I made a choice. I no longer measure myself up to these external standards. Who says being slim is the way to go. Who says having a high paying job is going to make me happy? Who says being rich is going to make my life wonderful?<br><br>I measure my own self worth with my own internal measures. Such as my health, peace of mind, by abilities to even provide advice like this cause I had a similar insight, and other skills.  Life is really not very exciting nor it is fair. Cause we all never start out with the same footing - ie some people are already born rich, some people are born in Lee family, some are born as beggars, and others disabled. But what matters is what you do with yourself and be happy with what you acheive even though it might not seem significant to your eyes. Even taking care of your parents - might not seem much but its really something. cause if you look  out there, many old folks are abandoned by their kids.<br><br>Take it easy and chill out.  Take note of what are you comparing yourself against and if that is being fair to yourself.<br><br></div>

I feel envious of the Super Models. I feel envious of the rich people in my office.  I feel envious of even my relatives/colleagues who are rich and had better PR and have a good life while I slog away for nothing. But, its just a feeling - it does not have to take over your mind and your life.<br><br>Cause I know this feeling will eat me away and make me feel useless and depressed.<br>I realised that using these external measures, I can never be happy with myself and whatever I have. So I made a choice. I no longer measure myself up to these external standards. Who says being slim is the way to go. Who says having a high paying job is going to make me happy? Who says being rich is going to make my life wonderful?<br><br>I measure my own self worth with my own internal measures. Such as my health, peace of mind, by abilities to even provide advice like this cause I had a similar insight, and other skills.  Life is really not very exciting nor it is fair. Cause we all never start out with the same footing - ie some people are already born rich, some people are born in Lee family, some are born as beggars, and others disabled. But what matters is what you do with yourself and be happy with what you acheive even though it might not seem significant to your eyes. Even taking care of your parents - might not seem much but its really something. cause if you look  out there, many old folks are abandoned by their kids.<br><br>Take it easy and chill out.  Take note of what are you comparing yourself against and if that is being fair to yourself.<br><br></div></blockquote>Thank you for your post. It is enlightening indeed <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Yea, that's why I said I am a competitive person. Even since I was young, I measure myself against others. But I also measure myself against my own expectation. And part of my disappointment now is because I am not performing even up to my own expectation. I feel like I am supposed to do more, but I can't seem to do that. Hence the feeling of helplessness these few days...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
