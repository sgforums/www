            <div class='col-md body'>hi again rainee...<br><br>it seems like u've already pointed out yrself where the source of this uneasiness or envy is from - yr competitive nature.<br><br>first of all, it's only natural that u r envious of the success around you but yourself. even for me, i'm not a very competitive person, but i do feel a bit bad and funny when i see my friends doing well but myself. constantly i've been reproaching myself and spend much time trying to identify "what is wrong"<br><br>perhaps u could, ask yourself, not reproach, what could be holding u back from your dreams? if you're already having a job...r u happy with e job? etc... etc...<br><br>or perhaps u just don't have the luck your friends do... or perhaps u hav to learn to come to terms with yourself if you're already doing what u can to achieve yr dreams but just short of the results u want... the answer's all within you. it may not be easy finding these answers... all the best.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

If I had chosen something else, I might have done significantly better...<br><br>What to do...I made that decision when I was 18 years old, and didn't do much research because I was too puffed up with my own pride and arrogance at that time, and I told myself that I would be able to succeed no matter what I chose to do...and now I am suffering as a consequence of my own past action...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div></blockquote>Regretting is just a matter of choice.. Along your path of life, you often would find yourself looking back at certain points of your life... And some of them might seems such a BIG and STUPID MISTAKE that you simply thought "how I wish...." But in actual fact, your future's always there for you to CREATE...<br><br>In life we constantly do things we wish to do but only to find that we have to 'pay up' for it later... Most of the times, one thing compensate for another.. Sometimes we even do things which we thought we want without really knowing what we wanted..<br><br>BE BRAVE. If I had bought another number combination, I would have striked lottery already.. And if only my parents really cared about me in the past, I would have achieved so much more... And if only...

Not that they would care, cos who am I to them? Just a good-for-nothing, an acquaintance, nothing more than that.<br><br>Somehow, deep inside me, I am convinced that I will do something great one day, but at this point of my life, it seems like I am banging my head against the wall thinking about what that might be. I can't find any proof to support my conviction, but somehow my heart just believe so firmly in it. Even when my mind tells it that that is just a dream and nothing else, it is still there. I do not know why my instinct is stubbornly holding to something I think is false dreams because it will only disappoint me in the end when I do not do something great after all.<br><br>I am confused and depressed over this, especially when more and more of my friends are coming up to me to tell me about their interviews and success...I even had to resort to blasting my music so that I do not have to listen to my roomie talking to her bf about how her interview went when they are both in the room...<br><br>How to control my feeling of envy before it eats into me further? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> Sorry for the long post...</div></blockquote>hi fren,<br><br>wat is ur dream actualli..care to share? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
