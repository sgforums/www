It is enlightening indeed <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Yea, that's why I said I am a competitive person. Even since I was young, I measure myself against others. But I also measure myself against my own expectation. And part of my disappointment now is because I am not performing even up to my own expectation. I feel like I am supposed to do more, but I can't seem to do that. Hence the feeling of helplessness these few days...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div></blockquote>Then you have to review your expectations.<br>How did you even arrive at your expectations of yourself? Did you parents, friends or relatives build you up that you need to acheive all that?<br><br>OK, Put it this way. Do they know you well enough to put their own views and thoughts on you and Do you have to take their word for it that this is the "standard" you have to make yourself acheive?<br><br>EG: My relatives, every single year, tell me I am old already, I need to get married, I need to have a baby. I need to do this do that, and Only then They would consider I have lifed fully.<br><br>But I question their views because thye do not know my situation fully hence their words is just rubbish. Why should I live by their words? Do they know me so well that they can define my life for me? Would I be happy with their expectations?<br><br>Hence, I started a fresh clean slate and think of the things I should expect myself to do. I know I have acheived my papers and I am able bodied. So I should be able to provide for myself and then give a little to my parents.<br><br>And if I cannot acheive any of the expectations, I would question myself if I had set it too high or I didn't work hard enough. If I did work hard, and I still cannot get to that mark, then I would lower that expectation or create a milestone that I've achieve this much towards getting onto my goal. But still continue working towards it. However, I do have to review my expectations if someone had tainted it and needs adjustments, if its no longer a valid expectation as things had changed. etc.<br><br>But you have to be reasonable and also not go off tangent - my older brother became a changed person when I told him  has to define his expectations. He defined it as he will do whatever he is happy at the cost of his family - Hence his failed marriage, failed relationships with our parents, kicked out my sister cause it makes him happy, kicked me out cause he didn't like my views. It sure made him happy. But it cost him is family life and strainted relationships. He used his expectations and set it on others - Others need to give way and bend backwards to keep him happy.<br><br>Now, we are always wanting more, better life for ourselves. We set such a high expectations that make us unhappy working towards the goal. Sometimes, we set our expectations so high that we do it at the cost of the people around us - ie Backstabbing in office -but is it necessary? But ultimately you need to ask : is this the life you want?<br>I definitely didn't. I want to live honestly, even with less money but I do not want to live that I do not have a clear conscience.<br><br>Expectations .. Are just artificial lines we create for ourselves. Remember the key word: artificial.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by rainee:</div><div class="quote_body">Deep inside, I am someone who feels pretty competitive, therefore I will feel disappointed when I feel like I am not performing up to standard compared to my other friends. So lately, I have been hearing a lot of success stories from my friends who are the same age as me...like how many of them are getting offer to work here, etc...this provokes me a deep sense of envy in me...cos I am not doing as well as them.<br></div></blockquote>A question I'd ask is: how much of such success stories are true? People can say whatever they want, such stories can be a masquerade of the real picture, whatever this picture may be.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I know I am not supposed to be feeling this way, and I might have even become unfriendly to them because of this. Not that they would care, cos who am I to them? Just a good-for-nothing, an acquaintance, nothing more than that.<br></strong></blockquote>If you are really an acquaintance to them, then the first para should not matter, right? Then the real issue is: who are your real friends and how genuine are they to you and vice versa.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Somehow, deep inside me, I am convinced that I will do something great one day, but at this point of my life, it seems like I am banging my head against the wall thinking about what that might be. I can't find any proof to support my conviction, but somehow my heart just believe so firmly in it. Even when my mind tells it that that is just a dream and nothing else, it is still there. I do not know why my instinct is stubbornly holding to something I think is false dreams because it will only disappoint me in the end when I do not do something great after all.<br></strong></blockquote>We need to establish what is "doing something great". Do you mean a new invention, a new cure for cancer, what? Or do you mean make tons of money and become the poster girl/boy for innovation? You need to understand that most people are never going to be in this position. Sure, one can dream,  but one need to be realistic about what is achievable and what is not.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I am confused and depressed over this, especially when more and more of my friends are coming up to me to tell me about their interviews and success...I even had to resort to blasting my music so that I do not have to listen to my roomie talking to her bf about how her interview went when they are both in the room...<br></strong></blockquote>Go ahead and let your "friends" get to you.... if you do this, you'll never be able to pick yourself up. I'd ask myself what I want to do at the moment. If the interviews are not coming, I'd ask myself why. You need to get behind the reasons as to why things are not happening for you. Here's where a clear and analytical should take over the emotive downward spiral of negative thoughts.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>How to control my feeling of envy before it eats into me further? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> Sorry for the long post...<br></strong></blockquote>Some people choose to talk about what they've achieved, others don't. Some people exaggerate their achievement while others are more down to earth. Realise that!<br><br>Well, let them talk all they want.....<br><br>Are you looking for a job? I take it that you are an undergrad. What's important to you? The ability to brag about what you've achieved? Or more concrete steps to go the direction you want to take?<br></div>

But trust me, in 20 ye<br>ars, you'll look back at photos of yourself and recall in a way you can't grasp<br>now how much possibility lay before you and how fabulous you really looked.
