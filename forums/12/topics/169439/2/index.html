            <div class='col-md body'>There's a reason for attraction. Your words, your behaviour and body language says it all. Attraction is not a choice but it's either the other party will be attracted to you or not attracted to you at all. But there's contributing factors and reasons as to why people are attracted to you.<br><br>As for love, it cannot be defined simply because it is the longest-lasting power ever known in this universe. It was around since way beyond the beginning of time. So, to define why you love someone is a little hard to explain through words, but rather it will proven by actions and the condition of the heart instead. Unlike attraction, love is a choice.<br><br>Feelings, are never accurate. They cannot be trusted. Trust only in wisdom and understanding so that by them, you will see the true meaning of what love is really all about.<br><br>There're reasons for everything. But there're some reasons which words alone cannot be spoken or defined. There're some reasons which only God Himself knows and us man will never get to know them.</div>
