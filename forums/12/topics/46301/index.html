Now the client thinking<br>to sue his company (the health care admin).<br><br>My friend now very confuse.. he feels very bad to his manager and bosses<br>he is thinking to bear the damage by his own money..<br>I oso confuse..what advice should i give to him? what's is<br>your opinion guys?girls? do u think my friend should bear the damage?<br>or is there any other solutions?<br><br>any comments, suggestions would be very appreciated<br><br>thanks</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ar damn i forgot my law liow..<br><br>there's a term, dunno wat liability, that when a mistake is made by an employee doing his duties, the mistake is bourne by the company. so they cannot MAKE him pay the losses, but of course they can fire him etc etc. of course got alot of clauses but we assume that it was an honest mistake.<br><br>if he wants to come out money from his own pocket then it's up to him i guess..<br><br>i can't remember wat's the thing called liow..<br><br></div>

(eg, if u job is to let red balls thru, and u let a blue one, then that's a grave mistake of the basis of ur post - sorree just an over-simplified example)<br><br>so do u know if the company has already decided to fire him and he's still begging for his job?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Joho thanks for your comments, currently my friend is still waiting for the client's response.. because last friday his manager sent an email to the client saying that there is no liability in the contract that say the company must borne such mistake to client.  If the client going to sue in the court..or if the client terminate the contract..then surely my friend will be in trouble.. it really will make him look bad (so far his division never lose a single contract)..<br>that's why before all those thing happen, he's thinking to offer a shortcut to just borne the cost (before the client sue his company, or the client terminate the contract)... however if the client terminate the contract also bad for his reputation..and his performance will down to drain and surely will be dumped next month.<br></div>
