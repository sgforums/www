Look - same JC, no contact whatsoever lifes goes on, then same University, problem pops back. This time he really has a gf, which is the additional new rule on the table. Karmic relation with that guy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Seriously speaking, what can you see from someone who tries to flirt while his gf is in overseas? Then he told his gf about you and wants to cool off the relationship? I think its very unfair to you - considering the fact that he is using 'maintaing friends/contact' as an excuse to get closer and dump his present relationship when the situation arise. You did mentioned that you did not 'flirt back' - which shows that you are hesitating about his advancement. He, took his own foolish intiative and throw you into the picture. Selfish guy?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Think about this: Why can't he settle his own relationship first without throwing you into the picture?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You may love him alot, but I seriously urge you to consider all factors and option leading to this. Liking someone is only a minor factor: being with someone who will give you happiness is the most important thing. You think he can? I can't give you the answer either - this is the risk you have to take.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If I am in love with someone when I am attached, I would settle my present relationship first before starting somewhere. Well, <strong>her reputation, her image is also my concern right</strong>? You think a relationship would last when the whole world thinks that she is a *insert word here*, and the guy is going with a *insert word here*?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: You could fight for your happiness and probably get it, however it may not be happiness you are fighting for.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear LittleCanyon,<br><br>Though you've explained things a bit on your side, things on his side remain uncertain and unclear. As with my previous post, I do not find anything wrong with remaining contact with him even after he's attached. Some issues might still leaves with...<br><br>1. If he purely just out for your friendship in demanding on the STAY on your contact with each other OR does he has other motives? Something which is very much unclear now...<br><br>2. I don't think there's much wrong with his gf being defensive about the both of you especially because of your past history with her bf... Given the fact that her best friend knows what's going on between you &amp; her bf and that she's on her side doesn't make the picture any better.... Which closely relates us to the 3rd point.<br><br>3. Obviously from the way ya describe how you feel about the other guys going after you, you're still not over THIS GUY.... The funny question now is even YOU YOURSELF is having a difficult time to convince yourself that you can let go of him, it's no wonder why his gf is on her guard against you....<br><br>4. Morally speaking, if you're to go for her bf you're snatching someone's bf away... Morals aside. Not being suggestive for him to change his mind do you know if he's really interested in you? How is he feeling for his current gf now and can his words be trusted? From the way I see it, this can be a TRUE LOVE between 2 parties (you and him) or just a trap setup by him (with you being a willing party and he probably knows that you're falling for it?) Very much now would depends on (a) how well you'd know him in the past? (b) is he a trustworthy guy?(c) how much has he changed?<br><br>If your love for each other is TRUE and his feeling for his current gf is kinda weak or 'false', it's just a matter of time before everybody probably end up with unhappiness.... That's morals aside. If the mentioned case is true and both of you are persistent with the 'go ahead', be prepared for the SH[/i]IT ahead... But even if that's the case, don't take it too personally... Usually no relationship is a perfect smooth ride....<br><br>If this is a TRAP, you take care? Any wrong step could mean sort of a DEEP endless fall....<br><br>5. Additional questions if you're interested? His horoscope, your horoscope, his gf's horoscope and her best friend's horoscope?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">(0-0-1-2, 0-1-2-0, 0-0-2-1, 1-0-0-2) kindly ignore this part.</span><br><br>Regards.</div>
