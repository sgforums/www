            <div class='col-md body'>Here, is where how much a couple treasures each other comes in.<br><br>If u're sure u wanna spend the rest of ur life wif tt person, u'll do watever to takes to make the other smilez, &amp; watever tt person does for u will make u smilez.<br><br>A hugz, a kiss, cuddling in front of the TV, etc, may seem boring to some.  But when a love is deep, will it become boring?  I dun think so : )<br><br>We started out as best frens, my guy &amp; I, we did thgs best frens do, &amp; we're still doing it even tho we're now a couple.  Haf we gotten bored?  No...<br><br>It depends on an indiv's perspective &amp; priorities.  Are u willing to make the r'ship fun?  Will the pillow-fights cease?  Will the teasing &amp; flirting end between a couple?  It's up to them : )<br><br>Some take these thgs as routine after awhile &amp; dun bother to think of the partner anymore.  But when both indivs r committed to making a r'ship work, they'll think of ways to make the partner laff &amp; the partner will appreciate it.<br><br>As I've emphasised over &amp; over again, being in a r'ship means u think for 2, Not juz for urself.  If pple can understand this, then the probability of boredom setting in cld be greatly reduced : )<br><br>RP<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lolsuck:</div><div class="quote_body">that is almost the case,i think..  u will  think someone else will be better only when u are bored with the relationship.</div></blockquote></div>

I guess getting to know someone well is not easy, even the one you think is better may not be the best, so there is always someone better.. so when do you stop the comparison?<br><br>I agree with mooku.. its a childish way to view a relationship by comparing with people? what do you think he/she is? a commodity?</div>
