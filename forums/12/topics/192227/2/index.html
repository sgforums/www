She uses emotional blackmail on her bf lots and even goes to his place and threatens to jump out of the window.<br><br>Ultimately, she didn't kill herself when he left her because I guess there is only so much rubbish a guy can take though she was like a wreck for the next month or so. Seriously, from a human point of view, there will be a breaking point where you can go kill herself if she wants because you don't care anymore.

And so i told her it will be good time for me to have a gathering with my own guy buddies.<br><br>The problem is that she wants me home by 10.30pm .. i ask why. She said 'Dunno. I just dun like my bf to stay out late. Usually I will reach home at 10.30pm so i wan my bf to do same.'<br><br>I tried explaining nicely to her that respect in a r/ship comes from giving each other space. I hardly had a all-guys gathering since like more than a year already. She tell me 'Why have all guys gathering ? I dun even have all-girls gathering'<br><br>I meet her almost 5 days a week. On days I dun meet her, we stick on phone chat a lot.<br><br>I asked her what if I need to work late or study my degree part-time ? got curfew ? Then she said 'no of course not la.. cos work and study need time.'<br><br>The i reminded her that she did tell me one thing b4 .. that she wants me to be happy and enjoy life. I told her you keep saying that but u just cannot let me have a decent gathering with my buddies. I dun like to be treated like a small kid.

All because she wanted attention. My boss then disliked my quality and efficiency in work. Told me to leave.<br><br>I brought it up to her. then after the real big fight where she nearly tried to jump, i coaxed her to come down. We then really tried to work things out.<br><br>Her plus points are : She tried to give me more space by knowing when to let me rest and in return i give her more assurance and accompany wherever possible. She cooks for me and in return i help out the dishes. She knows i am financially tight so she planned the budget we could agree on. She knew I had some problems with one of my guy buddy then she delibrately msn him (cos we all know each other) to find out what is the problem.<br><br>Sometimes as much as I try, I get caught in middle. My dad, after losing his wife.. (my mother passed away last year), sort of depends on me to some extent. He doesnt say much but he constantly hopes for some company at times. My gf is quite afraid of him, cos he is a very direct person. Hence she dun really like to come to my place.<br><br>Anyway, after the big fight, we really tried to resolve things. But of course a bit of bicker here n there. But at times she can be quite a kid and refuse to sort things out.<br><br>A little more background about her : She is a straight 'A' student in school last time, parents sort of forced her to study really hard. And sadly, she was raped by her uncle when she was very young. Guess thats why she is insecure at times.<br><br>Sorry my story comes in pieces. After typing all these out, somehow i got my own answer.<br><br>Will really try to make her feel secured.</div>

I think leon lai also..<br><br>she said something<br><br>"security comes from urself" (An quan gan shi zhi ji gei zhi ji de)<br><br>You can't GIVE someone security. Security comes from self confidence, maturity, learning to trust people, learning to handle rejection/hurt/disappointment.<br><br>You CAN give reassurance. But.. know that... reassurance cannot abolish insecurity. It can only pacify it temporarily. Don't fall into the trap of giving more and more and more, thinking one day she will understand.<br><br>The problem doesn't lie with what you are able to give her.</div>
