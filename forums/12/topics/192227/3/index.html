All because she wanted attention. My boss then disliked my quality and efficiency in work. Told me to leave.<br><br>I brought it up to her. then after the real big fight where she nearly tried to jump, i coaxed her to come down. We then really tried to work things out.<br><br>Her plus points are : She tried to give me more space by knowing when to let me rest and in return i give her more assurance and accompany wherever possible. She cooks for me and in return i help out the dishes. She knows i am financially tight so she planned the budget we could agree on. She knew I had some problems with one of my guy buddy then she delibrately msn him (cos we all know each other) to find out what is the problem.<br><br>Sometimes as much as I try, I get caught in middle. My dad, after losing his wife.. (my mother passed away last year), sort of depends on me to some extent. He doesnt say much but he constantly hopes for some company at times. My gf is quite afraid of him, cos he is a very direct person. Hence she dun really like to come to my place.<br><br>Anyway, after the big fight, we really tried to resolve things. But of course a bit of bicker here n there. But at times she can be quite a kid and refuse to sort things out.<br><br>A little more background about her : She is a straight 'A' student in school last time, parents sort of forced her to study really hard. And sadly, she was raped by her uncle when she was very young. Guess thats why she is insecure at times.<br><br>Sorry my story comes in pieces. After typing all these out, somehow i got my own answer.<br><br>Will really try to make her feel secured.</div></blockquote>Hmm....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

She told me she has this ex-schoolmate gathering, ex-classmates from her poly next week. And so i told her it will be good time for me to have a gathering with my own guy buddies.<br><br>The problem is that she wants me home by 10.30pm .. i ask why. She said 'Dunno. I just dun like my bf to stay out late. Usually I will reach home at 10.30pm so i wan my bf to do same.'<br><br>I tried explaining nicely to her that respect in a r/ship comes from giving each other space. I hardly had a all-guys gathering since like more than a year already. She tell me 'Why have all guys gathering ? I dun even have all-girls gathering'<br><br>I meet her almost 5 days a week. On days I dun meet her, we stick on phone chat a lot.<br><br>I asked her what if I need to work late or study my degree part-time ? got curfew ? Then she said 'no of course not la.. cos work and study need time.'<br><br>The i reminded her that she did tell me one thing b4 .. that she wants me to be happy and enjoy life. I told her you keep saying that but u just cannot let me have a decent gathering with my buddies. I dun like to be treated like a small kid. How to be happy when i have to keep looking at my watch ?<br><br>I tried 'bargaining' for 11pm but she refuse.<br><br>There was once she did come home late when she went pubbing with her gal fren. I reminded her about that incident and asked for explaination since she wants me to be home at 10.30pm. She was stumped.<br><br>But she refuse to give in. She refuse to see my point of view.<br><br>She doesnt keep in contact with her frens mostly due to her work schedule. But now that she is changing job with a regular office hr she will soon be able to meet up her frens. And I hope she will meet her frens more often so she will not 'tie me up' and also not be such a 'frog in the well' .. cos she keeps thinking she is right. She basically imposes her set of principles on me and expect me to follow.<br><br>Any suggestions on how to resolve this ?<br><br>Thanks<br><br></div></blockquote>The solution is very easy but messy. Just come home any time you want and if she makes noise just say orrr orrr orrr.... don't quarrel just say orrr until she herself tired and change the subject.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Security comes from self confidence, maturity, learning to trust people, learning to handle rejection/hurt/disappointment.<br><br>You CAN give reassurance.
