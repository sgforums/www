            <div class='col-md body'>What is purpose of life? It is to become happy. Whatever country or society people live in, they all have the same deep desire: to become happy.<br><br>Yet, there are few ideals as difficult to grasp as that of unhappiness. In our daily life we constantly experience happiness &amp; unhappiness, but we are still quite ignorant as to what happiness really is.<br><br>Happiness is a not a life without problems, but rather the strength to overcome the problems that come our way. There is no such thing as a problem-free life; difficulties are unavoidable. But how we experience &amp; react to our problems depends on us.<br><br>Buddhism teaches that we are each responsible for our own happiness or unhappiness. Our vitality Â– the amount of energy or Â‘lifeforceÂ’ we have Â– is in fact the single most important factor in determining whether or not we are happy.<br><br>True happiness is to be found within, in the state of our hearts. It does not exist on the far side of some distant mountains, it is within you, yourself. However much you try, you can never run away from yourself. And if you are weak, suffering will follow you wherever you go. You will never find happiness if you do not challenge your weaknesses &amp; change yourself from within. Happiness is to be found in the dynamism &amp; energy of your own life as you struggle to overcome one obstacle after another. A person who is active &amp; free from fear is truly happy.<br><br>The challenges we face in life can be compared to a tall mountain, rising before a mountain climber. For someone who has not trained properly, whose muscles &amp; reflexes are weak &amp; slow, every inch of the climb will be filled with terror &amp; pain. The exact same climb, however, will be a thrilling journey for someone who is prepared, whose arms &amp; legs have been strengthened by constant training. With each step forward &amp; up, beautiful new views will come into sight.<br><br>There are two kinds of happiness Â– Â‘relativeÂ’ &amp; Â‘absoluteÂ’ happiness. Relative happiness is happiness that depends on things outside ourselves: friends &amp; family, surroundings, the size of our home or family income. This is what we feel when a desire fulfilled or something we have longed for is obtained. While the happiness such things bring us is certainly real, the fact is that none of this lasts forever. Things change. People change. This kind of happiness shatters easily when external conditions alter.<br><br>Absolute happiness, on the other hand, is something we must find within. It means establishing a state of life in which we are never defeated by trials, &amp; where just being alive is a source of great joy. This persists no matter what we might be lacking, or what might happen around us. A deep sense of joy is something which can only exist in the innermost reaches of our life, &amp; which cannot be destroyed by any external forces. It is eternal &amp; inexhaustible.<br><br>We should compare who we are today against who we were yesterday, who we are today against who we will be tomorrow. While this may seem simple &amp; obvious, true happiness is found in a life of constant advancement. And, the same worries that could have made us miserable can actually be a source of growth when we approach them with courage &amp; wisdom.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A person with a vast heart is happy.<br>Such a person lives each day with a broad &amp; embracing spirit.<br>A person with a strong will is happy.<br>Such a person can confidently enjoy life, never defeated by suffering.<br>A person with a profound spirit is happy.<br>Such a person can savour life's depths while creating meaning &amp; value that will last for eternity.<br>A person with a pure mind is happy.<br>Such a person is always surrounded by refreshing breezes of joy.</span></div>

Nope. It doesn't mean that human would be without feelings then. It just means that one would have to accept that there're some things in life which are beyond our control, and mooding over such things just ain't too healthy on the long run. Learn that everyone has to die and accept that as part of life.</div>
