              <p>You can just keep in contact with her and see how things go for some time before deciding again whether or not you want to go ahead and woo her. If she can't really get over her ex then it would be hard for you to win her heart anyway. If after some time she still can't get over him, maybe you can consider finding another girl.</p>

              <p>Personally if crying can make you relieve all the buildup emotions, i find it an ok way to vent it out but you need to pick yourself up after that.</p>
              <p>Doing any physical harm to yourself is a totally stupid way to deal with any problems cos the only person you hurt will be yourself and those who really care about you but not the person who caused you to do it.</p>
              <p>Did she know you cry? Pluck up some courage and face her cos regardless what, you cannot always run away or hide from her or anyone else.</p>

              <p>Until you try it, don't say no. Even if you feel you might not be up to it, at least try your best and not just give up on your studies.</p>
              <p>You are still young and have a long future, don't just get yourself into shit over a girl.</p>
              <p>As i've said, if you are unsure about her know, give both of you some time to think. Give both of you 1-2 months, talk about it again after you cleared your mid yr exams. If she still can't get over her ex then its time for you to give up as well.</p>

              <p>The things you want from a gf can be furfilled by a good, close friend as well which could be of either genders. Sometimes gf's are not even the best persons to share negative things with.</p>
              <p>If she can't get over her ex and patch up with him, that shows how much she cannot get over him and even if you try to woo her, i doubt it would do much to change her decision. For you however, it would hurt alot more cos u put in even more effort and yet still fail in the end.</p>
              <p>Even if you 2 can't be boy girl friends, theres nothing stopping you from being beside her to support her as a friend and not always as a boyfriend. That might be better than totally lossing her.</p>

              <p>Would you be able to live with the fact that you on purpose breakup her? If you really love someone, you should be caring about her happiness and not try to possess her. Thats being selfish yourself and not showing you love her.</p>
              <p>Its too late to say maybe things would be different if you didn't know her now etc. You already do so just live with it. Everyone will have met people who have helped change their lives in many different ways and often these people do not forever stay in your life. Just appreciate what has been done to change/help you and move on from there to live your life to the fullest and not dwell at the same spot over something.</p>

              <p>As mentioned, i would suggest you give her some time to decide. If she can never get over her ex, its not likely she will accept you.</p>
              <p>You can still stay by her side and offer her help, support etc as a good friend. For all you know, 1 day she might be touched by your actions and decide you are more worth loving than her ex and that would be better than for you to intentionally cause something between the 2 of them.</p>
