              <p>The problem might not be with you but with her.  If you have time, have a read about articles on "Toxic Relationship" (just google it) and try to identify if you're in one of them.  If it turns out to be yes, It doesn't mean it's the end of the world or relationship as long as both of you are willing to work on the problems. </p>

              <p>i can be.. rather emotionally aloof. i don't think i'm able to cry even if someone close to me dies, (i don't know, i don't feel sad all the time, right, or cry at movies etc)</p>
              <p>the last time i cried, was over my ex, and that was years ago.</p>

              Males are generally not good in communication. You don't need to be a talker and expert in communication but just need to do it effectively. Unfortunately to be able to maintain good relationship or friendship, you will need to be able to communicate.
