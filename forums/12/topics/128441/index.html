He wants to bed you as soon as possible without paying for it. This type of guy will keep pushing the idea of sex into your head. Haha this type of method already so old liao no one using liao haha...  He must really be in heat to be using this.<br><br>I explain the method a bit for you to understand how he uses it.<br><br>He chose a so call easy target. he knows the target has no boyfriend or is alone at the moment.  He will try his best to ask the target out as he knows the best why to handle the target is to be as close as possible.  He will keep asking about sex stuff making the target feel curious and start asking him about it. Then he will push for the idea of sex into the target's head by slowly teaching the target to explore herself or to find out wat she wants in her sex life and give it to her. Then bingo he have sex with the girl after that laughing at the target for being so dumb. It will incease his ego and he will find another target.<br><br>This method require some time and effort to use but he make a very big mistake. He goes in too fast and never gain target's trust first.<br><br>Why I say his type of method already so old liao no one using is becos now days sex is like a everyday stuff. Just ask most of the gals this days if they  willing to  try it  and you can have liao no need to put so much effort lar.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">i find it very disturbing and uncomfortable... it's like i dun even know him well, how dare he said all those thing of me.. what is this idiot trying to do?<br>i felt an invasion of privacy when he asked me those qns... I now even fear to go out with him..</span><br><br>Ways to counter this method.<br><br>1) Change handphone without telling him<br>2) Totally ignore him. As his method requires the target to response but if target never response then no hope liao.<br>3) say that you are a lesbo<br>4)  attack his ego by saying like he cannot make it , he not handsome or he got no money, etc<br><br><span style="color: blue;">am i too sensitive?</span><br><br>Final thought : You are  right to be sensitive. YOu have to protect yourself have people like him and no one can help unless you are willing to help yourself.</div>
