I can't remember alot of things... like what I did yesterday.. cannot remember...<br><br>1) can't remember my primary school friends.. their names.. their faces even.... can't remember the life there...<br><br>2) can't remember my secondary school friends.... can't remember my life in secondary... even the teachers!!!<br><br>3) can't remember my poly friends.. can't remember what I studied there (everything!!!!)... can't remember my project supervisor even though it is only 2 years ago!!! can't even remember my lectuers...<br><br>4) can't remember almost every of my BMT mates... platoon and even section wise.. nid to take time to remember my section mates' names!!!! can't remember what I did there too...<br><br>5) can't remember even the ppl in my unit although I just left like 3 mths ago!<br><br>HELP! am I showing symptoms of getting senile?<br><br>Believe it or not, I'm only 22!!!! how.. I don't wan to get senile... but I just can't remember... even with photos.. I don't remember the person at all.. evidence is from my BMT foto.. can't remember that this person is acutally in my platoon and it is only 2 years ago!!!<br><br>And I mixed up dates ever so often... can't remember even my pin!!!<br><br>I really scared that I will forget that I ever posted this here!!!!<br><br>What is happening? should I see a doctor?<br></div></blockquote>Did you have photos of them or keep diaries, or their special gifts that mention them?<br><br>Frankly speaking, there is a saying: "One who hear would forget, One who see would remember, One who practises would understand."<br><br><strong>So you are not senile, just that you did not have chance to see them more to remember, or maybe your stress caused it.</strong><br><br>And so I would suggest you:<br>1) If there are chances, take photos of them.<br>2) Keep diary or gifts mentioning them.<br>3) Do some relaxing activities or do something you are passionate in. In this way you might rekindle your memory!<br>And 4) Train yourself again to memorize. Sometimes memory are very crucial for your success.<br><br>Cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>SGEMP</div>
