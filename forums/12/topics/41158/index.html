Being in such relation, is just like studying for the sake of studying, without any thoughts for your own future.<br><br>Then why in the first place she wanna be your gf?

            <div class='col-md body'>I got the same problem like yours, blowfish and I already gave it up. I could not wait until she rethink cos it's not like love,right. Love should come from the feelings of both parties. If she comes back to you probably it's just her compassion for you for what you did for her. I'm loveless now but feel quite happy and free at least better than continue getting sarrow. It's just my own idea.

It's like sacrificing your beauty sleep and wake up early to buy her breakfast and she gives a smile in return. From her smile you can see that she appreciates you and you feel happy from it.<br><br>But love is not about sacrifacing everytime, giving ur gf/bf watever you have.

She who doesn't like you at all.. and is willing to go with you.. WHy? Cos.. There's no other guys for her.. the one that she likes.. noone in her mind now.. And then you jus happen to be there.. She needed some companion.. And therefore she agrees to be with you.. She feels lonely... wanted someone there to love her.. care for her.. But however she couldn't find that someone.. BUt she found you.. As time goes by, if she really find her MR RIGHT.. She will go for that guy and eventually break up with you.. Would wan to see this situation take place and being hurt deeply???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Secondly, why bother to win her love back.. Since all the while her heart wasn't with you right from the start.. Meanwhile she's searching for her PRINCE and come and pick her up.. I will rather you to find another who will appreciate your love in return! Arent you "Yi Xiang Qing Yuan". In the end if both are not together.. You will be the one being hurt.. she will be happily with the one she loves..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Do some soul-searching and ask youself whether is worth doin all this to someone who cant be bother with you.. Whether you are her bf or not... it doesn't even matter... To her.. you are jus someone who can rely on for the time being... Would you prefer to see her happy always with someone she likes.. or to see her being so unhappy with someone she's doesn't love at all..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You got the physical side of her.. but you never capture her heart and emotions..... Think it through.. All the best to you!!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm...<br>I guess there are 2 sides to it.. had a friend who was kinda dumped. Even though we all told him to forget it, he still persevered and although nothing is certain, the girl is at least still willing to see him...because she is that important to him, he is willing to suffer (in a way) cause he plays 2nd fiddle to her friends. But he is happy in his own way.<br><br>I've been down that road before, and its just really painful. Liking a girl so much, yet knowing that you are never as important to her as she is to u. Hence after that I've taken a more relaxed approach to relationships. Have confidence in yourself, know what you are worth. If she doesn't like you for who you are, then what makes you think that she is going to learn to like you? Its a possibility, but its a gamble. If u don't feel really comfortable around her, or are constantly trying to impress her or find something to talk about/say just to keep the conversation going, then maybe she's not for you. If however you guys are fine, its just the matter of you wanting her more than she wants you, then turn inwards.<br><br>Its a funny thing, but I've found that girls place more importance to personal traits (in guys) such as confidence, power, personality, and humour. Build up your confidence and your communication skills-go out there and let your hair down, relax and have fun, stop worrying so much about what pple think of you or what kind of image you project. Learn to laugh at yourself more, and let people laugh with you.<br><br>Girls can sense these things. As long as there is a reason for her to respect and look up to you, she's going to come back to you..at that time, it will be for you to decide if u still love her the same way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

It's like sacrificing your beauty sleep and wake up early to buy her breakfast and she gives a smile in return. From her smile you can see that she appreciates you and you feel happy from it.<br><br>But love is not about sacrifacing everytime, giving ur gf/bf watever you have. There will be one day, whereby you realise that you have nothing left...only an empty shell and a broken heart.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>yup totally agree with u . although sacrifice is part of it but the other party must reciprocate ur feeling and thing that u do for her. she must appreciate what u have done for her or else will be like she treat u like a fool.</div>
