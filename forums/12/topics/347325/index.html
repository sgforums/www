              <p>I have a friend who has broken up with his ex-gf of 8 years about 2 years ago. The girl is the one who suggested the breakup, and the reason being he is just not a good bf to her after knowing each other for more than 10 years. When they broke up, the guy was devastated and has tried all means to get her back, but she was so cruel that she even rejected his proposal to get married. Now ... 2 years later, she came back to him and asked him back, he... on the other hand felt that he has owed her, as he has not been a good bf when they were together. He is a very responsible person and very loyal to who he loved. Therefore he decided to get back together with her.</p>
              <p>I felt that this is so unfair to the guy, as I've seen how he got hurt when they broke up... Just because she is not able to find another bf during these 2 years, or maybe she is already 34 this year ... or for whatever reason, she decided to take him back. What do you all think?</p>

              <p>What were her reasons for leaving him?</p>
              <p>He fell short of her expectations in what ways?</p>
              <p>No one will marry someone they didn't love so she wasn't cruel to reject his proposal. Besides, salvaging a failed relationship through marriage wouldn't have worked in his interest either.</p>
              <p>I think this has less more to do with your friend and less to do with his 34yo ex. He should learn to act in his own interest before taking the plunge again.</p>
              <p>If, like you said, he wants to revive this failed relationship out of obligation, he has serious issues to straighten out.</p>

              <p>I have a sec sch friend whom after one round of dating and finding the right person, ended up marrying his first gf and now they have a happy family with 1 kid.</p>
              <p>If the guy still feels for the girl and likewise for the girl, if she feels that he is still the one for her then I don't think there's anything wrong getting back together.  Ultimately if they don't get married then at least they have tried.</p>

              <p>hard to say. I think the main thing to look at is based on what criteria did she think of him not as  a good boyfriend years ago.</p>
              <p>If he still has not fulfilled those criterias yet then I think it be a better choice not to get together again in the first place.</p>
              <p>They are bound to be caught up in the same problem again.</p>
              <p>Just my two cents worth..</p>

              <p>I have a friend who has broken up with his ex-gf of 8 years about 2 years ago. The girl is the one who suggested the breakup, and the reason being he is just not a good bf to her after knowing each other for more than 10 years. When they broke up, the guy was devastated and has tried all means to get her back, but she was so cruel that she even rejected his proposal to get married. Now ... 2 years later, she came back to him and asked him back, he... on the other hand felt that he has owed her, as he has not been a good bf when they were together. He is a very responsible person and very loyal to who he loved. Therefore he decided to get back together with her.</p>
              <p>I felt that this is so unfair to the guy, as I've seen how he got hurt when they broke up... Just because she is not able to find another bf during these 2 years, or maybe she is already 34 this year ... or for whatever reason, she decided to take him back. What do you all think?</p>

              <p>ya.. haiz.. come to think of it.. i am really disappointed.. all this while waiting for her and hoping that she will accept me.. Suddenly know that she went back to her ex.  Its hard to digest, just could not accept it in the 1st place.. Also her bf of a opposite race, even more shocking. Call me racist or what, i am just not used to seeing her going out, kissing  and having sex with a bf of a opposite race. Sry</p>
