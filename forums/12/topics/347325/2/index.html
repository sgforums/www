              <p>ya.. haiz.. come to think of it.. i am really disappointed.. all this while waiting for her and hoping that she will accept me.. Suddenly know that she went back to her ex.  Its hard to digest, just could not accept it in the 1st place.. Also her bf of a opposite race, even more shocking. Call me racist or what, i am just not used to seeing her going out, kissing  and having sex with a bf of a opposite race. Sry</p>
