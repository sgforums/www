              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> It’s entirely up to his self determination to decide if she could provide him the happiness he seeks at the end of the day. Love doesn’t always run in a linear fashion because we are always placed in pluralistic circumstances that shape our every present moment and even that one micro tweak might be the catalysis to a different decision altogether. <br><br>Who says that a relationship of eight years will guarantee a lasting, fulfilling marriage? Probably only in the eyes of an outsider because in the eyes of a stranger, he/she is not part of that wholesome experience and we are always guilty of judging the quality of relationship based on its length. <br><br>Of course in reality, that’s completely erroneous.<br><br>Anyway, since TS is not the person involved, I shall not go on any further on that part. But I would like to address one other point:</p>
              <p>***</p>
              <p><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> The truth is that it’s not really him who has received unfair dues, much more than it’s you who is feeling the inequality. Your anguish for him is merely a representation of your own innate feelings for yourself – that someone, who once has treated a relationship so lightly, could haughtily return and claim her throne without even a need to contest for it. <br><br>And I will tell you how you have inevitably contributed to your own misery. <br><br>Your agreement to be involved in a non-committed relationship is, although a logical method of self protection, but this is precisely the agreement that allowed him to persist in pining hope for her because you have given him the consent to use you as an emotional substitute, without a concrete structure, and he doesn’t have the space to recover naturally from his ordeal completely. <br><br>I will illustrate in simple words: <br><br>When death of a relationship occur, every unwilling party will go through a natural grieving process, in which at the point of conclusion (when that happens) is always the realization and acceptance in their own irrevocable situation and the outcome of moving on, unless there are situations that halt this natural recovery. <br><br>Your presence and agreement in maintaining this non-committed relationship unconsciously allowed him to have an emotional shelter for everything else a relationship could offer, minus the responsibility. It’s almost like staying in the house, without paying the rent. <br><br>In another words, if he was once emotionally very attached to his ex-gf, then you merely acted (sadly on her behalf) as the tacit support he had once gotten, while endorsing his placid waiting for her. Surely, upon her return and without hesitation, he will leap over to her.      <br><br>Now a subtle form of self pity has manifested – you are probably feeling short-changed, pondering why he has still choose her, despite your quiet attempt to demonstrate your affection for him.<br><br>Your plight is brought about disastrously by the notion of non-commitment because if he was given a choice in the past: a situation where he has to firm the choice between (1) to learn acceptance, commitment and move on OR (2) to create an interim method, to remain uncommitted and to wait? <br><br>Theoretically, you tried to eliminate risk for yourself, thinking that you will be safe because this is an ‘uncommitted relationship’, but reality is such that once you have invested in that dubious deal, you <em>are </em>already into it – regardless of how you perceive your situation. <br><br>If this is truly ‘uncommitted’, then why is it affecting you?  <br><br>Maybe it’s self deception, under the façade of uncommitment. <br><br>P.S: All uncommitted relationship built on emotional grounds ends up in contradiction and is oxymoron. You can only have an uncommitted relationship if it’s built on physical grounds like sex because it entirely possible to have a sexual relationship, without paying the emotional dollars. You cannot be emotional and yet unemotional - just like you cannot exist yet not exist simultaneously.

              <p>BTW, there is some ex worth going back to.</p>
              <p>And some dont.</p>
              <p>Worth as in, does the person makes you happy, are you comfy with that person.  Do both of you enjoy each other companies and are you both prepared to work on the same goals.  Eg. Spending time together, financing a home, have children &amp; growing old together?</p>
              <p>Or is it going to become a relationship where one party preys on the other, giving headaches, heartaches or expecting higher standard of things without at first compromising with each other's shortcomings?</p>
              <p>Eg like, you expect your partner to start exercising and lose weight, but he/she dont.  And you end up often quarralling over those issues.</p>
              <p>Think everyone will remember their heartache, when one party expects somethings, but the other party does not deliver.  Or create more problems to mask the original problems.</p>
              <p>Eg, that person is suppose to stop smoking, but instead, the person creates a scenerio where he/she fights with you because you are stopping him/her from smoking.</p>

              up in contradiction and is oxymoron. You can only have an
              uncommitted relationship if it’s built on physical grounds like sex
              because it entirely possible to have a sexual relationship, without
              paying the emotional dollars. You cannot be emotional and yet
              unemotional - just like you cannot exist yet not exist
              simultaneously. (CloUdiSm) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>People don't simply quit a relationship. They break up because it's not working on some levels.</p>
              <p>Sometimes
                          people grow apart, they discover they want different things in life.
                          There's no right or wrong, good or bad. It is not a measure of staying
                          power or faith.</p>
              <p>The notion of "payback" is a sign of blame. Sure, we are entitled to
                          moments of painful doubt, resentment and regret before moving on. But imho, you only heal when you find the magnitude to forgive. :)</p>
