Alot of things that we don't see, don't hear, don't know... Are constantly happening.....<br>You should encourage him not to try so hard but instead try to sense his care and concern for you bit by bit... (Since you claim you ain't even feeling any yet, what's the use of having the whole packet of biscuits when you can't even finish a piece...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) Having him try too hard would only threaten to burst your relationship when times are tough... (Your bf in dilema, your relationship in dilema... BIG 'no no'....) Try to <span style="font-style: italic;">sense</span> his love for you by being more <span style="font-style: italic;">observant</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">appreciative</span> of things...

I say a leopard would not if it doesn't want to..... Having a very bad temper is in a sense a disadvantage... But the good thing about it? You realise that it's there and it's a potential poison for you....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  Just like a child learning to walk... We fall over and over again in our Life... But that doesn't mean we stop trying...? And after that, we learn to read, to communicate and then once again to understand our <span style="font-style: italic;">Love</span> for others.... I guess it's quite impossible for you to kick your bad temper overnight...? How about just being more tolerant of things...? Find out what are the usual trigger points and try to take up a DEFENSIVE POSITION to control your temper when they happens.... And when you're beginning to feel <span style="font-style: italic;">in charge</span>, why not try realising that many a time getting angry over something simply won't get you anyway far...? Is there really a use for the anger...? Nay... Let's KICK its ASS once and for all?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  And while you're walking along that line... Realise that there're no end to such things.... No matter where you have to stop though you try, most probably your bf would have realised that you're trying to change for the better by then.... And least to say if you're doing it for him?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>If you love him, I think you should start TRYING now...? Even in the future when you come into contact with other relationships (Not neccessarily BGR), the same problem would come and haunt you over and again.... So I say WHY NOT kick its ASS now...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><strong><br>i really feel so lost now... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </strong><br><br>Try seeing some scenery or things that would calm down your heart and emotion so that you can have a better grip of yourself? Also, there're self-help books available in bookstores and library....<br><br>I wish you <span style="font-style: italic;">luck</span>...? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's good to know that there is something you need to change in order to righten this relationship. But do you know what the reason is for attempting to change?<br><br>There has been countless debates on why someone could change becos of their partner. IMO this situation comes across to me in a two-fold matter:<br><br>FIRST:<br><br>No matter what we do, we are constantly changing. What we learn, feel and experience in life will inevitably change us (for better or worse) whether we like it or not. This is what i call involuntary change. Examples are aplenty: when we were kids we'd fight with our nextdoor nightbour or our siblings, but now we don't. SImplistic maybe, but it is!<br><br>Now when a person is in a relationship with another, they can consciously or sub-consciously change for the better of the <span style="font-style: italic;">relationship</span>. I say relationship because certain things that have happened beforehand invokes different behavior in a once-bitten-twice-shy manner. If a certain habit of yours manages to irritate the hell out of your partner you'll be certain to be mindful of not doing it while he/she is around and eventually you'll get rid of the habit. I still classify this as involuntary change becos usually it's done sub-consciously and it's sure as hell not voluntary! It could be out of fear, convenience or just becos you don't wanna hear him/her nag. Remember your mother not letting you eat snacks before your meal. I don't know about you, but I don't do it anymore, not becos I chose not to, but becos i was more or less forced not to. Now i'm just used to eating proper meals without snacking. (this is but ONE example ok! and it's getting out of point anyway...)<br><br>SECOND:<br><br>Voluntary change. This is a little trickier. This is the part where so-called true love comes in. For some reason, you seem to be pissing your partner off, causing him/her unhappiness, discomfort or irritation. In other words, you are <span style="font-style: italic;">hurting</span> them, and i sure as hell do not mean physically.<br><br>Maybe it's this simple: If you love them, yet you are hurting them, there is obviously something wrong! So you change, because you do not wanna hurt them so.<br><br>Now for the age old question of "If you love me, you will change for me." Because isn't that wat the voluntary change sounds like?<br><br>No.<br><br>I would like to rephrase it like this "My love for you will change you. I will not, but because you know i love you, and you love me too, this LOVE will change you."<br><br>Let love change you. Not fear, not anger, not convenience, not becos you don't wanna hear him nag or scold you.<br><br>If you still don't change, question the love. Not the person. Becos he shouldn't be the one changing you.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>
