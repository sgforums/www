            <div class='col-md body'>you know there are some guys that can REALLY handle gals who get angry for petty reasons. these guys just go out of their way to sweet talk and buy presents for their gf...<br><br>sometimes the gals are just wanting attention. there are no doubt plenty of attn seeking gals out there. this is by no means an insult to the female species. i find some attn seekers really "cute" the way they come up with ways and means to get it but i can see thru the "ploy" eheh<br><br>if i may stereotype, it's usually the younger gals that act this way. i guess it depends on wat kind of guy he is and wat kind of gal she is. if he's the kind that can "hong3" the gal then it's ok if the gal has an angry fit every few days.. now i'm just wondering when will the guy lose his patience and just give up one day.<br><br>i believe there are guys out there that will never stop "hong"-ing their partners. kudos to them!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br></div>
