              <p>Well, obviously those arent ur true friends man.. you go through fire, you go through shit to come out knowing who are ur true friends. U dont make same mistakes with the same people again. If they can do it once, they can do it again. So why still 'hang' with em.</p>
              <p>I got tons of friends man... from school to drinking friends to golf buddies to business partners to colleagues. There will be at least.. 1 .. in each of these that will burn your ass or help your ass. Thats just how it is. N thats just how u weed em out.</p>
              <p>I have strong belief in this concept because it has worked out for me. When u got friends willing to go all the way with u, even if it means jail,  like in court, at the witness stand, u know they are ur true friends. N it really touched me to know that yes i still got these bros out there that regard me as highly as i regard them. You build up on these relationships.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, i dun think i have much online friends. So i dunno is it a good thing or bad. Maybe because you cant go through the trials n tribulations with these online people, so i dun have any true online friends at all.</p>
              <p>Like i said, your character n attitude attracts what kind of people to and around you.</p>
              <p>So i hope you will find ur true friend/s oneday. Because it is really sad not to have any at all.</p>
