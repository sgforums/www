              <p>thats bull, all the times i could "get out" i stuck by with my "friends" so that they won't go down alone only to have the same people step on me to "get out of jail free" and then giving me advise like "you would have done the same if you were me, its nothing personal" </p>
              <p>people you trust as friends, those close enough to regard as family, all doing the same thing and giving me the same bullshit.so i'm pretty much of the same view as <a rel="nofollow" href="/users/193383">ItchyArmpit</a>.</p>

              <p>..... I shared your sentiment, got friends who told you they treat you as their own brothers or family members. In the end, they were the one who turned out to be the biggest assholes</p>

              <p>Well, obviously those arent ur true friends man.. you go through fire, you go through shit to come out knowing who are ur true friends. U dont make same mistakes with the same people again. If they can do it once, they can do it again. So why still 'hang' with em.</p>
              <p>I got tons of friends man... from school to drinking friends to golf buddies to business partners to colleagues. There will be at least.. 1 .. in each of these that will burn your ass or help your ass. Thats just how it is. N thats just how u weed em out.</p>
              <p>I have strong belief in this concept because it has worked out for me. When u got friends willing to go all the way with u, even if it means jail,  like in court, at the witness stand, u know they are ur true friends. N it really touched me to know that yes i still got these bros out there that regard me as highly as i regard them. You build up on these relationships.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, i dun think i have much online friends. So i dunno is it a good thing or bad. Maybe because you cant go through the trials n tribulations with these online people, so i dun have any true online friends at all.</p>
              <p>Like i said, your character n attitude attracts what kind of people to and around you.</p>
              <p>So i hope you will find ur true friend/s oneday. Because it is really sad not to have any at all.</p>
