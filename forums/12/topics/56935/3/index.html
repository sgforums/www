            <div class='col-md body'>here is some advice from a girl.<br><br>since u say u're a student, so i guess u must be quite young.<br><br>so my advice is - don't sweat it so much. who says u must decide now?<br><br>u have ur whole life to experience and explore, so take ur time.<br><br>what u think is such a big problem now (that u like men) will most likely be nothing 5-10 years from now.<br><br>in the meantime, learn as much as u can. there's a lot of books out there for gay pple. (but i dont mean porno lah!) i mean real books abt young pple's self-dicovery.<br><br>i bet u'll feel better and more sure of yourself after u read that u're not the only one who feel that way.<br><br>good luck!</div>

Besides, i know homosexuality is morally not right....well at least to me it's not right. And i really don't want to live the rest of my life w/o a gf and then settling down to marriage...i want to be 'normal', i want to have kids and all that.....<br><br>okok am i sounding a little paranoid here? Just thinking long-term.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess thats quite a natural feeling.<br><br>We all want to be like everybody else, and fit in.<br><br>But I personally think life will be very boring if like that!<br><br>Abt NS, sorry i got no experience so I dunno what its like. (Though from my friends comments - sounds like torture! hehe)<br><br>I guess it depends on the pple you get thrown with. If you find that they're not so tolerant, maybe its in your best interest to keep your confusion to yourself.<br><br>And save it for when you feel more secure.<br><br>Although sometimes I notice that the least likely of pple who you think will help you end up being your biggest supporter.<br><br>People are funny.</div>
