              <p>Haiz.. ang moh want to divorce send email ... siao boh...if my hubby 
              do that.. i will burn his house down to ashes...I digress...</p>
              <p>This type of problem is very common, like reading the same tabloid over and over again. So can you just stop being so dramatic ?</p>
              <p>You
               never provide full story... only piece meal info. to convince us you 
              are so innocent. Frankly, no one is innocent in these type of situation.</p>
              <p>In my previous post to you, I already said theres deeper issues between that man and his wife..</p>
              <p>You unknowingly stepped knee deep into shit.. then you dig yourself deeper into shit by doing more stupid stuff.</p>
              <p>That
               woman is already upset, then she saw this girl (you) trying to act all 
              mommy and nice to her husband... what else do you expect her to feel ? 
              Of cors she is more upset.</p>
              <p>Then inside she hope she was wrong, so 
              she confronts you and try to find out the truth.. and you insulted her 
              by acting like the bitch(unknowingly ? I donno, you tell me).</p>
              <p>you could have been more mature and made things clear to her, but you didn't, now she is FURIOUS.</p>
              <p>What
               do you expect a angry woman to behave ? Send you a present and chit 
              chat ?? Of cors she is going to explode in anger and punish both you and
               that man till the cows come home...</p>
              <p>If you are just wondering how
               to pacify her.. I suggest you let her know.. in a  MOST sincere and 
              calm manner that you are not a threat to her marriage , apologise for 
              your unruly behavior as you felt you were being attacked by her.. so you
               got on your defensive which made things worst for everyone involved.</p>
              <p>Let
               her know that you realised you overstepped your boundaries that day 
              when you thought you were just being kind to her hubby , as it is in 
              your nature and upbringing to show concern to people who is unwell.</p>
              <p>Apologise for causing such a big misunderstanding between her hubby and
               herself. It was never your intention to create so much grief.</p>
              <p>At 
              the end.. let her know that you hope she will forgive you for your 
              immaturity and inexperience and please forgive her husband.</p>
              <p>But a 
              word of warning tho... if you are lying and you go sleep with her hubby 
              later..she may come after you with a big cleaver... parang... so don't 
              play play hor.</p>

              <p>Pardon me hor... when you go see doctor... you tell doctor all your symptoms.. you don't tell doctor your finger pain... then expect doctor to diagnose you actually got breast cancer ok. So really, who is the irresponsible one here ? YOU ofcors.</p>
              <p>If she is unsatisfied , then ask her directly... WHAT must you do to convince her that there is really nothing between her hubby and you ? Lets see what she say..maybe she ask for ransom..</p>
              <p>BUT... it is likely that she DOES not want to be satisfied.. because she is punishing you for your bratty behavior towards her... not necessary related to her husband.. just using it as an excuse. So in this case.. no matter what you do..she will not want to be happy.</p>
              <p>OR, you are merely her punching bag for now... since her marriage is falling apart.. she need someone to vent her anger at... and you are the convenient target.</p>
              <p>Did you act cute ? yes you did. It was none of your business if that man wants to come into office or not when he is not feeling well...your job was get the document done, he want to work to his death.. that's his problem not yours....so you shouldn't have acted like the family nurse, cherp your little cutesy demand he should go home and rest..</p>
              <p>Who knows what else you've been doing for him...ahem... Monica Lewinsky ? Just sayin.</p>
              <p>Frankly, what is up with you and your big gigantic ego... do you really believe you are pure and innocent ? No you are not. Get over yourself already... you ain't no angel.</p>

              <p>My female colleague decided to meet her today and explain
                                      everything….</p>
              <pre>in short, according to my colleague, she admits her faults and making whole lots of mistake and sorry to me cos she wanted to save her marriage and shldnt so insane sending those smses to me....and suspecting as well as keep checking everything from her husband...cos her husband has informed her the divorce letter is on the way(today she will rcvd it, according to her husband)........its too late, now then you turn to reasonable person again......
                                      </pre>
              <pre>my colleague said she felt really regretful abt everything......hopefully, will be end.......
                                      </pre>
              <pre>(i hv learned an important lesson, its very hard that to get others people  to believe/understand, if u really innocent....u r not seeking problem but problem will seeking at u...all i can say i  m bad luck. the end of the day, only face its.....i shldn't sign in here to get advice in the 1st place)

              <p>Lucky you have a good colleague to help you sort this out and become your CO-guarantor that you are indeed not the slut she thinks you are.</p>
              <p>I hope you learned something from this incident.</p>
              <p>She regret is one thing, does not mean you didn't bring this upon yourself.</p>
              <p>Even if you are not the one today, coulda be someone else in your shoes.</p>
              <p>Human beings are suspicious creatures... more often guilty until proven innocent.</p>
              <p><strong>Just because you can convince yourself you are innocent.. does not mean everyone around you see it that way.</strong></p>
              <p>So it's best to take the high road and err on the safe side. There's some boundaries best left alone .</p>
              <p>Whatever is the outcome.. you still need to watch your back.</p>
              <p>I doubt she is going to let you off so easily.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <pre>no pretending, no acting, no act cute all were genuine....and all were true statements"<br></pre>
              <p>Uh huh... no pretending.. so all real lah ? ... you want to continue acting like that to married men? Or any married man with PRC wife ?  then be prepared to face more angry wives.  If that's what you want... ... your good colleage will only help you once... the next time you do this again.. she will not be there to pull you out of the pit anymore.</p>
              <p>You can only act the fool once.</p>
              <p> Besides, lets be honest lah... you don't feel sorry that she is getting divorced lah... in your heart , I bet you must be feeling so vindicated her marriage is done , yes ?</p>
              <p>I know... you never liked that PRC.. you despise them...yes? We know.</p>
