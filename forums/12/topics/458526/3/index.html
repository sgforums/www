                --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
                  
                  On Oct 6, 2012, at 11:05 PM, her husband wrote:
                  
                  
                  Dear Rachel (lawyer firm),
                  
                  Could you please find out THE FACTS on the following accusations :
                  
                  1) That I bought an appartment for xxx(me) ( viz. attached file sent to me on the 7th of October 2012  ) as my wife is accusing me of same but refuses obstinately to show me the corroborative evidence .
                  
                  Quote "So u bought apartment for her.
                  
                  ï’Œ
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  &lt;113129_001.jpg&gt;
                  
                  2) That xxxx(me) was with me in my studio in Switzerland during August 2011 , in Paris end August 2011 and with me again in Switzerland in August 2012 .
                  
                  My wife also asserts that xxxx(me) was with me in Geneva on the 10 - 11 and 12th of September 2012 and that we stayed at the Mandarin Hotel in Geneva the night of the 11th of September .
                  
                  Could you please ask Ms xxxx(my head manager) , the head accountant and office manager of xxxx(company name) where xxxx(me) works  and to whom I am a consultant to confirm ( or not ) if xxxx(me) was in Singapore , executing her duties , throughout those periods on oath  as well as xxx(me) .
                  
                  Moreover , my wife asserts that xxx(me) was with me in Myanmar on the 27th and 28th of April 2012 as well as on other occasions .
                  
                  She , of course , refuses steadfastly to present the evidence that would support such claims .
                  
                  She claims that my business partners , Mr xxx and Mr xxxx who always accompany me on my trips to Myanmar can corroborate this fact . ( I will provide you with their e-mail addresses ) 
                  
                  Could you please ask them to corroborate OR invalidate this preposterous accusation on oath .
                  
                  3) By checking through my Viber account ( which I do not use ) , she claims that xxx(me) is purchasing items / songs using my account and under my name .
                  
                  As I am technically incompetent with computers , could you kindly verify these facts .
                  
                  Furthermore , this Viber account "revealed" to my wife that xxx(me) lived " from time to time " in an appartment situated at 190 Dunearn road and had a computer there which I allegedly purchased for her and through which we communicated clandestinely .
                  
                  On the night of the 3rd of October , exasperated by her baseless and absurd accusations , I asked her to accompany me to this address in order to clarify the matter once and for all .
                  
                  It turned out that this was the Singapore Chinese girl's school ...... My wife asked them to show her the classroom  ( PE 1 ) in which she alleged that xxxx(me) was living " from time to time " ( ?....)  and in which was housed " the computer that i bought for her " .
                  
                  The schoolgirls that were sitting on the steps of the entrance and to whom she directed these questions laughed and told her  that this classroom as well as all others were closed and that this classroom , like all the others , was a mere classroom with school benches and NO COMPUTERS and that NO ONE LIVED THERE .
                  
                  Confronted with these irrefutable facts my wife was temporarily silenced ....
                  
                  4) Today , in a misguided effort to resend me the file which contained only the photograph of the appartment which my wife claims I allegedly bought for xxx(me) , she , mistakenly , sent me a VERY CONFIDENTIAL business file relating to the purchase of cathodes from a company that I trade with on behalf of the world's second largest trading firm , xxxx Pte Ltd .
                  
                  This shows that she is searching in every corner of my computer and could , as a result , compromise the secrecy of these transactions .
                  
                  This is a very serious matter which could cause me irreparable damage .
                  
                  
                  
                  ï’Œ
                  
                  ä»¥ä¸‹æ˜¯è½¬å�‘
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  &lt;113129_001.jpg&gt;
                  
                  
                  
                  ï’Œ
                  
                  
                  All this is very serious and exhausting and would greatly appreciate your examining in detail all these baseless accusations so that my wife be obliged to face the facts  however unpleasant it will be for her .
                  
                  Regards ,

              <p>To all the young girls out there,  simple rules when stepping into the working world.</p>
              <p>1. Do not act cute to your co workers, in this case the company consultant, no matter how cute he/she is. Especially the married ones. You won't know what kind of spouse they have.</p>
              <p>2. Do not be smug and insult their spouse when accused of flirting or acting cute. </p>
              <p>3. When your co worker tell u to shut up after u have muck up, please just shut up. Don't need to snub the accuser just because you think u are innocent.</p>
              <p>4. Acting cute does not absolve u from guilt, so stick to rule number 1.</p>
              <p>A sincere apology goes a long way. Don't ever think it is beneath you to say you are sorry.</p>
              <p>If u do not want to look like a thief, stop acting like one. </p>
              <p>Stupidity CAN get you into a lot of trouble, so think first before u act.</p>
              <p>when a angry spouse is out there punishing the betrayer, stay clear ! Payback is a long and extremely painful process.</p>

              <p>To all the young girls out there,  simple rules when
              stepping into the working world.</p>
              <p>1. Do not act cute to your co workers, in this case the company
              consultant, no matter how cute he/she is. Especially the married
              ones. You won't know what kind of spouse they have.</p>
              <p>2. Do not be smug and insult their spouse when accused of
              flirting or acting cute. </p>
              <p>3. When your co worker tell u to shut up after u have muck up,
              please just shut up. Don't need to snub the accuser just because
              you think u are innocent.</p>
              <p>4. Acting cute does not absolve u from guilt, so stick to rule
              number 1.</p>
              <p>A sincere apology goes a long way. Don't ever think it is
              beneath you to say you are sorry.</p>
              <p>If u do not want to look like a thief, stop acting like
              one. </p>
              <p>Stupidity CAN get you into a lot of trouble, so think first
              before u act.</p>
              <p>when a angry spouse is out there punishing the betrayer, stay
              clear ! Payback is a long and extremely painful process.</p>

              On Oct 6, 2012, at 11:05 PM, her husband wrote: Dear Rachel (lawyer
              firm), Could you please find out THE FACTS on the following
              accusations : 1) That I bought an appartment for xxx(me) ( viz.
              attached file sent to me on the 7th of October 2012 ) as my wife is
              accusing me of same but refuses obstinately to show me the
              corroborative evidence . Quote "So u bought apartment for her. ï’Œ 2)
              That xxxx(me) was with me in my studio in Switzerland during August
              2011 , in Paris end August 2011 and with me again in Switzerland in
              August 2012 . My wife also asserts that xxxx(me) was with me in
              Geneva on the 10 - 11 and 12th of September 2012 and that we stayed
              at the Mandarin Hotel in Geneva the night of the 11th of September
              . Could you please ask Ms xxxx(my head manager) , the head
              accountant and office manager of xxxx(company name) where xxxx(me)
              works and to whom I am a consultant to confirm ( or not ) if
              xxxx(me) was in Singapore , executing her duties , throughout those
              periods on oath as well as xxx(me) . Moreover , my wife asserts
              that xxx(me) was with me in Myanmar on the 27th and 28th of April
              2012 as well as on other occasions . She , of course , refuses
              steadfastly to present the evidence that would support such claims
              . She claims that my business partners , Mr xxx and Mr xxxx who
              always accompany me on my trips to Myanmar can corroborate this
              fact . ( I will provide you with their e-mail addresses ) Could you
              please ask them to corroborate OR invalidate this preposterous
              accusation on oath . 3) By checking through my Viber account (
              which I do not use ) , she claims that xxx(me) is purchasing items
              / songs using my account and under my name . As I am technically
              incompetent with computers , could you kindly verify these facts .
              Furthermore , this Viber account "revealed" to my wife that xxx(me)
              lived " from time to time " in an appartment situated at 190
              Dunearn road and had a computer there which I allegedly purchased
              for her and through which we communicated clandestinely . On the
              night of the 3rd of October , exasperated by her baseless and
              absurd accusations , I asked her to accompany me to this address in
              order to clarify the matter once and for all . It turned out that
              this was the Singapore Chinese girl's school ...... My wife asked
              them to show her the classroom ( PE 1 ) in which she alleged that
              xxxx(me) was living " from time to time " ( ?....) and in which was
              housed " the computer that i bought for her " . The schoolgirls
              that were sitting on the steps of the entrance and to whom she
              directed these questions laughed and told her that this classroom
              as well as all others were closed and that this classroom , like
              all the others , was a mere classroom with school benches and NO
              COMPUTERS and that NO ONE LIVED THERE . Confronted with these
              irrefutable facts my wife was temporarily silenced .... 4) Today ,
              in a misguided effort to resend me the file which contained only
              the photograph of the appartment which my wife claims I allegedly
              bought for xxx(me) , she , mistakenly , sent me a VERY CONFIDENTIAL
              business file relating to the purchase of cathodes from a company
              that I trade with on behalf of the world's second largest trading
              firm , xxxx Pte Ltd . This shows that she is searching in every
              corner of my computer and could , as a result , compromise the
              secrecy of these transactions . This is a very serious matter which
              could cause me irreparable damage . ï’Œ ä»¥ä¸‹æ˜¯è½¬å�‘ ï’Œ All this is very
              serious and exhausting and would greatly appreciate your examining
              in detail all these baseless accusations so that my wife be obliged
              to face the facts however unpleasant it will be for her . Regards ,
              her husband</p>

              <p>Having lived in USA for many years... I've seen enough to know they are no different from non ang mohs in many many ways.</p>
              <p>Ang mohs like to think they are better than people of other races. ( similar to Sg men thinking they are better than Vietnamese men or men from less developed countries)</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, our local culture re-enforced that idea on them. We treat them (expats) better than we treat our own kind, simply because we want them to feel welcome.. which is part of our upbringing to be a good host.</p>
              <p>So they do received more respect than they truly deserved, and we did give it to them. Resulting in them really believing they are higher beings than us.</p>
              <p>In fact, I find some of their behaviors somewhat backwards. They really arn't as good as we thought them to be. <strong>They are just human beings like you and me.</strong></p>
