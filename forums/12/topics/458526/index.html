              I am being harassing by a china woman and accusing me having an affair with his husband by a very simple joking manner in sms related to work "yes mum" then i replied "good son". i had reported to police twice but seems like no help at all. That woman still harassing me by callings/smses/emails anytime she likes. Pls help and advise me....i am afraid that china woman came out of no way to harass me in the middle of no way to insult me in public or....cos i do not know what she will do.....
              
              This incident happened sometime in early Jan12. i received a call from a china woman, asking to meet up with me etc....the following incident as follow :
              
              I had received numeral miss calls between 6am â€“ 7.30am. When I woke up at 7am for morning toilette to get ready to work. My phone rang again and I picked up the call, a china woman accent looking for me(calling my name), the tele-conversation as follows :
              
              [Date : 6 Jan 2012 ; Time : 7.20am]
              China woman : xxx please.
              xxx : Yes, speaking. 
              China woman : Can you speak mandarin.
              xxx : Yes, who is that?.
              China woman : Can I meet you?.
              xxx : Who are you, why you want to meet me.
              China women : you knowâ€¦
              xxx : Knowing what?. Who are you?. Youâ€™re not even telling me who are you, why should I meet you.
              China women : you knowâ€¦
              
              Then I just hang up the call as I thought this china woman either got something wrong or got the wrong person with the same name as me or else it scams. But she calls back and I did not want to answer the calls. Then I received her sms said â€œ I donâ€™t want u loss face thatâ€™s why call u, but if u donâ€™t mind. We will meet in ur office.â€�    
              
              After reading her sms, I felt more puzzle as no friends of mind knowing where my office and I did not have any china friends either. By saying that, I assured that lady definitely got the wrong person. After that, I totally forgot about this incident.
              
              Around 11am, my colleague (his husband) called office and apologized to me this morning calls then I realized his wife was from China and I asked him what happened and why she kept callings  me so many times early in the morning. I told him that your matter better settled by yourself. I have nothing to do with you matter and donâ€™t came to me.
              
              When my colleague(his husband) came to office, I asked again why she kept callings me then he told me his wife suspect we are having an affair because she discover a sms in his mobile which was work related issue, he replied to me in a joking manner â€œYes mumâ€� and I replied â€œgood sonâ€�.
              
              He asking helped from my another colleague trying to explain to her in mandarin.After short period of time,thing did not get well, that china woman using her husband mobile phone as well as her mobile phone or block/unknown calls to disturb me.in the middle of the night or early in the morning.... Despite, I replied and warned her in sms said â€œI  donâ€™tâ€˜ know whatâ€™s going on n nothing to do btw ur matter. Stop harassing me again, if u do n I will report to police.â€� Unfortunately, she did not believe and replied me in Chinese â€œè¯·è‡ªçˆ±â€�.

              <p>Lets see, is his phone issued by your company ? <span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  ">And your phone is also company issued ?</span></p>
              <p>Basically , you are caught flirting with this married man.</p>
              <p>You may not be the only one his wife is going after. There are possibly other women he flirts with outside work.</p>
              <p>You cannot hide behind "work related issues". Always keep communications business like and strict about office ethics and behaviors.</p>
              <p><span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  ">
              </span></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In my work, we had to deal with a lot of sexual harrassment problems before, so now every employee goes for compulsory yearly "reminder" training about work place sexual harrassments and how to avoid it.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Keep private communications private, do not mix with work place comms..there are too many cases of office affairs attributed to "work related" interactions. Its just a lame excuse. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">We are all mature adult workers, able to control our behaviors and desires.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>You may think your "good son" tex reply seemed innocent to you.</p>
              <p><span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  ">it may not be the case for him or his wife, if he never have a good trust record in his marriage.</span><span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);  "> </span></p>
              <p>Your colleague may be having marital problems at home, and now due to your text being so personal, she has more reason to believe he is being unfaithful.</p>
              <p>I suggest u keep records of the texts and emails and note down time of calls and caller ID. So that in any case u can Use as defense .</p>
              <p>Your colleague need to go for marital counseling. If he can't work it through, u will need to escalate to your management. if he need to , he should leave the company and start elsewhere. </p>
              <p>As the saying goes, don't shit where u eat.</p>

              <p>The police will not do anything in your case, because it's a civil infringement. Not criminal.</p>
              <p>Now that u have all your evidence and recorded support, u need to first talk to your management and explain to them the situation, inform them u have no choice but to commence civil litigation against the co-worker. Your management may either step in and try to resolve the issue , or they will give u the blessing to go ahead and sue his wife.</p>
              <p>Either way, at least u have done your part in letting them (management)  know, as the legal action between co-workers may change the dynamics within the work environment.</p>
              <p>If u get the go ahead to file legal suit, u likely start with a cease and desist letter drafted by lawyer/paralegal.</p>
              <p>Now, if that woman is just out to punish u, she likely will stop.</p>
              <p>But if she is out to punish her husband, she may continue until he leaves the company. His marital problem may be very deep rooted, but as an outsider, we won't know.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>
              <p>Add:I am assuming there's really no sensual or sexual activities between u and that co-worker. But if there is/are, then be prepared for things to turn ugly really fast.</p>

              <p>Why she can hound you like that?</p>
              <p>Very easy to answer.</p>
              <p>Because you can makan one. You don't know how to fight back. You don't know how to retaliate.</p>
              <p>Be mean.</p>
              <p>Give as good as you get. If you can't, she will continue, because you can't do anything, and she can feel it. So she keep on poking and smiling.</p>
              <p>Think how to hurt her back, think how to sabo the husband, make the husband do something or make them fight and quarrel. . Let her come to the office. All the staff should have already know the situation. Have a three-some arguement in the office. When she comes, call security to standby, make sure she don't have a chopper.</p>
              <p>Don't be afraid. People only bully people who are afraid.</p>

              Totally agreed with manchat.
              
              You gotta be firm and defensive enough to prove that you are innocent. Do not be afraid if you've done nothing wrong.
              
              The bad guy always survives.

              <p>May I know, are u single or married ?</p>
              <p>Dont believe your colleague, what he told u may be him trying to act the victim.</p>
              <p>He is trying very hard to discredit his wife, make her look like a crazy woman. A lot of cheating men resort to this when they get caught.</p>
              <p>A woman don't just go crazy for no reason. You are a woman yourself, you should know.</p>
              <p>He did marry her, so she wasn't that crazy as he paint her to be now.</p>
              <p>Unless u hav the chance to hear her side of the story, best u not side with your colleague at all.</p>
              <p>When I was single I had many married men tell me sob story about their marriage, wife don't love them anymore, haven't had sex with wife long time. They no longer in love etc etc, all these so I will pity them and agree to be their mistress. So be careful the lies men will use to get into your panties.</p>

              <p>I agree that u need to be very cautious. If she is staying in Singapore and her marriage is falling apart, she will have no reason to be civilized . The most is she get deported back to her home country and she probably wouldn't care. If she falls, she'd probably want to take someone down with her as well. </p>
              <p>I suggest u stay away from that male colleague and try not to travel on the street alone if you can. </p>
              <p>fYI : Caucasians are no less/more trustworthy as any guy on the streets. I live in the USA, the Ang MOHs here not very faithful to their spouse much. 60% are divorced and many are cheating on their spouse. Even at 50s or 60s, they still want their second or third marriage with other women. Of course not all are like that, but I've seen enough to know they tend to be concerned with their own self interest more than anything else.</p>
              <p>Anyway, it's best to let your family, co-worker and friends know of your situation. They can help watch your back.</p>
              <p>I think u should still inform HR , just to keep them in the loop, <span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.296875);  ">the last u want to be is collateral damage or the sacrificial lamb.</span></p>
