            <div class='col-md body'>Dearest All,<br><br>Trying to make the most of my 1 day's stay here (or rather, a few hours, hopefully), so I'm gonna write about something new today, &amp; share my experience.  Partly because I'm damn bleedin' cheong hey <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Anyway, I've noticed that some of my friends bring this topic up at times when we talk: After some time, things seem to become kinda stale, &amp; there's No new places to go, Nothing exciting to do, etc.<br><br>I won't speak for everybody, nor every couple, since I've experienced different things with ex-partners, but I shall base it solely on the greatest love of my life (we're still together, for those who're wondering).<br><br>Now, the both of us are pretty much easy-going (which sometimes results in a whole lotta problems in decisions), &amp; since we've been best friends before, it's kinda like spending time with a best friend anyway.  Ultimately, we do the most boring things: Go to movies, go to pet farms, go to pet shops, go walking around aimlessly, watch VCDs/DVDs, have reading day, etc.  Sounds VERY normal, don't you think? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Of course, once in awhile, we go nuts &amp; decide to explore Singapore (getting hopelessly lost in the process) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Anyway, the gist is, we manage to enjoy what we do, &amp; the feeling of boredom isn't really there.  Instead of taking the MRT, we try to take buses to our destinations in order to have a more scenic route.  Then we point things out to each other, talk, tease, &amp; tickle each other (think DECENT, please!).<br><br>This weekend, we're having a VCD/DVD weekend because the weather is so hot, it's No fun to go out.  We've been planning all week what we're gonna do: go to the supermarket to buy snack food (very unhealthy but absolutely necessary for these kinda things), make up a list of oily, greasy, yummy fastfood to order (don't really like Mac's though), shopping for more movies to watch, making jelly &amp; fruit cocktails together <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>We're still having so much fun preparing &amp; making a list <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  And we're gonna have as much fun shopping for the stuff in our casual clothes (being Vainpot, we'll still wanna look nice, of course!) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Bottomline: Perhaps him being my best friend prior to us being together really helped.  We still do many of the things friends do, cruising together, reading, talking, buying stuff, pillow fights (geez), etc.  But perhaps that is the secret to Not being bored?  Treating your other half like your best friend, having fun doing the stuff that you'd do with your best pal, planning, etc?<br><br>We're planning for X'mas now (I know I know, it's still far away, but I'm NOT exaggerating!), &amp; it's still in its early stages, but we're planning for something special : )  What a wonderful way to pass the time : )<br><br>FeowFeow</div>
