            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all the replies. Office politics is still something I trying to grasp. Will try out some of the suggestions.<br><br>I have been trying to be nice to everyone. I don't hang out with them outside work so hard to build rapport. Maybe I offended some seniors unknowingly by not joining them for activities and they influence others to treat me as an outcast. My EQ not very high.<br><br>Some of the senior colleagues that are not so political, have advised me to try to fit in with the others. No choice, I want this job means I must change the opinion of these senior colleagues that dislike me, as it is hard for a newbie like me if people are constantly giving you a hard time and not willing to help you at work. Very vexed with handling these pr matters.<br><br></div>

              <p>hmm do u join them for lunch?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>personally i find lunches a very good bonding time to be with
              colleagues.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i don't normally socialise with colleagues after work or on
              weekends either but we have lunch together.</p>

              <p>But what if they all have their own cliques already and never even invite you for lunch? It is hard to fit into an existing clique lor...Even if you see them in the cafe and join them for lunch, you will notice that they don't even talk to you but talk to their other friends...</p>
              <p>Kinda having this problem also at my new workplace...sometimes will miss my old office where I can click with almost everyone there and everytime lunch time I will get invited to go to lunches...but here right now I have to resign to eating at my desk :(</p>

              <p>they never ask then u go ask them lo say can i have lunch with you guys? very seldom ppl will reject one. they talk to their friends, listen to their conservation, then respond accordingly lo. i mean like even if they never talk to you, by responding like nodding ur head, u are actually one step away from communicating with them. by doing that, you are also joining in the conservation though.</p>

              <p>I have asked them before, they said yes, but thing is I feel like super extra during the lunch cos I was sitting in between two of them, and then both of them talked to each other over me, as if I was a piece of transparent glass like that. It just feels weird when everyone is talking to each other except me, it just makes me feel unwelcomed and uncomfortable to the point that I do not want to join them anymore :|</p>
