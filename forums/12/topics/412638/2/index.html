              <p><br>Thank God no. But last time I was 10 year old boy, one man try to kidnap me. Lucky I fight back and shout a lot. Man got scare and run away.</p>
              <p>Last time I read Yahoo news got one British Man pretend to look for his dog. So he trick a young 12 year old boy to follow him to the woods to look for his "dog". The British man promise to pay the boy. So when he take him to woods, nobody watching, the Man rape the boy ! Man was arrested by british police but boy is phycologicaly sar for life.</p>
              <p>Now I become Macho Man go to gym and learn martial art. Watch out for Pedophile ! Pedophile Man, they like small boy 10 year old, teenager 15 year old and young man 20 year old. I now 29 year old, so old hag oledi, men find me unattractive (thank god) but woman find me even more attractive because I got more $$$$.</p>

              <p>Here is a story about a PHOTOGRAPHER SERIAL KILLER</p>
              <p><strong>Rodney James Alcala</strong> (born August 23, 1943) is a convicted <a title="Rape" href="/wiki/Rape"><span style="color: #0645ad;">rapist</span></a> and <a title="Serial killer" href="/wiki/Serial_killer"><span style="color: #0645ad;">serial killer</span></a> who was <a class="mw-redirect" title="Death penalty" href="/wiki/Death_penalty"><span style="color: #0645ad;">sentenced to death</span></a> in <a title="California" href="/wiki/California"><span style="color: #0645ad;">California</span></a> in 2010 for five murders committed between 1977 and 1979, and is thought to be responsible for others.

In 1964, after what was described as a "<a class="mw-redirect" title="Nervous breakdown" href="/wiki/Nervous_breakdown"><span style="color: #0645ad;">nervous breakdown</span></a>", he was diagnosed with <a title="Antisocial personality disorder" href="/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder"><span style="color: #0645ad;">antisocial personality disorder</span></a> by a military psychiatrist and discharged on medical grounds.<sup id="cite_ref-laweekly_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-laweekly-7"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>

              <p>In 1971, after two campers noticed Alcala's FBI wanted poster at the post office and notified camp directors, he was arrested and extradited back to California. By then, however, Tali Shapiro's parents had relocated her family to Mexico, and refused to allow her to testify at Alcala's trial.<sup id="cite_ref-CBS_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-CBS-8"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Unable to convict him of rape and attempted murder without their primary witness, prosecutors were forced to permit Alcala to plead guilty to a lesser charge.

              <p>Less than two months later, Alcala was arrested for violating parole and providing <a class="mw-redirect" title="Marijuana" href="/wiki/Marijuana"><span style="color: #0645ad;">marijuana</span></a> to a 13-year old girl who claimed she had been kidnapped.

              <p>During this period Alcala also convinced dozens of young women that he was a professional fashion photographer, and photographed them for his "portfolio." Most of those photos remain unidentified, and police fear that some of the women may be additional victims (see below).</p>
