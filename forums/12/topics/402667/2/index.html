              <p>By saying things like "topics must be something i like" tells me you are a self centered person.</p>
              <p>By harping on your disabilities and thinking everyone hates you because of that tells me you are overly self conscious and seriously lacking self confidence.</p>
              <p>Being angry over little things tells me you have anger management issues.</p>
              <p>You tell me, would you like to befriend someone who is overly self conscious, seriously lacking in self confidence and extremely self centered and angry?</p>

              <p>Somewhat, I can't get along with people in the digital world,even here and in life too, Squabbles between the bus-forumers are nothing new, (I am a bus fan by the way)They kept picking on me by asking to admit fault, and they think they are always right, and think I like to lie to them.</p>
              <p>Since young, I always got bullied for being special, and my condition was serious enough for me to get discharged from NS, I can't understand why people can't accept me, I hate random topics especially, and if my (church) friends talked about something random, my earpiece would be on, gave a black face because I knew these people are liars by saying they can accept me (which in fact they can't) and I always tell myself that having 'em is never a good thing, because these (church)friends of mine are as good as traitors, and would be better off observing buses.</p>
              <p>I know bus forumers who see this are going to call me a person with no life, as for the rest would probably say that I like to shift the blame.</p>

              <p><br>Hey, in my opinion you are no better. dn;t be thick skin because thick skin people piss people off. he is already being himself. Only sales people and during working on ground zero you need to exercise on how to deal with people, and even some minor insigficant people you can just ignore them. i bet if i continouously knock into you everyday in your life you will get pissed off sooner or later. Also he seems to be sticking tohis believe.</p>

              <p>Hey seriously since if you think everyone in the world is unacceptable and keeps picking on you. I think you should consider dying.</p>
              <p>Surely make a big hooohaa. Better still,spread word that you are going to kill yourself in forums, spam emails, write a note on the mirror with your blood on the wall. After that, open the window and jump. Make sure you die if not, people will keep picking and laugh at you if you didn't.</p>

              <p>And yes, your life would be miserable, because most people would automatically shun people like you, and you'll be left to wallow in your own despair. (your loved ones may end up suffering with you)</p>

              <p>Everything has a possibilty of something bad happening, but dont let it stop you from doing it. Its called faith. So why do you sit infront of your com ? Isnt there a possibilty of your com exploding in your face ? So why are you still risking your life ?</p>
