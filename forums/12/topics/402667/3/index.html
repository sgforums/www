              <p>Haiz aiyoh, you not read the whole thing. I tell him to be himself ma. Person be himself mean not be irritating people, you know what I mean? People who pester like sales people are insecure people. I am telling him to be more confident and smarter next time. Think before he talk. But if he think he do the right thing then he must stand up for himself, that is what I am telling him.</p>

I used to be something like you , but i swing the other way. Instead of creating barriers between ma and the world, I devised lies upon lies to build my image in front of my friends to make myself feel good. It was so bad to the point that the image that i created for myself , this 'mask' i had put on , it is not my real self. Its great if you can sustain this image and all , but you can't and thats what happened. I was kinda shunned for a while, thinking back on what i had done , i felt that it was definitely foolish because I realised that everyone is UNIQUE in a way or an other. The point is that i feel that you cant accept yourself , that inherently leads to you not being able to accept people as well.  So unless you change the way you are going , i don't think you will find the true love you seek.</p></div>

              <p>Hmm.. I don't wanna sound long-winded, but I just wanna say that you need to change your perspective. I know that some people are true hypocrites or backstabbers or whatever you call it, that's why we distance ourselves away from them. I've my fair share of them. But ultimately, it's still your choice whether you are gonna shun everyone else, thinking they are all the same, or reflect on yourself what actually went wrong that makes people ostracize you. I'm sure a loner will still crave for a true friend. Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/sunglasses.png" alt="sunglasses.png"></p>
