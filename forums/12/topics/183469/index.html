The lack of trust issue will be brought up and the r/s will become sour. try as much as you can to maintain the harmony in the r/s and hope for the best. But its also best if you prepare for her leaving you one day. Good luck my friend.</div>

Watch it SINKS with your DECAYING THOUGHTS...? End of the day, it won't even matter if the guy's still interested in your gf... It won't matter if your gf is interested in him... Won't matter if she decides to stay for the better of you... Because your relationship is SIMPLY WEAK... Wouldn't even be able to take a single punch from HIM... From her(?)... From YOURSELF... Or ANYWHERE ELSE....<br><br>If your gf's really trustworthy, have you realised that you've just allowed a guy who's interested in your girl... So EASILY getting his way...? Because this girl's bf is not capable enough to keep his mind cool...?</div>

I wish I could do the same.<br><br>Update on the situation:<br><br>That guy asked my girlfriend to go to a study group which he is organising. Sure enough, there are other people around, but I feel that if she really loves me, she wouldn't even think of going. The sad thing is, she is thinking of going. She decided not to go, but not because she realised going would hurt me, but (I THINK) because she cannot handle the stress she had if she is going (meaning, i feel that she decides not to go because of STRESS, not because of ME).<br><br>I want her to go because she would be unhappy if she doesn't go.<br>I don't want her to go because she would be yet giving another chance and I frankly don't like her to go.[/b]</blockquote>Practically, we, guys shld take a little step behind on such things...try not to be too narrow-minded n protective over your gf...Possesiveness shld not be maintained at HIGH level...A little bit of possesiveness is healthy in a relationship..but too much of it, kills the relationship...<br><br>Be open-minded abt it...if she wanna go for the study group, then just let her go...you can't stop her for it's her choice, not yours..furthermore, it's her studies...Even though if that guy'll to ask her out, let him be...u can't stop that guy for doing such things...in the end, whether your gf wanna meet him or see him, it's her choice...again, you can't stop her....<br><br>If she'll to tell you that this guy asked her out or watsoever, it means something....it means that she doesn't wanna hide anything from you and she's honest with you so as to maintain a healthy relationship...<br><br>Whether she wanna let known of her status...i.e. attached or not...is really not a big issue or concern...it's a minor....<br><br>Most importantly, you must be postive in your gf...have faith n trust in her...since she's willingly to tell you so much, it already means that you're important to her, otherwise, why the heck would she wanna tell u all these things....she could jolly-well just lie to you all the way... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks, everyone.<br><br>All of you guys' replies were basically the same as what my GF's close friend said (she's a good friend of mine).<br><br>Before that guy's appearance, she was under great stress, and I was all along counselling her etc. But after that guy appeared, I somehow became one of her stress factors too. By that, I'm letting that guy in.<br><br>And yeah, I'm a rather possessive guy, but I'm trying my best to tame that beast within me.<br><br>Thanks, everyone, for your advices.
