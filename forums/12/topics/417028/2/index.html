              <p>Although some accepted open marriage in their marriage life, but how well do they be responsible to the other parties?  Are their parties are also agreeable to open marriage this idea?</p>
              <p>If closed marriage cannot work well in our society, how well can open marriage work?  Closed marriage (means only one partner) requires love to maintain, does open marriage requires love to maintain? Is open marriage becoming open sex then? How do we cater for kids born from open marriage?  A lot of problems... our human race is far being so loving to one another, that we can endorse open marriage.. hahahahaha ... in legal and moral.</p>

              <p>what's the point of an open marriage? That by itself is an oxymoron statement. A marriage is supposed to be closed and monogomous between two heterosexual people.</p>
              <p>People these days take marriage vows too lightly. Seriously, marriage is not play play. 3 out of 10 marriages in Singapore end in divorce. That's an insane number! Be very sure who one is to marry and open eyes big big before getting married. Those vows are meant to be for life and a promise. So to make things better now there are open marriages because things don't work out?</p>
              <p>What's gonna happen next?</p>

              <p>An open marriage is a ''half-hearted'' commitment and to assume that it is marriage is fallacious.</p>
              <p>It is bound to be conflicting the tendency is to compare and that in itself is already neurotic.</p>
              <p>Where there exists such a so-called marriage - it is a mutual benefit scheme and the difference is in an open marriage it is probably and likely to an easy exit for either one. At the end , one can at most come away expereinced for the better or worse. It is bound to encroach in another relationship and marriage if it were to take place.</p>
              <p>Marriage in itself is not unhealthy but what is the prevailing fear and anxiety is whether ti can be sustained. It can be sustained presupposing two mature individuals are willing to share what they are and that makes a big difference. By sharing I mean, one is fulfillled in himself or herself and allows the other to partake of what one is.</p>
              <p>Today, many go into relationships and cement it into a marriage and on closer scrutiny - it is fear of loss, fear of collapse of onself cos one went into the relationship/marriage to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">find</span> oneself. Heaping/propping up a relationship, marriage with ''materials'' and ''children'' is not going to fulfil and that is the predicament of many. Many have children, cos it is the norm and also some unconsciously have children to prop oneself up - hence the children suffer. That is why many feel stuck and endure. Why has one to endure if one is already full within. It is beggary to expect another to fulful u and even worse to have children to fill oneself up.</p>
              <p>If one cannot relate to what one is, there is no way one will be able to relate to what another is. The quality of living is not about what one has or does but in the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ability to relate</span> and that can only come about when one has it within oneself first.</p>
