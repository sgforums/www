              <p>Not really harsh words, but seems quite hurting and ironical at that time.</p>
              <p>His buddy's grandma passed away in the same period when my mother was in critical condition in hospital. Everyone came and visited her except him; at that time I guessed I really need a support, especially from him.</p>
              <p>His words "My buddy's grandma passed away, it's very important that I stayed with him for the entire wake, every single minute and second. If you are telling me you need support like my buddy, forget it. U want to know the reason why? It's because your mother isn't dead yet, while my buddy's grandma has died already. Comparing the two of u, obviously my buddy is feeling much more pain than u are, so obviously he needs me around him every minute and second."</p>
              <p>It happened a year plus after we got together.</p>
              <p>My reaction? - Maybe I am cruel? I lost the heart to carry on with him the moment he told me those words. Even thou he came personally to visit my mum after the wake thing and after my mum has been discharged, but I already felt there was no point. From that moment on, he was 'cut out' of my life forever. </p>
