            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, there are number of things that I wanted to say about going back to time. Yes, there will be cause and effect, by doing so and you will never know what will happen if the history is changed.<br><br>However, there <strong>will</strong> be real time machine in 30 years from now. Scientists had been doing much research about it. (Those ebay one is fake.. trust me) The time machine might not be in use for the public but the military. Imagine if everyone used the time machine, what will happen to the world? Unless those professional people in the military are well-trained enough to go back to recover lost info or document.<br><br>I heard people saying about going back to time to 'save' the world? (tsunami for example) Well, if you really gone back to time and reported about what will going to happen before the tsunami strike, will anyone from that 'past' believe you? ok, let say Im from the future and im now back in time. I'm telling you all that there will be earthquake in singapore 1 hr later from now (touch wood). Will everybody evacute singapore just because I said that? (Ok, not really evacute but at least went to so-call safety shelter.) And if i told fire station about it, will they sound the alarm just because i said that? (1hr is a short time though)<br><br>In your shoes, you might think that if people dont believe me, they will die. So you try to make your stand to the government. Ok, the earthquake did happen (touch wood again) but after that what will you think that are going to happen? Yes, you save alot of life but you expose yourself as a time traveler. You will end up in the lab being research by the scientist  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  and they will force you to tell the truth about the machine.<br><br>For your information: There's infinite worldline as in when you travel back in time, you might land up in different worldline which is slightly different from current worldline(now). Furthermore, how are you going to face 'yourself'? Since any Â“youÂ” on another worldline would not be a mirror image, you get a slightly distorted feeling while seeing yourself, let alone the concept of speaking to yourself. (will not talk much about this as it's kinda off-topic and no one might be interested anyway <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> )<br><br>Thank You<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Sometimes I wonder what it is about Fate or Destiny that they have to be so inexplicably intertwined with our Lives. We can choose to believe or scoff at it...; yet most of the time undeniably they feature greatly in our choices in Life.<br><br>If I were to have the option to travel in a Time Machine, what would I choose to do? Go toward the Future, or go Back to the Past? I have mulled over this yet I always eventually come to an impasse where I know not what to do should I ever have to make the choice.<br><br>I'd like to go to the Past... 'cos there are so many things that I have left incomplete. The Wheels of Time can be cruel, and there sometimes isn't enough time to do and see everything that I would've loved to. But No : I Would never change a single thing about what had happened in the Past ~ cos every event, every tear shed, every laughter shared... have made me what I am today.<br><br>Then again, I would love to have a Peek into the Future...'cos I am curious about what the Future holds. Would I be happy having made a certain choice, or would it have been better for me to have listened to Reason?<br><br>Whatever it is *sigh* I have been blessed with so much so far in life, and for that I am grateful. Be it Emotional, Mental or Physical, I have gone through plenty to realise that there is always sunshine after the rain. And somehow... the choices that I have made and however the Future will turn out to be, I know that I have had and will not have any regrets.

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not really a fantasy but time machine <strong>do</strong> exists... in 30 years time. (GaLtwenty, this is my answer.)<br><br>But why do you all still wanted to go back when it's impossible for you all to do so? Like i said eariler, it's <strong>for military use only</strong>.<br><br>It might be a fantasy to think that going back is a childplay and you can do whatever you want. Remember, there is still another 'you' exist in the past. How are you going to face it? Do you think you can change the way of treating your boyfriend/girlfriend better when another 'you' are still in the past? Also, another 'you' might treat your boyfriend/girlfriend the same way you treated them before.<br><br>Thank You</div>
