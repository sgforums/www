It may open up another Pandora's Box, and we know that the World does not need any more than it already has to handle!

I think you got the concept wrong. Butterfly effect is the process whereby you went back to the past and you have the memory of the 'future'.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Sweet[Saint]<br><br>I do not know where you get your concept of butterfly effect from but I am sure mine is not from time travelling nor form the movie "Butterfly Effect".  My understanding of butterfly effect is from the nature science theory which stated that what you do now will have an effect in the future.  I wont want to say too much about it for it may bored many of you to sleep.<br><br>However, even though our understanding of the butterfly effect is different, I believe we do agree that time machine cant really help us much when coming to change the past for a better future.  It doesnt matter whether it is just you with a memory of the 'future' or it is a 'past' you with a 'future' you working together.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> anyway I  believe 'Final Destination' have nothing much to do with time travelling and not really much to do with butterfly effect.<br><br>Regards<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Sweet[Saint]:</div><div class="quote_body">Erm..
