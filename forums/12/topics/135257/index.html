Some girls are like that one la.Some act cute and all so that they can get the attention that they want especially the guys that they are interested in.<br><br>You sound like someone who is quite popular in class, maybe thats why she purposely play a trick on you as she thought you can take it? If I read correctly, you scolded her in front of everyone in class, maybe she became very embarassed and angry at you for making her lose face? Then her best friend also collectively ignore you because.. they are best friends??<br><br>Anyway like many said earlier, if she is more than just a friend to you then perhaps you have to make the first move to talk to her.. Even if shes just a friend  to you, ignoring each other will lead uneasiness which in the end will only make you less happy right??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Just curious, how old are you all?</div>
