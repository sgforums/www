Foremost, the inability to feel content with the situation, the desire for things to go in your way and not knowing what you want. These mixture of feelings are offer tiggered by sudden change of issues which you can't adapt immediately.  To make matter worst, whenever you have mood swing, the people who loves you will give in to you.  These people will, not knowlingly, encourage your mood swing behaviour, thus deminish your sense of self-control on your temper.<br><br>Knowing that you are hurting those around you due to your mood swing is a good start.<br><br>To solve this issue, you will need some encouragement, understandings from those you hurt and to practise a number of things.<br>1. Understand yourself.<br>- How well do you know yourself?<br>- How contented are you with things, people and issues?<br>- Do you think before you act?<br>- Do you worry too much? When in problem, do you share your worries?<br>- What makes you happy?<br>2. Your ability to handle situations.<br>- How independent can you be?<br>- Can you let go when things didn't go your way?<br>3. Practise Openess<br>- Do you desire to understand the feelings of others rather than the desire for others to understand you?<br>- Do you allow others to be close to you?<br>4. Accepting the situation<br>- Why worry when there will be a solution ultimately, if there is no solution, worrying won't help either.<br><br>Consistence mood swing will destroy relationship and friendship because most of the time, they don't understand what's wrong with you and what's to be done.  It always ended up that people will leave you alone till the storm is over.<br><br>Come to think about it, you may be in mild depression without yourself knowing. Regardless, do spend sometime thinking through the above.  If these doesn't help... well, just keep your distance from everyone and calm yourself down.</div>

Till today, i nv knew the reasons why i have so little frens left.. but guess its partly cause of my subconscious mood swings..<br><br>On the other hand, it depends a lot on what kinda of frens u have... how supportive &amp; understanding they are. Some ppl are "lucky" to have frens, partners stand by them.<br>MOst of my frens jus shun me when i am depressed....<br></div>

Pick urself up, do something meaningful and think positively.<br><br>Reading may be boring to some, but it helps alot when u r alone; battling with ur mind. I suggest u can read books on self-help. U can get them from MPH, TIMES, Kinokuniya or Popular bookstores. Reading is essential to every human beings, it widdens ur knowledge and teach u abt life.<br><br>Your mind creates ur experience of reality, so u have to make ur mind ur fren.<br><br>When u allow ur mind to be ur enemy by toleratin its negative self-talk, u aren't being ur own fren.
