I could be mistaken, but it seems to me a lost cause -- his heart is not with you any more. The silliest thing you could do now is to waste another minute waiting for him to come back to you.<br><br>Keep your mind away from him by engaging yourself in the activities you used to do without him, such as shopping with your so-called sisters, hanging out, going to gym classes, picking up your old hobbies, etc. Make yourself happy again. Fall on your family and friends -- it makes standing up again easier after you stumble.<br><br>This comes rather late for an active response thread, but hope it helps.</div>

Sometimes feelings can be developed through time.<br><br>If you really can't foresee yourself ever being with E, then it'd be better not to waste his time any longer -- let him know that you want him to be just a friend. If you wish to be mean and run the risk of losing a friend in E, then go ahead and let him know about your feelings for Y.<br><br>Speaking of Y, his relationship may be unstable, but he has not broken up with his girlfriend yet, right? So do you want to be the third party? It'd probably be advisable to stay on as just his friend for the time being and get to know him better. Infatuation alone is never a good indication of the subject's suitability as a partner.</div>

I'm not necessarily saying that he is one of them, but there are guys I know who profess love for their ex-girlfriends so that they could still enjoy some fun for "old times' sake" while getting kicks from their new girlfriends.<br><br>From the tone of your post, you must be dying to hear support for you to wait. Sorry to disappoint you, but if you don't wish to get hurt again, if you don't want the "thing that had gone wrong" to go wrong again, it'd be better if you move on.<br><br>Even if the ex-boyfriend broke up with his current girlfriend now to be with you, there is no guarantee he would not do the same thing to you to go back to his current girlfriend. The only guarantee you could get from such an action is that he is not one who treats relationships seriously.</div>

It is unlikely he would destroy the current girlfriend's faith in him to be with you. Because this time, his heart is set on her. Maybe he was just consoling you when he 'set' the date, a la "My Best Friend's Wedding" style, with you.<br><br>I wouldn't probe on what you did to make him lose that faith in you, but here's hoping you have learned your lesson and wouldn't do it again to the next guy who comes along.
