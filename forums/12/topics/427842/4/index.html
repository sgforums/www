              <p><br>Personally, I feel that due to the influence from the western country like the states, our ladies, in generally, have a shift on their mindset. This could be the effects of globalization. We asian have a collectivisit mindset, while westerner have individualistic mindset. I believe it's largely due to globalization that we are losing a lof of our unique asian characteristics found in ladies. </p>

              <p>Like I said in another thread it has to do with upbringing.</p>
              <p>Parents bring up girls in SG to be independent so that they will not be cheated by their partners and able to stand on their 2 feet if anything happens.</p>
              <p>Whereas for the guy, they are still brought up with traditional values, thus resulting in the mis-match.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if you want a wife to stay at home to cook, clean and look after the family, make sure you hv the means to do so, if not seriously you will be better off to find someone who can help bring home the bacon as well. </p>

              <p>Or have you considered getting a bride from China or Myanmar or Cambodia ?</p>

              <p>China bride should not have language barrier leh. And since its chinese, you may not feel as stressed as compared to having a viet wife gua? Many china girls are very pretty and sweet looking wor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I even saw on TV before theres this matchmaking agent say that their agency gets paid by China ladies to help them find Singaporean husbands. The guy dont have to pay much to get hook up with them.  Heard of it before anot?</p>

              <p>elindra jie jie, i dont think so loh.. my kiddish looks aside, what are the thresholds of a girl liking a guy older than her ?</p>
              <p>A 23-26 year old girl will prefer a guy near her age rather than another thats in his 30s right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes you are spot on about malaysian girls from which state. But we are singaporeans how to woo those far far away one wor. KL so far .. can woo also cannot maintain lah ..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But one drawback is that msian girls get attached very young one. You will find that its harder to find msian girls at their 20s who are still single than in spore loh.</p>
