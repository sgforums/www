            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p> </p>
              <div style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 100%; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #ffffff; padding-top: 0.3em; padding-right: 0.6em; padding-bottom: 0.3em; padding-left: 0.6em; font: normal normal normal 13px/1.231 arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I made an account just to reply to you as you are plain pathetic. I was searching for my ns stuff but you are just sad. So I am going to help you. Follow my list below.</p>
              <div style="padding-top: 0.3em; padding-right: 0.6em; padding-bottom: 0.3em; padding-left: 0.6em; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: #ffffff; font: normal normal normal 13px/1.231 arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; text-align: left; line-height: normal; margin: 0px;">
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Things you need to do for yourself:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">1) Most important thing you need to work on now is your confidence. Do up your hair, wear perfume, go to the gym and good clothes (please ask friends' opinion). I will recommend Zara as a starter. But eventually, as long as you feel good, nothing else matters.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Walk with your back straight up, head held up, never look down. Always sit in a relaxed position, talk in a smooth and slow tone, not too slow but calm.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">2) Start talking to the little people (cleaners, security guard, stall owners, etc). Make yourself known to the people of places you frequent.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Let me give you a situation, because you made an effort to know people of a place you frequent say - Mcdonalds. You enter the restaurant and people starts saying hi to you, you know the manager and staff. A chic at the corner might be dying to know who you are, popular people get laid, you have to start small and build your way up.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">When you have the confidence to strike up conversation with people without shaking like a retard, you are ready to talk to women. Don't ask for their number first, just talk to them and get familiar with that feeling.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">3) Build your "aura". Since you are 29, the bad boy aura doesn't really work as a charm since women your age matured quite a bit. BUT REMEMBER BAD IS GOOD IN THE EYES OF WOMEN, you can figure out how much bad you need. So I recommend the stable(income)/mysterious attitude. Mysterious does not mean you go home and do shit in your basement. I will give you an example of being mysterious.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">When a women ask you what do you do for a living, answer "You can't handle it." There are various replies but you shall learn them yourself. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">4) Read horoscope, I know most people are skeptical to this, but that is good for you. Since you might be the few that actually reads it, it gives you a headstart. Horoscopes are not 100% but they are 50% - 90%. ONLY read personality and behaivour horoscope, DO NOT READ DAILY HOROSCOPES. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Point being, daily horoscope gives you that mentality that what happens in the horoscope is actually going to happen to you. So you subconciously think it's going to happen to you and act that way. Do not under estimate your subconcious - you think you lose, you lose.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">5) When you finally get a number or get a date, the initial interval for replies are hours. DO NOT REPLY IMMEDIATELY. Also, always be the one to end the conversation and act like you are busy. In the game of women, you have to act, women act pretty damm well, you just have to act better.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Ignoring a woman certain extend will drive her crazy, if you just got dumped the best way to get her back is to ignore the fuck out of her and give her time to miss you. Seriously, many do not agree but well it's your choice. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">6) Different women has different taste, that is why read the horoscope. YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE STAR YOU ARE BORN UNDER. Dress according to the type of woman you are dating or want to attract, some women like men with collar shirts, some like tank tops. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">NOW....</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I can write a book to teach you how to totally sweep a woman off, but these are good enough to get you started. It's totally up to you to believe me, I just stated some points for you.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEN GROWS AS THEY AGE (Total opposite of women, so cheer up)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Women look for 2 things in a guy - CONFIDENCE &amp; SENSE OF HUMOUR. Work on both of these.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">ps: You have a decent command of english, good point. Now go, I will come back and give you more tips if I have the time. </p>

              <p>let me share a quote.</p>
              <p>Women will always cost, but marriage is the most expensive way to go. If you want to pay for it, go to Australia. For a hundred bucks you can order a whore over the phone. Half an hour later she arrives at your door... Fresh and hot, like a pizza.</p>

              <p>I know the divorce situation very well because I've worked in Family Court before.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Every single day I see couples divorce. All past relationships are left behind, all thats remains is a fight for maintenance, the house, the car, the kid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The drama that enacts everyday is surreal. Its like a TVB episode unfolding before your very eyes. All the shouting, finger pointing, crying, begging.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ya i have to agree the woman's charter is really detrimental towards guys. Judgement tend to favour the women. When the woman is vicious, its very scary. I find myself having to console despondent fellows after a divorce hearing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Really, its very depressing to be seeing this everyday. Its a miracle that I could still harbour positive aspirations towards marriage. </p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p> </p>
              <div>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I made an account just to reply to you as you are plain pathetic. I
              was searching for my ns stuff but you are just sad. So I am going
              to help you. Follow my list below.</p>
              <div>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Things you need to do for yourself:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">1) Most important thing you need to work on now is your confidence.
              Do up your hair, wear perfume, go to the gym and good clothes
              (please ask friends' opinion). I will recommend Zara as a starter.
              But eventually, as long as you feel good, nothing else matters.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Walk with your back straight up, head held up, never look down.
              Always sit in a relaxed position, talk in a smooth and slow tone,
              not too slow but calm.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">2) Start talking to the little people (cleaners, security guard,
              stall owners, etc). Make yourself known to the people of places you
              frequent.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Let me give you a situation, because you made an effort to know
              people of a place you frequent say - Mcdonalds. You enter the
              restaurant and people starts saying hi to you, you know the manager
              and staff. A chic at the corner might be dying to know who you are,
              popular people get laid, you have to start small and build your way
              up.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">When you have the confidence to strike up conversation with people
              without shaking like a retard, you are ready to talk to women.
              Don't ask for their number first, just talk to them and get
              familiar with that feeling.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">3) Build your "aura". Since you are 29, the bad boy aura doesn't
              really work as a charm since women your age matured quite a bit.
              BUT REMEMBER BAD IS GOOD IN THE EYES OF WOMEN, you can figure out
              how much bad you need. So I recommend the stable(income)/mysterious
              attitude. Mysterious does not mean you go home and do shit in your
              basement. I will give you an example of being mysterious.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">When a women ask you what do you do for a living, answer "You can't
              handle it." There are various replies but you shall learn them
              yourself. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">4) Read horoscope, I know most people are skeptical to this, but
              that is good for you. Since you might be the few that actually
              reads it, it gives you a headstart. Horoscopes are not 100% but
              they are 50% - 90%. ONLY read personality and behaivour horoscope,
              DO NOT READ DAILY HOROSCOPES. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Point being, daily horoscope gives you that mentality that what
              happens in the horoscope is actually going to happen to you. So you
              subconciously think it's going to happen to you and act that way.
              Do not under estimate your subconcious - you think you lose, you
              lose.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">5) When you finally get a number or get a date, the initial
              interval for replies are hours. DO NOT REPLY IMMEDIATELY. Also,
              always be the one to end the conversation and act like you are
              busy. In the game of women, you have to act, women act pretty damm
              well, you just have to act better.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Ignoring a woman certain extend will drive her crazy, if you just
              got dumped the best way to get her back is to ignore the fuck out
              of her and give her time to miss you. Seriously, many do not agree
              but well it's your choice. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">6) Different women has different taste, that is why read the
              horoscope. YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE STAR YOU ARE BORN UNDER. Dress
              according to the type of woman you are dating or want to attract,
              some women like men with collar shirts, some like tank
              tops. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">NOW....</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I can write a book to teach you how to totally sweep a woman off,
              but these are good enough to get you started. It's totally up to
              you to believe me, I just stated some points for you.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEN GROWS AS THEY AGE (Total
              opposite of women, so cheer up)</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Women look for 2 things in a guy - CONFIDENCE &amp; SENSE OF
              HUMOUR. Work on both of these.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">ps: You have a decent command of english, good point. Now go, I
              will come back and give you more tips if I have the time. </p>

              <p><br>no I did not. but judging from the current situation and it's direction.... it's sooner or later kinda of decision that I'll have to make (i.e. foreign bride).
