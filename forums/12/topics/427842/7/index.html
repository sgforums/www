              <p>Hey, you are not any less of a person than yer frens. You are
              not handicap. You have two hands and two legs. You are a normal
              function person. So what have u to complain about?</p>
              <p>It is not yer time yet to get married. Kapeesh?</p>
              <p>Go enjoy life, meet more frens n get to know more people. Take
              initiative instead of complaining. I hear Chocochip complain all
              day long about the government and high prices like a barking dog
              but nothing get done for this ccb chocochip dude.</p>
              <p>You will find the Miss Write so as long as you don't suffer an
              emotional breakdown. Yer state of panic, insecurity due to
              loneliness is scaring off potential partners. Be yerself and enjoy
              life.</p>

              <p>I created so many stories. The Wife stealer story you oso want to believe. No more ammo ah? Go ahead and belief la, I just created tis story to test people responses because I was in the process of successfully winning the heart of a girl. I just want to see what happen the situation was different. This is what you call "scenario planning". To be successful in winning the girl you like, you have to plan ahead. Fortunately she is not attach or married so I was successful. I just wanted to see what people reaction would be had she been otherwise. You really think that I would go after my cousin wife when I am the eldest of all my cousins and none of them are even married yet...stupid cow Chocochip.</p>
              <p>This is why you will always be failure in life, chocochip. You are gambler, yet you don't know how to do scenario planning and plan hypothetical circumstances.</p>

              as expected, ur insults are getting weaker. 
              
                                child molestor? anymore bullshit? whats next? im a granny rapist like you? 
              u are getting stale, and seriously, i dont think anyone in the forum are convinced by ur er, "truth" about me. u have this weird fetish of calling me names hor, issit becuz girls reject u and called u the same names? or deep down u wan to confess to the whole world u r indeed a sick freak but u are afraid so u resorted to projecting it onto me? tsktsktsk. 
              
              if theres one "story" out of your many "stories"  that i dont believe, its got to be ur market value.
              face it, u are not wanted at all. 
              lastly, its not me whos taking revenge. its u. 
              u know damn well u started this whole affair, in ur "why is julian khor so kelian? so nice so wholesome but nobody wants him" thread.  n u couldnt take some comments cuz perhaps it hit one of ur many weak spots. 
              
              and oh, im still fking sure u tried to hit on ur cousins wife. i confirmed it with them.

              <p><br>hi andrea, well, most of my peers are already attached. So no chance for any group dating even if i wanted to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would not flatter myself as what a cute looking guy. No i'm not that. I'm just a decent, normal looking guy thats sincerely looking out for a caring and understanding companion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, I tend to be on the shy side. To be honest, I have a strong innate fear of rejection from girls. Cos theres always a thought that, well the girl will always pick the most good looking guy, the richest one from the lot. Why would she wanna pick me, or .. why would she like me, you know? And if you go approach her, she ignores/reject you, I'll be making a fool and embarass myself in front of everybody. Scary to even think of.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think for many guys or at lease myself, i only talk to girls on the premise that i already knew them. Its very awkward to be approaching a girl you dont know leh. I do not judge a girl for her looks like how pretty she is and from there i go and approach the prettiest and try to know her.  I'm not a superficial person loh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I feel the type of girl i will really fall for just need to look normal, is someone who shares similar sentiments, easy to communicate with, that is pleasant to spend time with. But honestly, its these type of girls that are the hardest to find =\</p>

              <p>Having said that. Back to the topic. xiaogougou I think you should get a grip on yourself. Being complecent because of your looks is not going to get you anywhere. No girl wants a guy who has low-self esteem. Just be happy to be who you are ^^ </p>
              <p>Yeah I agree with SBS2601D. You can try making more aquaintances. You don't have to be bold and go around asking for contact numbers. You can just talk and after you are familiar with the person then you can go on further to ask for a contact number. </p>
              <p>Either way you have to expand your social network and also have better self-respect and esteem.  Jiayous ^^</p>

              <p>xiaogougou I feel u man, although im attached and all but the fact that i look so much younger den my age, at least half a decade younger... affects me, in terms of society growth to hooking up with mature ladies (or in fact ladies my age). As a matter of fact, age affects me from head to toe, but learn to make use of this fact, being young as a weapon, alot of people wants to be young like us, they're envious of our looks.</p>
              <p>Learn to talk beyond ur "looks", what i'm tryin to say is, though u may look young, but speak mature. NEVER let them have the though that not only u look young, u act young too and poof u'll be their younger brother for the rest of ur life.</p>
              <p>Get across to them that being young is a priveledge, make across to them that to be able to look so young at such age has all the benefits in the world, and allow them to think that u feel dam bloody comfortable looking the way u look.</p>
              <p>All these comes after u being comfortable in urself, if ur low self-esteem is causing all these looking young problem, den build some self-esteem. Make some achievements, go for social parties, present urself, portray urself just be confident in urself and everything will go right...</p>

              <p>xiaogougou I feel u man, although im attached and all but the fact that i look so much younger den my age, at least half a decade younger... affects me, in terms of society growth to hooking up with mature ladies (or in fact ladies my age). As a matter of fact, age affects me from head to toe, but learn to make use of this fact, being young as a weapon, alot of people wants to be young like us, they're envious of our looks.</p>
              <p>Learn to talk beyond ur "looks", what i'm tryin to say is, though u may look young, but speak mature. NEVER let them have the though that not only u look young, u act young too and poof u'll be their younger brother for the rest of ur life.</p>
              <p>Get across to them that being young is a priveledge, make across to them that to be able to look so young at such age has all the benefits in the world, and allow them to think that u feel dam bloody comfortable looking the way u look.</p>
              <p>All these comes after u being comfortable in urself, if ur low self-esteem is causing all these looking young problem, den build some self-esteem. Make some achievements, go for social parties, present urself, portray urself just be confident in urself and everything will go right...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks man, It sucks. Man I tell you it really sucks.  i could simply stand within a group of teens and blend in totally. I often get looked by teenager girls, Can You Believe It?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And when pple get to know my actual age, some jerks would actually make fun of me, are you having a mid life crisis? God dammit, i really wished at that point of time I could have punched their manhoods right out from their backs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I surmise the social parties you meant are SDN activities? Though unwilling, but I may not have a choice but to compel myself to go. I'm not expecting that i'll meet anyone suitable there, rather feel its a big risk that i'll waste my time, money and pretty much get left out in the event though.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However I realised that my mentality has changed. in terms of character, I've matured and am a different person now. I've become even more responsible, and focused. I know what I want. Work hard, be more dependable, for the woman I will eventually meet, hopefully.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But as time passes on day by day, my hope diminishes along with it too.</p>

              <p><br> hi andrea, well, most of my peers are already attached. So no
                      chance for any group dating even if i wanted to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I would not flatter myself as what a cute looking guy. No i'm
                      not that. I'm just a decent, normal looking guy thats
                      sincerely looking out for a caring and understanding companion.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, I tend to be on the shy side. To be honest, I have a
                      strong innate fear of rejection from girls. Cos theres always a
                      thought that, well the girl will always pick the most good looking
                      guy, the richest one from the lot. Why would she wanna pick me, or
                      .. why would she like me, you know? And if you go
                      approach her, she ignores/reject you, I'll be making a fool and
                      embarass myself in front of everybody. Scary to even think of.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think for many guys or at lease myself, i only
                      talk to girls on the premise that i already knew them. Its very
                      awkward to be approaching a girl you dont know leh. I do not judge
                      a girl for her looks like how pretty she is and from
                      there i go and approach the prettiest and try to know
                      her.  I'm not a superficial person loh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I feel the type of girl i will really fall for just need to look
                      normal, is someone who shares similar sentiments, easy to
                      communicate with, that is pleasant to spend time with. But
                      honestly, its these type of girls that are the hardest to find
                      =\</p>

              <p>the more u are desperate (for the lack of a better word) for a something, the harder it is to find. so maybe you shld just spend some time gng out with your friends and just chillout, calm yourself down.</p>
              <p>if you're schooling/ working, maybe you can just hangout with your peers/ colleagues of different genders but just treat them as platonic friends, don't talk to females with the objective of finding out if they can be your potential girlfriend. just make as many new friends as possible- male and female, and keep in touch with your old friends as well.</p>
              <p>the more you think about it, the more it wouldn't happen; you'll find a good partner in time to come, but first you'll have to work on your self-esteem and try to be a more friendly and approachable person. and don't be afraid of approaching females- from a female's viewpoint, i would rather talk to a guy that approaches me but who i might not really have interest in, rather than a guy who i might have interest in but who does not approach me- usually, females are even more afraid to make the first move, so if you don't approach a girl whom you're interested in, you might not have a chance to get to know her at all. provided that you're at least decent-looking and polite, the girl would not likely reject talking to you. but do note that you should approach the girl with the aim of being friends first.</p>
              <p>good luck^^</p>
