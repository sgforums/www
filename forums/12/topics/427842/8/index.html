              <p>hi <span style="line-height: 17px; font-size: 15px; color: #333333; font-weight: bold;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #ff7129;" href="http://sgforums.com/users/278095">xiaogougou</a>, </span></p>
              <p>I do hope that you have sort out your issues.</p>
              <p>I am a firm believer of marriage, thus encouraged relationship too.  However, one need to learn to live with people before able to appreciate your partner.  Once, a senior told me (when I was a teen) that unless we can cope with loneliness, we are not ready for relationship.  If we insisted, we will end up having broken relationship, and still not know where has gone wrong.</p>
              <p>Believe me, go get a life, attend some social function, and enlarge your circle of friends, and that will also indirectly enlarging your opportunity to meet new female friends.  Observing from how those girls behave in a non-threatening activities will also help you sized up which is suitable for your life partner. </p>
              <p>All the best to you.</p>
              <p>Regards, </p>

              <p><br>Dear Sir,</p>
              <p>Everyone must grow old one of these day, including me, and you have all my respect for the time that had past in your life, be grateful that you is able to grow to nice golden age with a graciousness of a human, there are many who cannot even walk, talk, think or worst, died young.</p>
              <p>There is no immortality, accept the old, because ultimately, we all will grow old, wither and be gone for good. No that peoples do not agree with me, just that humans like to evade the sensitive bad side of our true life, they also want the good thing, good ole times and good comfort zone, and that is when they met up with bad times, they get so depressed and start to have mental problem and all those nonsense.</p>
              <p>Since young, i knew that I hv to grow old and pass away one day, that is why i am alway happy and see bad thing happening in my life as easy as eating roti prata.</p>

              Ts,
              What u are being now is the meaning of life. There is no meaning, and it is folly to assume tht one can find life.
              As for wanting a relationship, one who cannot relate to what one is (accepting of oneself) is most likely to want another to save oneself or to add oneself.
              
              Intuitively, it feels like loneliness. Loneliness is a negative state ... and when that aspect is not reconciled within oneself - one may have many things in life - money, friends and what-not, even a friend, spouse or ... it will never go away. There are merely traps. 
              
              Clinging and possessiveness would b e the mainstay. It does not matter whether it is money, things or ... it is all the same. It is an alienation ffrom one''s being (ie, well-being)
              
              These are props and the anxiety of losing things or .... will have onself in a psychological morass cos one would try to preserve that sense of self (derived/acquired outside of oneself) and inevitably that self-preservation imprisons one. It is fine to hanker for things, friends or ... but one has to be cognizant of the pitfalls and the concomitant anguish and anxiety that would shadow such a stance(s).

              <p>While you desire to have relationship, i desire to be out of one but cannot. Dun be desperate. You might nt know what you are going to have. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many of my friends prefer to stay single......no commitment is the best. I always advise them on not to get married and have kids. Life in SG is too stressful unless you ba long long all the way. How to have kds and take care of them?</p>
              <p>Recently, my blood pressure went in pre-hypertension stage. My kid is driving me mad all time when i am back from work or from school. (Partaking a part time master programe). There are times where i purposely go home around 1130pm or midnight. My wife is mildly retarted and has OCD...which increase my blood pressure.</p>
              <p>I really hope you stay single and if you need to have company for the night, theres always services out there to satisfy you.</p>
