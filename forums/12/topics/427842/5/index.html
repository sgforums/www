              <p>A dating experts once said that to me, that you should spend 30% of your time meeting new people. I respectfully agree to what he said, and I really tried it out. the result was good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I went to tagged.com and meet some new friends. 90% of the guys at Tag are preverts and sicko. But I'm sure you'll be able to date a girl at 25~ 28. I tried dated a few girls (18~ 20) and it seems good. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> Usually is some dinner and movie~ but nothing developed further than that because of my work committment issues (i own a tiny biz).

              </p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">When a girl plays hard to get, she is testing how far you will go. However, you have to differentiate between "playing hard to get" and "just not interested". </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Most above average girls usually plays hard to get to "filter" their suitors, girls always want you to work for it, those that give up too easily because they lack confidence always go home sulking "nah, she's too good for me, not worth the time."  </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong>Girls look for the alpha male who makes his own rules, if you find yourself backing away too easily - your not getting any pie.</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">When you are positive that they are playing this game, just apply the "ignore the fuck out of her" theory. </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">When you play the game right, you will know when it is the right time to be the guy to end the conversation and the one to not reply, not the other way around - waiting for her reply.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">If you are confident you made an attraction, just apply this without holding back, she will reply (I can assure you). </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Personally, I never thought about marriage so I cannot help you with the marriage part. I am only telling you... well, how to get laid and get into a relationship (maybe). Whatever nationality a woman is, she is ultimately still a woman, play your cards right and you will get them. </p>

You mean like you never make any female friend during your schooling days or working days? Female friends are really good because they are able to introdue more female friends that may suit you. If you feel like you look like some small kid than do something about it. eg. like working out to look good and keep fit or maybe taking more time to doll yourself up. And you say you have a degree salary so i presume it's a 4 digit salary, use your money to buy like some branded stuff to make you confident and make you look attractive and maybe you can dye your hair. When girls talk to you play the hard to get game, but be suave at the same time. I promise you will be hitch in two weeks. If it work out right i expect a big ang bao for being your love guru.</p>

              <p>Well.. I am definitely going to change my dress code and adapt a different demeanour. I realise that once I dress more maturely, my female colleagues actually compliment me that I look good and smart. I hope to make myself a blend between a boy and dressing maturely bah. Act cool play hard to get I will try that a bit too.</p>

              <p><br>I teach you one skill lah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those ladies with above 350+ friends, you can delete off them liao. Chance of dating them out is near impossible. You might have seen people with 1000+ friends? those anyone add one lah~ =.=""</p>
              <p>Those that I date out ones are shy ones with less than 150 friends. Those are the real human beings. :) Send them a message to intro yourself to them. Best if you be genuine (tell them as much about you, show them that you're really want to make friends). If you want love, you will need to become their friend. If you want to become their friend, you need to show them genuinely that you're willing to make friends.</p>
              <p>Constant communication. Once you've found those girls with less than 150 friends, the next time is to create a regular communication. When the girl feels comfortable abour you, she'll give you her number. SMS and MSN is good, but I personally prefer SMS. From there, keep texting her regularly for two weeks before further developing. After all, there's no harm having lunch with a girl and getting to know your friend.</p>
              <p>Don't pester them because they might not feel comfortable going out with "stranger online friends". Do you best in grooming and act natural. Smile!!! If first lunch date is successful, then make a second date. Relationship this kind of thing must have feelings de. Best is ask her after the third/fourth date. See if she have feelings for you or not. &lt;3</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The rest next time I continue type~ <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> I don't use match.com.</p>
              <p>Another one that is local dating website I use is lovestruck.com (finding who's having lunch nearby, and arrange a lunch date/meeting with them). Personally I feel that the subscription is quite expensive, but the people there are all genuine. So I am recommending you lovestruck for the genuine people. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"> </p>

              <p>WTH? you meet people need use the net one arh? Like that very
                  despo style leh. Girls don't like despo guys, all the dating site
                  the girls either look like Susan Boyle or their age expire liao.
                  You mean like you never make any female friend during your
                  schooling days or working days? Female friends are really good
                  because they are able to introdue more female friends that may suit
                  you. If you feel like you look like some small kid than do
                  something about it. eg. like working out to look good and keep fit
                  or maybe taking more time to doll yourself up. And you say you have
                  a degree salary so i presume it's a 4 digit salary, use your money
                  to buy like some branded stuff to make you confident and make you
                  look attractive and maybe you can dye your hair. When girls talk to
                  you play the hard to get game, but be suave at the same time. I
                  promise you will be hitch in two weeks. If it work out right i
                  expect a big ang bao for being your love guru.</p>
