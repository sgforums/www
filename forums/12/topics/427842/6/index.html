              <p>Nothing wrong with picking up girls on the net. Fuck dating sites, Facebook is your hunting ground. </p>
              <p>Also if you have more female friends compared to male, it's not a good sign, you are entering friend zone. </p>
              <p>Don't concentrate on one girl to be your girlfriend, allow yourself to have various potential dating partners, so you won't seem desperate.</p>
              <p>Step 1: Multiple dating</p>
              <p>Step 2: Filter for a exclusive relationship aka girlfriend</p>
              <p>Step 3: Discover if she's a bitch or an angel</p>
              <p>Step 4: If she's a bitch, get the fuck out</p>
              <p>Step 5: Rinse and repeat till you meet an angel (Step 3)</p>
              <p>Step 6: Get married, however during this stage Step 3 might occur - proceed to Step 4</p>
              <p>Insurance: In any case a divorce is inevitable, get wife to commit adultery</p>
              <p>Step 7: Win &amp; repeat Step 1</p>

              <p>Talking about another country's culture, I'm taking Japanese language classes very soon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Used to study japanese before but didnt complete it. Am hoping to finish it this time round.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not just doing it for interest, but also hoping that it can boost my career options. Nowadays everywhere also degree holder, to have an edge, its seems like mastering another language is a form of competitive advantage. Saw quite a number of job adverts that jap language speakers can earn gross income of at least 50% more than the average degree holder leh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hopefully when I get my JLPT n1 will be able to get employment in a Japanese MNC or better still get a job overseas. But studying a language takes a lot of time, by the time I fully master it I'll be 30 something. Duno how much use it will help to boost my career by then.</p>

If during my grandma days, if you said you are still single, people will laugh at you, today, if you said you are single, not attached, peoples said very normal lah. Me 22yo gal also single mah, my grandma said, last time for gal 22yo not married, meaning very old already, no body wants. But today, marrying at 22yo is a waste of my youth. Be cool lah, CNY, what is CNY in singapore, with so many foreigners, CNY become just a normal holidays, unlike my taiwan hometown, all celebrating and still hv the tradition and the feel of CNY.</p>

              <p>there is pros and cons in every situation, u cant have the cake and eat it (most of the time)..</p>
              <p>u cant expect to have a wife that brings in the dough, yet is homely. because she is a human too, if u want her to cook, bake, clean , buy groceries, and fufill u, i dont think she would have enough time for all that, unless she doesnt sleep or is a superwoman.</p>
              <p>if u get yourself a foreign bride, she might most probably be able to help u in all the household chores, but she cant bring in the dough for the first few years she is here. and probably if u want her to give birth, she might have to stay home to look after the kid.</p>
              <p>the only good thing might be that, u get to choose the foreign bride. sg girls will choose u.</p>
              <p>please dont take offence, with your standards and earnings, u are just a normal young urban professional single guys out there. u have no "speciality" over other guys, yet not that bad for u to resort to foreign brides.</p>
              <p>upgrading yourself might be a plus to help u get girls, but there will be girls who will come after u for your standards and money then.. and girls u meet then will be more picky because they themselves might be as good as u, or even better than u.</p>
              <p>u got to think thoroughly what kind of family life and wife u want in future. and go for it. because if u want to have kids in future , at 29 u should start a relationship. u dont want to be still earning a living to feed your kids at retirement age.</p>

              <p><br>seeking foreign wives is a risk, some make it well, some end up get cheated, so most sg guys rather remain single, takes single seat, single room, single scoop, single shot of expresso and single portion of foods.</p>
              <p>For gals, once we are unable to marry up, we rather be single than to face a lower earning, less capable and educate man, lets be frank, forcing onself to marry will ultimately lead to divorce or break up. And most Singaporeans cannot take failure in life.</p>

              <p>Not that I'm not happy for them, but its never a good feeling to know that u're left behind. The topics to talk about between us is changing, and you realize that less and less attention is put on you, you feel outcasted among the group.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Particularly at this age, when all other people around you are happily engaged while you are still single, the feeling of emptiness and loneliness just hits you twice and thrice as hard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know some will say why conform to society expectations or why give in to peer pressure.  Yesterday my lady friend comforted me by telling me I'm a nice person, I look fine, I've got a decent education, I dont have to worry. But I like to say that I am just acting rationally as a human being at my age.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some people can choose to be single but I cannot. It is not my choice to be single. I dont want to land myself in a state of denial. I dont want to procrastinate and have a large age gap between potential girls i can know. I have a lot of love to give and I long to be loved. I want to start my own family and have my own children.
