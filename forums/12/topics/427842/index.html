              <p>Perhaps I can share a little with you because I am also a boyish looking man even until now. I look possibly 10+ years younger than what I am. I know this looks is detrimental and hurts your self confidence especially with girls.</p>
              <p>Girls do go for looks and good news is some girls like cuty looking boys. However, girls will become your gf not because of your looks but how comfortable she feels with you. Obviously, it means letting the girls have a chance to know you and that means you or the girl have to come together and feel for each other.</p>
              <p>As a man, I would think you have to be courageous enough to approach the girls. Put away your fears. It can be embarrasing but the embarrasement really can't kill you. Trying is key and not attending any session at SDN is gonna help you either. If it feels better, go for girls who are less mature looking. This is what I did and I alrdy have a loving wife and family.</p>
              <p>It is really about putting away your fears, do it even if u are fearful, trying, getting embarrased and trying again after getting over it. Eventually, u will find luck and your love!</p>

              <p>Chocochips, theres nothing to show off when you are almost 30 years old but still look like a 16-18 year old kid.  It hurts a lot on my self esteem. I'm glad Apples understands.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hwaimeng, i know theres nothing wrong in marrying a foreign bride. I had an ex gf whos a thai. But paying $ to get a wife is wrong. The girl is being compelled to marry you because she has no choice to. She is doing this out of poverty. I feel so sorry and guilty if i am doing this. I have a soft spot and I cant bear to do anything to hurt girls.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also I think not Singaporean girls are bad. Bashing them and saying they are lousy is not right too. Marrying a foreign wife does guarantee you have a good wife too. Whats important is that this person you're marrying genuine loves you or not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporean girls also have their good point. One main thing is that they share the family income and they do a big part to take care of the family. When you marry a foreign bride, you must be sure you can take care for her. I also want somebody who can understand my problems, share my dreams, provide me with moral support and comfort when I need it. Foreign wives are submissive yes, but I am not the kind of guy who wants a girl at my beck and call.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can only consider this when I ran out of options. But as much as i try to deny this, I also know i am running out of time. Some day I will have to face the truth. I am so sad and angry at myself if I have to resort to this to get married.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know there are many people who say that being single can be good too. But I am just not that kind of person. Without somebody to share my life, give me the support and comfort when I need, i duno what is my purpose, where is my direction, who am I living for, what is the hope am I clinging to. I cannot imagine living the rest of my life like this. Life is so sad and meaningless like this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My younger sister shes already married and she has a 3 year old daughter. My niece is very adorable and I love her very much. But whenever I see her, I feel just so much sadness inside. I also want my family. I also want to have my own children. I dont understand why my sister beat me to it. I am way better looking than her, she is only ITE grad while I have a degree from SIM.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now the center of attention in my family revolves around my niece and I feel so left out. As the only son of the family, I feel it is such a shame, especially during chinese new year, when relatives keep bombarding me with questions that I dont even have the answers to it myself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chinese New Year has become the most hated festival of my life, believe it or not. </p>
              <p>Nice guys really finish last. I am a living example.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: Hitman, to answer your question, No. Porn does not get me a gf and indulging in porn only make girls hate and despise you. How about I try something else such as slapping you instead?</p>

              <p>Aiya, Ah Xiao, today, being single is the fashion, only those outdate peoples go and get marry. If during my grandma days, if you said you are still single, people will laugh at you, today, if you said you are single, not attached, peoples said very normal lah. Me 22yo gal also single mah, my grandma said, last time for gal 22yo not married, meaning very old already, no body wants. But today, marrying at 22yo is a waste of my youth. Be cool lah, CNY, what is CNY in singapore, with so many foreigners, CNY become just a normal holidays, unlike my taiwan hometown, all celebrating and still hv the tradition and the feel of CNY.</p>
