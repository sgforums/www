              I'm 21 this year and I have never been in a relationship before.
              
              Just a few months back, for the first time, I have a guy who is interested in me. He made his intentions clear to me and I did let him know that I was interested as well. However, right from the start, he has been very inconsistent. He likes to do what I call the disappearance act. 
              
              Because we are school mates, we do see each other in school now and then. He will only maintain his contact with me for a while after we meet. For example, we would see each other on Monday because we have a common lecture then we would hang out with our clique for lunch. Then he would message me or msn me that night and maybe we would still message till Tuesday. And if our timetables are such that we dont meet till next monday, He wouldnt contact me at all till the next time we meet. 
              
              I guess the point I'm trying to make is that he doesnt make the extra effort to stay in contact? He will only let circumstances coincide with our meeting times. He wouldnt message or msn me or anything and I'm supposed to pretend everything's normal when we next meet by circumstance while for the past week I will be left hanging and wondering if he is still interested or even serious about me. 
              
              i know I dont have much experience but I thought the least I could expect from him would be an sms to let me know what he's up to at least to ask how im doing? Am I just being insecure or is this just normal expectations? 
              
              I would love to message him whenever I feel like it but I hold back because I feel like he wont reciprocate. That he will mind my messaging because maybe this is something that he doesnt like to do. i dont know if he doesnt message because it simply doesnt cross his mind or because he's waiting for me too. 
              
              If circumstance dictates that we will never meet, i think he will never bother to contact me at all. what's this? Is this normal? Are interested guys supposed to message/bug the girl every day or every few days or am I just insecure??

              yeahh i think im more interested than he is ):
              
              he did tell kinda hint cos he did tell me that he wants to be with me and he did ask me if there was chance should be go after me.
              
              i think we both are aware that we both are interested in each other
              
              the issue here is that i am just not convinced that he is interested anymore. 
              
              he might be. he would say he is. but i am just not convinced because he doesnt show it

              he kinda asked informally...what if he wants to be with me.
              
              i told him im not ready, that its too fast.
              
              because honestly i hardly know him. i dont feel completely comfortable with him. we dont have much chemistry yet, i feel. like we would run out of things to say. i feel like i am awkward/he is awkward around me, so i wanna get to know him better first. i dont know if things would change if i said ok then. if he was going to be like that, then i would feel like i dont have a bf.
              
              he didnt even ask me out today. i dont know whats hes doing today. i dont know what's up with him. im going for braces and he doesnt even know. my laptop died over the weekend he doesnt even know. even my normal guy friends talk to me more than he does.

              <p>I’m 21 this year and I have never been in a relationship before.</p>
              <p>Just a few months back, for the first time, I have a guy who is interested in me. He made his intentions clear to me and I did let him know that I was interested as well. However, right from the start, he has been very inconsistent. He likes to do what I call the disappearance act.</p>
              <p>Because we are school mates, we do see each other in school now and then. He will only maintain his contact with me for a while after we meet. For example, we would see each other on Monday because we have a common lecture then we would hang out with our clique for lunch. Then he would message me or msn me that night and maybe we would still message till Tuesday. And if our timetables are such that we dont meet till next monday, He wouldnt contact me at all till the next time we meet.</p>
              <p>I guess the point I’m trying to make is that he doesnt make the extra effort to stay in contact? He will only let circumstances coincide with our meeting times. He wouldnt message or msn me or anything and I’m supposed to pretend everything’s normal when we next meet by circumstance while for the past week I will be left hanging and wondering if he is still interested or even serious about me.</p>
              <p>i know I dont have much experience but I thought the least I could expect from him would be an sms to let me know what he’s up to at least to ask how im doing? Am I just being insecure or is this just normal expectations?</p>
              <p>I would love to message him whenever I feel like it but I hold back because I feel like he wont reciprocate. That he will mind my messaging because maybe this is something that he doesnt like to do. i dont know if he doesnt message because it simply doesnt cross his mind or because he’s waiting for me too.</p>
              <p>If circumstance dictates that we will never meet, i think he will never bother to contact me at all. what’s this? Is this normal? Are interested guys supposed to message/bug the girl every day or every few days or am I just insecure??</p>

              <p>Aiyo, 21yo then got first contact, that is bad. Guess you must be not that perfect, so to speak</p>
              <p>Me 15yo fully booked already.</p>
              <p>So, you got no experiences, let me teach you, sg guys all hv a problem, most are pampered, motherboy, or grandmotherboy or maidboy, they tends to hv a proud and high ego side in them, most turn out to behave in a male chauvanist way, like they need to be serve, not you serve them, so naturally, they expect you to call, sms, msn, or whatever, this will make them hold on to their pride, their ego and can go tell their friends that his gf only obey and listen to him, all other male will praise and respect him high high, but actually, they are just same shit but different type</p>

              <p>First of all, this is normal in courtships or maybe half baked ones. Contact, then no contact, then contact again. He may have other options. You should keep your mind open too, he may not be THE ONE. If he messages you, good. If not, don't fret. You will have other suitors? Then when you finally end up with one, let the fella lick his wounds for not trying hard enough. It's alright....courtships in schools are but mere games sometimes.</p>
