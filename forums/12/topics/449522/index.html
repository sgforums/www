              At a recently meeting of old school mates, we noted that many were "flying" second wings in more ways than one ! Yup, some were constantly traversing China from north to south . Others were flying furiously to Vietnam, Cambodia  and now Burma. Most of the so deemed successful Singaporeans and Malaysians( with Singapore PRs of course) spent at least 1/3 to two thirds of their time year out of Singapore!  Even some of the  so call high flying ladies  were spending lots of time out of Singapore working in Hongkong , China  Europe London etc.
                      Many of the guys epsecially those in China admitted they sought temporary comforts in the warmth and arms of their China lovers (could be regular partners, KTV girls, massuesses ,escorts, salegirls in a mall,or even prostitutes of their pick)  Similarly the guys stationed or working on assignments in Vietnam had girlfriends in the form of their domestic housemaid, salesgirls, hairdressers, massuesses and of course the common call girls. 
                      From my observation at least 90% to 95% of Singapore men( I know)who work abroad in semi permanently  or on assignment indulged in some form of extra marital activities. Is it therefore inevitable that Singaporean women accept the fact that their husbands need some form of comfort or relaxation after a hard days work in the arms of a woman?( at least one sometimes more) . And as long as their do not have any emotional attachment to these women  and still come back home to Singapore where the family is, they should live and let live?  Afterall in Japan, don't Japanese businessmen patronise their geishas after a hard days work or business transaction, but still go home after that?
