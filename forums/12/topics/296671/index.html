Also, they are very poor at dealing with solitude and normally centre their lives around making and keeping friends (ultimate goal in life). Therefore, when shi<strong></strong>t happens, they have more readily available options which are convertible to boyfriends.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

For the same reason, when they fall in love, some of such guys cannot believe that despite they have given in more than what they usually give (ie which is really nothing other than sweet talk and sex), they get jilted and hurt in the end.  Isnt this an wounded ego?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thats why , dont put too much effort into it. Many ppl say i dont put much effort .. and i always let the girl break with me. If u prioritize relationship as the first , it will be hard. U will know when things are not going well and they gonna break liaw. If u think its worth ur time to keep on to it , u fight for it.. if not , then just let it go. There are more important things to do. More girls out there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>But yeah.. i got it bad once...real bad. heh.. even fell sick for 1 month.
