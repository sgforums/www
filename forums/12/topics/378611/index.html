              <p>Hi LowHead,</p>
              <p>Please don't give up so easily! Have faith not only in your religion, but also have faith in your own ability. A student's self-efficacy is part of the equation towards his success. As long as you have worked hard, there is nothing to regret. </p>
              <p>Even if you entered the N(A) stream, that does not mean it is the end for you. There are people from the N(T) stream who entered ITE, followed by local poly, and finally local uni. Thus, as long as you are willing to believe that success will come about as a result of your efforts, you will be sure to shine in your own light in the end.</p>
              <p>If you have any worries or unhappiness, feel free to post them help. Many of the forummers will be glad to help you out.</p>
              <p>Cheers</p>
