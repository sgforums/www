In fact, you shouldn't be amazed if she was dating other guys while going steady with you. They tend to be spoilt for choices if they are given too much attention. (same applies to guys, in fact guys who are too spoilt for choices are most likely going to end up jerks!)<br><br>Are you her boyfriend? Have she introduced you to her friends?<br><br>If the answer is yes and no, it shows that she wants to have choices then sorry, but you're likely to end up as a substitute.<br><br>If you're not her boyfriend, at least she didn't acknowledge that you're her only one, and you're dating her, you are definitely a substitute if she calls you out when she's bored and ignore you most of the time.<br><br>Most women (note: not girls) are better at masking so you have to ask yourself the same question whether she treats you seriously or not. If she doesn't, you're definitely a substitute or a part-time entertainer.<br><br>The easiest way to do a check on the cases above is look at the mirror and ask yourself this question: "Are you more desirable to the opposite sex than her?" If the answer is no, the chances of being a substitute is higher.</div>

A little strange that you're mentioning 'substitute' here? What's her current status in relationship? Attached?<br><br>Personally, I feel that she probably have mixed feelings about you... Meaning some things she like about you, some things which she don't... Uncertainty...? It also hints infatuation from her side (though not necessarily so)....<br><br>Regards.</div>

In fact, you shouldn't be amazed if she was dating other guys while going steady with you. They tend to be spoilt for choices if they are given too much attention.

Ur reading too much into every of her word and action. Learn to let go. But if u can't help it, clarify every doubt with her instead of letting these negative thoughts breed in ur mind.<br><br></div>
