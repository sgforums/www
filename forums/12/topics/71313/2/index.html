I need help from those out there who are experiencing the same prob with me either now or b4 or anyone who can help me.<br><br>I have been liking this guy for 7 years. At first it's jus a crush but as days grew by, i love him more n more. In order for me to control my feelings for him, i ask him to b my god bro but it doesn't seems to be helping. I sacrificed a lot for him, when he got prob, i'll be by his side to console him even if i'm very tired. I'm always willing to do whatever he ask me to do. But recently i found out that he likes a girl n i'm very sad. I know it's no use being sad cos he had told me that he only treat me as a sis. That's why i have the urge to end this frenship bcos i noe that i won't be able to face him if he really go into a relationship with other girls n it will be easier for me to forget him too. If we continue to be frens i won't be able to 4get him. It's hard for me to put up a brave self infront of him when i'm actually bleeding inside. What should i do? Does anyone encourage me to end the frenship or any beeter solutions?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> 7 years? Usually with regular contacts, love would have vanished and stable friendship would have form and crystalized. After a long period of time, normally, one side cannot picture themselves having a relationship with the other. Sometimes, it's because they are so used to them being as friends, others, purely because of platonic purposes.<br><br>I have to say this: Your initial decision to become 'sibling' relationship is a route you took to foster better relationship with him subconsciously. Its like a stairs - when you walk finish level 2, you can't just remain there. You created your own dimension of relationship through 'kor-mei' relationship and in your heart, you wished to get closer to him. So you were around when he was down and all that. But your plan backfired because you ended up nowhere.<br><br>Now that you realise all this effort was in vain to get him, you rather retreat beause you can't take the full blow to see him getting intimate with other girls. This is physical evidence of my point above because if you return back to the original objective of having this 'sibling' relationship with him is for your emotional control as you claim to do so - <strong>it has never serve its purpose at all.</strong><br><br>You should have already woke up and prick your bubble dreams many years back. Your hope is constantly fed by your subconscious desire, even though the result has already been set. This is a classic case of people following their heart and dull their mind - so now, have you gain anything? Reject possible suitors? Pro-long unneccessary emotional hurts? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Stop this. Its time to leave your self-conjured shelter just to make sure he is well everyday and learn to plan your own route now. Don't even have to end this friendship because friendship are priceless - end your overwhelming hope and desire. Stop catering to his wants and needs and carve out a fresh life. Explore other options and alternative.<br><br>Cheers</div>
