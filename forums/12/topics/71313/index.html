            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, this is my first time posting in this forum. I need help from those out there who are experiencing the same prob with me either now or b4 or anyone who can help me.<br><br>I have been liking this guy for 7 years. At first it's jus a crush but as days grew by, i love him more n more. In order for me to control my feelings for him, i ask him to b my god bro but it doesn't seems to be helping. I sacrificed a lot for him, when he got prob, i'll be by his side to console him even if i'm very tired. I'm always willing to do whatever he ask me to do. But recently i found out that he likes a girl n i'm very sad. I know it's no use being sad cos he had told me that he only treat me as a sis. That's why i have the urge to end this frenship bcos i noe that i won't be able to face him if he really go into a relationship with other girls n it will be easier for me to forget him too. If we continue to be frens i won't be able to 4get him. It's hard for me to put up a brave self infront of him when i'm actually bleeding inside. What should i do? Does anyone encourage me to end the frenship or any beeter solutions?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

As in, actually say 'I like you or love you...'? Or did you just hint to him, that you like him? If its the latter, then you should try confessing to him your feelings and how much you love him. If he says no, take some time off from spending too much time with him until you feel that you have moved on. As for his frens, are'nt they your friends as well?<br><br>There's another evil way, which I doubt you should take but I will mention it to you, that is to go after his close fren... WARNING this tactic seldom works, but most of the time hurts you and the close fren.<br><br>Other than that, once you have moved on, you can see him as a good friend and nothing more than that...</div>

I did something and it did not workout.... this is still better than FOREVER having that "question mark' in your life !<br><br>7 years,.... you two should hev known each other pretty well liao..... what makes u think u stand no chance against some other girl whom he just probably know? ....

Trust me, you will always ponder to yourself whether if you had confessed your feelings to him, would he have said yes? Sure, the chances might be slim, but do you really know for sure? Maybe, he is contemplating on asking you but you always treat him like a bro, so thats why he never asked you or told you his feelings for you?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He told me his criteria of his dream girl once n i don't fit into that criteria at all. He also told me that we will always be fren and we can only remain frens during a chat last time. BTW, i'm not pretty n i feel that he not only goes for character but looks too. Although i'm not that ugly but compared to his other Girl frens, i'm not up to their standards.</div>
