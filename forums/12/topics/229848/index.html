            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, i don't know if i'd give this to her or not. But this is just what i happen to feel at the moment. Please leave your comments. I think by reading what i wrote you'd guess what its about.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br><br>I'm really confused.<br>Why do u have to do this to me? Its only been such a short time. For all you know it may just be that we haven't been attached for too long.. &amp; Sometimes just feeling the pain of being single..<br><br>You stroked my hand in the theatre.. on the phone you go like "Jeremy... nothing.." where i bet you're just thinking of me. I honestly, admit that plenty of those moments where i went "Kimberly.. nothing.. " i was thinking of you. And also during the times when we aren't talking or out together, i just miss you, and wish you were beside me.<br><br>I mean, i have a little feelings for you, but truthfully, i'm scared. I'm scared you've developed deep feelings for me, where i have issues of my own to deal with. Things like my superficiality, where i put the blame on the nature of guys. But i know deep down to you, it seems like its just me. I'm just really sorry.<br><br>I know you probably feel disappointed and sad whenever i mention things about looks or clothes.. And you also get scared when choosing your clothes on a day out with me. This for fear of my rejection.<br><br>I'm sorry for being so critical. But its just me. This along with all my nastiness, my sniding at you, my laughing at you, but... let just say not for my bullying of you! that was amusing honestly!<br><br>But seriously speaking, i'm feeling confused. On one hand i like you, at the other i'm scared it wouldn't work out, cos i just don't wanna hurt you. You're a nice girl Kimberly, and i don't know what will become of us, acquaintances, friends, best friends, or maybe even get attached, but right now, everything is just going too fast.<br><br>I'm sorry i'm broke, and i feel like an ass for making you pay for my stuff. And though i know you didn't mind because you were with me, it feels all wrong.. I wish i could take back my christmas gift, and i wish i didn't accept your present, maybe that way, things would be yet, still more normal between us.<br><br>Other things also, like holding you in the theatre when you were feeling cold.. My go-.. (excuse my discomfort at saying the phrase), what a mistake! what many mistakes i've made, giving you too many signs. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.<br><br>All i ask for now is that you give me some space and time. To get to know you better. Honestly, I don't know if you're the right girl for me. And i most certainly hope you'd be still be fine after reading this. But whatever happens, i know i'll never regret meeting this girl i know called Kimberly..<br></div>
