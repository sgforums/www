I initiated it because i was feeling that my ex changed and that she just didn't had that part of her left that attracted me so much in the first place.<br><br>Eventually, quarrels and misunderstandings led to our downfall. You know...Couples in love do the most petty and darndest things. Since the relationship was already rocky on my side, it took the littlelest of quarrels and misunderstandings which led to our separation.<br><br>The breakup was hard to take for both of us but it was harder for my ex. I knew she was suffering but i didn't want to cause more hurt so i just lied low. I maintained that we were still friends.<br><br>A few months passed and now its today. I thought everything was over and that both of us could now start anew.<br><br>Then i received a very very sad Powerpoint presentation from my ex. It was about the past memories we had together, the way she took the breakup, post breakup and present. It even contained pictures we took together and the funny things we did.<br><br><span style="color: red;">She still loves me...</span><br><br>I'm now in a state of emptiness, emo-ness and feeling downright lost. I guess i should be feeling guilty that i couldnt appreciate what i had but as you know we cant turn back time and we can't reverse certain things. I truly am confused now.<br><br>Yours Truly<br>Temere<br></div></blockquote>I dread to think about e way she must feeling now...her loneliness on Valentine's...her bitterness in Lunar New Year's festive period...<br><br>Don't know why you are still feeling confuse now though...even if she's deluded now...eventually "guilt" would be e last reason any gal would want from a guy to patch things up...</div>
