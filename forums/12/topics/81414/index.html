            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, there's a saying, if it has happened once, it can happen again. Just because he got dared, he did it? lol... Actions speak louder than words n of coz he wants to apologize to appease u. But thing is, he did it already. N that is a mistake to u lah... it may not be to him or *S. It's juz a matter of what each of u all think is rite or wrong.<br><br>Of coz there is that sense of betrayal. But I would say that he doesn't rreally feel for u. Cause if he did, he would never have done such a thing. What was he thinking going to kent ridge park so late? KRP is famous for nite bangs! lol...<br><br>Anyway choice is urs. But like i said, if he could do it, he may do it again. N if he really meant that he loved u n stuff, he would never have banged S...<br><br>All the best in ur decision making...</div>
