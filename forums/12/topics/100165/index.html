Are u trying to take her as a substitute as ur ex gf or all along ur ex gf was just a substitute for her???<br><br>I can roughly see why ur ex gf wanted to break with u. Mayb she felt that ur heart was not with her at all. I think it was really very unfair of u to have feelings for other girls while u are stil attached to ur gf.<br><br>My point of view, if u got rejected by her once, its most likely u will get rejected again no matter how many times u try. If she had some feelings for u, she would have accepted u long ago. Stay as frens with her.<br><br>I think if u cross the line this time, u might even lose her as a fren. Think carefully.</div>
