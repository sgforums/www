              Although ppl always say r/s eventually becomes something that involves both families, it is ultimately your relationship and you take ownership for it. Of course it is important to get the blessings of your family... But sometimes things may not be that easy. Do you think your bf is someone worth yOu fighting for? If yes, fight for the approval! If all has been done and yet your bro's view still remains the same, then Ignore him! Ultimately, you are the one who is with him, not your brO.
              
              Been through something quite the same... A lot is going to depend on your choice

              <p>I think it is unwise to disregard your older brother's concerns just because your other family members turned a blind eye to your bf's flaws.</p>
              <p>What kind of issues does your older brother has on your boyfriend ?</p>
              <p>Are those valid concerns ? </p>
              <p>Is your brother , being the outsider, better able to sight potential downfalls ?</p>
              <p>Perhaps it will be better for the relationship with your brother and for the sake of your future spouse,  if you can sit down and rationally address whatever is/are bothering him.</p>

Is ur bro working in his area of studies? if not, what difference is ur bro from ur bf? Always rmb, u choose others, others choose u too. So if he wants to kpkb about ur bf, make sure he is at least more than 1 cut above him.</p>

              <p><br>yup, he has intention to become SGC but i would rather he's not going to.. having multiple citizenship in a family might be good for doing business in future or some other thing. hmmm.. yea.. all his life he has been in quite a good school.. same goes for the people around him i guess.. he is not exactly from the same field, somewhat similar. He keeps emphasizing that I shld be realistic that this is SG where the paper matters..</p>
              <p>And, I believe this topic is not wise to bring up this issue to my bf right..? which might make the matter worse.</p>

              <p>Small things that are not apprantly to you, might mean alot of things to the family. Example, simple things like you helping your bf to clean up after a meal with your family, might not mean anything to you but to the family, the number one thinking "what is wrong with this dude, he got no hands no legs is it? why the heck he cannot clean up himself, he is supposed to take care of my sister and not the another way around and why my sister must clean up for this a**hole" and misunderstanding can happen and I know this kind of thing vary between families but just take note, small small stuff can mean big big things in eyes of others.</p>

              <p>Just an example, if your boyfriend is the kind who like to stay overnight in your house often and every morning he woke up early and have to "fight" with the washroom with your brother who also need to wake up early for work and need to use the washroom, your bf have an habit of using your home's thing like PC as if it is really his home, try to do thing to grab your mother or other family members "good books" and make your brother look "bad" (We all know the story how parent also like to compare their own children with other "talent" people and say son/daughter how come you cannot be like that boy next door who is an "A" grade student.)</p>

              <p>Actually he used to eat before coming over to my place.. And maybe from time to time, I will dine outside with him. Perhaps my mum feels that outside food is not so healthy, so she invited him to come daily. Sometimes, he would bring some gifts ocassionally as well, and even scarier amt when we travel back to his hometown. And, It has been a routine that we walk my dog every evening, so it is not exactly seen as he come over just for free food.</p>
              <p>We used to stay below and play with my dog, and never enter my place. I was hoping for the situation to improve if he goes over more often..</p>

              <p>Although ppl always say r/s eventually becomes something that
              involves both families, it is ultimately your relationship and you
              take ownership for it. Of course it is important to get the
              blessings of your family… But sometimes things may not be that
              easy. Do you think your bf is someone worth yOu fighting for? If
              yes, fight for the approval! If all has been done and yet your
              bro’s view still remains the same, then Ignore him! Ultimately, you
              are the one who is with him, not your brO.</p>

              <p>I suggest you hold back the house visits for a couple of month and observe if the situation improves.</p>
              <p>My brother is one who doesnt care, he will walk around in his boxer shorts ( underwear) even when my friends visit, often he will pee with the toilet door wide open...he says he will do what he likes because that is his home. If we don't like it, we can take a hike into the mountains.</p>
              <p>Your older brother is obviously not comfortable having an outsider in his home.And your bf is invading his privacy daily... </p>
              <p>As much as you wish for your brother to accept your bf, you must first need to RESPECT your brother's need for privacy.</p>
              <p>If you continue to shove your bf in your brother's face, the conflict will only increase. The animosity can escalate to your brother eventually telling your bF off directly. When that happens, the relationship can no longer be fixed.</p>
              <p>Never force acceptance on another person. Acceptance must come from a person's true willingness.</p>
              <p>If you have to eat out everyday, so be it. If your mom has to pack dinner for you to picnic downstairs, it has to be done. That is the sacrifice you need to make to ensure harmony for your bf's relationship with your family, so do what you need to do.</p>
