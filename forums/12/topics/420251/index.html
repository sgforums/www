              <p>Okay, all was well for 3 terms in my sec3 life, till this a**hole who I will refer to as MB from my corehistory class decided to seat next to me to have "fun" with me. He bullies me whenever Im in corehist and the teacher does nothing (I dont blame her, cus she's quiet young). Okay Im sec4 now and the bullying stopped because the guy dropped his corehistory. BUT BEFORE HE DROPPED IT, that fag drew on my uniform, and its stained. It was fine for awhile because I thought it could be removed.... But I forgot to tell my mom and nows she's pissed at me because of the stain. Fortunately this MB got reported for another case (he bullied another boy and did the same thing as me) at first I thought this was like a good thing. TIll found out that their punishment was a very minor one, Like wtf internal suspension for a few days!?  I was expecting a more serious one.... like canning.</p>
              <p>So what should I do? Report him to the DM in order to increase his punishment? Just remain calm and forget about him? (since Im sec4) </p>
              <p>Other then drawing on my shirt, he has beaten me and harrassed me for quite some time now. And there are witnesses who have no guts to help me report the case...</p>

              <p>Sometimes, we just close 1 eye and forget about it since you are in sec 4 (final year).</p>
              <p>But if this bully keeps on pastering you, I think you such talk to your parents or principals or head master. If still unable to solve, probably you need to ask your parent to come to the school to sort it out.</p>

He talk bad about me behind my back, tt my soccer skills suck and i play quite funny. idk about tt until some1 told me. i of cos not happy ma duh...told all of my n(a) guys and they all ready to beat him. But thn i rmb got O level so i dun want la cos later all kena suspend or smth. after he know tt we want to beat him up he told my friends tt if i were to step into his class the guys will beat me. In the end he got beaten not me for his big mouth. Teachers ask us why, we say "birthday bash". And the reason he insult me is bcos i sms a girl which he like and is quite close to. -.- is she sms me first can</p>

              <p>no point reporting him now since it was in the past. However, in order to deal with these bullies. Try reverse physcoloy (can't even spell it...hahha). Next time he said you are shit at soccer. Straight away say yeah i knnow I am shit at soccer and don't how to improve then ask him how you should improve your soccer skills.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You will make the bully feel important and will try to help rather bully</p>
