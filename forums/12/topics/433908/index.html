              <p>I have a girl whom Im sharing a great platonic friendship with. We have 
              great chemistry and got along well. We both are of the same age. <br> <br> Im always concerned that I may fell for her as I dont wanna get myself 
              hurt of being rejected again or ruined the friendship. Furthermore, she 
              earns more than me &amp; its not possible that she will see me as a 
              potential mate. Though she admits she likes going out with me, I dont 
              think that boost the chances of me being with her.<br> <br> So far, we both see each other as friends only. No romantic feelings 
              developed yet. But there is also a part of me that wants to be with her.
               If given the chance to go with her, I will definitely take it.<br> We can communicate well and thats the first thing I look for in a 
              relationship. Ive always respect her and she do deserve to be treated 
              with respect. She is definitely the kind of woman I would take 
              seriously. Is it ok to tell her about this? Not being in love but go 
              further if she initiate it? She knows I do not want to fall in love ever again</p>

              <p>As for now, i dont have any feelings for her yet. Maybe a little but not to the point that I kept thinking about her. But I hope i wont end up to that point.</p>
              <p>But I guess, if i really do fall for her, I would break it to her gently and tell her I wont be mad or angry at her for not being able to return me my love. Like killtheink says, you only live once. and If i confessed to her, it would be a once in a lifetime opportunity. i want her to know at least how i feel before we go our separate ways.</p>

              <p>Jiani: what makes you think im a pisces?</p>
              <p>Tan CHhan89: how do you define Be a Man?</p>
              <p>As for now, i dont have any feelings for her yet. Maybe a little but not to the point that I kept thinking about her. But I hope i wont end up to that point.</p>
              <p>But I guess, if i really do fall for her, I would break it to her gently and tell her I wont be mad or angry at her for not being able to return me my love. Like killtheink says, you only live once. and If i confessed to her, it would be a once in a lifetime opportunity. i want her to know at least how i feel before we go our separate ways.</p>

              <p>I have a girl whom Im sharing a great platonic friendship with.
              We have great chemistry and got along well. We both are of the same
              age.<br> <br> Im always concerned that I may fell for her as I dont wanna get
              myself hurt of being rejected again or ruined the friendship.
              Furthermore, she earns more than me &amp; its not possible that she
              will see me as a potential mate. Though she admits she likes going
              out with me, I dont think that boost the chances of me being with
              her.<br> <br> So far, we both see each other as friends only. No romantic
              feelings developed yet. But there is also a part of me that wants
              to be with her. If given the chance to go with her, I will
              definitely take it.<br> We can communicate well and thats the first thing I look for in a
              relationship. Ive always respect her and she do deserve to be
              treated with respect. She is definitely the kind of woman I would
              take seriously. Is it ok to tell her about this? Not being in love
              but go further if she initiate it? She knows I do not want to fall
              in love ever again</p>

              <p>First of all. You may think too much......... If you are not 100% sure of going into a relationship i suggest dont. Then again you face the possibility of her getting a new boyfriend and regreting after that</p>

              <p>TTFU: i agree with you. either way, its risky. if i fell for her and she cant accept me, then i have to stop contacting her to get over her and move on. Thus ending the friendship. If i just keep it to myself to save the friendship, i would get upset too if she found someone else. but either way, i wont hate her. sometimes i think its best if i turn gay, so i wont have anymore feelings for girls. save me the trouble of being in &amp; out of love, picking up the pieces for dozens of times...hahah</p>
