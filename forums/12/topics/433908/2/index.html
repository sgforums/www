              <p>Make life simple, ASK. Yes or No, at least life goes on, stop wasting time in playing hide and seek with Love, life is not long, there is no offence to we ladies if men start to ask, if not, you can go on with your one sided illusion Love.</p>

              <p>Stop thinking negative. Life is about giving your shot. No point complaning here. Its either you want to go after her or you don't want to. The three ways about this.</p>
              <p>If you think you both are not suitable then forget it, not point whinning.</p>
              <p>If you want to make your move: then make your move. Be a Man. So what if she rejects you? Take this as a life learning experience and move on. Even if you don't make your move on her, would you think that both of you will remain friends 4 eva?</p>
              <p>When she gets married she wouldn't have time for your friendship.</p>
