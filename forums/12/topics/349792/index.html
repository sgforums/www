              <p>As some of you who knows me here, I'm from ITE. Being ITE student isn't a big deal, but there are people out there who don't think ITE students are good.</p>
              <p>The same goes to my girlfriend's parent. Recently, her parents keep pressuring her, asking if she is still with me or not. It seems like they do not have good impression of ITE students.They said that our relationship will suffer, as a result of her earning more than me in the future.</p>
              <p>Education plays a part, which is true.</p>
              <p>But when she told her parents that I will further my studies, her parents said, "Huh, you still want to be with him ah?"</p>
              <p>As a result, recently my gf has been feeling the pressure from them. Last night, she ask for a break, as she does not want to disappoint her parents. Yes, she's a good girl, she can't go out at night, maybe have to return home by 8-9pm? Or else her parents will keep calling.</p>
              <p>Somehow I find the parents too strict. No I'm not saying that I blame the parents. I blame myself for not studying hard enough during sec sch days to enter into poly, I blame myself for not studying hard in ITE for another chance to get into poly. It's only when my grandma pass away, then I woke up and face the reality, that I should not take things for granted. I screw up myself hard.</p>
              <p>It's not easy putting down a 4 years relationship when we both still care for each other.</p>
              <p>What can I do? I'm at a loss</p>

              <p>The thing is, the TS can do it, but his gf can't. She is sandwiched between him and her parents. This in turn affects the TS.</p>

              <p>I think it's because you haven't met before, but when her parents know she has a bf and asks about it, they learn that you are from ITE. The stereotype of ITE students is normally "Bad influence... smokers... lazybums..." you get my drift. So that's why they already created a mental image of you as an ITE student, not a guy who is serious about succeeding in life and providing their daughter with a good life.</p>
              <p>First impressions are very important, and that's their first impression of you, which is hard to change since you haven't met them in person before.</p>
              <p><em>I blame myself for not studying hard enough

Uhhh I hope you understand what I'm trying to say. Haha. So that contributed to their 'first impression' of their daughter's bf, which they have never met before, and as I've said, first impressions are often hard to change.</p>
              <p>You can try meeting her parents though, but don't force her or pressurize her. I think she's stressed enough as it is.</p>

                                      influence... smokers... lazybums..." you get my drift. So that's
                                      why they already created a mental image of you as an ITE student,
                                      not a guy who is serious about succeeding in life and providing
                                      their daughter with a good life.</p>
              <p>From here, I think that their first impression of you wasn't
                                      wrong, in the sense that you were really not serious about school
                                      then, so when your gf told her parents she couldn't really put in
                                      good words for you in this sense. Uhhh I hope you understand what
                                      I'm trying to say. Haha. So that contributed to their 'first
                                      impression' of their daughter's bf, which they have never met
                                      before, and as I've said, first impressions are often hard to
                                      change.</p>
              <p>You can try meeting her parents though, but don't force her or
                                      pressurize her. I think she's stressed enough as it is.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Hmmm, I got your point. Don't think I will pressure her to meet her parents. I'm not ready at the moment too. Last time still young and naive, thought that everything will be smooth. When I get older, then I regret of my actions back then.</em></span></p>

              <p>totally agree with this.... thats what i think too.</p>
              <p><br>TS, what qualification is she holding? The parents <strong>seem to be very sure</strong> that their daughter will be earning higher than TS. This is like ç‹—çœ¼çœ‹äººä½Ž....</p>
              <p>TS, I think that there's nothing you can do right now, besides talking to your gf and see what she thinks........... Cuz achievement cant be attained overnight, it takes time. But for the moment, you gotta prove yourself. Continue to work hard. It takes time to prove something, like your sense of worth and also your academic qualification.</p>
              <p>I dont think meeting the parents is a necessary move, but thats just my opinion.</p>
