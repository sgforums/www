BUT let me warn you.. the time waiting is very torturous for you and as much as possible, she WILL talk about her time together with her ex which might be hurting for you.<br><br>She quarrel with you because she knows that the both of you are getting too close to each other. Like what i mention above, she might not want to start another relationship yet.<br><br>Maybe you want to slowdown abit as at the rate you're going, might be abit too fast for the girl. Just be patient with her and she will soon forget about being nasty with you. BUT dont be her punching bag. Once you become one, it's gameover.<br></div>
