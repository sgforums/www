            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Schizoid personality disorder (SPD) is a cluster A personality disorder characterised by a lack of interest in social relationships, a tendency towards a solitary lifestyle, and emotional coldness. SPD is reasonably rare compared with other personality disorders. Its prevalence is estimated at less than 1% of the general population.</blockquote>Schizoids are not schizophreniacs as many people tend to mistake them to be one and the same. It does not occur exclusively during the course of Schizophrenia, a Mood Disorder With Psychotic Features, another Psychotic Disorder, or a Pervasive Developmental Disorder and is not due to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Then what is SPD? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br>Simply put, it can be defined in this mnemonic:<br>S Â– shows emotional coldness<br>O Â– omits close relationships<br>L Â– lacks close friends or confidants<br>I Â– involves in solitary activities<br>T Â– takes pleasure in few activities<br>A Â– appears indifferent to the praise or criticism<br>R Â– restricted interest in sexual experiences<br>Y Â– yanks himself or herself from social relationships<br><br>Compared to schizophrenia:<br>Schizophrenia is a psychiatric diagnosis that describes a mental disorder characterized by impairments in the perception or expression of reality and by significant social or occupational dysfunction. A person experiencing untreated schizophrenia is typically characterized as demonstrating disorganized thinking, and as experiencing delusions or auditory hallucinations. Although the disorder is primarily thought to affect cognition, it can also contribute to chronic problems with behavior and emotion. Due to the many possible combinations of symptoms, there is ongoing and heated debate about whether the diagnosis necessarily or adequately describes a disorder, or alternatively whether it might represent a number of disorders. For this reason, Eugen Bleuler deliberately called the disease "the schizophrenias" plural, when he coined the present name.<br><br>Diagnosis is based on the self-reported experiences of the patient, in combination with secondary signs observed by a psychiatrist, clinical psychologist or other competent clinician. There is no objective biological test for schizophrenia, though studies suggest that genetics, neurobiology and social environment are important contributing factors. Current research into the development of the disorder often focuses on the role of neurobiology, although a reliable and identifiable organic cause has not been found. In the absence of objective laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis, some question the legitimacy of schizophrenia's status as a disease. Furthermore, some question the status of schizophrenia as a disease on the basis that they do not consider their condition to be an impairment.<br><br>The term "schizophrenia" translates roughly as "shattered mind," and comes from the Greekschizo, "to split" or "to divide" and phrÃ§n, "mind". Despite its etymology, schizophrenia is not synonymous with dissociative identity disorder, also known as multiple personality disorder or "split personality"; in popular culture the two are often confused. Although schizophrenia often leads to social or occupational dysfunction, there is little association of the illness with a predisposition toward aggressive behavior.<br><br>Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia are highly likely to be diagnosed with other disorders. The lifetime prevalence of substance abuse is typically around 40%. Comorbidity is also high with clinical depression, anxiety disorders, social problems, and a generally decreased life expectancy is also present. Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia typically live 10-12 years less than their healthy counterparts, owing to increased physical health problems and a high suicide rate.<br><br>However, both conditions can appear in a single patient. Thus the patient will really feel sucky about it.<br><br>Signing off for now and can a mod please make this thread sticky?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Woah, it's not a matter that we schizoids can't change. We can playact out feelings no doubt but it will never be natural. If you have problems picturing out, try to visualise a robotic human being. The problem is that we lack the ability to feel human emotions. That is very detrimental to human relationships.<br><br>As for responsibility, we will try to adhere to local laws but not to everyone's whim and fancy. So please do not accuse without valid justification.<br><br>As for schizophreniacs, they are influenced by a world of their own. Like hearing disembodied voices and seeing things that arn't there or are there. They are in fact distressed by such appariations that they will react very badly to it. It may range from anger to sadness. In fact, some cannot differentiate from reality and illusion.<br><br>I hope that people can try to understand the differences and problems that schizoids and schizopreniacs face. Thank you.</div>
