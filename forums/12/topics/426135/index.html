              <p>We all are taught to respect people around us. Men have to
              respect ladies to be considered a gentlemen.</p>
              <p>But what if the ladies do not appreciate the respect men had
              given them? Does that justify men to stop respecting them? We all
              know women tend to take men's respect for granted. And if men dont
              respect them they also complained.</p>
              <p>And speaking of respect, how you think we should respect people?
              By their actions, role in society? Or just because someone is
              higher than us in any way we must respect them? Boss, parents,
              elderly? </p>
              <p>For me I seriously dont care who you are as long as you done
              something good and you dont treat people like shits, you have my
              respect. Some people still failed to understand that respect have
              to be earned.</p>

              <p>if ladies don't behave in respectable ways, then men will lose respect for them.  this applies to everyone.....IMO</p>
              <p>even elderly who jump queue and take for granted he is correct, will not have my respect.  the mother &amp; child who jump queue or who are rowdy without consideration of others also will not have my respect. parents who abuse their children should also be condemned.</p>
              <p>everyone's criteria differs.  for me, the person's integrity comes first as to whether he deserves my respect.  those who demand my respect because of position/ authority, will be the first ones to lose my respect.</p>

              <p>imo the respect we give others is the respect we have for ourselves. it's virtue. refinement. everyone gets 50% basic human respect by default, from road sweepers, waiters, peers, family to bosses and ministers. it's common human decency cos basic human dignity requires respect.</p>
              <p>anything more or less from then on is earned. </p>

              <p><br> respect should not be earn, it should come about naturally, if you
              earn respect, you are actually carving for it or acting to earn it,
              but respect to a person is best when one is respected without he or

              <p>when you give your respect to someone, obviously that someone must have done something or the way he/she carry themselves must've earned your respect....otherwise you're just an idiot who respects anyone without even knowing why you're respecting them...</p>
