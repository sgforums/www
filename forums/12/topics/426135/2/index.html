              <p><br>that is a layman talk, there tons of peoples out there, who you respect them, and they in turn never respect you, I think you can see that in our daily way of life, from MRT to workplace to public toilet and hawker centres etc etc...and that is what and how quarrel and fighting, hard feeling and disappointment of life come about, you respect someone, but that someone not only dun respect you, but make fun of you or sabotage you, therefore, it is not that you want to respect people, you need to reserve your respect to the right people.</p>

              <p><br>as long as you hv respected someone, care less if he/she respect you back, we should not carve for respect by respecting someone and in turn expect that someone to respect you back, that is wrong. Your respect of someone is your own well being, well brought and nurturing, I may not respect the silly old man, but i respect his age and that does not imply he needs to earn it.</p>
              <p>Respecting bosses and senior peoples is another issue, there is an ulterior motive behind that respect, it is different from our own nature way of respecting people in the public. You respect your boss or someone who is higher or someone that can help you is a respect with an objectives. My kind of respect is different, a respect that do not expect anything in return is a true respect.</p>
