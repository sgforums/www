            <div class='col-md body'>Depends on situation<br><br><strong>Situation 1</strong><br>You 2 are <span style="color: red;">very good friends</span> and have known each other for a [color=redlong time[/color].<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> It is more likely she will accept your invitation to celebrate your b'day. Since she will definitely feel more comfortable gg out with u. Another point to note is, if you 2 are really  good friends, she would most prob remember your b'day. Thus giving u a chance to invite her out. Maybe you can just ask her out for a meal when she calls to wish you or pass you your present.<br><br>Situation 2<br>You 2 are only so-so friends, but have known each other for sometime.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Maybe she might get suspicious about ur motives. Well....u still stand a chance.<br><br><strong>Situation 3</strong><br>You have only known each other for awhile.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Maybe can try getting a few friends along too. So that she wont feel so awakward. Or u might risk her avoiding u in future if u come on as too strong and pushy or maybe she will feel bad for rejecting ur invitation. Since you 2 dun know each other well enof...it would be hard for either of u to try and clear up any misunderstanding under such circumstances, or, rather hard to make the other party accept your explaination readily.<br><br>** For all situation, Versatility is the word. Change according to how the situation changes.<br></div>

BUT not my style...<br><br>IF I a gal har... I have to see wat kinda gal I m... sociable or quiet type... I most likely will go coz fun mah... can disturb bdae boi.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  frankly speaking VERY hard coz many factors regarding da gal side... May OR may not go... depending. (cant understand gals much, so its a MOOT point)<br><br>If yr fren noe wat TYPE da gal is then its MORE appropriate whether to ask her or not loh... If she out goin or sociable or open minded or watever, can ask her... If quiet or aloof or watever... have to see how loh...<br><br>In any case... noe da gal more then decide wat to do. dats all I can offer as a COMMENT.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
