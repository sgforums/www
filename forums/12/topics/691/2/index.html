            <div class='col-md body'>Well...personally, I think it's a normal thing for a guy to watch or have the urge to watch porn. My brother watches it. And I think it's perfectly normal. Though I'm not a guy, I do know that some guys 'DIY'...hey, even the channel U has this programme on 'Xing Ai Xue Fen'...we know that it is a normal behaviour...and especially young boys will have the curiosity to want to watch porn. Unless they overdo it like some of you have post here say, i think it's perfectly alright. What my friend does is she simply watch with her bf and they even discuss about the plot. I used to work part time at a particular law firm...my colleagues will discuss about porn movies while photocopying their huge stack of documents. Some of the married women will talk about it and say it helps them in their sex life with their husband...some of my friends who have sex with their bf also feels that watching porn helps in their sex life.<br>Just to reply to some who feels that porn are gross...hmmm...they may look 'kua zhang' but isit that what many couples do behind closed doors? My friend used to laugh at me when I say that porn is gross...he'll say, 'Ok...so next time on your wedding night, your husband tries to make love to you, will you also shout gross at him? Will you say what he is doing to you is gross?'</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pornography, or rather the want/need/urge to watch it stems directly from lust. Sexual lust is a problem with many many people.<br><br>Some find that they are trapped in it; as in they cannot look at a girl without fantasizing. Others find that it's just a minor thing in their lives.<br><br>However, I must mention that pornography and the viewing of it does carve the images of the such that you see into your mind. Your mind has 2 parts: the conscious mind and the sub-conscious mind.<br><br>The conscious mind can only think/focus on 1 thing at one time. It must have complete concentration on one thing at one time. The conscious mind is very factual and gets its information from TEXT and words and the such. As such, your conscious mind sets/replaces itself by what you read, and factually get information about.<br><br>The subconscious mind however is very different. The subconscious mind gets its information from the visual. This is a known concept for many successful people. "If you can see it, you can have it!".<br><br>Thus, since porn is very visual in its appearance and content, the area of your mind that receives it is the subconscious. Unfortunately, the sad thing here is that your subconscious is the part of your memory/mind that is the MOST DIFFICULT to erase.<br><br>So how does this affect relationships? Well, no matter how much a guy who likes to watch porn SAYS he is satisfied with his gf, in his subconscious mind, there is already a battle... a comparison with the gf and the images he's seen.<br><br>Also, the moment physical touch comes, it can trigger the subconscious mind and the images come back to mind like a flood (for the people who are addicted) and the relationships ends up in nothing but sexual lust and perversion.<br><br>There is much to be said on this entire topic. I shall stop for now, unless someone wants me to expound on this.<br><br>Cheers~!<br>|mission</div>

BTW,im NOT SAYING that EVERY1 who surfs porn turns into a sex-starved rapist!!Porn corrupts the mind ... WHY SHOULD WE LET GUYS DO JUST B'COZ THEY CALL IT A "BOY THING"?!?!? Are we gals going 2 just close one eye &amp; shut up??? NO!!! (Well,at least 4 me !!)U never know...first porn then next prostitutes???? Besides the pictures of naked girls in the websites have been touched up &amp; edited..they look so perfect,wat if he starts comparing u with a porn star??? (ok,I DUN MEAN ALL guys do that!!!)I'm just saying wat if....anyway,there r many disavantages of letting him c naked bimbos prancing around naked or engaged in sex...Im tooo lazy 2 list all for now.... I would like 2 hear more from guys on their opinions....BTW,ALL WRITTEN ABOVE IS MY PERSONAL VIEW....<br></div></blockquote>I like to post some of my personal views then since you requested for some. Well, there's nothing wrong with watching porn cos it's the normal act that the guy will engaged in with their partner eventually. Wouldn't it be better for a guy to grow up normally being interested in opposite sex than in developing to be a gay or sissy?<br><br>However, i do agree that care must be taken not to overdo it and guidance must be given if the guy in context is immature due to the risk of impulse and urge to commit crime.<br><br>Well, i got to admit i do watch porn and in fact, i watch it with my wife together sometime. It help to make sex life more interesting. Both will know more trick to satisfy each other fully. Both will more likely attain orgasm in sex than just performing a dull sex on the spot without any foreplay/watching porn to get the right tune. Life is about enjoying while you can but not at other pple's expense of course. Why be so restricted in your thinking?<br><br>The idea is it's alright for guy to watch porn but there is a limit. And for those immature one, guidance need to be given instead of restriction.</div>

But that doesnt mean guys cant differentiate between fake and real. Try watching a porno movie with your bfs and you'll see.<br><br>3) Handcuffs and candles have more important uses than catching badies and romantic dinners.<br><br>the list could go on... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Michelle: "The soup is too salty..."<br>Chef: "IT IS NOT...TOO...SALTY!!!"</div>

But that doesnt mean guys cant differentiate between fake and real. Try watching a porno movie with your bfs and you'll see.<br><br>3) Handcuffs and candles have more important uses than catching badies and romantic dinners.<br><br>the list could go on...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div></blockquote>hahahahaha nice one!!!  esp the matching bra n thongs!<br><br>Anyway... i think it's a normal thing for guys to watch porn.

I've encountered people in irc who initial a private chat, but the first thing they ask is what colour undies you wearing or what bra you wearing. I'm just wondering...what's the big deal about knowing the colour? Crazy! Not as if never wear. But I never like talking to such preverts...maybe becos I resent the idea of cybersex. Why do people like to see gal's undies? Really damn curious lor.<br><br></div>
