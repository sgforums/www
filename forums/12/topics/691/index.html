            <div class='col-md body'>I guess a little is ok, but if it's extreme then it's bad.  Actually, if the girl restricts too much.  The guy will still do it anyway as long as he's not caught by you. heehee...<br><br>Anyway, i find porn vulgar, at times funny, most times boring.  It's up to you really.  If you want to restrict him, go ahead but he may really resent you later on.  Other than that, if the guy is worth his salt and really in love.  He wouldn't need the visual stimulation anyway.... ah well.  Another time.</div>

Anyway, it's good you understand and feel about all these.  Explain to your bf about porn.  I'm anti-molesters, anti-perverts too but i don't go out and gunned them down.  They are being themselves.<br><br>Truth to be said, you're right certain groups of people cannot control themselves and want to go out and experience it.  Personally, i think it's more of an in-born psychology problem.  Porn is the catalyst that convert them into full-time perverts... not all though.  For each pervert there are some who are not.  That's the way it is and that's the way it will be even long after we're gone.  We cannot change everything.<br><br>Well, i'm also not saying that you're wrong so don't get worked up.  My family trusts and understands me... my sister always tell me that it's all right but don't go and do something stupid and fool around.  If your bf's not the kind to be trusted then watch over him, explain these things to him and if he's matured enough...  He'll understand.  Otherwise...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey ... why get so worked up about this matter ? I'm sure it was discussed internationally and they found that it was normal for guys to go surf porn ... otherwise they would have closed down all sex sites already. Besides ... surely it's not that bad ? One can fantasise when surfing porn, but so long he can exercise enough self-control to stop himself from doing all those stuff in real life, i think it's all right.</div>
