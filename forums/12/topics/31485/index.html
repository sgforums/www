            <div class='col-md body'>Don't mean to sound long winded but if our opinions are going to be humble, then dun think u'll get much out of us.<br><br>OKokOK, I noe u didn't mean it.<br>Anyway i think the situation presents itself rather clearly. She mentioned that if her mother could no longer accept u, then neither could she. Can there be love then?<br>Perhaps not at the moment...but judging from the <strong>apparent</strong> fact that she chose u over the other 'more qualified' candidates, perhaps she saw something in you which could blossom into something both of you could depend upon for a longer lasting and more stable relationship.<br>Also, it depends on how u feel about her. It seems u only went after her when nudged along, but it also shows that u CAN accept her and not like u totally detest her or what.<br>So in all, I'd say that this relationship CAN develop into something real if both of u hang on and if no other truer love comes along.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>u say that i went after her only after she nudged me. maybe i did not make myself clear. i am the shy type. i have never ever went after a gal or declared that i like her etc. anyway i didnt like anyone until i met this gal. i feared rejection thats why didnt go after her. scare wait she didnt like me. she gave me very obvious hints but still i didnt ask her coz i very scared to get rejected. some more we both study in same class. it will be very awkward. but i really hope that i can spend my life with her. she stays over at my house time to time. she also always liek to bring me to furniture stores and dream about our future house. hehe..</div>

Since you knew that she was a lian, had such a past (your feelings and action continues) AND It didn't stop you from liking her, therefore you can't complain about her past because you CHOOSE to accept it subconsciously. She ask you out, you could reject her - but you didn't, therefore you wanted somewhere within yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>She chose you - because you are (or seemed) DIFFERENT from those who attempt to woo her, because if you feel the same, she wouldn't even fall for you.

Your heart is subdued, just that your mind is experience equity problem -when you love someone - it goes beyond just what you will get *from* her, rather what you can *give* to her. You said if love someone can get her go - you are totally right, but the big question is that HAS she GIVEN YOU up for ANOTHER GUY? No! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>You feel sad that she has lost her virginity - that is her past and you do not have any contact with her past - you can't do a thing - therefore you shouldn't even get bother.

Everyone has that lame past - but if they were to learn and grow from it, it may not be a bad thing. Think about this, if she hasn't gone through such situation, she most likely may not even like you and may still be with that other guy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Love is to accept: if you can't - you forgo all the beautiful thing it could give to your life in exchange for your self-absorbed thoughts that will get you nowhere.

GUess wat! my fren actually ask her y she choose me lah blah blah behind my back!! wtf man!!! then he kept mumbling nonsense when i around and start to turn hostile liek as if he wanna show his 'man-ness' to impress my gal. he so disrespectfully call the auntie to clean up the table lah blah blah. my gal n i were so pissed with his attitude! to think i took some points for that idiot when he beat the traffic light! wat an ingrate!<br>then everytime he calls me (which is rare nowadays except he needs help) he will always end of with this... " hey sumei and u still together huh?"<br>Really regret knowing this kinda ingrates man.<br><br>and yes i pamper my gal a lot. i give her many surprises which she likes. but she has a bad temper which might be the main problem. anyway once again thanking u for ur reply! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
