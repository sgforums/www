GUess wat! my fren actually ask her y she choose me lah blah blah behind my back!! wtf man!!! then he kept mumbling nonsense when i around and start to turn hostile liek as if he wanna show his 'man-ness' to impress my gal. he so disrespectfully call the auntie to clean up the table lah blah blah. my gal n i were so pissed with his attitude! to think i took some points for that idiot when he beat the traffic light! wat an ingrate!<br>then everytime he calls me (which is rare nowadays except he needs help) he will always end of with this... " hey sumei and u still together huh?"<br>Really regret knowing this kinda ingrates man.<br><br>and yes i pamper my gal a lot. i give her many surprises which she likes. but she has a bad temper which might be the main problem. anyway once again thanking u for ur reply! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Art of Surviving<br>Do not depend on people, especially when it comes to relation the jioing part and more especially when it comes to guys in general.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Couch^potato,<br><br>I may not sound professional in helping you. but this is really my utmost personal views.<br><br>I presume you both are serious in considering into committing yourself in relationship.<br><br>If you really love a girl and don't mind her past now, you won't mind the next time. BUT bear in mind, if you mind, you mind, be it now or later and be it you hide it well, or hide it REALLY well. From your story, it seems that you are bothered by a lot of things, not only whether she likes you, but also what reason she likes you? Pretty tricky here... huh? Guess I also can't help much here cos I'm not her and won't know it better than she herself.<br><br>But I guess, at this point of time, the most important question is whether you really like her? if you do, than what is in her that attracted you? and if you don't, what is the REAL reason that is stopping you from loving her? Be honest. I hope you don't need a lie detector... here. Be fair to her and to yourself.<br><br>Give yourself some time to think about this thoroughly. Think it well and think it through once again. If you really mind about her past, but love her deep, don't ask about her past, cos there would be no gain to both of you. What's the point of probing if you REALLY love her?<br><br>This is just my personal opinion.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>All the best, though....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

Many many guys went after her this 2 years but she chose me even though i did not chase her. i just liked her n i didnt even show it to her. we just hanged out together with my other frenz and it seems that she liked me as well so she kinda like 'forced' me to go after her. i m not the type who goes after gals as i m a car n bike fanatic. hehe.. so one day i told her i liked her and my love was reciprocated.  i started sending her home but she won't let me be seen together with her in front of her neighbours etc as she say tt they are all very kaypoh and she didnt want her mum to find out. she said that she will tell her mum in due time. then one day she showed me to her mum and her mum also accepted me. then after that nowadays we hang out very intimately even in her neighbourhood. in fact she always holds my hands in public.i get along fine with her family very well except the father to whom i have not been introduced yet. this will be some time later, not now. she goes out with me ad holds my hands etc. sh even took a cab in the middle of the night to come over to my place when i was feeling very down. MY PROBLEM is that i always ask her this qn--&gt; " what if ur mum rejects me one day?" then she will say that if her mum rejects me then she will leave me as well.. then she says her mum will not reject me lah blah blah. i dunno if she really love me or wat.. any ideaS??  but then rite, when we are together we are very intimate etc. she always sends me sms-es etc to show that she cares for me. we talk EVERYTHING out from head to tail when we have a problem. but i dunno why, when i am alone or sad etc i will ponder over the fact that she lost her virginity not to me. i feel so insecure knowing that so many guys are after her. she has assured me that she wont choose them.. else she would have done that long ago instead of choosing me. Engineers etc after her but she chose me, a poor guy. haha.. how ironic.<br>so i just wanna know does this gal really love me or wat? i feel she loves me really but then... i dunno why she says she can simply leave me if her mum objects?? if u love someone u can just let go like that is it??<br>thanks for reading and i hope non-nonsensical replies will be posted. thanks alot!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>she in the first place chose u is becoz u r simple... not so liek other guys... other guys got $$ doesnt mean she wants... she's been with so many ex b4, that maybe she realised what matters is not about having $$, but just a simple guy which she feels happy being with... get it?<br><br>Its your sincerity that she wants, not $$... always remember that man..<br><br>Don worry about her mum thing, since her mum saw u, and its ur gf u have to tackle, not her mum. U r marrying her daughter, not her. And now is 2003 boy, must see mum approve then married ah?? Siao... if me, mum don allow her problem, i truely love my gf can liao, thats what is matters boy...<br><br>From what i see, ur gf is not like last time, she's changing from her old ways to what she is now, give her support and be happy with her now, thats what it matters... right friend? Hope these advices helps.<br><br>BTW about the virginity thingy, i understand what u feeling... like bway song right? But Its no choice... its already done... what u love her is her present... if can don think about her past... i oso have this kind of feeling b4... but no choice... SG girls to be frank not many virgins left liao... so be with it lah... now HAPPY is the most important thing... don let ir ruin...</div>
