              <p>How come so indecisive one? As a MAN, you must be able to decide and make decision smart and sharp.</p>
              <p>How about you forget about those universities and be your own employer?</p>
              <p>I recommend selling Chwee Kueh, cos I like Chwee Kueh and I will patronise your store if yours is as better than the one at the Hawker centre in Bugis market.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually I don't like both, cos all those graduates come out into society and claimed to be talent from these universities and expects everybody to respect them and treat them like GOD.</p>
              <p>But the truth is, they are all no-class people in their personalities and characters.</p>
              <p>Be an employer yourself and then you can see how you almost made the same mistakes like all those so-called University graduate talents that you will be interviewing to run your Chwee Kueh franchise.</p>

              <p>I'm currently waiting for ns, just graduated from poly and I'm going into NUS ME direct 2nd year which means I'll be in the same batch as you if u decide not to change.</p>
              <p>I know how you feel about everyone saying that NTU engineering is better than that of NUS but my reason for choosing NUS over NTU is because i feel that people think NTU is better as it is so called more hands on and that's what people say is important in engineering rather than theory. However after consulting some experienced engineers and lecturers, I feel that hands on ability is much easier to pick up than to learn the theory and theory is what NUS is supposedly stronger in.</p>
              <p>In engineering you must have both practical and theoretical knowledge but I felt that for me I've got more practical knowledge than most so now it's only fitting for me to study the proper theory.</p>
              <p>In your case coming from A lvl's I presume you would not be so technically adept at hands on work but I still feel that practical work can be picked up more easily through working experience than theory can be learnt.</p>
              <p>This of course is just my own opinion.</p>

Besides the best time to travel is when you're still studying, and what better time than in UNI. When you go out to work you'll have very little time to go out and explore. Who knows life in other countries may be better for you.. just as it probably was for thousands others who have left SG.</p></div>

              <p>How come so indecisive one? As a MAN, you must be able to decide and make decision smart and sharp.</p>
              <p>How about you forget about those universities and be your own employer?</p>
              <p>I recommend selling Chwee Kueh, cos I like Chwee Kueh and I will patronise your store if yours is as better than the one at the Hawker centre in Bugis market.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Actually I don't like both, cos all those graduates come out into society and claimed to be talent from these universities and expects everybody to respect them and treat them like GOD.</p>
              <p>But the truth is, they are all no-class people in their personalities and characters.</p>
              <p>Be an employer yourself and then you can see how you almost made the same mistakes like all those so-called University graduate talents that you will be interviewing to run your Chwee Kueh franchise.</p>

              <p>i graduated from A lvls last yr now in army, so this year i applied for uni and got my self accepted into nus and ntu both mechanical enginnering, the thing is i accepted nus and i wonder if nus is the right choice cos ppl keep tell me ntu engineering better, but i chose nus cos it is more globally known and have longer history, is my choice right</p>
              <p>can list the pros and cons of nus and ntu engineering? do sg employers look at nus and ntu enginnering students differently?? and in terms of standard do they actually differ by alot</p>

              <p><br>My advice is unless u prep to leave sg and work overseas, dun take up engineering.  I graduate from mechanical engineering and had to work a few yrs overseas to move my pay scale up.  Other friends of mine in the engineering who nvr work overseas, their career is in bad shape.  Engineering is not highly value in sg.</p>
