Some stuffs are simply just too hard to share especially when you know it'll effect your partner too when they learn of it.<br><br>Certain things I'll choose to keep it to myself and unless I find it apporiate to talk to her then I will. Maybe it's just a matter of time that I'll tell it to her. She understands that and never really pressure me to say things that I dun feel like talking about it at the moment. Same for me, if I sense that something is bothering her, I'll try to ask but if she prefer to keep quiet about it then is ok with me cause I know she will tell it to me when she feels comfortable about it.</div>

I will rather keep to myself. But usually all my friends feel sad will find me to talk cause I will listen attentively.
