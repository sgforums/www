              <p>Fren,</p>
              <p>Of course study first.</p>
              <p>If you go and work, by the time you want to study, you would be like in your 40s by then. Do you want to go to class in your 40s with people who are still 18 or 19 years old?</p>
              <p>Also, do you want to go to work and one day see all your peers get promoted and higher pay than you because you don't have any paper qualification? Employers will take advantage of you when they know you got no paper qualification, they purposely keep your pay low so they can save money. You will become green with envy when you find your colleagues get better pay package than you.</p>

              <p>There are disadvantages of being a chef.</p>
              <p>1) You have to work in the weekends. You have to work till late in the night. Sometimes its like 7 days a week of work. NO break.</p>
              <p>2) You are stuck in the kitchen. All those fumes</p>
              <p>3) Hotels got breakfast menu. So as chef, you have to come to work at 4am to start cooking for the breakfast.</p>
              <p>4) Only few chefs make it out to become celebrities. Majority have to grind with low pay in the kitchen.</p>
              <p>If you want to be different from the rest, suggest you try Le Cordon Bleu, world class french cuisine school, you can either try go to France or Australia, they have a branch there.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>And just to add more view of being chef which is not discuss here :</p>
              <p>1) Even in Public hoildays like Chinese New Years, you also have to work and this does not mean you only focus on cooking only. You will have to help washing the dishes as well and by the time everything is finished, should be about 2-3 a.m when you knock off.</p>
              <p>2) Some of those senior chef are "china-minded", meaning they will not coach you how to cook the restaurant signature dishes for fear of being replaced. There might be an chance that you do "simple" things on all of your life, example cooking vegatable, meat and throwing rubbish.And these people are the kind of Ah seng without education who is not hesitated to raise their voice and "screw" you. Just warch those Mediacorpse chef reality show in MobTV, you know what I mean</p>
              <p>3) I do know some chefs "own time own target" cook their company foods for themselves because of stress, you just didn't get caught. :D</p>
              <p>4) Finally depend whether your girlfriend believe that "all job is an champaign", Most of the chef know are single, and I didn't think I need to stated the reason why.</p>

              </p><p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">What are your dreams? I am not just talking about interests... I am talking about what you really want. <br>What you think will make you happy.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">What do you want to see in your life in the future? Do you want a normal life like most people does? Working 8-6 shift and all those...</p>
              <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">Or do you want to do what you really want, your dream? But know all the hardship that the rest stated above and still wants your to achieve your dream?</p>
              <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">And make sure every decision made is in line with your dream and your vision.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">If you wants to be a chef, by all means go for it... or other dream you wants</p>
              <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">Plan it out. Do you need to study or can you just start working? and how are you going to get to your vision?</p>
              <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">Ohh btw... Most people achieve their "dreams" and regretted... Because that wasn't actually what they really wants...<br>Have a dream for the right reason...<br>Always ask yourself, why do I want this dream? Is it because it looks cool? or because the life of that perticular job sounds comfortable and reasonably easy?<br>Or is it because this job allow you to be able to help others that's why you wanted it?</p>
              <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">Take some time and think about what you really want. Just a job, or one with meanings. </p>
              <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">Have a dream with the right reason and decide your decision base on it.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">People might not understand why you choose that path, like for example being a chef is so bad in this case, but if you have a right reason to become a chef and not just because you like to cook, go for it. </p>
              <p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">I have choose path whereby people thinks I am stupid.<br>But I always work towards my dream. <br>Because I have the right reason for my dreams and I will keep going and trying no matter what, and no matter how old I am. </p>

              <p>Yo, hormone changes in life, as you age, what dream u make 10 or 20 years ago changed, some become wet dream and some just went dry out. Look at those corrupted SCDF chief and 4 chefs who cohorted with their food supplier contractors and many others, they have never dream of doing it, but they did it.</p>
              <p>After you finish yr education, typicially, you will be in yr 20s, then you struggler to pursue yr dream, that may take a decade, then you are in your mid or late 30s, very soon, you will be in your 50s, then by 70s, some already up lorry, some up the van, some end up still hanging around with no life, cos everything also very old and weak.</p>
              <p>Therefore, in conclusion, just do a job and dream less, life aint long ya</p>
