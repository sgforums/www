            <div class='col-md body'>There is a girl whom I liked who is studying in the same course as me in the uni. But due to a twist of fate, I was one month too late in expressing my feelings to her. I never had such a strong feeling for a girl ever before. To me, she's the cutest and sweetest girl I've ever met or seen.<br><br>Before her current bf expresses his feelings to her, we were getting along well and i can sense that I could stand a chance if I ever have an opportunity to tell her my feelings. Actually i plan to do that on her birthday. Cruel as it seems, just one month before her birthday, her bf made the move before me. Before that, I never knew there was any guy going after her. If I knew that beforehand, I would have put more effort in wooing her. Until now, I still believe that if I was the one who made the move first, things would have been very much different. When I asked her if she would accept me if I was the one who expressed my feelings to her first, she refused to answer.<br><br>She is at least kind enough to tell me that she has a bf even before she told her other friends. She asked if I will still continue to treat her as a friend. Of course I do. I still treasure my friendship with her. When I saw her bf's photo, he was better looking and bigger size than me. I guess only a stupid girl will reject such a guy's proposal. If I'm a girl, I would have also chosen him instead of me. Everyone wants the best thing for themselves.<br><br>Knowing that her bf in now serving NS, and wish to go to the university next year, I also wish that he can go to the uni he wants. Even if he needs any help in future, I'll also willing to go all out to help him. How I wish her bf is a nice guy who will take good care of her. It doesn't matter I can't have her if she can get a guy who is better than me. I also want her to have the best thing as well.<br><br>During a certain gathering, I finally managed to see him in person. I msg her to ask her to intro her bf to me. Initially she agreed. But after that she said that her bf doesn't wish to know me. I'm really very disappointed over his response. If her bf is really a nice guy, he wonldn't have rejected my offer. If he can prove to be that he is a kind and magnanimous gentleman, I would not have any worries for her. I would have been more than willing to let him have her. If he is really such a nice guy, even if he were to let me have her, I would have rejected his offer. To think that I even prayed for him, that he can go to the uni he wanted, really disappoints me. Nevertheless, I still ask her to say "Hi" to him on my behalf and tell him to enjoy himself.<br><br>I understand that sometimes a guy is not willing to associate with any guy who is close to his gf. Maybe he needs time. She told be before that her bf is not very mature. Well, I guess everyone needs time to grow and mature. I really hope that he can mature soon and take good care of her. Sometimes I do feel that love between couples can be selfish at times. But of course when two get together happily without anyone getting hurt, it is a good thing. But when two get together at the expense of someone else getting hurt, I think it is not worth it.<br><br>I guess I'll continue waiting for her just in case. That is because I'm a guy. I can get a gf easily in future with a gd career. For girls, its different, the older she is, the harder it is for her to find a bf. I also cannot bear to see her get hurt in future. I believe a lot of problems in relationship happen because people make the wrong choice right from the beginning. I do not wish to find another gf now, because if I found one and she breaks off with her bf, I'll be in a deadlock situation.<br><br>Sometimes I feel that being so nice to others will only hurt myself even more. Others may not appreciated it at all. But that is all about love. Love is all about selflessness and giving, without asking anything in return. It is not an easy thing to do.<br><br>I just want to have a place to let go of my feelings and emotions...</div>

If you're gonna start calculating for the ten thousands of POTENTIAL hazards in every step ya take, you most probably won't make it to your next 100 metres....<br><br>Yes... Loving someone is being selfish in a sense.... Whether her bf is nice to her or not in the future, she've made her choice... Even if things go wrong for her in the future, doesn't mean that she would necessarily have to choose to be with you...?<br><br>Thinking that you're ALL LOVE and SELFISH is just WHAT you think... If YOUR AIM is not her, would you be doing all this?<br><br>Urge you to just move on with your life... If it's meant to be, it'll be... Performing TOO MUCH of such RESTRICTIVE acts might only act on to your own misery and perhaps even hers too in the future....<br><br>Her bf's good or not is not up to you to judge... REMEMBER, he's HER BF.... NOT yours.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I don't calculate my every potential hazard in my life, all I need is one wrong step, drop into the "long kang" and I won't reach the end of my 100m as well. I will still ultimately reach the end of the 100m eventually if I make sure I make the right move everytime. Even though it might be a slow process, but at least its possible.<br><br>Of course I know she has already made the choice and she might not choose me even if things might not work out between she and her bf, but again, it really doesn't matter. I will always respect her choice. I know u mean well and always encourage pple to move on with life. Its good.<br><br>But I believe this world will be a better world if there are more selfless pple and love around. Nevermind if the whole world around you are heartless. The light in you will show sooner or later. And I not only show love to her, but to everyone around me. If you need any help, I'm also more than willing to go all out to help you as long as it is within my limit. No problem abt that. I also wish to love her bf as much as I love her.<br><br>And whether her bf is good to her is not for me to judge. I agreed. I'm not judging him. I'm juz pointing out his weak points and hope that he can change for the better. Everyone has their bad points, including me. I know my bad points as well. I'm sure he can be a better person if he can be more gentlemanly. It is a constructive criticism, not a judgment. Everyone's character need to be improved and that can only come if others are kind enough to point it out. If not, that person will never realise it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks AngelDark...<br><br>What you said is correct. Holding on to something is no good. I realise that as well. I'm already beginning to give her some breathing space. Actually I want to let her try out the relationship as well and prove me wrong. If it turns out well, I'll be happy for her and I'll very gladly take back all the things I've said abt her bf.<br><br>Its her first bf in her life. It will prick my conscience for the rest of my life if she is hurt in anyway due to my interference.<br><br>As for the "long kang" I'm talking about. Maybe "long kang" is not a good analogy. My original meaning is potential hazards like what Devil1976 has said. What I'm worried is the potential danger of hurting others in the process of my decision. Maybe it will be a learning experience for that other party as well, but it is not a good feeling in making others fall because of me.<br><br>So, I plan ahead to prevent others from being hurt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course if a good girl comes along I won't be so stupid to reject lah, but now I don't see the need to have one<br><br>If I'm in her bf's shoe, I'll treat any close guy friends of hers well as well. By treating them in a gentleman way, my gf will respect me as well. I'll trust my gf. If she betray my trust, then she's not fit to be my life partner.<br><br>Actually I think he is quite free now. He going to ORD soon and he is in the air force. Poly students are harder to get into local uni. Hope he can get into one.<br><br>I hate to be in love with an attached girl as well. But this time I'm forced my circumstances. In love before she gets attached. Her friend told me she feels sorry for me as well.<br><br>That time when she told me she has a bf, we have a good talk together. She even thought I'll scold her for misleading me and playing with my feelings, but how could I possibly bear to scold her? Its not her fault as well.<br><br>Actually I bought her a bracelet waiting to give it to her when I express my feelings to her, but since now she already has a bf, I don't see the point in keeping it. And since it was originally meant for her, I gave it to her that day.<br><br>Before we left, I prayed for her and bf and wish her the best. She initially wanted to give me a treat, but I rejected the offer. Sign... what a nice girl. At least I didn't regret going after her in the first place.</div>
