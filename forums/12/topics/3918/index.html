            <div class='col-md body'>To make a long story short, I met someone and we beame friends. I had a crush on her, and I was rejected twice by her because she was thinking of a previous guy she liked.<br><br>One day she finally said she liked me, no she suddenly realised she loved me after a specific event occoured. It was a magical moment and that was then she leaned in to kiss me all of a sudden and it gave me a shock but it was  a pleasant one.<br><br>So we loved each other for a while with the foundation of a friendship already. While attached we became really close special friends. After that, we realised that we worked better as friends then lovers. I managed to get over her I guess. And moved on<br><br>Then one day she confessed that she was not over me and we got back together (again) and this tmie it was even more blissful than the rest because it was a combination of a good stable friendship and a very special romance. Then one day she said to me that occasionaly she still thinks of the previous guy she liked but I guess i exaggerated the whole situation and it went out of hand. It was my fualt in this case.<br><br>After that we became friends again, still very good special friends without the romance but i still was not over his this time and she was not over me but she felt everytime we got attached it got complex but everytime we were not attached we feel so distant from each other.<br><br>this time though we kept arguing and it came to the point where the fault fell on the both of us and suddenly she said she didn't want to know me anymre and she has stopped contacting me for the past few days.<br><br>i don't know. i really miss her and i don't know what to do or think. i think it is unfair of her to expect me to cater to her mood changes, like from romance to friends romance to friends. she has always expected me to change according to her own feelings but i find it very hard<br>but deep inside i do know ilove her and she still llove me a lot even though she thinks of the old guy sometimes. i don't know what to do.<br><br>i don't know whether to carry on quietly, to tell her off and everything i feel and carry on, or to try and carry our friendship on<br><br>i feel there is too much water under the bridge and this is a feeling i have had for some time now.<br><br>pls help..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I too think that she's not ready for a relationship. Either that she's still too young to understand the thing about relationship. The idea of commitment and to be tied down is not in her mind.<br><br>I understand that it's hard accept that both or ur have broken off. Furthermore, both of u have the base of a close friendship. To call it off is a even harder thing than just to break up and remain as frens. I think time will be able to help. Slowly, the pain will go, but never never look for another girl to be ur gf in replacement of her. It will only be cheating her.<br><br>I believe that it shld be urself that she likes. TO change for someone means that she wants to turn u into someone that she likes, and this is not possible. Becoz it's not u. There is only one unique u and only one unique person in her mind. U may say that she is thinking of another person at times, but it's totally alright, becoz memories are something that will remain in us forever</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah I guess so but she's still not talking to me and waiting for her to do so is an agony. Btw, she's 21. She isn't that young in a way but I guess she is still quite naive in some areas. It's quite odd considering i'm 19, and extremely naive myself. But there has been certain aspects of herself which i have been sure of, and that is she has a hot temper.<br><br>She did tell me once, she thought of the previous person at times, but when she thinks of me and misses me it isn't anyone else. I'm not totally blinded by love but I could sense somehow that what she said was true. It wasn't my own delusiveness telling me so because I could see it in her eyes. And i believed her<br><br>Then everything diminished and it's dead<br><br>Sigh</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Cradleoff,<br><br>Are you simply trying to be funny or are you so bored that u wanna write some stories to fool pple and play them out?<br><br>U mention that u r 19, and in love with a ger in this thread. However, in another thread 'My brother caught me masturbating', u mention that u r a 17 yrs old JC ger...... so may i ask what r u trying to prove? U r a lesbian who couldn't tell her own age or what? errmmm...... OR, simply said, you are her brother who had caught her masturbating? Is it possible? I dunnoe, maybe you would like to tell us who u really are. Just can't believe that after so much incident had happened, the 2 of you still can be so close as to share 1 nick, haha.....if that's the case, the 1st thread won't be put up i guess.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In response to the two people posting,<br><br>Yeah it's only me. And the breakup problem is genuine. The masturbating one, as I'm sure most people have thought, isn't serious. That was my first posting here you see, so I was testing the seriousness of it. I've seen a lot of perverse responses from other mails that have been totally unrelated to sex and I just wanted to check it out. SOrry for playing u out. You realise I could have easily registered another time and posted as another person but then I didn't.<br><br>I really don't know. I called her the other day and she slammed down the phone on me. I am getting really pissed!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I suppose Cradle has cleared our doubts...<br><br>Well, with regard to ur prob, I think it's just that the girl is still unable to feel tied down yet. She maybe 21, but it doesn't mean that she will understand the meaning of love, or being in a relationship. U can say that she's matured, but it's a different aspect of a person u r talking about here. Maybe she is inexperience in handling relationship, or maybe experience something  about love in her life?<br><br>she could be bothered by something that u said, which u might say without knowing. Maybe instead of calling her, can try writing to her and tell her ur feelings and how u see the relationship, and ask her for her views, reasons and stuff. It's a bit old-fashion, but it works for some cases.<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>
