OUCH!! Nice choice of hurtful words there <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Secondly - reason why I posted that is because I really don't think 12 year old relationships and rumours are of much concern but I suppose if you want to help the kid that's fine. I mean honestly, we've all been that age once when school was tough because of us just hitting that age when we're starting to notice girls and rumours are rampant but I'm sure that you can all agree that even though it may have seem like a big deal at the time it's absolutely trivial compared to others things we had yet to experience. So I'm not being a wiseass, I just think you're taking a 13 year old's (or whatever age he is but from what he's told us about his friends he's obviously no older than 13) problem too seriously. If you guys in AA do like helping our youth, no matter how small the problem, please let me know and I'll desist.<br><br>Oh and btw, about the chicks comment, I've had gfs before and I can assure you they're HOT! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>EDIT: And my signature is a reference to the movie Shaft.

            <div class='col-md body'>haha... very funny... for me indead...<br><br>i was once a rumour maker, now a rumour stopper...<br><br>i can say i am very experienced at rumour stuffs... especially at this age.<br><br>all i can say to solve ur solution is not just keep quiet and act as if nothing happened...<br><br>i have 2 solutions to u provided u must be very skilled:<br><br>1) Start a rumour on him, anyhow start, there is no need for fire to get smoke, just make some smoke urself, anyhow say he love who who, last time he tell u de, make it childish as possible, then when he say u like that girl, then say him back.... the more childish it is, the more effective..<br><br>2) "admit" the rumour in a very sarcastic way, or in a sense very fake way, then say like, " Aiyo, like that girl say i like her.... i cover up for u for so long very good le hor, u not young liao, take the initiative la... need my help?"<br><br>yeah i agree that both way is very very childish, but it is effective...<br>this kind has happened both me and my friends... or even my enemies...<br><br>Tip: learn to suan ppl, suan as in very sarcastic yet very humorous way... can be very useful in life whether in real world or in school, with friends or family...<br><br>IA</div>

When others see that there is no truth in the rumours, they'll stop circulating the rumours on their own.
