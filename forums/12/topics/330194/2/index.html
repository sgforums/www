              <p>Sorry to hear that you have broken up with yr gf.    It is not easy to let go of someone when you regard her as someone so special and nobody can take her place.   I,too, find it hard to get over someone who is so special, one in a million.    Well, this is mourning time for you, let yourself release your emotions and do not force yourself to control it, if not it is going to make it tougher to get over.</p>
              <p>Take care.</p>

              <p>frankly speaking the person writing this must be a

              irreplaceable in this world.....maybe another 10 years down the
              road when u matured...then u realize no one is irreplaceable in any
              relationship......not like world is coming to an end.....moreover
              young kids are always so sensitive over whether the gf accompany
              them or not....she want accompany her friends...u do the same and
              find ur own friends lah....why be super glue not sian meh everyday

              <p>things that can touch her include reaching out your hand until your hand is in physical contact with a part of her body.</p>
              <p>making her fall for you can be done by using trip wire to impede her movement</p>

              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">then she msged me and said she's going out with her friends to break fast together..i was rather upset..becos she could go out with her friends instead of going out with me..i told her im abit disappointed..and she apologized and everything..i just forget it then..</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">the next day..sunday,i asked her whether she can meet me..but she told me her friends are coming over to study at her house so she cant go out with me. i was yet again,disappointed but i let go of the matter.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">e following day,i met uo with her at school and finnaly got the chance to talk to her. We wne tsomewhere and i told her how i felt the past 2 days and she said she wanted to go out with me as much as i wanted to go out with her,but she just cant..</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">i understand her situation and didnt pursue it any farther..over the next few days,we would just call each other and talked abt homework...exams..the usual "what are u doing now?" questions and..erm talking dirty..haha..i just wished time would just stop so we could go on talking forever..but eventually,she wanted to go to slp..so yea,said goodnight and the lovey dovey things and bedtime for both of us...</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">everything was fine until today..when we were out together,i told her we havent spend much time together n asked her whether after her tuition we could go home together..she said ok,i was happy of course..</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">so after she finished her tuition,i met her..it was around 6+ alr..almost 7..she met up with me wanted to go home immediately becos its almost her break fast time. i was kinda upset but i just try to like..understand..i know its important to be home before the break fast time so she could pray and eat..</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">after i sent her home,i msg her and told her tht i was upset n i wish i can spend more time with her..she then started telling me tht i didnt try to understand her and stuff..then i got fed up of course..we started arguing..i told her about my feelings for the past few days when she was with her friends instead of me...and she then said i really dont understand her..she suggest we might as well break up..</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">she still wants to love me..as a friend...i dunno what to say..i was really heartbroken..i wished i did not got mad and quarrel with her..but i had no choice..she wants a break up...i cant say no and not let her go..</p>
              <p style="margin: 0px 0px 1em; padding: 0px;">so yea..that's it..that's what happened...</p>

              <p>If you really want her back, then....</p>
              <p>Go apologise to her and let her know that you wished you hadn't got angry and quarrelled with her. That is only IF you truly realised that you are wrong.</p>
              <p>I guess your PRIDE/EGO is preventing you from doing so?</p>
              <p>You HAVE a CHOICE. A choice not to end up like some retards here who can never change, admit they were wrong and vowed to embrace their pride/ego till death...which they will eventually realise anyway.</p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <p>You can still choose to join those retards and repeat the same mistakes on your next relationship like a neverending cycle. And if you wonders why all your relationship were like this, it's because you never actually took the effort to realise, overcome and correct your own mistakes. </p>
              <p>You do understand that you were being possessive right? And it's that possessiveness that you had in you that caused this breakup.</p>
              <p>If you do not get rid of this insecure feelings which caused you to be possessive, then you are just going to put all your future relationships AT RISKS!</p>
              <p>Be a MAN and admit your weakness and mistakes to her and repent, AGE is not an excuse for maturity especially when you have a gf. Relationships forces people to mature in character, and the person that denies to mature in a relationship will be forced out of the relationship before he could even realised it. </p>
              <p>I hope you can be a better guy than some retards here. Their lives has already ended, but You still have HOPE. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
