              <p>ok. If you look at his current job, he is only there for 1 year. Imagine that his resume is flooded with job experience at only 1 year, 2 years. This actually give people an impression that he is a job hopper.</p>
              <p>Why do I want to train up a person that has a record of job hopping? The general recommendation for a person to stay in a job is about 3 to 5 years. And by that time, he should be promoted or move on. Unless, his job is a contract based or project based, people would like to take on a new things after the contract or project has expired. </p>
              <p>If you look at the cost of training up a person from probation to skilled, and finally he is a proficient and effective worker, it is about 3 to 6 months. So he is only be useful for another 6 months!?</p>
              <p>If he has really finished up his MBA, I would still recommend him to stay for another 1 years, before he can convincing say that he thinks that he can do more than his current job.Or this current boss does not move, so he have to move out.</p>

              <p>no need to put everything in your resume. like me there are sometimes in my resume no job. but its a world of companies out there to see. just put a few for your job looking can oredi. show some strength, hide some stregth. show some weakness, hide some weakness. when work work like water, so people don;t know where you are strongest. let them hit you hard where they think you are weakest. then they know. even my boss and people interview me don;t knwo where i have been in the past. they think they kow but unless i tell them, they will never know. but really now i can;t because i forgotten. so many places i been to, all the caompanies and their canteens seems so familiar to me, like t=i have deen there before - Deja Vu! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I don't know if you realise the severity of your actions, if you omit anything in your resume, chances are the employer will find out. The HR is not dumb, they can see the gaps in your job history and ask you why you have been out of job during this period. If you try to bluff your way by putting "extending" your previous job history, the HR does reference checks. The more reputable the employer you apply to, the more reference checks theydo to your resume.</p>
              <p>They won't know it when they interview you but after they hire you, they will check your background. If they find out you r lying, they will put all sorts of pressure at you when working.</p>

              <p>Well, if you are looking for better opportunities without leaving a bad reputation on your resume..given your near completion of MBA..you might want to consider going to Hotel to work in the management dept..</p>
              <p>this way you can be part of the events planning and they do expose you to huge events which you will gain experiences and help get your brain thinking..which will help you facilitate and let you understand yourself better..</p>
              <p>this is probably the best time since 2 Integrated Resort Hotels headhunted lots of experience staffs over already, so you can go in and fill in the gaps caused by the IR..</p>
              <p>it's not really highest pay, but you'll gain lots of experience depending on how you look at each event/dinner/client you serve &amp; interact with.</p>

              <p>That is why, i also tell my interviewers the same thing, I am very adaptable ! But they are not convince and they are afraid to hire me because they think i wiould leave after a short while. You know, employers are very selfish, they only think about themselves, they firstly value loyalty as the main reason for hiring.</p>
              <p>I have also known people who worked for 10 years and then when they change job, they suddenly found themselves in an alien environment and they fail to adapt.</p>
              <p>I think I have to stay, no choice about that. Its not easy to find the right job. Attending interviews is hard because if i take leave my employer will be suspicious of me, especially when I take a lot of leave.</p>
              <p>And then employes do reference checks, if i leave my current company on a bad note, then they may say harsh things about me to the new employer and then wallah, the new boss will act like teh old boss to test me.</p>

              <p>By now you already have accumulated 8 yrs of worked experience. Why not you write an ideal job description for yourself than you look at what you are currently doing? Does any line item JD matches your desire JD?</p>
              <p>Does your past JD depict some of your desire JD? (So you are building up your horizontal portfolio already. ) I just want you to aware what you have already "Gained"</p>

              <p>To your second point, surprisingly I am working for a MNC. But this MNC is badly run. Disorganized, people like to tai chee and some managers got attitude problem, very sianz lah. My previous company also MNC, but everything very systematic and organized. They have briefings and proper instructions are laid out verbally and by email before they actually do the job. Also there is proper JOB TRAINING. Over here, the boss is quite selfish. He wants me to figure everything myself or else if i don't finish the work, he will take it and do it for himself. THe boss said that when he joined the co, he had to figure everything out himself, this is not the proper way ! A proper leader should train his staff. That is what a manager is for. Managers should have leadership and provide training, not do his staff's work.</p>

              <p>To tell you the truth, getting the interview is one thing, doing the job is another. I think I am ok with interviews, convincing the potential employers. But its when i start taking over the job, that is when the complication starts. I may come from a different culture from the past and suddenly the way things done in the new company becomes a cultuire shock and makes me feel so disatisfied with the way things are done here.</p>
              <p>I am not sure about you wife, perhaps she has talents to make it at the job. But for me, I have been having a series of bad lucks getting bosses who are not open to mentoring, not open to training, not open to cooperation, not open to proper systematic and coordination. This boss is very disorganized.</p>
              <p>Yep, you are right, Show my talent is very important. But the fun stops the moment you are hired and you start the pain of the new job.

              <p><br>I do bring a lot of inititiative. I ask my boss a lot of things. But he getts annoyed at me and accuses me of not checking the work properly and bugging him and even had the audacity say I accuse him.</p>
              <p>What does he expect? In my previous company, whent the template comes, the management would discuss over this and managers are open to staff feedback. Its an open discussion. Here, the boss just brush me off one side like I am not important. I really think he is a cuckoo. I don't want to make mistake so anyting i am not sure, i have to ask him.</p>
              <p>Come on, there are a lot of things I am not sure about the templates, of course i have to ask him. But he accuse me of not looking and studying at them properly. What good use of me studying them when he doesn't trust me with teh work? He does it anyway. Jerk..him.</p>

              <p>To tell you the truth, getting the interview is one thing, doing the job is another. I think I am ok with interviews, convincing the potential employers. But its when i start taking over the job, that is when the complication starts. I may come from a different culture from the past and suddenly the way things done in the new company becomes a cultuire shock and makes me feel so disatisfied with the way things are done here.</p>
              <p>I am not sure about you wife, perhaps she has talents to make it at the job. But for me, I have been having a series of bad lucks getting bosses who are not open to mentoring, not open to training, not open to cooperation, not open to proper systematic and coordination. This boss is very disorganized.</p>
              <p>Yep, you are right, Show my talent is very important. But the fun stops the moment you are hired and you start the pain of the new job.

              <p>Well, if you are looking for better opportunities without leaving a bad reputation on your resume..given your near completion of MBA..you might want to consider going to Hotel to work in the management dept..</p>
              <p>this way you can be part of the events planning and they do expose you to huge events which you will gain experiences and help get your brain thinking..which will help you facilitate and let you understand yourself better..</p>
              <p>this is probably the best time since 2 Integrated Resort Hotels headhunted lots of experience staffs over already, so you can go in and fill in the gaps caused by the IR..</p>
              <p>it's not really highest pay, but you'll gain lots of experience depending on how you look at each event/dinner/client you serve &amp; interact with.</p>

              <p>I don't know if you realise the severity of your actions, if you omit anything in your resume, chances are the employer will find out. The HR is not dumb, they can see the gaps in your job history and ask you why you have been out of job during this period. If you try to bluff your way by putting "extending" your previous job history, the HR does reference checks. The more reputable the employer you apply to, the more reference checks theydo to your resume.</p>
              <p>They won't know it when they interview you but after they hire you, they will check your background. If they find out you r lying, they will put all sorts of pressure at you when working.</p>

              <p>There is something I know about what you do, but I am not going to say it. As you say, like I care? And then what if you go to another company and it turns out to be something similar or worse? Then? Leave again? Grass is not always greenier on the other side, different challenges.</p>
              <p>Stay long enough so that you can learn how to tackle the same problem when you go elsewhere. But don't leave after a year or two. What we got to lose anyway? It is not as if we are professional footballers, whereby our soccer career only lasts until we are 32 years old then after that, our old legs cannot play anymore. With retirement age extended, we can work pass our 60s. So stay back one or two more years won't kill us, ya know.</p>
