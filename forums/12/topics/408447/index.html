              <p>Different industries. Yes I am learning completely diff skills, I like challenges and opportunties in job role.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately what I am getting now is so paltry...there's little to learn. At my level this is so basic. I am just praying that my temper dont get the better of me and I continue to use mywisdom to strategise to persuade the boss to give me more job exposure.</p>

              <p>Then the boss got this friend of his, the attention seeking muppet junior lady who is the mktg junior exec who wants to get attention from me. I say I am not interested, that crazy junior lady always go and try to insult me and organize social functions that leave me out to try to make me feel left out - she always want my attention. I just ignore her, because she has little meaning to me. I got other many many more friends out there and social outings of my own, so I am happy with my own friends.</p>
              <p>And when i am frustratingly battling my boss for more job exposure, i just know that she will barge in for more attention. She just went pass me, and passed a passing remark that appear to want to insult me, but i just ignore her. She tries to be pesky and irritaing, even try to stand at the cubicle next to mine to trhy to spy what I am typing.</p>
              <p>Insignificant person, not worth my attention...i dislike attention seeking muppets. Thank god, i dont have to attend social functions with this kind of underachievers. This lady ah, office gathering also want to force me to share present and have to add her in msn messenger. When I dun add her, I kena snub, good lah. Haha, I thank god, i dun need her attention. But I will be ready, this junior lady when she fails to attack me, she will get other people to attack me one. But i am always one step ahead. Bottom line is dont pay any attention to those attention seeking muppets. I dont know what kind of person this junior is, her lady boss is nice person but can spawn such a crazy subordinate.</p>

              <p>Not really, the pay is ok, above average but not fantastic.</p>
              <p>Training policies is absolutely naada..</p>
              <p>Not so easy, I have been to interviews whereby the interviewer
              kept on hogging on my job record and ask me why I move here and
              there. Moreover, the economy is not so good, there are jobs but not
              many good jobs out there. It takes time to find a suitable job.</p>
              <p>Today the boss so blady moody, he just like so busy and don';t
              want to entertain people. If he has given me the job then he won't
              be so busy. What good use of me being here if he don't utilise me.
              I know that I am not familiar with the format but if he don't give
              me a first try then I wont be able to improve.</p>
              <p>This is what a boss should do, he should coordinate. A boss
              should have leadership skills to delegate, not absorb and hoard all
              the work for himself...unfortunately I have ended up with this kind
              of boss.</p>
              <p>I wish that next time, the job seekers get to interview the
              company instead of the company interview the job seeker. Always
              unfair, the company ends up getting their way and the staff are
              unhappy.</p>

              <p>go locate those short term &amp; temp job assignments for big events, and at times volunteer your services.</p>
              <p>than after each short term job, type your reason for leaving the job as: End of Job Assignment or Contracted Work if you are ever required to sign a contract etc..</p>

              <div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Macho Man:</div>
              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I applied for the job, and the interviewer told me what kind of
              exciting work experiences and learning experience I will get. I was
              promised that I get exposure and to work with many people.</p>
              <p>But after I joined this new company, I found that half the time
              I sat down in my place, no work at all. I ask my boss but came back
              with deaf answer. So months past by, I still sit there doing
              nothing, I was promised to have the opportunity to do "A-Function"
              job. But up until now, my boss still wants to take full charge of
              the A-Function job. He gives me little morsels of the part of
              A-Function job to do, really pathetic exposure. I learn nothing.
              The A-Function job has a few levels, after i helped my boss to
              finish the first level, he had meetings with the bigboss and the
              people from other department but he conveniently left me out. Then
              second and third levels, he left me out and didn't give me the
              opportunity to update the A-Function job, I am so disappointed.
              Broken promises.</p>
              <p>I know it is no use to tell him about me wanting more exposure,
              knowing that he is so laizze faire, the boss does everything last
              minute and he lacks coordination skills. So I pester him everyday,
              asking him irritating questions to tell him that I want a piece of
              the action. I know I am new to the A-Function job and I am not use
              to the format, but he could at least give me some guidance so I can
              do the work because this was what I was hired for in the first
              place. I know I can do it, but he just doesn't want to teach me. I
              have handles A-Function jobin my previous company but because my
              previous company is from an entirely different industry, I need
              some guidance for this current company.</p>
              <p>This boss neglects his staff, it has been 1 year, I am totally
              disatisfied. Most of the time I am free, swatting flies. He doesn't
              want to give me the opportunity to do the job.</p>
              <p>But I know some of you will surely advice me to quit. Quitting
              is really not the answer. Economy is not good and it is hard to
              find a job. I have changed 4 jobs in 8 years so I do not want to be
              branded as a job hopper. My longest was 2.5 years.</p>
              <p>I believe this is the chance for me to stand up against my boss,
              and to lobby more for my job role. I want to pester him everyday to
              give me more chance. What should I do? If the situation don't
              change after 2.5 years, I think I may have to seek a new job.
              I am unhappy with the culture. It is so unsystematic, I am suppose
              to be in charge of the A-function job, but the boss have decided to
              go back against his words. And I really dislike a job whereby I am
              so free half the time. I want a meaning ful job, something that I
              can sit down and work from 8am to 5pm and not surf the internet as
              I have nothing to do. I have a bit of work, but it is nothing
              compared to my previous job. THe job is boring, it has some
              interesting job functions but my boss is hoarding them for
              himself.</p>
              <p>Very little point to have a word with him, I have told him
              before, but he just sits down there quietly. I have no choice but
              to continue to pester him and implicitly tell him I want more job
              exposure, but day by day I am receiving a small morcel.</p>

              <p>if you want to learn as much as possible without appearing to be a job-hopper..just try out a method which  i did previously..</p>
              <p>go locate those short term &amp; temp job assignments for big events, and at times volunteer your services.</p>
              <p>than after each short term job, type your reason for leaving the job as: End of Job Assignment or Contracted Work if you are ever required to sign a contract etc..</p>
              <p>but this method can only be used towards the school holidays whereby companies require sudden surge of temp employments.</p>
              <p>else search the net to pick up whatever you can learn on your own time since half of your work time, you are left with nothing to do..just keep the attention seeker out incase she rats on you etc.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, mistakes I made in the past was all my jobs were permanent assignments. I do not prefer temp or contractual jobs because they don't offer the privaledges of permanent employment.</p>
              <p>No problem, today I stayed back at work and the attention seeker was there, i just work there and didn't bother about her, but she will be back laughing like a hyena. She don't scare me at all.</p>

              <p><br>I am almost finishing my MBA, i only got my thesis left. It is no dream to have a job doing nothing, I am a person who wants to have meaning in his job, I want to have something to do. That is why I have to fight my boss for more work exposure.</p>
              <p>I know this is not the USA, where people will beg to have a job but we Asians have gotten our fair share of suffering, through the 1998 Asian Financial Crisis. Its time we become more picky in our jobs. I just thought that during the interview my boss say this job has so much to do but when it comes ot the real job, I have little to do.</p>
              <p>And then his approach is so unsystematic, if I don't complete what he gave me, without warning, he would finish the work for me. And then he doesn't tell me where I went wrong. I have to keep on asking him questions.</p>
              <p>In my past job, things were done so organized, before we do something we have meetings and discussions on how to approach the problem. But here, my boss thinks first without even telling me and then he sends vague instructions via email and make me have to struggle to figure out what it means.</p>

              <p>if your boss can't tell you explicitly what he will be measuring you on (and make sure the goals are measurable), you are better off start looking from within and work for someone who can adequately value you or outside.</p>

              <p><br> I am almost finishing my MBA, i only got my thesis left. It is no
              dream to have a job doing nothing, I am a person who wants to have
              meaning in his job, I want to have something to do. That is why I
              have to fight my boss for more work exposure.</p>
              <p>I know this is not the USA, where people will beg to have a job
              but we Asians have gotten our fair share of suffering, through the
              1998 Asian Financial Crisis. Its time we become more picky in our
              jobs. I just thought that during the interview my boss say this job
              has so much to do but when it comes ot the real job, I have little
              to do.</p>
              <p>And then his approach is so unsystematic, if I don't complete
              what he gave me, without warning, he would finish the work for me.
              And then he doesn't tell me where I went wrong. I have to keep on
              asking him questions.</p>
              <p>In my past job, things were done so organized, before we do
              something we have meetings and discussions on how to approach the
              problem. But here, my boss thinks first without even telling me and
              then he sends vague instructions via email and make me have to
              struggle to figure out what it means.</p>

              <p>then your case is very simple. After you finish your MBA, get really to move on to another place, set up a business or take over one.</p>
              <p>I think you are overpowered, and you feel that there is more you can do. Try doing volunteering then for the time being. </p>
              <p>My guess is that you are still single, so concentrate in looking for a mate.</p>
              <p>I think you are narrow in your scope,how about your fitness, health, and other prespectives.</p>

              <p>you mean you got much to do about nothing? yes, i hear ppl get sick from that too.....and i don't think it is a matter of you can't do nothing about that, rather you are doing nothing about it.</p>
              <p>i think your suspicion about your mental state is true though.... </p>
