              <p>This type you have to be careful. from your discription never really meet him in person. i encounter before some are really behaviur gay and mix with girls and also really enjoy attention and company from guys. some are outwardly you cannot tell but inside they like to have s*x with gays the same gender.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Back to the outwardly gay type. They get jealous whenever guys are horny or attentive towards any girl. The matter come to them you see their face change and they behave like charbor say what you only like pretty gails lah only like tophotograph pretty girls lah abcdefg.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this type better avoid far far</p>

              <p>Should have deleted him immediately from your facebook. Thats one aspect you can deal with.</p>
              <p>If you can't avoid him, then oogle girls when he is around, and also talk about your fantasy with girls. He'll get the message.</p>

              just as you have the right to do as you please, so do irritating people have the right to do as they please. Yes, this includes irritating things. it's their own prerogative.
              
              Other than tolerating them and their behavior, I try not to get too worked up by reminding myself that it takes all these lousy fellas to prop me up in social standing........

              <p>omg that type of friend i rather run away. U can maybe just tell him off directly. Be aggresive, make him understand. He will feel embarrass and leave u.</p>
              <p>But its weird that i had a couple of my friends like that, i dont feel irritated. Maybe yours is too extreme =x</p>
