            <div class='col-md body'>Yar, she's bring a friend bcos she wants to feel more assured and comfortable going out with you. If you already asked her out and she didn't reject, you're already one step in front. Let her bring her friend, you can bring yours. Maybe during this outing, she will know you better, and slowly, she'll be able to assure herself that its safe to go out with you.<br><br>That'll be the time when yes, she will agree to a 1-1 date with you. But don't relax so soon. Show her that you appreciate going out with her, whether its a 1-1 or with her friend. These are the little things girls notice, alot.</div>
