            <div class='col-md body'><div class="content">I was working for company "J" for almost 6 years previously. We were in the construction industry and I acquired a additions and alterations job in the airport. I was hired to supervised the job. During this job, my company "J" were employed to do mechanical works. <br><br>Along the way, the main contractor approached me to an external works. He said he wants to pay seperately and not use company "J" for the job. Knowing that my x-company do not have the capabilites of doing the job, I recommended a friend to complete the external works without the knowledge of my x-company; and main contractor to the pay of 7.5k through me. I've then shared the cost of the works with myself and the friend.<br><br>After a year, I left company "J" to seek better oppurtunities. Around 2 years later, the police contacted me in regards to airports works. They had claimed that I had commited "criminal breach of trust". I was so surprised. I went through the investigations for almost 6 month. Life was so difficult and I couldntÂ sleep without thinking what is going to happen to me. <br><br>In the alleged claim, I found out that the main contractor had refuses to pay the balance of the amount of 7.5k and had claimed that he had given me the money. I was devastated, this is what happens when you are trying to help people and this is what you get. On the virtue, I've explained to the police on the scenarios that had happened during the initial dealings. I proclaimed that I did not use any of company "J" equipments to complete the external works.<br><br>After 6 months, the court tribunal / police letter came. I was not charged with anything but was turned to a warning not to commit such works again.<br><br>Everything subsides for almost 1.5 years, then I started to have a debt collectors calling me, telling me that I owed company "J" for 11.5k. I was so shocked. I ignored the calls and reported the matter to the police about the harrasement from these debt collectors.<br><br>I found out that my x-boss of company "J" is chasing me after the money which I do not owe at all to him. He's been calling all around my friends to get to me. It feels like he is like extorting me for the money which I do not owe in the first place. I'm not trying to run away or anything, I felt that if it really matters to him, he could have given me a call and talked nicely on how should settle the matter.<br><br>I really dont know what to do. Who should I asked for help? I'm in doubt of what would I do would be right thing to do.</div></div>

              <p>Everyone has a part to play, even if you are not an employer or
              even an employee. If you know of employers that are non-compliant,
              you can report by calling this hotline: 1800-221-9922, or email
              <a title="workright@mom.gov.sg" rel="nofollow" href="mailto:workright@mom.gov.sg">workright@mom.gov.sg</a>. The identity of
              the caller will be kept strictly confidential.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) and Central Provident Fund (CPF)
              Board are stepping up our efforts to bring about compliance with
              the CPF Act and Employment Act (EA), so that employees,
              particularly more vulnerable groups like low-wage workers, enjoy
              their basic employment rights under the law. Areas of focus include
              payment of CPF contributions, on-time payment of salary, overtime
              payment, provision of paid annual and sick leave, and adherence to
              working-hour requirements, amongst others.</p>
              <p>We will do this through a two-prong WorkRight initiative
              covering enforcement and education. Besides ramping up enforcement,
              we will be reaching out to the public through a publicity campaign
              which aims to educate workers on their employment rights under the
              CPF Act and the EA, as well as to educate employers about their
              legal obligations.</p>

              <p>If you had done nothing wrong, like stealing company J's work while still employed by J you wouldn't be sleepless over this issue.</p>
              <p>Why don't you go and see your ex boss face to face and explain directly to him ?</p>
              <p>The fact is.. you knew in your heart.. you've done something unethical. And is afraid or ashamed to face the music.</p>
              <p>The industry is very small... your reputation is very critical in your line of work.</p>
              <p>No company will want to hire a contract thief to supervise contract work.</p>
              <p>Talk to your x boss and try to settle this amicably.</p>
