            <div class='col-md body'>can see that u are really depressed.. dun be, there is always hope.. sometimes, things like friends and r/s enter ur life when u least expected it to be.. the more u craved and the more u want it, the more u dun get it.. so let nature takes it's own course.. if ur frens are really that mean, let them be. do reflect if it's a prob wif ur personality.. if it's really not ur fault, just let them do wat they like.. ignore them.<br><br>if u are a low self-esteem person, i would advise u to go for courses like perhaps, upgrade urself? and change ur outlook? i used to be v inferior and my best fren helped me alot and changed me..<br><br>all e best!~</div>

There're always AT LEAST 2 sides to this world... BEAUTIFUL and UGLY... You pick your SCREEN?<br>You can't really change the way people wanna think and behave though you can always try?

            <div class='col-md body'>riesla: don't worry too much about it, just try to mix around with more people, and maybe you'll find people whom you can really mix well with and be close to. and yea, meritocracy is bullshit lah...along with democracy, justice and equality. and if you need someone to talk to, you can let me know, ok? btw i'm not trying to buaya you or anything  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>raingal: what yawnyawn said about wearing a mask is actually very true. basically a lot of people have a way of behaving and talking when in the company of others, so as to be able to mix in with the crowd, and conform to the image of what other people would think of as desirable. like maybe this person might be very depressed or suicidal, but puts on a show of being very happy and cheerful when in front of other people. go to orchard road and you see a lot of people with masks...you get what i mean?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
