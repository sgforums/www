              <p>I have the same experience of friends wanting to borrow my DSLR and other stuff. Its never easy. I dun agree that its simply a matter of paying for damage. Once damaged, its about money... as the chinese always say è°ˆé’±ä¼¤æ„Ÿæƒ…...</p>
              <p>I think in your case its quite easy to decline... u probably did not explain it tactfully enough.</p>
              <p>Just say that 1 month is too long and you will need to use it. Even 1 week is too long for me if its going to be physically out of the country. If it is in Singapore, I can always ask for it back if I need it urgently.</p>

              <p>Why you don't want to lend your DSLR to your brother and sister-in-law?</p>
              <p>Your relationship and life together with them will outlast whatever precious DSLR that you are holding tightly onto your chest.</p>
              <p>Forgive the angry comments made by your brother and your sister-in-law, people say stupid things that bypassed their brain circuits when they are emotional.</p>
              <p>Nobody can blame you for not lending your possessions to anyone, and nobody is at fault if negotiations for borrowing your precious camera.</p>
              <p>You should make your own choice that will  make you the most happy and stand firm by it, regardless of any future consequences and live happily through it.</p>
              <p>What is ultimately most important is your own happiness and not everyone's else happiness, because everyone doesn't really gives a damn about your happiness anyway.</p>
              <p>At least I don't care about anyone's happiness, only their sadness.</p>

              <p>Advice - just give them the compact camera, take it or leave it.<br><br>Frankly if you lend - i bet with you there be worst argument ahead !!! <br><br>Frankly 1 month on the road without proper casing and knowledge of photography, and basic maintenance there will be scratches on body and lens itself too. Also sometime due to moistures - the lens will get fungus too. </p>
              <p>Even between family, I think everyone is entited to own their own thing. Something are just consider personal. Everyone should be entited to have their own personal item and space.It is your personal item, you have the right to say no, also there is the compact camera, there is no other options. </p>
              <p>If they feel that DSLR is so super - then i think it is really time for them to get one for themselves.</p>
