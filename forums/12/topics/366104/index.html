              <p>You were not wrong to protect your own interest, but on the otherhand, just like what Bear had said, is it worth it?</p>
              <p>Unless you are telling me your relationship with your brother has always been bad, otherwise you shouldn't quarrel with him over an physical object which is bond to be gone someday.</p>
              <p>He might be wrong to force you to lend the DSLR to his wife, but remember, you are the one who promised his wife to lend it to her in the first place. That is why one should always clarify things before making promises, otherwise it will become empty promises.</p>
              <p>I am not going to take your side or your brother's side, whether to lend him and his wife your DSLR now or not is still your own choice. But take this as a lesson, do not make promises so simply without knowing the circumstances involved.</p>

              <p>Why don't you lend him the camera and get yourself a new disposable, holga, lomo to play with? Those are fairly affordable, plus you can get creative, try something different, develop a new style and possibly capture better shots.</p>

              <p>Its NEVER wrong to protect your own interest or your own property espicially when its something you scrimped and saved for..</p>
              <p>Even if your sister in law did offered to pay for any damages done to the camera, its never a good idea.</p>
              <p>Firstly alot of people are going to DEFINE the term "damaged" differently. Believe me when i tell you some would consider a 0.1cm scratch on the casing to be "damaged". Others would just shrug it off and justify their claims that the camera is still functioning as per normal and wouldn't consider the scratch to be damaged. Its all comes down to how 2 people "perceive" the term damage and in the end its only going to cause more unhappiness if you're unable to compromise with each others understanding.</p>
              <p>Secondly, you DID offer your brother an alternative when he asked for ANY type of camera. My Question to you is how did he react when you offered him the comapct camera as an alternative? Instead of gracefully accepting or rejecting, he acted like a spoilt brat and stomped off in anger? What kind of a spoilt attitude is that? Knowing how much the camera meant to you, he still INSISTED on getting it for his wife..WTF MAN?!?!?!?!</p>
              <p>And when he came into YOUR room get luggage he apparently slamed the stuffs around and slam doors. This clearly shows he has no respect for you or your properties. And the way he replied you? How rude....</p>
              <p>Last but not least, there always the feeling of paranoia when someone borrows your stuff. Perharps she might have damage it when she returned it to you but isn't being truthful?</p>
              <p>But the decision should come down to yours alone. You've known your brother way way way longer then we all do and what kind of character he has...we're just judging by scenarios...you're family after all and part of being family is having trust in one another..</p>

              <p>hmmm. depends on how you look at it lah.</p>
              <p>being reluctant to loan him your dslr implies a lack of trust in his capabilities in taking good care of it.</p>
              <p>he might be resentful that you, his brother, doesn't trust him to protect your valued possession.</p>
              <p>Your sister-in-law request might have been quite unreasonable, since its one month, really long after all.</p>
              <p><br>however, can i clarify what your brother wanted the camera for? is it really for taking of pictures or taking the dslr for his wife? if he is just taking pictures, then why not? if you cant trust your own brother, who else can you trust?</p>
              <p>And remember that your last resort would always be your family, its not wise to alienate them over issues like this.</p>
              <p>perhaps TS might want to impress the importance of the dslr onto him before agreeing to lend it to his frother for a short stint</p>
