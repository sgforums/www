            <div class='col-md body'>Gosh.. wat a long story... read it thru...<br><br>but one thing that I haf to mention is that watever we are telling is based on a Chinese thinking... As I believe U r some foreign student here??<br><br>But I think.. the best thing to so is juz to be urself them.. do wat u think u will naturally so.. say wat u think u will naturally say... it's no use preparing for it.. coz... there are so many ways and so many situations that u cannot even think of all of them, let alone to prepare for them. Well, as for the matter.. I think u haf to be in a very sorry state... but go in direct.. saying that u made the mistake.. but tell her why u told the fren... Tell her how u feel... abt the whole matter... and ur feelings towards her... dun even think of lying to her, coz she is in the state of not trusting u.. so dun make things worse.<br><br>As for getting into the topic... maybe after the usual 'hiz' maybe u can just bring it up immediately coz u know that the relationshi[p between u and the girl is very impt to u. that's y u r so concern over it.. u dun want to lose her even as a fren rite? u can use these words as a start...<br><br>most impt thing is to be sincere, and truthful.... she will be touched we are all humans.. we haf feelings...<br>hope I'm of some help....<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Not good.<br><br>I have to talk to to her directly really soon.<br>I heard from another friend, closer to her than me. That she has no feelings for me in that way what so ever.<br><br>This means that there can be no relationship and no friendship.<br><br>The friendship will not work because if we go out again together it is inevitable that we will be very close as usual so why put us both in that position.<br><br>So now I've lost my BEST friend who I also love to bits at 17 years of age. This is not good as friends like these do not come along very often.<br><br>Now I have no one to go out with or conspire with socially, she was the only person I had in my life apart from my work colleagues and my sister and we are not on the same wavelength as me and Rachel.<br><br>I'm stuck!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.. Sorry to hear that.. but I do hope that actual meeting is somehow better than expected... How is it??<br><br>I agree wif u that good friends are hard to come by. Especially if it's frens u can really communicate well.. But sadly I think in ever friendship there will also be a period where it's there to test how well the two of u can maintain it. Normally, it's just some small misunderstanding, which both of u cannot see eye to eye at that point of time. And just becoz of it, both refuse to gif in, becoz of some stupid word call 'pride'. And becoz of this silly little word, it caused a lot of r/s and f/s get broken...<br><br>As for u.. maybe u try to take the chance to get to know more pple.. Know more friends... Join in some social activities... It's hard to bring urself to it at first.. but after a period of time, u will enjoy the company.. I'm not saying that u take these friends as substitute, but to know them to enlarge ur network of friends... now u are still studying, u haf more free time to widen ur friendship circle.. and also make friends from all fields.. When u are working, it really depends on ur job that gives u the chance to mmet pple from all walks of life. For instance, if u need an architect to design ur house in the future, it better to know them now, and let the friendship develope.. maybe next time can get him to do it. Not only will he feel honour then it also save u the hassle of looking for one too.. but I'm not hinting that u, look for friends just to reap the benefits... U look for friends to learn abt pple, to care for them... that's how it shld be.. and they in turn will care and love u back..<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, Tom!  Listen to what Bear here is saying.  He's talking a lot of sense.  You're too young to tie down yourself into a tight situation.  Widen your horizon, at the same time do not forget Rachel.  She has taught you something very precious, about yourself and - if it never turns out with her - about your future relationship with the future lady you're going to have, for you will surely find one, a nice one too if you do not allow this experience to make you bitter and cynical.  What this precious experience is, only you can tell.  It is personal and only you can work it out for yourself.  If you do it right.  You'll come out right.<br><br>Now for the immediate moment.  Don't be afraid to face her.  As Bear says, as long as you are completely honest with her, it is now in God's hands whether she will "see" what a nice fellow you are.<br><br>This posting may be too late for you to read.  If it is too late and everything has collapsed around your ears.  Pick yourself up.  You're still very young, and you've got a hell of a lifetime to go yet. I don't know what you look like, but the way you stood by her you will make some lucky girl very happy one day!...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wad can i say. i spent da last few lotta minutes readin this meaningful post. The sayin keeps onto everyone's mouth that everyone needs love .. guys need love .. gals need love .. ARGH *fark all away *laffz .. life just plain sux ain't it true. n fark those who're tellin ya life rocks, *laffz abruptly think abt how ya life sux<br><br>Love is an existance everywhere. Seriously, just ask everyone out there who's in the topic : Can a gal n a guy be really gd frz  when other parties know each other n understand vice versa totally? Some might agree but i wun be that noble to agree on it. I can't pull out myself from her anyway afterall i know her as a so call normal fr as well. Wad happens in da end ? da same situation happens as this nice littlie tomgimp.<br><br>It ain't stupid to tie oneself up in a realtionship where u think the fire is burnin well hot under the rod. Fer someone who's in da ball game fer a long time they will know that givin away tellin yer loved one dat how u appreciate the love is a very courageous thing. U'll have to face all embressment n feedbacks; it ain't easy afterall.<br><br>Bold up n get yerself in her shoes tomgimp. Wuld a gal just openly kiss ya on da dance floor. Think of all da incidents dat a 3rd party din even witness. Frankly speakin i dunno how a gal thinks. Either she shld be just real disappointed from ur response in the 1st post u made, n like wad bear had said; frank is the only solution to all.<br><br>Never lose a littlie chance as u'll never know when the second one strikes. Love is beautiful n definate memories will live ferever. Y not let the memories be beautiful rather than hideous ?<br><br>*smiles<br><br>------------------<br>Agony Strikes when death advocates.

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm very sorrie to hear bout this. I agree that good frenz are hard to come by and when one comes along, treasure it. I think that in our teenage yrs, if we haf a good fren that is of the opposite sex, it's best to b juz platonic good buddies as we do not noe wat we really want in our partners. It's only in later yrs when u like noe wat u want and if u find that good fren of urs like fit the bill then u go after him/her.</div>
