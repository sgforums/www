              <p>I don't know, I could be overreacting. I took engineering out of
              interest and because I was really good at it. Unfortunately, I feel
              that this isn't working out as I had planned , hence my rant about
              not having any "reliable" plan. It is to some extent poor foresight
              I do not deny.</p>
              <p>Yes unemployment is bad. I don't expect sky high salary. In
              fact, if a reputable US company offered me no pay internship to
              work on some thing over summer, I would devour it just so I could
              have more things to put on my resume. At least something to build
              on. As an engineer, the opportunities you have in Sg are
              significantly fewer compared to many places in the world.</p>
              <p>My family isn't doing business but my father is doing quite well
              in his position, at least to me. Even if he were a business owner,
              I wouldn't want to rely on nepotism nor would he allow it either I
              would like to think. However, like I said, we still have bills to
              pay and I would still like to make good return based on what I was
              given.</p>

              <p>If we have to divide people into two extreme personalities, in

              former depict people who think (only), but the latter refers to
              people who do (only). Naturally, most people fall in between.
              Problems usually arise from those who are nearer to these extreme
              points.</p>
              <p>You are decapitated by your thoughts to such extend that you are
              basically immobile. Although you might have decent academic
              background, the crux of your plight lies with your selection
              process. Although you are right to say that you don't mind working
              as an intern for as long as it is a prospective company, this is
              precisely the problem here - many company may not be as
              'prospective' as you deemed it would be, which you might probably
              eliminate. To worsen your deal, you lacked the necessary working
              experience - so companies are reluctant to hire (even intern),
              especially since times are difficult.</p>
              <p>I will reframe it into something simpler - you want a deal that
              is good for you in the long term and the path you have 'planned'
              for yourself is rigidity linear and fixed. Even as a civil servant
              (in which our garmen would likely to hire you, considering your
              relatively impressive academic background), you consider it 'bad'
              in the long run. For someone who has been unemployed for 4 years -
              frankly, this 'bad' in the long run is still irony a 'good'
              now.</p>
              <p>Beggars can't be choosers.</p>
              <p>Your thinking disabled you totally. To make matter even worst,
              because your family is well-to-do, the incentive to find a job
              isn't as urgent. Yes, you might talk about ROI, but everything else
              is still stable, so what's the urgency unless it derives from
              self? </p>

              always be waiting for the glorious stallion to pass by you before
              you take a leap. Your attitude towards life synonymously reflects
              your situation in love - your fear of 'risk/lost' is masked by
              fortifying yourself in this ivory tower of intellectual retreat,
              analyzing from an apex, which you feel safe from the noisy rumbles

              <p>The urgency would come from the "thinking" part of me.

I've tried my best to compensate for this lack of a big-name-company internship on my resume by fighting for every obscure chance that came by way in my undergraduate years. This was why I interned in a different place every year. However, inspite of this, I couldn't get any further. That's life I guess.</p>
              <p>I've listened to what a few of the posters have said here and I'm feeling a little better and my thoughts are alittle clearer now I hope. In terms of a "plan of action", I think I may assist my roommate when he goes back to Sg in the summer. He's working to optimise NUH operations and since at this point I don't have a much better alternative anyway, I will likely go with it even though I will not be compensated.This outcome is not much different from the last 4 years. Actually I was compensated all the times before so there is some difference. Also, in this case, I'm feeling alot more depressed. My only hope is when I graduate for real at the end of my masters this year, things will be different.</p>

              <p>I'm not quite sure to be honest. I can only reason that with the recession, the engineering field has been even more badly affected. In the US, I had some interviews as an undergraduate but now as a masters student, I've not had a single response. The only reason I found an internship in Sg last year was because a fellow student's mum was working in that company and was looking to fill temporary positions. This case was special as she knew how good my engineering school was and basically based the entire interview on email exchanges. Apart from that alot of internet applications to sg companies basically fall into a black hole, at least from my own experience. This is unfortunately the only means I have of applying from the US.</p>
              <p>I'm surprised that he can't find a CE person. I'd imagine that would be a pretty popular field in Sg but I may be mistaken.</p>

              <p>I omitted that to try to retain some anonymity. The last thing I want is for people to find out who I am and to start worrying about me but since I'm already at this point I might as well say. I did my undergraduate in Mechanical and subsequently switched to Industrial &amp; Operations in masters.</p>
              <p>I tried to reposition myself after my undergraduate, as after 3 years, I realised that my degree was not getting me anywhere in terms of job/internship prospects and opportunities. Ind &amp; Ops was the most logical choice given the synergy it shares with mechanical and its wider applicability.</p>

              <p>Well, think out of the box. A good job need not necessary be one which is within your interests, or which you had thought of before.</p>
              <p>Keep your eyes peeled for opportunities on the web and on job advertisements now and then, you may just find a good job which suits you. </p>

              <p>Hello Jerjoe,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can totally "feel" you as I think I 
                                                                                      have the exact qualifications as you (MS Eng, no extremely strong set of

                                                                                       debts to come to USA to study)</p>
              <p>I was only slightly luckier 
                                                                                      because I found a job right before the 2008 financial crisis. What I can
                                                                                       tell you is that the unemployment figure in US now is 10-13% and that 
                                                                                      actually means that 20-30% of americans are unemployed. For further 
                                                                                      understanding, google and find out how they calculate employment figures
                                                                                       in US. What's more, the companies that shed the most jobs are those in 
                                                                                      the tech 
                                                                                      industry. So you can expect 3~5 out of 10 technically-trained people who are
                                                                                       unemployed. Do not underestimate the situation. US is sitting on trillions of dollars of debt and that financial disaster in 08 has costed them alot.</p>
              <p>The reason why you cannot find a internship chances in Tech 
                                                                                      companies because the only companies that hire international students are large 
                                                                                      tech firms (of course some biz/consultancy hires MBA/LLM) AND right now 
                                                                                      they are not generous at training international students at all. Why would if they have a large stock of unemployed American workers/students in a political situation dominated by the Democratic Party? Also, large banks can 
                                                                                      no longer hire international students due to the kind of agreement they 
                                                                                      have with the federal govt for the bailout. Yea, as much as American claims to take in immigrants all over the world, they need to protect their own people in tough times unless you are really brilliant which you have already identify yourself not to be.</p>
              <p>The next bad news for you is: (sorry for being negative but I 
                                  need to drive in the facts to you) most international non-PhD students 
                                  who can easily find jobs in US are those in EE, Com Sci, IT/IS/etc, Finance (used 
                                  to), Pharmacy, Chem Engine. Reason: Just look for those companies that sponsor 
                                  H1B visa. Most of them are in these areas.</p>
              <p>You doubted if your Masters degree has 
                                                                                      degraded your chances at employment. To be honest, your masters and mine
                                                                                       are merely paper qualifications without research background. Yes MS (whatever) is prestigious but not quite useful in a recession. You only have chances at entry-level jobs due to the 
                                                                                      fact that you do not have any relevant experience. If I am not mistaken, you have followed the coursework only masters
                               plan.  Ask yourself, what is the difference between you and your friends who are working now? You only accumulated more textbook knowledge.The only masters 
                                                                                      degree that is markedly different is the one that comes with a strong research thesis. 
                                                                                      That may qualify you for a more senior position if you have spent that 
                                                                                      period in a research assistant position which is to employers relevant work experience. Hence, by upgrading our 
                                                                                      qualifications to Masters, we put ourselves in direct competition with 
                                                                                      everyone: Bachelor's, PhDs, and Masters. This fact was slammed hard at me and I never had good feelings of that extra money I spent on my masters.</p>
              <p>Another feel-good factor you might have butter yourself with is your conservation skills. The reason why you have thought that interviewers thought well of you is because they expected you not to be fluent at all. Also ask yourself, will American do better conversing in their interviews? Obviously they do. You will be amazed at their interviews if you sat in one. And Indians too? They are well-known to devote alot of time and effort to interviews. Don't compare yourself to chinese and non-english speaking people. Compare yourself with the best then you can correctly benchmark yourself. I put myself at a 6 when it comes to conversations skills. Luckily, technical skills are more important for an engineer in my area.</p>

                                                                                      engineering company before, they hire engineers based on the number of

                                                                                      took in twice the number of internships this year and I was assigned to 
                                                                                      train two American engineering juniors from Berkeley. Last year, I was assigned to train a Taiwanese student. There's a 
                                                                                      marked difference right now in the employment market. Is there a shift 
                                                                                      to favor local americans instead? I don't know but you can make your own
                                                                                       judgement. When I looked at the resumes of the two 
                                                                                      interns, they had really relevant experience and near perfect GPA (much 
                                                                                      much better than mine when I got my job). I came to realize that
                                                                                       now, an Ivy-League or Big-Ten degree is no longer a qualifying ticket 
                                                                                      to a technical job in the US. The other trend I noticed is that the 
                                                                                      number of China-born Chinese and India-born Indians in undergraduate 
                                                                                      programs have jumped many folds. That has created a lot of competition 
                                                                                      in engineering jobs. This is something that did not happen when I was in Bachelor's. For example, I only had a few Chinese friend when I was in the 
                                                                                      Bachelor's program but when I went back to my school's to recruit 
                                                                                      students, I saw almost 1/4 to 1/3 of the class population are 
                                                                                      chinese/indian. For info, read this: 
                                                                                      http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/16/education/16international-.html. <strong>In the near future, non-PhD non-IT no-EE non-researcher international students may need legitimacy in their background (green card minimum) and  previous 
                                  relevant training. Why? It's just plain competitive compared to 5 years ago and the US market has not grown so much to absorb the demand. <br></strong></p>

                                                                                      advice for you is to return to Singapore to seek opportunities because the internship recruitment period is all but over. We did our interviews in late February. As you know in US, <strong>no USA internship = no future job</strong>. To be honest, I think it's really hard for you to find a job in US in the future. Like you mentioned yourself, you have to be responsible to the debts incurred and start seeking other forms of opportunities back in Singapore. It is not a step back but a step forward (in life).</p>
              <p>However, don't worry 
                                                                                      for the immediate impact of the debts you incurred and try to think more "long-term" issues ahead. I

                                                                                      good and the situation is really changing in US when it comes to engineering 
                                                                                      prospects.I understand that you have put in 200k-ish into your

                                                                                      usd a year, I have to service my debts and also pay for housing etc. 
                                                                                      It's not rosy as you think.The only good things that comes with work in

                                                                                      cars). If you understand how things work in Singapore, you can do very 
                                                                                      well and get as much as u do in US. So, in a nutshell, try to think how 
                                                                                      you can recoup the 200k in the long term rather than in the short term. 
                                                                                      Also, the key question to ask yourself is: Do you actually need the green card? 
                                                                                      And why? Prestige? To migrate?</p>
              <p>Actually right now, I am facing lots of pressure at 
                                                                                      my work to 
                                                                                      perform at a very high level or face elimination. I need to keep my job 
                                                                                      so I can get my green card in a couple of year's time. Can I keep my job
                                                                                       for another 3 years? I am not sure myself but I am doing my best to 
                                                                                      prove my value to the company and impress everyone I work with. I also 
                                                                                      network a lot with people outside my company so I have backup chances 
                                                                                      when I am removed. I definitely had a lot of thoughts to what I can do 
                                                                                      when I get my green card and that includes returning to Singapore for 
                                                                                      better opportunities. So don't think that returning to SG is a shameful 
                                                                                      thing. In fact, I think it's a great background for me because lots of US MNCs are based in Singapore. Also I am very grateful to the bilingual education I received in Sg. It opened several more doors for me. The only set back is the NS system which took away 2 years of my life.</p>
              <p>Take care and be positive! Don't even think of killing yourself. It's the dumbest thing you can ever do to yourself and imagine how your parents will feel about it. I think you are a smart guy but you need to really start moving forward.</p>

              <p>Passion besides engineering? You mean something that else I can be employed to do or just pastimes. During the semester, I hardly have time aside from exams and homework (urgh American education system). When I have time, I do play sports and as I mentioned I help to run one of my university's sports clubs. I cook whenever I can too. I would think that those may count as other "passions" of mine lol. Sorry about the intentional vagueness. Was that what you're refering to?</p>
              <p>Hmm what else is possible is in fact a great question. I'm out of genuinely good ideas but there are some not so good ones I know.</p>

              <p>don't under-estimate other passions if any.  times like this require a little entrepreneurial spirit and creative thinking.  there are people who are forced by circumstances to spurn another means of livelihood through passions other than their "main" one.</p>

              <p>Hello Jerjoe,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can totally "feel" you as I think I have the exact
                          qualifications as you (MS Eng, no extremely strong set of skills,
                          not a PhD person, comes from strong Engineering school, took on
                          debts to come to USA to study)</p>
              <p>I was only slightly luckier because I found a job right before
                          the 2008 financial crisis. What I can tell you is that the
                          unemployment figure in US now is 10-13% and that actually means
                          that 20-30% of americans are unemployed. For further understanding,
                          google and find out how they calculate employment figures in US.
                          What's more, the companies that shed the most jobs are those in the
                          tech industry. So you can expect 3~5 out of 10 technically-trained
                          people who are unemployed. Do not underestimate the situation. US
                          is sitting on trillions of dollars of debt and that financial
                          disaster in 08 has costed them alot.</p>
              <p>The reason why you cannot find a internship chances in Tech
                          companies because the only companies that hire international
                          students are large tech firms (of course some biz/consultancy hires
                          MBA/LLM) AND right now they are not generous at training
                          international students at all. Why would if they have a large stock
                          of unemployed American workers/students in a political situation
                          dominated by the Democratic Party? Also, large banks can no longer
                          hire international students due to the kind of agreement they have
                          with the federal govt for the bailout. Yea, as much as American
                          claims to take in immigrants all over the world, they need to
                          protect their own people in tough times unless you are really
                          brilliant which you have already identify yourself not to be.</p>
              <p>The next bad news for you is: (sorry for being negative but I
                          need to drive in the facts to you) most international non-PhD
                          students who can easily find jobs in US are those in EE, Com Sci,
                          IT/IS/etc, Finance (used to), Pharmacy, Chem Engine. Reason: Just
                          look for those companies that sponsor H1B visa. Most of them are in
                          these areas.</p>
              <p>You doubted if your Masters degree has degraded your chances at
                          employment. To be honest, your masters and mine are merely paper
                          qualifications without research background. Yes MS (whatever) is
                          prestigious but not quite useful in a recession. You only have
                          chances at entry-level jobs due to the fact that you do not have
                          any relevant experience. If I am not mistaken, you have followed
                          the coursework only masters plan. Ask yourself, what is the
                          difference between you and your friends who are working now? You
                          only accumulated more textbook knowledge.The only masters degree
                          that is markedly different is the one that comes with a strong
                          research thesis. That may qualify you for a more senior position if
                          you have spent that period in a research assistant position which
                          is to employers relevant work experience. Hence, by upgrading our
                          qualifications to Masters, we put ourselves in direct competition
                          with everyone: Bachelor's, PhDs, and Masters. This fact was slammed
                          hard at me and I never had good feelings of that extra money I
                          spent on my masters.</p>
              <p>Another feel-good factor you might have butter yourself with is
                          your conservation skills. The reason why you have thought that
                          interviewers thought well of you is because they expected you not
                          to be fluent at all. Also ask yourself, will American do better
                          conversing in their interviews? Obviously they do. You will be
                          amazed at their interviews if you sat in one. And Indians too? They
                          are well-known to devote alot of time and effort to interviews.
                          Don't compare yourself to chinese and non-english speaking people.
                          Compare yourself with the best then you can correctly benchmark
                          yourself. I put myself at a 6 when it comes to conversations
                          skills. Luckily, technical skills are more important for an
                          engineer in my area.</p>
              <p>If you have been to a engineering company before, they hire
                          engineers based on the number of projects they have concurrently
                          and only hire if they have shortage of resources.My company sort of
                          took in twice the number of internships this year and I was
                          assigned to train two American engineering juniors from Berkeley.
                          Last year, I was assigned to train a Taiwanese student. There's a
                          marked difference right now in the employment market. Is there a
                          shift to favor local americans instead? I don't know but you can
                          make your own judgement. When I looked at the resumes of the two
                          interns, they had really relevant experience and near perfect GPA
                          (much much better than mine when I got my job). I came to realize
                          that now, an Ivy-League or Big-Ten degree is no longer a qualifying
                          ticket to a technical job in the US. The other trend I noticed is
                          that the number of China-born Chinese and India-born Indians in
                          undergraduate programs have jumped many folds. That has created a
                          lot of competition in engineering jobs. This is something that did
                          not happen when I was in Bachelor's. For example, I only had a few
                          Chinese friend when I was in the Bachelor's program but when I went
                          back to my school's to recruit students, I saw almost 1/4 to 1/3 of
                          the class population are chinese/indian. For info, read this:
                          http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/16/education/16international-.html.
                          <strong>In the near future, non-PhD non-IT no-EE non-researcher
                          international students may need legitimacy in their background
                          (green card minimum) and  previous relevant training. Why?
                          It's just plain competitive compared to 5 years ago and the US
                          market has not grown so much to absorb the
                          demand.<br></strong></p>
              <p>My advice for you is to return to Singapore to seek
                          opportunities because the internship recruitment period is all but
                          over. We did our interviews in late February. As you know in US,
                          <strong>no USA internship = no future job</strong>. To be honest, I
                          think it's really hard for you to find a job in US in the future.
                          Like you mentioned yourself, you have to be responsible to the
                          debts incurred and start seeking other forms of opportunities back
                          in Singapore. It is not a step back but a step forward (in
                          life).</p>
              <p>However, don't worry for the immediate impact of the debts you
                          incurred and try to think more "long-term" issues ahead. I
                          personally think that you have to accept that your luck is not
                          exactly good and the situation is really changing in US when it
                          comes to engineering prospects.I understand that you have put in
                          200k-ish into your Bachelors+Masters but it is an investment that
                          you will stand to enjoy the branding benefits in the future even
                          though you may not be able to find work in the US. Also wages in
                          the US are not as high as you think it will be. My friend who is
                          working in the civil service in Singapore is drawing close to what
                          I am drawing now. Even though I get ard 80K usd a year, I have to
                          service my debts and also pay for housing etc. It's not rosy as you
                          think.The only good things that comes with work in US are benefits
                          (green cards, great health care, better technical experiences, no
                          NS callbacks, weather, more recreational stuff, cheaper cars). If
                          you understand how things work in Singapore, you can do very well
                          and get as much as u do in US. So, in a nutshell, try to think how
                          you can recoup the 200k in the long term rather than in the short
                          term. Also, the key question to ask yourself is: Do you actually
                          need the green card? And why? Prestige? To migrate?</p>
              <p>Actually right now, I am facing lots of pressure at my work to
                          perform at a very high level or face elimination. I need to keep my
                          job so I can get my green card in a couple of year's time. Can I
                          keep my job for another 3 years? I am not sure myself but I am
                          doing my best to prove my value to the company and impress everyone
                          I work with. I also network a lot with people outside my company so
                          I have backup chances when I am removed. I definitely had a lot of
                          thoughts to what I can do when I get my green card and that
                          includes returning to Singapore for better opportunities. So don't
                          think that returning to SG is a shameful thing. In fact, I think
                          it's a great background for me because lots of US MNCs are based in
                          Singapore. Also I am very grateful to the bilingual education I
                          received in Sg. It opened several more doors for me. The only set
                          back is the NS system which took away 2 years of my life.</p>
              <p>Take care and be positive! Don't even think of killing yourself.
                          It's the dumbest thing you can ever do to yourself and imagine how
                          your parents will feel about it. I think you are a smart guy but
                          you need to really start moving forward.</p>

              <p>Hi XenDan,</p>
              <p>:/ I typed out a reply and somehow lost it when I 
                          tried to reply but here's the jist of what I said. I agree with alot of 
                          the things you mentioned. I'm not so sure about the political effect on 
                          big tech company hiring policies but I'm certainly feeling the lack of 
                          engineering opportunities. I would in fact further narrow the 
                          "employable" fields to just Computer Science engineering, banking and 
                          consulting. The only chem engineer I know who got a job here went into 
                          banking (through his dad's connections). I realized this midway into my
                           undergrad and somewhat regret taking this path.</p>
              <p>I'm certainly 
                          aware things are not as rosy as some make it out to be and that the 
                          internship hiring period is long long over.The H1B sponsorship (I don't 
                          really need/want a green card) has pretty much dropped by 75% and yes 
                          alot of companies that used to sponsor no longer do so. It also seems to
                           have affected internships which is the first problem for me. Since I 
                          switched majors for masters, I'm focusing mostly on learning as you say.
                           I actually worked as research assistant in my undergraduate, through 
                          spring/summer and during school for almost a year, paid and unpaid. It 
                          just seems that employers seem abit adverse to students who seemed to 
                          have taken a more "academic" route in their work experiences, even if it
                           was very relevant. I worked more as a design/prototyping engineer as 
                          compared to a laboratory assistant. A couple of prototypes that I build 
                          from scratch are being refined by the research group and will probably 
                          be patented some time in future. My undergrad gpa is near perfect for a 
                          top college program that does not inflate grades. I don't know if thats 
                          good or brilliant any more as I've beaten myself up too much about not 
                          getting an internship/job. Its just that they would gladly hire someone 
                          else with just one internship with a big name company even if they'd 
                          been there for barely 3 months (what could you accompish?). I've thought
                           about the Phd route but the lull in earnings for 5-6 years is just 
                          something I can't afford right now. Being mentored by my young prof who 
                          graduated from MIT and has tons of funding is on face value an excellent
                           opportunity but I'm just not cut out for a Phd, practicality aside.</p>
              <p>I've
                           had alot of feedback on my interviews. I used to actively seek it as 
                          well. There have been quite a few times I've had to remind recruitors 
                          that I'm not a US citizen and would need sponsorship as they tend to 
                          keep falling into the assumption that I am one. I usually take it to 
                          mean that I'm doing a good job. I know there is always a bias that other
                           nationalities can't speak english well and that I out performed that 
                          expectation. However, I've also been interviewed by quite a few who had 
                          less than perfect english, usually Indian/Midde Eastern PRs or first 
                          gens. As you get past the HR people and progress further into 
                          the later rounds, they tend to be more open and honest with you, 
                          especially if you meet those who you could potentially work with 
                          directly. Ultimately, I think communication would come in secondary to having specific knowledge sets for a position / having a big name internship / having a US citizenship/PR. I'm still working to improve on whatever I can.</p>
              <p>If I may ask, why do you "need" a green card (ignore if
                           this is too sensitive a question)? If you are Singaporean, H1B1 should 
                          keep you around for as long as you want, so long as you have a job in 
                          the US I guess. I still think that from an Engineer's standpoint, there 
                          is no doubt that US&gt;&gt;Singapore. My theory is this probably stems from the costs difference and popularity of getting an engineering degree in either country. You can look at it from take home pay
                           after taxes, cost of living, job satisfaction, job variety, etc. I've done a fair bit of analysis and I 
                          think its quite safe to say this (assuming one gets the job).</p>
              <p>You're quite accurate in describing the influx of foreigners in US universities. In one of my classes, 95% are chinese/indian and probably among the brightest as well. This has made things very difficult for me academically. While doing Mech, I more than held my own but since going into Indus, my lack of foundation knowledge has hampered my performance. I'm taking it as a learning experience. In terms of job searching, I feel that most Chinese want to do a masters/phd before returning, whereas the Indians are desperate to stay. They are essentially in the same boat as me except that I like to think I can communicate better. Returning to Sg, leaves me no different from having gone to say NUS or NTU, except with this "branding".</p>
              <p>I'm very disillusioned with this 200+k worth of "branding" and honestly do feel it was a very poor investment, maybe even cheated. Most of the $$ goes into research funding and what I have is no more than a overpriced piece of decorated paper like coe. It also only matters on the first job generally. In my case, its seems like it won't even matter  at this rate as I'm probably headed for grunt work that won't use my knowledge.</p>
              <p>I'm finding it very hard to feel positive, since other facets of my life aren't doing that great either. I think I'll stay my hand that would be taking my life for now as I do think about what my parents would do/how they would feel if I did it. That is truly the only reason that's keeping me alive.</p>
              <p>Good luck with your green card. I sincerely want that to work out for you.</p>

              <p>I didn't post this on hardwarezone, so maybe someone copied it. Or there is someone else just like me.</p>
              <p>I've spent approx 200k usd. Yes the reality is I'm gonna have to return to Sg by law pretty much after this year. "if u r a strong engineer, you will earn as much as USA
                      engineers in future why bother staying in usa?" I respectfully disagree with this statement. I could elaborate further on why but its too long an analysis. Those who have worked as an Engineer in US and Sg will understand my point to some extent.</p>
              <p>I'm not so sure about Sg needing engineers either. I've found very few positions available for internships. For those that I have applied, my application is probably floating in no mans land. At least in US, they mostly take the time to send you an email telling you that you've been rejected instead of leaving you in limbo. In terms of full time jobs, there has been some growth with Exxon, renewable energy and some aero sectors but they've been quite small developments compared to the larger engineer talent pool. I believe a poster already mentioned earlier what prospects he faced in Sg as an Engineer.</p>

              <p>In regards to your earlier post, I guess I can't help but be fixated in some way since I am doing my degree here and the employment opportunities that come my way are in the US of course. I do keep my options open in Sg for sure. About your friend/collegue from China, I must commend him for what he has accomplished. A few years ago, I actually spent my spring and summer in Shanghai, 2 months working in Baogang which is a steel manufacturer (one of the largest in the world actually). I am to a small extent knowledgeable about working as an engineer in China and it is far from a walk in the park. Many with a basic degree can't get a job/internship since the field is oversaturated. That is why most try to get a masters if not a phd before attempting a job search. I needn't remind you that alot of things in china are based on "guan xi". This is even more so.</p>
              <p>Its true - "survival is not a concern" *yet*.  Like I told another poster, if it really comes down to it, I will do any job I can find. My machining/hand tooling skills while a little rusty, are still pretty good. I would no doubt lose "alot of face" among friends and family but at least I'm going somewhere. haiz...</p>
              <p>Life does work in strange ways and maybe what I really need now is just a break. Thanks for your concern.</p>

                                  and consulting. The only chem engineer I know who got a job here
                                  went into banking (through his dad's connections). I realized this
                                  midway into my undergrad and somewhat regret taking this path</em><br><strong>It's not too late to consider a career switch to banking if you have the know-how and connections. For example, if you have a b/millionaire relative or some celebrity friends. I believe that you are a smart, attractive and elouquent person. If you think Engineers earn too little in Singapore, switch to banking where there is a demand for talents like you. However, be very careful this time with your career planning because banking jobs are very susceptible to the economy and the job market is not that rosy like in 2008. The question to ask yourself is: Do you want to be a banker? There are many types too and I'm sure if you do a simple search online, you can find out what areas they are.<br></strong><strong>
                              </strong></p><strong><strong>The reason why US employers are not hiring as much as they did is because the engineering economy is not growing and even China is not consuming enough US engineered products. Yeah they will buy coke, burgers, a cheap laptop and a  Boeing plane or two. Microsoft only earned 6 million usd in china and google just left the market. Cisco faces very strong competition in china too. All the movies don't even make money in China with their rampant piracy. In US, IT is still growing and you can really tell from twitter, flickr, facebook in recent years. 
                  
                  My personal analysis is that things are going downhill further even though many people are pinning their hopes on the green energy thing. Green technology is not exactly advanced technology but more of a extension of each branch of science and engineering. For example, as a result of the need for alternative fuel sources, solar cells are now being used widely in EE and corn ethanol in biochem engineering. Unfortunately, it's not a disruptive technology like computers, internet, cars, aeroplanes and will not create much wealth for the americans other than the energy-related industries. I am very pessimistic about the US economy and the job market so much that I am quite jittery at every feedback I received at work. If you have any idea about the big asset bubble in China, you will lose half a head of hair. If that bubble pop, we are going to see a real depression in all parts of the world especially in Singapore because a lot of our sg banks are exposed to their environment. Let's hope not.<br></strong><p></p>

              of engineering opportunities. I would in fact further narrow the
              "employable" fields to just Computer Science engineering, banking
              and consulting. The only chem engineer I know who got a job here
              went into banking (through his dad's connections). I realized this
              midway into my undergrad and somewhat regret taking this
              path</em><br> <strong>It's not too late to consider a career switch to banking if
              you have the know-how and connections. For example, if you have a
              b/millionaire relative or some celebrity friends. I believe that
              you are a smart, attractive and elouquent person. If you think
              Engineers earn too little in Singapore, switch to banking where
              there is a demand for talents like you. However, be very careful
              this time with your career planning because banking jobs are very
              susceptible to the economy and the job market is not that rosy like
              in 2008. The question to ask yourself is: Do you want to be a
              banker? There are many types too and I'm sure if you do a simple
              search online, you can find out what areas they
              are.<br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>The reason why US employers are not hiring as much as
              they did is because the engineering economy is not growing and even
              China is not consuming enough US engineered products. Yeah they
              will buy coke, burgers, a cheap laptop and a Boeing plane or two.
              Microsoft only earned 6 million usd in china and google just left
              the market. Cisco faces very strong competition in china too. All
              the movies don't even make money in China with their rampant
              piracy. In US, IT is still growing and you can really tell from
              twitter, flickr, facebook in recent years. My personal analysis is
              that things are going downhill further even though many people are
              pinning their hopes on the green energy thing. Green technology is
              not exactly advanced technology but more of a extension of each
              branch of science and engineering. For example, as a result of the
              need for alternative fuel sources, solar cells are now being used
              widely in EE and corn ethanol in biochem engineering.
              Unfortunately, it's not a disruptive technology like computers,
              internet, cars, aeroplanes and will not create much wealth for the
              americans other than the energy-related industries. I am very
              pessimistic about the US economy and the job market so much that I
              am quite jittery at every feedback I received at work. If you have
              any idea about the big asset bubble in China, you will lose half a
              head of hair. If that bubble pop, we are going to see a real
              depression in all parts of the world especially in Singapore
              because a lot of our sg banks are exposed to their environment.
              Let's hope not.<br></strong></p>
              <p><em>I'm certainly aware things are not as rosy as some make it
              out to be and that the internship hiring period is long long
              over.The H1B sponsorship (I don't really need/want a green card)
              has pretty much dropped by 75% and yes alot of companies that used
              to sponsor no longer do so. It also seems to have affected
              internships which is the first problem for me. Since I switched
              majors for masters, I'm focusing mostly on learning as you say. I
              actually worked as research assistant in my undergraduate, through
              spring/summer and during school for almost a year, paid and unpaid.
              It just seems that employers seem abit adverse to students who
              seemed to have taken a more "academic" route in their work
              experiences, even if it was very relevant. I worked more as a
              design/prototyping engineer as compared to a laboratory assistant.
              A couple of prototypes that I build from scratch are being refined
              by the research group and will probably be patented some time in
              future. My undergrad gpa is near perfect for a top college program
              that does not inflate grades. I don't know if thats good or
              brilliant any more as I've beaten myself up too much about not
              getting an internship/job. Its just that they would gladly hire
              someone else with just one internship with a big name company even
              if they'd been there for barely 3 months (what could you
              accompish?). I've thought about the Phd route but the lull in
              earnings for 5-6 years is just something I can't afford right now.
              Being mentored by my young prof who graduated from MIT and has tons
              of funding is on face value an excellent opportunity but I'm just
              not cut out for a Phd, practicality aside.</em><br> <strong>It seems like you were PhD material and could have choose
              to go on to complete an free Ivy league PhD in Mech engineering
              since you were top in that department. It's a waste really. You
              seem to be under a lot of pressure to produce economic value and I
              totally understand that because probably Singaporean you see has a
              job waiting for them in Singapore and many americans can secure
              jobs easily. Your education was paid by a private bank loan or your
              parents are funding it?</strong></p>
              <p><em>If I may ask, why do you "need" a green card (ignore if this
              is too sensitive a question)? If you are Singaporean, H1B1 should
              keep you around for as long as you want, so long as you have a job
              in the US I guess. I still think that from an Engineer's
              standpoint, there is no doubt that US&gt;&gt;Singapore. My theory
              is this probably stems from the costs difference and popularity of
              getting an engineering degree in either country. You can look at it
              from take home pay after taxes, cost of living, job satisfaction,
              job variety, etc. I've done a fair bit of analysis and I think its
              quite safe to say this (assuming one gets the job).</em><br> <strong>H1B doesn't give you any job mobility. If you are under H1B
              from a certain company, it is not possible to switch companies with
              the legal complications and if you are fired you will most likely
              not be in time to file for H1B the same year and you have to go
              back home.</strong> <strong>Green card is also for enriching your
              next generation and extended family. You can put your children
              through the best colleges using federal financial aid and be
              assured that they have a future in this country because they are
              not F1 students like the rest. Of course, if you have the green
              card, you can invest freely in their stock markets without any
              restrictions and enjoy many benefits (7k if you buy a house, with
              social security you will have free health insurance after you are
              retired, unemployment benefits etc etc depending on which state you
              are in). If I had served NS for USA instead of Singapore, I will
              have alot of additional benefits as well but too bad for
              us.<br></strong></p>
              <p><em>You're quite accurate in describing the influx of foreigners
              in US universities. In one of my classes, 95% are chinese/indian
              and probably among the brightest as well. This has made things very
              difficult for me academically. While doing Mech, I more than held
              my own but since going into Indus, my lack of foundation knowledge
              has hampered my performance. I'm taking it as a learning
              experience. In terms of job searching, I feel that most Chinese
              want to do a masters/phd before returning, whereas the Indians are
              desperate to stay. They are essentially in the same boat as me
              except that I like to think I can communicate better. Returning to
              Sg, leaves me no different from having gone to say NUS or NTU,
              except with this "branding".<br></em><strong>It used to be quite
              different when the computer/IT/semiconductor industry started its
              boom in late 90s and early 2000s and there was a shortage of
              engineers. If you asked those Asian engineers in their 30s, they
              aren't really from the top universities like we are. One of my
              ex-Indonesian engineering manager was from Arizona State University
              and he just got his US citizenship. However, it's quite different
              now. I doubt any international student from ASU can even get an
              internship as a janitor in the tech companies. The chinese aren't
              really expressive people unless you know them well. I doubt anyone
              will want to go back to their country if they are offered a job to
              stay here. Where else can you get $70-100K USD for an engineering
              job? Chinese engineers earn less than $20k a year. It's all plain
              economics.</strong></p>
              <p><em>I'm very disillusioned with this 200+k worth of "branding"
              and honestly do feel it was a very poor investment, maybe even
              cheated. Most of the $$ goes into research funding and what I have
              is no more than a overpriced piece of decorated paper like coe. It
              also only matters on the first job generally. In my case, its seems
              like it won't even matter at this rate as I'm probably headed for
              grunt work that won't use my knowledge.<br></em><strong>Don't be.
              I know how you feel. I was jobless for 1 month before I got my
              interview with my current company and that was exactly how I felt.
              I started feeling shitty in my last semester in the school because
              most of my "scholar" friends went back and immediately take up
              senior officer positions in the civil service. Their facebook
              pictures were always about eating at nice places, clubbing with hot
              girls and new cars etc. I remembered I deactivated my facebook for
              quite a long while because I can't bear to watch others bask in
              their excesses while I hang by a thread.</strong></p>
              <p><em>I'm finding it very hard to feel positive, since other
              facets of my life aren't doing that great either. I think I'll stay

              <p>I've heard quite abit about banking (one of 
              my roommate's parents is with citi) and while the money is good, I don't
               know if I can appreciate the lack of job security. However, due to my 
              current predicament, I know I can't just restrict myself to engineering 
              jobs. Unfortunately, I don't know too many b/millionaires or celebrities
               directly lol. Some of my Sg friends here in college however are 
              associated with such people through blood or acquaintance.</p>
              <p>Lol 
              this China-US relationship has been a talking point for perhaps the last
               2 years. I think this recession will likely continue for another couple
               years until more debt has been deleveraged. We're not quite ready to 
              resume normal service and unfortunately this directly affects fresh 
              grads like me. It is however out of my hands, lest I strike some stroke 
              of genius and discover a limitless form of renewable energy. As it is I 
              already worry about the asset bubble that Sg is developing, not to 
              mention the even more gigantic one in China. Ah but what do I know, 
              there's always another school of thought that runs completely opposite 
              to what we think. Bubbles? There's no such thing as bubbles... Where 
              have I heard that before?</p>
              <p>My education was paid for by my parents. However that is not the 
              whole story. They essentially postphoned their housing loan payments by 
              paying for my education first. Before you ask, just take it that my 
              family will have a huge housing loan to take care of in a couple years 
              time. There is a really long twisted story behind it involving other 
              people speculating on our current apartment land, the current state of 
              Sg's property market, etc etc. I don't want to bore you, suffice to say 
              that I would have liked my dad at his age not to still be worrying about
               paying loans.</p>
              <p>Yes, I heard about the control that companies have
               on H1B workers and I now realise how important having a green card is 
              in this country. No wonder so many view H1Bs as merely a means to get a 
              green card.</p>
              <p>In regards to chinese people being less expressive, 
              I'm quite in agreement. I think that, at least in my observations at 
              career fairs, they also tend to project a more hesistant image when 
              presenting themselves. This also leads to a "poorer" impression that 
              recruitors have. If given a chance, sure they would love to work in the 
              US. However, alot seem to lack the confidence and charisma to pull it 
              off due largely in part to their English and then they basically just 
              give up talking to US recruitors. I know I'm grossly generalising here 
              but that seems to be the understanding I get from alot of my Chinese 
              peers. Hence, they prefer following the "safer" phd route or just simply
               returning back to China with an advanced degree. The naturalised 
              Chinese (ABC) do not fall into this category though and there are of 
              course still China students who pursue a US job all the way. Maybe times
               are changing, I might be mistaken.</p>
              <p>I'm glad that you fully empathize with what I went through last 
              year when I graduated. Quite a number here could not understand why and 
              blamed my arrogance or lack of direction. I'm with you on staying away 
              completely from Fb. That's probably the best advice I've heard so far. 
              I've plenty of sg friends who are either on scholarship with a fast 
              track up the civil service ladder or in banking (sg/manhatten) drawing 
              obscene salaries and already partying weekly or going to be posted in 
              California with a nice programming job. These 3 possible scenarios 
              recycled with different people and different names account for maybe 85%
               of all the sg students I've met here. The rest are either incredibly 
              rich so it doesn't matter or doing a Phd (or both as it seems). Don't 
              get me wrong. I'm very happy for all of them but I just wish I had some 
              thing to show for all my effort (no time for partying and 1/2 a banking 
              pay cheque is fine with me).</p>
              <p>That you went through that and still
               made it to where you are now does give me some encouragment. I'll try 
              to keep looking for that light at the end of the tunnel. Thanks again.</p>

              <p>I completely understand what you're going through. There's been quite a lot of good advice given here so do take the time to read what some posters have to say. Did you go straight to masters from undergrad?<br><br>In terms of plans, I'll probably be heading back to Sg after moving into my apartment for next year. Like I mentioned earlier, I will likely just help out my roommate in optimising NUH operations in my free time (which I should have plenty now given wc may not be coming to us on tv). I've not heard back on any sg internships either or I got rejected.</p>
              <p>I know I'm probably not the best person to be telling you this but do try to stay positive lol.</p>

              <p>humm. sry joe, ur post  was too long so I did not read.</p>
              <p>There is no hope in Foster City also?</p>
              <p>if you are talking about finding a job, while doing undergrad or
                  now as master student. It would be difficult. </p>
              <p>In any case, complete your studies then come back to singapore.
                  At least your expense will be reduced because you have a house in
                  singapore? </p>
              <p>Time is bad in US. I know. </p>

              <p>Not to worry, Lokey, I felt inclined to give a full response since quite a few posters took the time to give me very detailed pieces of advice. You don't have to go through all of it lol.</p>
              <p>I'm still trying Sg (I'm assuming you don't mean Foster city in Cali) but I think the internet application is making things difficult. If I was able to attend a local fair at NUS or NTU, things would probably be quite different as I would get to talk to people directly and meet specific companies who are actually looking to hire as opposed to me going in cold now with little ground knowledge. I'm still keeping a lookout though.</p>
              <p>Yes I do have a place with my family, so additional rent is essentially saved if I had instead continued in the US. I did however take almost everything into account when comparing Sg to US objectively. Regardless, that is the least of worries which one is better. If I had offers coming in left right center, sure.</p>
              <p>I'm not certain what will happen in future but its looking increasingly likely I will return to Sg after I graduate. I've basically set myself a deadline of up to early Feb next year, ~1 month after I graduate, to secure something. If I don't, I'll pack up and return. I will also have to be quite fluid and flexible too, so I'll try to apply to where ever I can regardless of location (and possibly field as well) as long as I'm eligible. Do note that if I go back Sg, there's also probably going to be a significant lag since I'll only be able to start interviews once I touch down (whether I get anything is also another story).</p>
              <p>We'll see what happens I guess, but there's still time for things to change.</p>

              <p>I am refering to foster city in Cali. That is where all the engineering and IT firm is. I think it is really because you are studying that why people dont accept you. You need to be on internship or something, firm there (FC) dont hire people who are unexperienced that is &gt; at least 5 years !!??.</p>
              <p>Oh you also need to learn to write resume, cover letter to present yourself. That is something that you need to learn from course.  </p>

              <p>I do agree that an internship is an important step into a company however getting one has been very difficult, maybe even more so than getting a job imo. I don't think that studying impedes employment opportunities, at least not in my college. Alot of my peers secure full time positions before they graduate but then again its not a level field as they are either US citizens/PRs or they have local connections.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, they don't teach you how to do that over here as part of curriculum. You need to actively take responsibility for your resume. There are of course many resources provided by my college that would help this. I know my resume isn't perfect but I think I've done a good job based on what I've accomplished. My problems extend further than that though as I mentioned to XenDan and number of others here - nationality, big name internship, specific skill set requirements or "fit" as they say.</p>
