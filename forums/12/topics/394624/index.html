            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Hi, my first post rant...</p>
              <p>I want to start by introducing 
                  myself. If you think I'm boasting, you're entitled to since it may come 
                  across that way. I'm just so frustrated that I don't know what to think 
                  or do anymore.</p>
              <p>I come from a pretty well to do family. From 
                  young, I've worked very hard, so my parents wanted to send me overseas 
                  for university. I was reluctant to be honest but went with it as they 
                  insisted. In the middle of ns, I applied and got into one of the best US
                   university for the engineering field I was interested in. Over my 3 
                  years in college, I tried my utmost to find a job there but it was just a
                   complete failure. Ironically, I was at my best in my undergraduate 
                  years. I was doing incredibly well academically - With a stunning gpa, I
                   was performing better than all the other Sg scholars. I was also the 
                  president/captain of one of the varsity sports clubs and was really fit.
                   I went to church every Sunday and had many friends. Heck, I even had 
                  time to go out clubbing and for some reason some guys worshipped how I 
                  carried myself around girls (with confidence on hindsight).</p>
              <p>Every year I practically threw myself at any US employer but no 
                  one bit. One could blame the recession perhaps. I was forced to 
                  compromise, interning in Shanghai one year, working for my university 
                  professor the next and in Singapore in the last year. The day I 
                  graduated was probably the most disappointing day in my life. I found 
                  itÂ  very shameful to tell others that, unlike all my peers, I was out of
                   college without a plan, without a dream. All that motivational talk and
                   speeches given out on that day could not console what I was really 
                  feeling. Lets face it, we graduated at the shittest time in the last 5 
                  decades. People complain about not finding a job for 6 months. I hadn't 
                  found one in 4 years.</p>
              <p>I decided not to take it personally. I switched majors for my 
                  masters, hopefully to broaden my scope. As expected, my grades took a 
                  dip and became quite average (I'm only human. Trying to compete with a 
                  classroom full of phd candidates with almost zero basic knowledge is 
                  like jumping out of a plane with an umbrella). I lost quite a bit of 
                  fitness as I sunk a little into depression even though I'm still 
                  managing the club. I think I'm losing my mind as well (as in becoming 
                  more stupid or mentally insane I don't know). Overall, I lost pretty 
                  much every bit of confidence I had in myself. Before I at least had 
                  academics to fall back on. Now, I have almost nothing academically, 
                  financially, socially, intelluctually. That's not to say I didn't see it
                   coming. The decline started the few months before I graduated and 
                  proceeded to endure almost a year later to now. I don't know how to 
                  reverse it.</p>
              <p>I'm a quarter million dollars in debt to my parents with no clear
                   path of recourse (ie, no job). The job situation here in the US is bad.
                   In Singapore, it seems I'm not wanted either. Too expensive compared to
                   "FT"s. Furthermore, we all know the job "prospects" of being an 
                  engineer. On the contrary, the banks who are culprits for this crisis 
                  are still offering business grads ridculous starting salarys (a topic 
                  for another time).</p>
              <p>I've given up also on having any kind of relationships. I 
                  thought that it was because I couldn't spare the time but now I know 
                  that was just an excuse. I just simply don't believe relationships work 
                  for me anymore (maybe this is a confidence issue I don't know). You may 
                  find this ridculous but at 25, I think I'm already too old to develop 
                  any meaningful long term relationship. Once a person starts working, 
                  status and money distort relationships and for all my faith in humanity,
                   I don't believe girls can see alot beyond that. I've seen too many 
                  first hand, off hand examples that my trust has been blown away. Sure, 
                  sure my sample size is "relatively" small hahaha but it grows every 
                  year.</p>
              <p>I no longer find myself having time/energy to spare for friends 
                  much less making new ones. Every thing I had going before evaporated. In
                   the past, I would be garang enough to step into awkard situations. Now 
                  even sharing eye contact with other people makes me feel weird and insecure. I used to be such an extrovert, now I'm an introvert. In 
                  short, I'm the person who from the outside seemed to have every thing 
                  but really has nothing.</p>
              <p>If someone threatened my life now, I don't
                   think I would care. I think about suicide on a weekly basis, more from a
                   "harakiri" standpoint but then what would my parents do? They are the 
                  sole reason why I'm still breathing. They also need to pay housing loans
                   something that would not have been a problem if I had stayed in 
                  Singapore. I need to provide an ROI so to speak for all their time and 
                  money. But with all the mistakes and failures I have made, I don't know 
                  how long more I can go on. Each failure I bring bears a cost to other 
                  people. Edison could have had a thousand failures before he succeeded 
                  but how many people have that luxury?</p>
              <p>I'm tired, frustrated and lost. Did I mention about my health? 
                  Nevermind, I too lor sor already.</p>

              <p>You have got only one brain up there to function your life, so maybe you can solving part by part of your problems first?</p>
              <p>Right now, at the age of 25, you should be focusing on building your career instead of r/s. So for the r/s problem, maybe you can just cast it aside first. That already reduces one of your problem.</p>
              <p>Now, about getting job, are you in this state because of your interview skills are not up on par? or that your asking salary is too high? Think about the factors that makes you unemployed till now. It does not take much to compromise right now.</p>
              <p>Correct me if I'm wrong. But I do not think you are required to contribute back to your household expense or that your parents are hounding you for the debt you are owing them. So this makes you pretty financially free at the moment. If that is the case, why not take a step back, take down a lower paid job, and slowly climb up through your abilities? Look at the longer term rewards, rather than the short ones.</p>
              <p>If you could have climbed that high in your early academic days, there must be something worthy of you to be mentioned and made use of. Do not give up.Â </p>
              <p>All the best. =) Â </p>

              <p>Sorry, you are on your own now. You have to make things happen. Or else wait for what is dished out to you. Many others are also like you, expecting their "entitlement" rather than "go get 'em".</p>
              <p>You are on a different level, a higher level from mere workers. You got to have a plan, a road map, direction, what you can contribute, what you want to achieve. Your prospective employers want to see that. They don't want a highly qualified worker. You are entering at the executive level, for gawd sake.</p>

              <p>Cause he is expecting himself to live to a hundred. 25 is a quarter of a hundred. Personally, I will prefer not living past forty though.</p>
              <p>Problems:</p>
              <p>1) No Job</p>
              <p>2) Health</p>
              <p>3) Debts to parents</p>
              <p>4) No gf</p>
              <p>The above is listed in an order from most important to least important. Basically, the first step is to find a job. My advice is to look for areas beside the engineering field. You can try education, insurance, products - Anything that will put food on the table and allow you to pay back your parents bit-by-bit. It doesn't matter if it is going to take a decade or two, the main thing now is that you have no income and thus is totally unable to repay them at all.</p>
              <p>DO NOT have the thinkings that ''I have a Masters, and I will definitely need to have a starting pay of above 5k, if not 10k'' and "I study so hard for so many years, so I must have a good job". Life is unpredictable, just take whatever that comes your way, and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">make the best out of it</span></strong>. Â </p>

              <p>You have got only one brain up there to function your life, so
                      maybe you can solving part by part of your problems first?</p>
              <p>Right now, at the age of 25, you should be focusing on building
                      your career instead of r/s. So for the r/s problem, maybe you can
                      just cast it aside first. That already reduces one of your
                      problem.</p>
              <p>Now, about getting job, are you in this state because of your
                      interview skills are not up on par? or that your asking salary is
                      too high? Think about the factors that makes you unemployed till
                      now. It does not take much to compromise right now.</p>
              <p>Correct me if I'm wrong. But I do not think you are required to
                      contribute back to your household expense or that your parents are
                      hounding you for the debt you are owing them. So this makes you
                      pretty financially free at the moment. If that is the case, why not
                      take a step back, take down a lower paid job, and slowly climb up
                      through your abilities? Look at the longer term rewards, rather
                      than the short ones.</p>
              <p>If you could have climbed that high in your early academic days,
                      there must be something worthy of you to be mentioned and made use
                      of. Do not give up.Â </p>
              <p>All the best. =) Â </p>
              </div>

              <p>Thanks. I do understand where you are coming from about r/s. The view I have is that its almost now or never. Yes we never know what will happen in future but I think that if I wait till I'm financially stable (great job I'm doing here), there will be too many obstacles by that time. But alright, perhaps I should sort out my career first and see how.</p>
              <p>My interview skills are decent I think. The feedback I get is that they usually very impressed with my conversation skills and education background. This was back in my undergrad and I was very confident then. Salary was always negotiable. The problem was that my "skill set" did not match. US private employers were very particular about candidates having a specific set of skills already in place, even for internships which I found a little unreasonable. I've been to so many career fairs that I'm on first-name basis with alot of recruiters from different companies.</p>
              <p>There is certainly no hard and fast rule about repayment. However, they have a housing loan to service soon. The last thing I want is for my parents to have any kind of financial instability because my education became a white elephant.</p>
              <p>Thanks again for your advice. I don't know what's going to hold me together but I guess I'll just keep plugging at it.</p>

              <p>Simple.</p>
              <p>You are full of yourself.</p>
              <p>You have no plans for next week,Â you only see

              make it.</p>
              <p>You still expect things to be laid out for you as itÂ was
              all through the years of study.</p>
              <p>Sorry, you are on your own now. You have to make things happen.
              Or else wait for what is dished out to you. Many others are also
              like you, expecting their "entitlement" rather than "go get
              'em".</p>
              <p>You are on a different level, a higher level from mere workers.
              You got to have a plan, a road map, direction, what you can
              contribute, what you want to achieve. Your prospective employers
              want to see that. They don't want a highly qualified worker. You
              are entering at the executive level, for gawd sake.</p>

              <p>I figured I would get some negative response. The internships I did through out my undergrad were all "plan B"s. When I graduated, I had applied and got into grad school for masters. That was also a plan B. Sorry what I meant without a plan was less literal. I was trying to say that even though on face value I had a clear path to take, on a more emotion level I was lost. I was following plan that I couldn't believe I was taking. Actually, I never expected things to be laid out, in fact I got so used to failure (to get a job/intern) that I planned my life around expecting failure to happen. For 4 years I gave everything. There's only so much I can take.</p>
              <p>You are right about facing a prospective employer. A couple years ago that wouldn't have been a problem. I was bright-eyed, sharp, had a clear idea of how I could position myself in the industry, knew where I was going. I had a hunger that I now vaguely remember. Now I don't even believe in or recognise myself. I'm not sure how I can convince someone else. I'm surprised at how college turned me into a tired shadow of myself.</p>

              <p>So have you thought, whether you would be settling down locally or in the US? You must know where you want to be, before you can even look for a job right? I'm not very sure about US employment stuff. Since you said that they are very particular about the relevant set of skills, then why not change your focus to that in Singapore?Â </p>
              <p>In Singapore, you do not need any specific set of skills, but a general one. If you are willing to accept a lower pay cut, and willing to work hard to show your commitment in the industry, I believe you would be scaling the ranks in no time given your qualification.Â </p>

              <p>Ideally my plan was to work in the US, recoup the degree investment before returning to Sg. But I can't be too rigid in my thinking seeing that today anything and nothing can happen. I've switched my internship search over to Sg but its also not going well, not to mention the inherent difficulty of doing it from US.</p>
              <p>I'm really banking on the fact actually that Sg companies aren't as particular about a graduate's initial skills as long as he/she has shown capability.

              <p>hi,</p>
              <p>i empathize with you.Â  the world is changing, especially in the last 2Â years of global crisis.Â  10 years ago, singapore graduates generally can expect to find work upon graduation.Â  there was the asian financial crisis, nevertheless the spore job market was more stable and protected then (in my view) compared to now due toÂ the influx of foreign "talents" and economic restructuring.Â </p>
              <p>fresh grads enter the job market full of idealism and ideas of how their future should turn out.Â Â it's frustrating when reality turns out to be quiteÂ different from their dreams.Â </p>
              <p>this situation happens not only to "fresh" grads like yourself, but also to mid-career professionals who left their jobs, say 1-2 years ago when the economy outlook wasÂ  rosy, to pursue full time post-grad degrees.Â  after making a hefty investment, they left grad school to find themselves either out of job, or having to do jobs which don't commensurate with their abilities.Â  it's not their fault that this situation has happened.Â  it is the macro-environment that has changed - the current slate of jobs available just don't fit their "upgraded" skills and knowledge.Â </p>
              <p>you are absolutely right in wanting to "make good of the education that you have had".Â  it is only natural to feel this way.Â  working at a "low-end" job for grads is possible, however it is likely you will feel the mis-fit.Â </p>
              <p>anyway, to cut a long story short, my point is that, being caught in a situation like yours is not your fault.Â  so don't burden yourself unnecessarily by blaming yourself or your parents for the decisions made in the earlier years.Â  back then, i'm sure no one had a crystal ball to predict how the future will turn out.Â  we have to make adjustment - psychologically and inÂ our strategy to move forward.Â  a changed world requires a different thinking to adapt to it.</p>
              <p>depressing as it is now, life will go on.Â  we just need to figure out how.Â  there will always be a way.Â  who knows, you may have a lucky break soon !Â  cheer up, kÂ ? :)Â  keep a positive attitude.Â </p>
              <p>by the way, don't give up on relationships (in general).Â  it's true that the well-being of a person's career affects his mood and outlook.Â  nevertheless, good relationships give you the warmth and fuel to draw upon to help you tide over the winter.Â  change is the only constant.Â  that means that the situation is changing too.Â  our minds tend to dwell on the negative, but change can be for the better too :)</p>

              <p>hi,</p>
              <p>i empathize with you.Â  the world is changing, especially in the last 2Â years of global crisis.Â  10 years ago, singapore graduates generally can expect to find work upon graduation.Â  there was the asian financial crisis, nevertheless the spore job market was more stable and protected then (in my view) compared to now due toÂ the influx of foreign "talents" and economic restructuring.Â </p>
              <p>fresh grads enter the job market full of idealism and ideas of how their future should turn out.Â Â it's frustrating when reality turns out to be quiteÂ different from their dreams.Â </p>
              <p>this situation happens not only to "fresh" grads like yourself, but also to mid-career professionals who left their jobs, say 1-2 years ago when the economy outlook wasÂ  rosy, to pursue full time post-grad degrees.Â  after making a hefty investment, they left grad school to find themselves either out of job, or having to do jobs which don't commensurate with their abilities.Â  it's not their fault that this situation has happened.Â  it is the macro-environment that has changed - the current slate of jobs available just don't fit their "upgraded" skills and knowledge.Â </p>
              <p>you are absolutely right in wanting to "make good of the education that you have had".Â  it is only natural to feel this way.Â  working at a "low-end" job for grads is possible, however it is likely you will feel the mis-fit.Â </p>
              <p>anyway, to cut a long story short, my point is that, being caught in a situation like yours is not your fault.Â  so don't burden yourself unnecessarily by blaming yourself or your parents for the decisions made in the earlier years.Â  back then, i'm sure no one had a crystal ball to predict how the future will turn out.Â  we have to make adjustment - psychologically and inÂ our strategy to move forward.Â  a changed world requires a different thinking to adapt to it.</p>
              <p>depressing as it is now, life will go on.Â  we just need to figure out how.Â  there will always be a way.Â  who knows, you may have a lucky break soon !Â  cheer up, kÂ ? :)Â  keep a positive attitude.Â </p>
              <p>by the way, don't give up on relationships (in general).Â  it's true that the well-being of a person's career affects his mood and outlook.Â  nevertheless, good relationships give you the warmth and fuel to draw upon to help you tide over the winter.Â  change is the only constant.Â  that means that the situation is changing too.Â  our minds tend to dwell on the negative, but change can be for the better too :)</p>

              <p>I think there is alot of truth in what you said and it makes alot of sense. Unfortunately, feelings aren't very logical and constantly facing negative setbacks for years at a time does take its toll. But I'll do my best to keep a positive outlook and at least get through this semester. Thanks for your understanding.</p>

              <p>I don't know, I could be overreacting. I took engineering out of interest and because I was really good at it. Unfortunately, I feel that this isn't working out as I had planned , hence my rant about not having any "reliable" plan. It is to some extent poor foresight I do not deny.</p>
              <p>Yes unemployment is bad. I don't expect sky high salary. In fact, if a reputable US company offered me no pay internship to work on some thing over summer, I would devour it just so I could have more things to put on my resume. At least something to build on. As an engineer, the opportunities you have in Sg are significantly fewer compared to many places in the world.</p>
              <p>My family isn't doing business but my father is doing quite well in his position, at least to me. Even if he were a business owner, I wouldn't want to rely on nepotism nor would he allow it either I would like to think. However, like I said, we still have bills to pay and I would still like to make good return based on what I was given.</p>

              <p>Hi, my first post rant...</p>
              <p>I want to start by introducing myself. If you think I'm
              boasting, you're entitled to since it may come across that way. I'm
              just so frustrated that I don't know what to think or do
              anymore.</p>
              <p>I come from a pretty well to do family. From young, I've worked
              very hard, so my parents wanted to send me overseas for university.
              I was reluctant to be honest but went with it as they insisted. In
              the middle of ns, I applied and got into one of the best US
              university for the engineering field I was interested in. Over my 3
              years in college, I tried my utmost to find a job there but it was
              just a complete failure. Ironically, I was at my best in my
              undergraduate years. I was doing incredibly well academically -
              With a stunning gpa, I was performing better than all the other Sg
              scholars. I was also the president/captain of one of the varsity
              sports clubs and was really fit. I went to church every Sunday and
              had many friends. Heck, I even had time to go out clubbing and for
              some reason some guys worshipped how I carried myself around girls
              (with confidence on hindsight).</p>
              <p>Every year I practically threw myself at any US employer but no
              one bit. One could blame the recession perhaps. I was forced to
              compromise, interning in Shanghai one year, working for my
              university professor the next and in Singapore in the last year.
              The day I graduated was probably the most disappointing day in my
              life. I found itÂ  very shameful to tell others that, unlike
              all my peers, I was out of college without a plan, without a dream.
              All that motivational talk and speeches given out on that day could
              not console what I was really feeling. Lets face it, we graduated
              at the shittest time in the last 5 decades. People complain about
              not finding a job for 6 months. I hadn't found one in 4 years.</p>
              <p>I decided not to take it personally. I switched majors for my
              masters, hopefully to broaden my scope. As expected, my grades took
              a dip and became quite average (I'm only human. Trying to compete
              with a classroom full of phd candidates with almost zero basic
              knowledge is like jumping out of a plane with an umbrella). I lost
              quite a bit of fitness as I sunk a little into depression even
              though I'm still managing the club. I think I'm losing my mind as
              well (as in becoming more stupid or mentally insane I don't know).
              Overall, I lost pretty much every bit of confidence I had in
              myself. Before I at least had academics to fall back on. Now, I
              have almost nothing academically, financially, socially,
              intelluctually. That's not to say I didn't see it coming. The
              decline started the few months before I graduated and proceeded to
              endure almost a year later to now. I don't know how to reverse
              it.</p>
              <p>I'm a quarter million dollars in debt to my parents with no
              clear path of recourse (ie, no job). The job situation here in the
              US is bad. In Singapore, it seems I'm not wanted either. Too
              expensive compared to "FT"s. Furthermore, we all know the job
              "prospects" of being an engineer. On the contrary, the banks who
              are culprits for this crisis are still offering business grads
              ridculous starting salarys (a topic for another time).</p>
              <p>I've given up also on having any kind of relationships. I
              thought that it was because I couldn't spare the time but now I
              know that was just an excuse. I just simply don't believe
              relationships work for me anymore (maybe this is a confidence issue
              I don't know). You may find this ridculous but at 25, I think I'm
              already too old to develop any meaningful long term relationship.
              Once a person starts working, status and money distort
              relationships and for all my faith in humanity, I don't believe
              girls can see alot beyond that. I've seen too many first hand, off
              hand examples that my trust has been blown away. Sure, sure my
              sample size is "relatively" small hahaha but it grows every
              year.</p>
              <p>I no longer find myself having time/energy to spare for friends
              much less making new ones. Every thing I had going before
              evaporated. In the past, I would be garang enough to step into
              awkard situations. Now even sharing eye contact with other people
              makes me feel weird and insecure. I used to be such an extrovert,
              now I'm an introvert. In short, I'm the person who from the outside
              seemed to have every thing but really has nothing.</p>
              <p>If someone threatened my life now, I don't think I would care. I
              think about suicide on a weekly basis, more from a "harakiri"
              standpoint but then what would my parents do? They are the sole
              reason why I'm still breathing. They also need to pay housing loans
              something that would not have been a problem if I had stayed in
              Singapore. I need to provide an ROI so to speak for all their time
              and money. But with all the mistakes and failures I have made, I
              don't know how long more I can go on. Each failure I bring bears a
              cost to other people. Edison could have had a thousand failures
              before he succeeded but how many people have that luxury?</p>
              <p>I'm tired, frustrated and lost. Did I mention about my health?
              Nevermind, I too lor sor already.</p>

              would be 'thinkers' and 'doers'. The former depict people who think
              (only), but the latter refers to people who do (only). Naturally, most
              people fall in between. Problems usually arise from those who are
              nearer to these extreme points.</p>
              <p>You are decapitated by your
              thoughts to such extend that you are basically immobile. Although you
              might have decent academic background, the crux of your plight lies
              with your selection process. Although you are right to say that you
              don't mind working as an intern for as long as it is a prospective
              company, this is precisely the problem here - many company may not be
              as 'prospective' as you deemed it would be, which you might probably
              eliminate. To worsen your deal, you lacked the necessary working
              experience - so companies are reluctant to hire (even intern),
              especially since times are difficult.</p>
              <p>I will reframe it into
              something simpler - you want a deal that is good for you in the long
              term and the path you have 'planned' for yourself is rigidity linear
              and fixed. Even as a civil servant (in which our garmen would likely to
              hire you, considering your relatively impressive academic background),
              you consider it 'bad' in the long run. For someone who has been
              unemployed for 4 years - frankly, this 'bad' in the long run is still
              irony a 'good' now.</p>
              <p>Beggars can't be choosers.</p>
              <p>Your
              thinking disabled you totally. To make matter even worst, because your
              family is well-to-do, the incentive to find a job isn't as urgent. Yes,
              you might talk about ROI, but everything else is still stable, so
              what's the urgency unless it derives from self?Â </p>
              <p>Learn to ride
              the donkey while you seek for the horse. You can't always be waiting
              for the glorious stallion to pass by you before you take a leap. Your
              attitude towards life synonymously reflects your situation in love -
              your fear of 'risk/lost' is masked by fortifying yourself in this ivory
              tower of intellectual retreat, analyzing from an apex, which you feel
              safe from the noisy rumbles of the world below your view. You comfort
              yourself with the thinking that you 'have the whole picture' but the
              truth is that your 'full picture' is the real distortion of the 'real
              picture'.Â </p>
              <p>For once, learn to do first and think later. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
