              <p>These days is not easy to find companies which are paying well for jobs.   We have our dear ruling party condoning companies to overwork the staff and pay them low, this is what CDC labelled as the trend these days.</p>
              <p>Well, you still can continue to look out for jobs while working on your present perm job.</p>

              <p>He reap wat he sowed... there'll always be consequences behind every action... judging from his words, he said he has experience... not first time working... if beforehand, the condition already so bad, then why sign with the company?</p>
              <p>even if he's in need of money back then, he shld have weighed his choices... in the end, it's him who made the decision... I'm sure his company didnt put a gun on his head to force him to sign with them...</p>
              <p>From his words, he say he started recently, say work till feb or mar... tat'll be 4-5 months... minus away 2 months pay for breaking the contract, he left 1 2-3 months pay...</p>
              <p>I suggest TS worked till he complete his contract... Even if u dun earn much, u still earn 2 yrs experience and it stays with u...</p>

              <p><br>Wrong.</p>
              <p>Company treated staff not well and staff turnover rate was high, this was the reason she left.    She was merely asked to work extra days and not got paid so being soft hearted she obliged.</p>

              than a fresh grad, mind you. some more its a 2 years contract. if

              <p>Hi Franceso,</p>
              <p>As you have mentioned, you are unhappy with the pay, but are you unhappy with the job itself? Many people are also unhappy with their pay in view of the current economic situation, but if you view the job as acceptable despite a lack of 'excitement', then I advise that you stay on with this job.</p>
              <p>Given that many people are out of job in the present time, it will not be wise to attempt to quit a generally acceptable job when you have one.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
