            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I realise my (ex?) girlfriend is too friendly to other people, to the point of ignoring me, her boyfriend. While friendliness is a virtue, I believe one must be selectively friendly. After all, haven't we encountered people who are distant to us but be super close to another?</p>
              <p>For instance, when I am with her and I am talking to her about stuff, if she sees a friend (close or not close), she would just say hi and start talking to the other person, totally ignoring the fact that I have NOT ended my conversation with her YET. And once it ends, she didn't even bother asking me to resume.</p>
              <p>Once, she happen to befriend a guy playing the piano in the piano room. Or rather, she was <em>befriended</em> by the guy. (The guy looks like a 'player') I sat there and read the papers, she knew I was there and she kept on talking to the guy. Then, she went out with him some more to watch a performance. On the FIRST day they met. I have been asking her out and she keeps giving me lame excuses, like busy or no money. After that, she still got the mood to sit and chat with him till midnight.</p>
              <p>Then, the piano guy keeps on coming, like trying to meet her. There was once me, the girl and another person were talking and I could see her giving a glance to the guy playing the piano. Upon returning to the gym (after 30 minutes, as I didn't feel well), I saw her AT the piano lounge, with the guy playing. Didn't expect her to return so soon. She said, she wants a break from work. Then, there was another occasion he came to play, on the pretext of 'teaching' her, up till midnight. She promised to come over to my room after it's done and it took her two hours to do so. Fortunately, he's no longer around. But then again, she's no longer around (in Europe doing some student exchange programme). Coincidence?</p>
              <p>Along the way, till now, I realised that she has always been giving me the cold shoulder. Each time she comes online, I say hi to her, and it always takes a long time (sometimes 10 mins or so) to say hi. I say something, and the only thing she says is those one-word replies like <em>haha, lol, i c </em>. She rarely speaks to me about a lot of stuff. Funnily, when her ex and other friends (usually desperate males) talk to her online, she can rival this long post in terms of word count. And her response was lightning speed, unlike mine which is akin to snail mail. Furthermore, she classifies some of her new friends (i.e. those that she got to know after heading to student exchange) under 'friends' whereas mine is lumped under 'other contacts'.</p>
              <p>When I ask her what's going on, she doesn't want to say. She always says it's 'private'. Funny how she spills out these problems to her pals. And funny how a lot of her pals know of her blog, which she has kept secret from me. She says 'a lot of private matters in it', which is why she doesn't want to disclose. Then, why tell others? Isn't 'private' affairs a personal thing in which NO ONE else is involved, not even pals?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When I asked her once whether she loved me and is my gf or not, she said YES. However, few days ago, she says I don't know her enough and she wanted to stay single. She wants to return to her <em>old life</em>. She wants more space and personal time so she wants me to 'respect the decision'.</p>
              <p>Don't know her enough? She doesn't want to share it with me!! Privacy, she said.</p>
              <p>Old life?? When we were going out, she said we were seeing each other too often, and she hasn't seen her other friends for so long. Friends??? Friends who don't contact her for so long? Friends who don't bother sacrificing their sleep to send her off at Changi? Mind you, I was the only one sacrificing my sleep and my S$20 to send her off at Changi. Who was the one taking the trouble to send her the important postage? You think others would care??</p>
              <p>Old life?? She thinks she has a lot of close pals...mind you, these 'pals' are mostly guys. And the same guys would always appear in her MSN, taking her attention away from mine. Which explains why it takes 10 minutes for her to give me a one-word reply. I should say her boobs are large and she does have a 'naive-like' behaviour, which is a turn-on for guys, because when I saw their faces, they look like fucking losers. Desperate for girls, perhaps. And some of them are already attached! Why are they spending so much time with my gf? Why she doesn't say she's spending too much time with them? Only I got the 'award' of spending 'too much' time together??</p>
              <p>Sometimes, I feel that her friends may be influencing her to be against me. After all, they all want her, right? And once I saw one of their messages condemning her 'ex-boyfriend' (i.e. me) when we were quarreling. Which meant they have a strong influence on her, stronger than mine. Otherwise, why the sudden attitude change? Then, one of the guys had the cheek to ask her if she has met 'any European hunks' on her Facebook. Since he's not in my friends list, I wouldn't know what she wrote there.</p>
              <p>It seems that she is enjoying her life in Europe now. Ya...getting to know white hunks, f**king them like nobody's business. To the point where she's forgotten me. If she truly wants to see me, why the f*** she go and take another module OUTSIDE her exchange university, forcing her to possibly return later? If she truly likes me, why give me the cold shoulder when I call or MSN? She likes giving attention to others only interested in giving her a f***, whereas I am being the doormat. Sigh...</p>
              <p>In addition, she wasn't planning to stay here. She wants to go to the USA so badly to do her masters, then from there hoping to do medicine. Moi thinks, if you cannot even get your good results here, forget about going to angmoh nations. I can't understand why she thinks USA is <em>the </em>place for her to go, citing good education, etc...brochures always look better than reality. In that case, even if she returns, I better be prepared for a ten-inch black cock to have penetrated her front and back in quintessential campus parties. If that's the case, get the fuck out of my chink arse. Remember, her tits are large.</p>
              <p>I wonder if she wanted to be my gf in the first place...I realised that I was the one pushing and she was a mere willing participant. </p>
              <p>Comments, brickbats are welcome. I'll just go bukkake on someone else in the meanwhile.</p>

              <p><br>so sorry i know i shouldn't be doing this but this actually got me triggered and started laughing.</p>
              <p>yea honestly you ain't reaping what you sow. it actually does suck to be taken for granted and not appreciated.</p>
              <p>not asking you to hold back or anything but look at it this way.</p>
              <p>way back in time when we were young, our parents had painstakingly brought us up and what have we done to repay them? with more shoutings and the hurling of our temper at them. why?</p>
              <p>because we know they'll forgive us.</p>
              <p>because we know they'll still continue taking care of us despite our actions.</p>
              <p>because we take them for granted thus only weep and regret when 'D-day' comes.</p>
              <p>same goes for you. but apparently you're her bf not her father. thus i don't see the need for you to actually take all the rubbish from her and if she ain't willing to listen to you, find someone else who does and get her out of your life.</p>

              <p>kench-an,</p>
              <p>Long story, simple answer.</p>
              <p>Right partner, wrong timing.</p>
              <p>If you've met her 3 years from now.. she'd be treating you differently.</p>
              <p>Right now, she just found new flavours.. new places to explore.</p>
              <p>The more you try to restraint her.. the more resentful she get's of you.</p>
              <p>It's a phase she has to go through.</p>
              <p>You either wait .. or you seek life with another person more ready to settle down with you.</p>
