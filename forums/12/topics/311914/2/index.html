              <p>wow, i didn't know the winning combi for guys is big tits + naivete. how -cough- shallow these despos can be. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/ugly.png" alt="ugly.png"></p>
              <p>well, good for you, from my p.o.v, you seem like the type who doesn't take a girl for granted, unlike those despos you mentioned. so score 1! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>As for your girl, let her go and explore the world she so desperately wants to go to ... she clearly isn't the smart or practical type .. no offence. If this happens to her one day with any European or American dudes who can't wait to get her naked then dump her, she'd be really sorry. Ah well, it depends on her alone if she wants to learn her lesson the hard way. Have you been telling her any of these by any chance?</p>
              <p>Anyways, since you prove to be able to commit, that's good. In the future, you may pick other worthier ladies, or you can give her a second chance if she's willing to. So play your cards right, yes?</p>
              <p>And umm.. if it wasn't meant to be, then it's not. On the bright side, at least by actually informing you that she wants a break (or sth like that, cant rmb because your post was too long<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png">), she isn't treating you like an emergency bf. It'd be a lot worse if she thought she could flirt with other guys and keep a first aid kit or a convenient boredom-dispeller.</p>

              <p>After reading your extremely long post, here's a curve ball bro. First of all, why you all caught up &amp; getting your boxers all up in a bunch? Let's review the FACTS. She shows disregard by ignoring or pretending to be utterly interested in what you have to say. It ain't a girl thing, guys do that too. I've friends that do that all the time, it's a sign of the other party being disinterested. Or maybe she has the attention span of a goldfish... maybe I dunno.</p>
              <p>Secondly, you claim she is being influenced by outside interferences (i.e friends) Well that is a clear sign, if it were true.., that she has no control over what she thinks, so she let's others tell her what to do/think. She doesn't have her own opinion on where you &amp; her are going. Being that as it may, pretty much what I tell my friends with similar problems..., If that is the way she is, then no matter how many nights you cry, feel depressed or try to rationalize the situation... You never lost her, 'cause you never had her to begin with. If you are as good a person/boyfriend or whatever &amp; all the above you said are true.., she doesn't deserve you. She's not prepared to give you what you need, she's more like I need my personal space kinda thing. Y'know, I'm better off alone attitude....</p>
              <p>So pick yourself up, find friends to keep you occupied. Go bowling, golfing or better yet go clubbing. Meet new people and sooner than you think you'll be kicking yourself, thinking "Why was I that person?" She will never know what she lost 'cause she never understood what she had. Guy or girl, it's all the same. Don't play this like a game. People's feelings are not for you to mess around with. Be a gentleman, understand and love yourself. Technically, she taught you something..., a lesson in the dangers of investing emotions in someone who is unworthy. I'm sure you can do better, you're just not looking in the right places. I wish you luck.</p>

              <p>so did you get close to her partly because of her ample chest too?</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I realise my (ex?) girlfriend is too friendly to other people,
                      to the point of ignoring me, her boyfriend. While friendliness is a
                      virtue, I believe one must be selectively friendly. After all,
                      haven't we encountered people who are distant to us but be super
                      close to another?</p>
              <p>For instance, when I am with her and I am talking to her about
                      stuff, if she sees a friend (close or not close), she would just
                      say hi and start talking to the other person, totally ignoring the
                      fact that I have NOT ended my conversation with her YET. And once
                      it ends, she didn't even bother asking me to resume.</p>
              <p>Once, she happen to befriend a guy playing the piano in the
                      piano room. Or rather, she was <em>befriended</em> by the guy. (The
                      guy looks like a 'player') I sat there and read the papers, she
                      knew I was there and she kept on talking to the guy. Then, she went
                      out with him some more to watch a performance. On the FIRST day
                      they met. I have been asking her out and she keeps giving me lame
                      excuses, like busy or no money. After that, she still got the mood
                      to sit and chat with him till midnight.</p>
              <p>Then, the piano guy keeps on coming, like trying to meet her.
                      There was once me, the girl and another person were talking and I
                      could see her giving a glance to the guy playing the piano.
                      Upon returning to the gym (after 30 minutes, as I didn't feel
                      well), I saw her AT the piano lounge, with the guy
                      playing. Didn't expect her to return so soon. She said, she
                      wants a break from work. Then, there was another occasion he came
                      to play, on the pretext of 'teaching' her, up till midnight. She
                      promised to come over to my room after it's done and it took her
                      two hours to do so. Fortunately, he's no longer around. But then
                      again, she's no longer around (in Europe doing some student
                      exchange programme). Coincidence?</p>
              <p>Along the way, till now, I realised that she has always been
                      giving me the cold shoulder. Each time she comes online, I say hi
                      to her, and it always takes a long time (sometimes 10 mins or so)
                      to say hi. I say something, and the only thing she says is those
                      one-word replies like <em>haha, lol, i c</em> . She rarely speaks
                      to me about a lot of stuff. Funnily, when her ex and other friends
                      (usually desperate males) talk to her online, she can rival this
                      long post in terms of word count. And her response was lightning
                      speed, unlike mine which is akin to snail mail. Furthermore, she
                      classifies some of her new friends (i.e. those that she got to know
                      after heading to student exchange) under 'friends' whereas mine is
                      lumped under 'other contacts'.</p>
              <p>When I ask her what's going on, she doesn't want to say. She
                      always says it's 'private'. Funny how she spills out these problems
                      to her pals. And funny how a lot of her pals know of her blog,
                      which she has kept secret from me. She says 'a lot of private
                      matters in it', which is why she doesn't want to
                      disclose. Then, why tell others? Isn't 'private' affairs
                      a personal thing in which NO ONE else is involved, not even
                      pals?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When I asked her once whether she loved me and is my gf or not,
                      she said YES. However, few days ago, she says I don't know her
                      enough and she wanted to stay single. She wants to return to her
                      <em>old life</em>. She wants more space and personal time so she
                      wants me to 'respect the decision'.</p>
              <p>Don't know her enough? She doesn't want to share it with me!!
                      Privacy, she said.</p>
              <p>Old life?? When we were going out, she said we were seeing each
                      other too often, and she hasn't seen her other friends for so long.
                      Friends??? Friends who don't contact her for so long? Friends who
                      don't bother sacrificing their sleep to send her off at Changi?
                      Mind you, I was the only one sacrificing my sleep and my S$20 to
                      send her off at Changi. Who was the one taking the trouble to send
                      her the important postage? You think others would care??</p>
              <p>Old life?? She thinks she has a lot of close pals...mind
                      you, these 'pals' are mostly guys. And the same guys would always
                      appear in her MSN, taking her attention away from mine. Which
                      explains why it takes 10 minutes for her to give me a one-word
                      reply. I should say her boobs are large and she does have a
                      'naive-like' behaviour, which is a turn-on for guys, because when I
                      saw their faces, they look like fucking losers. Desperate for
                      girls, perhaps. And some of them are already attached! Why are they
                      spending so much time with my gf? Why she doesn't say she's
                      spending too much time with them? Only I got the 'award' of
                      spending 'too much' time together??</p>
              <p>Sometimes, I feel that her friends may be influencing her to be
                      against me. After all, they all want her, right? And once I
                      saw one of their messages condemning her 'ex-boyfriend' (i.e.
                      me) when we were quarreling. Which meant they have a
                      strong influence on her, stronger than mine. Otherwise, why the
                      sudden attitude change? Then, one of the guys had the cheek to ask
                      her if she has met 'any European hunks' on her Facebook. Since he's
                      not in my friends list, I wouldn't know what she wrote there.</p>
              <p>It seems that she is enjoying her life in Europe now.
                      Ya...getting to know white hunks, f**king them like nobody's
                      business. To the point where she's forgotten me. If she truly wants
                      to see me, why the f*** she go and take another module OUTSIDE her
                      exchange university, forcing her to possibly return later? If she
                      truly likes me, why give me the cold shoulder when I call or MSN?
                      She likes giving attention to others only interested in giving her
                      a f***, whereas I am being the doormat. Sigh...</p>
              <p>In addition, she wasn't planning to stay here. She wants to go
                      to the USA so badly to do her masters, then from there hoping to do
                      medicine. Moi thinks, if you cannot even get your good results
                      here, forget about going to angmoh nations. I can't understand why
                      she thinks USA is <em>the</em> place for her to go, citing good
                      education, etc...brochures always look better than reality. In that
                      case, even if she returns, I better be prepared for a ten-inch
                      black cock to have penetrated her front and back in quintessential
                      campus parties. If that's the case, get the fuck out of my chink
                      arse. Remember, her tits are large.</p>
              <p>I wonder if she wanted to be my gf in the first
                      place...I realised that I was the one pushing and she was a
                      mere willing participant. </p>
              <p>Comments, brickbats are welcome. I'll just go bukkake on someone
                      else in the meanwhile.</p>

              <p>I think there's a problem with yourself here, for you do not even know if you are in/out of a relationship with her. You have a rather wrong account and I am just surprised that you are inconclusive on this issue. So my question to you here is: Are you in/out ?</p>
              <p>Don't mind me saying here but I perceive that you are out. On the fair side, you seem to be sore about the whole thing to such a sense you seem to loose some logic and sense here. Just because she has big boobs and friendly doesn't mean that she is loose and certainly not cheap. What's wrong with being born beautiful and attractive? Your post here is not only addressing the problem but your account is leaning towards her being a slut.</p>
              <p>In all fairness, as much as you mention the lack of attention on your conversation (God knows what you are talking about to her and I doubt if there's anything important - which is your answer of a light attention); there is also an act of neglect on your part when she was getting acquainted with that piano guy  and what were you doing? Reading the papers!! I mean what are you doing with the papers on a date? Trying to read the weather forecast or horoscope between the both of you?</p>
              <p>Your (ex) girlfriend seems to be a smart and intelligent individual. For what I see, she is a quick witted one and certainly isn't a cup of plain tea - but rather a cup of Earl's Grey. Generalize your conversation and you are out of her planet. Has it ever occurred to you that what you are communicating may be deemed lame and boring which has been repeatedly mentioned and brought up by you ? As what you have done here posting repeatedly about her being friendly with everybody she comes in contact with&gt;&gt;?? Did she not agree in the first place that you are her steady? Gone out with you one to one and close to you than any other individual?</p>
              <p>I hate to say this but I can't seem to have any reason to stand at your side of the fence. I just felt that you had let your emotions get the better of you to even generalize her being a slut going for other men instead of her pursuit for higher learning. From what you had posted, she seems to be the pursued rather than the pursuer. I am just shaking my head how you can misinterprete and misunderstood her.</p>
              <p>I felt that part of her in the USA I think is really uncalled for and shows the kind of character you are here. Sure speaks a lot to me here about how much base you have here. BTW do you have any issues with blacks in US? I think you had better be careful with what you say here.</p>
              <p>I don't want to dampen you here but I think you are out of her league. She is not your cup of tea. Move on.</p>

              <p>I realise my (ex?) girlfriend is too friendly to other people,
              to the point of ignoring me, her boyfriend. While friendliness is a
              virtue, I believe one must be selectively friendly. After all,
              haven't we encountered people who are distant to us but be super
              close to another?</p>
              <p>For instance, when I am with her and I am talking to her about
              stuff, if she sees a friend (close or not close), she would just
              say hi and start talking to the other person, totally ignoring the
              fact that I have NOT ended my conversation with her YET. And once
              it ends, she didn't even bother asking me to resume.</p>
              <p>Once, she happen to befriend a guy playing the piano in the
              piano room. Or rather, she was <em>befriended</em> by the guy. (The
              guy looks like a 'player') I sat there and read the papers, she
              knew I was there and she kept on talking to the guy. Then, she went
              out with him some more to watch a performance. On the FIRST day
              they met. I have been asking her out and she keeps giving me lame
              excuses, like busy or no money. After that, she still got the mood
              to sit and chat with him till midnight.</p>
              <p>Then, the piano guy keeps on coming, like trying to meet her.
              There was once me, the girl and another person were talking and I
              could see her giving a glance to the guy playing the piano.
              Upon returning to the gym (after 30 minutes, as I didn't feel
              well), I saw her AT the piano lounge, with the guy
              playing. Didn't expect her to return so soon. She said, she
              wants a break from work. Then, there was another occasion he came
              to play, on the pretext of 'teaching' her, up till midnight. She
              promised to come over to my room after it's done and it took her
              two hours to do so. Fortunately, he's no longer around. But then
              again, she's no longer around (in Europe doing some student
              exchange programme). Coincidence?</p>
              <p>Along the way, till now, I realised that she has always been
              giving me the cold shoulder. Each time she comes online, I say hi
              to her, and it always takes a long time (sometimes 10 mins or so)
              to say hi. I say something, and the only thing she says is those
              one-word replies like <em>haha, lol, i c</em> . She rarely speaks
              to me about a lot of stuff. Funnily, when her ex and other friends
              (usually desperate males) talk to her online, she can rival this
              long post in terms of word count. And her response was lightning
              speed, unlike mine which is akin to snail mail. Furthermore, she
              classifies some of her new friends (i.e. those that she got to know
              after heading to student exchange) under 'friends' whereas mine is
              lumped under 'other contacts'.</p>
              <p>When I ask her what's going on, she doesn't want to say. She
              always says it's 'private'. Funny how she spills out these problems
              to her pals. And funny how a lot of her pals know of her blog,
              which she has kept secret from me. She says 'a lot of private
              matters in it', which is why she doesn't want to
              disclose. Then, why tell others? Isn't 'private' affairs
              a personal thing in which NO ONE else is involved, not even
              pals?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When I asked her once whether she loved me and is my gf or not,
              she said YES. However, few days ago, she says I don't know her
              enough and she wanted to stay single. She wants to return to her
              <em>old life</em>. She wants more space and personal time so she
              wants me to 'respect the decision'.</p>
              <p>Don't know her enough? She doesn't want to share it with me!!
              Privacy, she said.</p>
              <p>Old life?? When we were going out, she said we were seeing each
              other too often, and she hasn't seen her other friends for so long.
              Friends??? Friends who don't contact her for so long? Friends who
              don't bother sacrificing their sleep to send her off at Changi?
              Mind you, I was the only one sacrificing my sleep and my S$20 to
              send her off at Changi. Who was the one taking the trouble to send
              her the important postage? You think others would care??</p>
              <p>Old life?? She thinks she has a lot of close pals...mind
              you, these 'pals' are mostly guys. And the same guys would always
              appear in her MSN, taking her attention away from mine. Which
              explains why it takes 10 minutes for her to give me a one-word
              reply. I should say her boobs are large and she does have a
              'naive-like' behaviour, which is a turn-on for guys, because when I
              saw their faces, they look like fucking losers. Desperate for
              girls, perhaps. And some of them are already attached! Why are they
              spending so much time with my gf? Why she doesn't say she's
              spending too much time with them? Only I got the 'award' of
              spending 'too much' time together??</p>
              <p>Sometimes, I feel that her friends may be influencing her to be
              against me. After all, they all want her, right? And once I
              saw one of their messages condemning her 'ex-boyfriend' (i.e.
              me) when we were quarreling. Which meant they have a
              strong influence on her, stronger than mine. Otherwise, why the
              sudden attitude change? Then, one of the guys had the cheek to ask
              her if she has met 'any European hunks' on her Facebook. Since he's
              not in my friends list, I wouldn't know what she wrote there.</p>
              <p>It seems that she is enjoying her life in Europe now.
              Ya...getting to know white hunks, f**king them like nobody's
              business. To the point where she's forgotten me. If she truly wants
              to see me, why the f*** she go and take another module OUTSIDE her
              exchange university, forcing her to possibly return later? If she
              truly likes me, why give me the cold shoulder when I call or MSN?
              She likes giving attention to others only interested in giving her
              a f***, whereas I am being the doormat. Sigh...</p>
              <p>In addition, she wasn't planning to stay here. She wants to go
              to the USA so badly to do her masters, then from there hoping to do
              medicine. Moi thinks, if you cannot even get your good results
              here, forget about going to angmoh nations. I can't understand why
              she thinks USA is <em>the</em> place for her to go, citing good
              education, etc...brochures always look better than reality. In that
              case, even if she returns, I better be prepared for a ten-inch
              black cock to have penetrated her front and back in quintessential
              campus parties. If that's the case, get the fuck out of my chink
              arse. Remember, her tits are large.</p>
              <p>I wonder if she wanted to be my gf in the first
              place...I realised that I was the one pushing and she was a
              mere willing participant. </p>
              <p>Comments, brickbats are welcome. I'll just go bukkake on someone
              else in the meanwhile.</p>

              <p>But for kench-an case, i think its far worse than my friend's case. Your gal simply wanted attention from other guys to make herself more popular i suppose. she is not the kind of gf guys will want. Maybe it's good to be her male friend instead of her boyfriend. Right guys?</p>

              <p>its like TS's ex likes attention from guys,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sigh, i can understand how u feel, its always weird and strange when the one whom supposed to get closer to you ended you finding their own time getting closer with other ppl more than you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it always hurt when u never feel loved by your partner especially when u 've done so much for your partner... i mean, even blind man can know if some1 really love them.. its all based on actions...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TS, this kind of gal are just not commited enough to stay long in r/s. She's just too young or rather the wild type to play around.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My advice, just forget her and move on.. u don have to check how was she doin anywhere. She wont care for you and u know you shouldnt care for her too. You can still be friend with her but i dont think u can be good friend.. the way she treated you will always haunt u evertime u chat with her...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>one day, u will find one whom really love you and wanted to marry u. No worries. When that time comes, you will feel like living in heaven. Let her out of your life. She will regret one day</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I realise my (ex?) girlfriend is too friendly to other people, to the point of ignoring me, her boyfriend. While friendliness is a virtue, I believe one must be selectively friendly. After all, haven't we encountered people who are distant to us but be super close to another?</p>
              <p>For instance, when I am with her and I am talking to her about stuff, if she sees a friend (close or not close), she would just say hi and start talking to the other person, totally ignoring the fact that I have NOT ended my conversation with her YET. And once it ends, she didn't even bother asking me to resume.</p>
              <p>Once, she happen to befriend a guy playing the piano in the piano room. Or rather, she was <em>befriended</em> by the guy. (The guy looks like a 'player') I sat there and read the papers, she knew I was there and she kept on talking to the guy. Then, she went out with him some more to watch a performance. On the FIRST day they met. I have been asking her out and she keeps giving me lame excuses, like busy or no money. After that, she still got the mood to sit and chat with him till midnight.</p>
              <p>Then, the piano guy keeps on coming, like trying to meet her. There was once me, the girl and another person were talking and I could see her giving a glance to the guy playing the piano. Upon returning to the gym (after 30 minutes, as I didn't feel well), I saw her AT the piano lounge, with the guy playing. Didn't expect her to return so soon. She said, she wants a break from work. Then, there was another occasion he came to play, on the pretext of 'teaching' her, up till midnight. She promised to come over to my room after it's done and it took her two hours to do so. Fortunately, he's no longer around. But then again, she's no longer around (in Europe doing some student exchange programme). Coincidence?</p>
              <p>Along the way, till now, I realised that she has always been giving me the cold shoulder. Each time she comes online, I say hi to her, and it always takes a long time (sometimes 10 mins or so) to say hi. I say something, and the only thing she says is those one-word replies like <em>haha, lol, i c</em> . She rarely speaks to me about a lot of stuff. Funnily, when her ex and other friends (usually desperate males) talk to her online, she can rival this long post in terms of word count. And her response was lightning speed, unlike mine which is akin to snail mail. Furthermore, she classifies some of her new friends (i.e. those that she got to know after heading to student exchange) under 'friends' whereas mine is lumped under 'other contacts'.</p>
              <p>When I ask her what's going on, she doesn't want to say. She always says it's 'private'. Funny how she spills out these problems to her pals. And funny how a lot of her pals know of her blog, which she has kept secret from me. She says 'a lot of private matters in it', which is why she doesn't want to disclose. Then, why tell others? Isn't 'private' affairs a personal thing in which NO ONE else is involved, not even pals?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When I asked her once whether she loved me and is my gf or not, she said YES. However, few days ago, she says I don't know her enough and she wanted to stay single. She wants to return to her <em>old life</em>. She wants more space and personal time so she wants me to 'respect the decision'.</p>
              <p>Don't know her enough? She doesn't want to share it with me!! Privacy, she said.</p>
              <p>Old life?? When we were going out, she said we were seeing each other too often, and she hasn't seen her other friends for so long. Friends??? Friends who don't contact her for so long? Friends who don't bother sacrificing their sleep to send her off at Changi? Mind you, I was the only one sacrificing my sleep and my S$20 to send her off at Changi. Who was the one taking the trouble to send her the important postage? You think others would care??</p>
              <p>Old life?? She thinks she has a lot of close pals...mind you, these 'pals' are mostly guys. And the same guys would always appear in her MSN, taking her attention away from mine. Which explains why it takes 10 minutes for her to give me a one-word reply. I should say her boobs are large and she does have a 'naive-like' behaviour, which is a turn-on for guys, because when I saw their faces, they look like fucking losers. Desperate for girls, perhaps. And some of them are already attached! Why are they spending so much time with my gf? Why she doesn't say she's spending too much time with them? Only I got the 'award' of spending 'too much' time together??</p>
              <p>Sometimes, I feel that her friends may be influencing her to be against me. After all, they all want her, right? And once I saw one of their messages condemning her 'ex-boyfriend' (i.e. me) when we were quarreling. Which meant they have a strong influence on her, stronger than mine. Otherwise, why the sudden attitude change? Then, one of the guys had the cheek to ask her if she has met 'any European hunks' on her Facebook. Since he's not in my friends list, I wouldn't know what she wrote there.</p>
              <p>It seems that she is enjoying her life in Europe now. Ya...getting to know white hunks, f**king them like nobody's business. To the point where she's forgotten me. If she truly wants to see me, why the f*** she go and take another module OUTSIDE her exchange university, forcing her to possibly return later? If she truly likes me, why give me the cold shoulder when I call or MSN? She likes giving attention to others only interested in giving her a f***, whereas I am being the doormat. Sigh...</p>
              <p>In addition, she wasn't planning to stay here. She wants to go to the USA so badly to do her masters, then from there hoping to do medicine. Moi thinks, if you cannot even get your good results here, forget about going to angmoh nations. I can't understand why she thinks USA is <em>the</em> place for her to go, citing good education, etc...brochures always look better than reality. In that case, even if she returns, I better be prepared for a ten-inch black cock to have penetrated her front and back in quintessential campus parties. If that's the case, get the fuck out of my chink arse. Remember, her tits are large.</p>
              <p>I wonder if she wanted to be my gf in the first place...I realised that I was the one pushing and she was a mere willing participant. </p>
              <p>Comments, brickbats are welcome. I'll just go bukkake on someone else in the meanwhile.</p>
