              <h1>Hair of the dog: Animal lovers turn dead pets' coats into woolly jumpers</h1>
              <p>When dog lovers Beth and Brian Willis's beloved pets died they found a
              way to remember them that left them feeling warm all over. <br> <br> They combed their carpets for hair left by their pedigree pets then had
              it spun into yarn, which Beth knitted into his 'n' hers winter warmers.
              <br> <br> And twelve years later, their hair of the dog memorials are still in use.<br> <br> <img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/FurNORTH1803_468x621.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em>Hair of the dog: Beth and Brian Willis in their his'n'hers jumpers made from their dead dogs' hair</em><br> <br> Brian, who worked for a removals firm for 27 years, wears his doggy jumper  every Saturday into town to do the weekly shop. <br> <br> The 73-year-old said: "They are extremely warm and pretty much waterproof. <br> <br> "Unless it is banging it down it is fine. I've always got a sweat on by the  time I get from the bus to the shops."   <br> <br> Mother-of-three, Beth, of Newcastle, first used the fur of their white
              Samoyed, called Kara, knitting Brian's sweater in 1990. <br> <br> Kara died 12 years ago but the sweater looks like going on forever. <br> <br> Beth, 71, said: "It is not actually a hair but a wool, which is why it is so  good for clothes. <br> <br> "It would just fall off the dogs and I would run a wet hand over the carpet and  pick it up. <br> <br> "We found out from the breeders we got the pups from that it was possible to  use their coat for clothes. <br> <br> "Apparently it is quite popular with lots of the people who breed long-haired  dogs."   <br> <br> The Samoyed is native to north Russia, where they were used to keep
              children warm. Its fur is almost waterproof and softer than alpaca. <br> <br> <img src="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2008/03_03/Fur2NORTH1803_468x298.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <em>Much loved pets: Swedish Lapphund Penny and white Samoyed Kara<br> <br> </em> Having proved a dog is not just for life once, Beth did it again with their  next pet Swedish Lapphund, Penny. <br> <br> She died six years ago but not before the retired St John ambulance telephonist  had got weaving on a new garment. <br> <br> Beth even, has enough wool left over to make a new jumper. <br> <br> She sends the fur to Malise Macguire in Derby to be spun. <br> <br> Malise, 60, has been spinning dog wool since 1977. "She said: "It takes
              about 30oz to make a jumper, but you would need 40oz at the start as
              you lose some in the spinning. <br> <br> "Brian and Beth have had more than 5lb spun, wrapped, pre-shrunk and ready to  be knitted."   <br> <br> The couple who celebrated their gold wedding last year, have three
              children, six grandchildren and two great-grandchildren and Beth said
              her next dog fur creation will have to wait. <br> <br> She is too busy knitting jumpers for the youngsters  - using wool. <br> <br> <br> <em> Source: Daily Mail UK, Mar. 18, 2008</em></p>
