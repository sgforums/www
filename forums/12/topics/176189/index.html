            <div class='col-md body'>It's a total lost for you also now too right ? You wishes to be with your girlfriend, to be there for her. But now your contraints is that if you were to let her parents know about the relationship, it will cause you 2 to be seperated. The one affected most will be your girlfriend because she have just lost her Granny, definately losing her boyfriend now will hit her hardest.<br><br>What I'll suggest is that you wait till the funeral matters are all settled first since she wishes to be alone right now. Maybe she's just too lost to think of other things. Maybe you can get her bestfriend to ask her and talk to her ? It will help especially if she's bottling things up within her.<br><br>V-Day is very close, just 2 weeks to be exact. She might have just settled down by then. So whether to continue with V-Day outing, get her consents first. Maybe her parents might want her to be home now cause her parents is so strict and think  they might also want to be conservatives as in 1 month of mourning period.<br><br>Death is inevitable in life. I too have lost 2 Grand-Uncle &amp; 1 Grand-Aunt within 1 year period and I myself have to handle partial of the funerals for 1 Grand-Uncle and Grand-Aunt and also to clear their flats cause they're childless. The sadness is there, but you have to tell yourself that whatever had happened had already happened. No matter what you do, it will not be reversed. Hope your girlfriend could take it that way.<br><br>As for you, hope you've felt better by pouring out your inside now. If you're religious, maybe going to the Church, Temple, etc might help. Talk to someone you can confide in. I do that when I'm upset. Meanwhile, I can only say, take care dude. I'll keep you and your girlfriend in prayer.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
