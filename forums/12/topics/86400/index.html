            <div class='col-md body'>I love this girl and I noe her thru working together but I never had the chance to talk and interact much with her before that. Then one day i pluck up my courage and ask her out during the school vacations and she agreed. I was damn happy. All the time I spent with her was really awesome and keeps me yearning for more and more.  I've asked her out for 7 times, and i will be meeting her tomorrow for the 8th time. I need to do something about it, I just wanna tell her I love her and wanna be more than friends. I don't wanna waste so much time and pain. She's like avoiding me a little after the 7th date as she knows what my intensions are. I believe that she feels for me a little but something is really stopping her. I aint sure what they are. Perhaps she fears of something? Studies or whatsoever? I have no idea and I wanna know so badly... I sms her sweet messages telling her how much i miss her and she gave me neutral responses which keeps me figuring out whether she likes me. You know something, I've a hard time asking her out again after the 7th date, and finally I will get to see her again tomorrow. Before that, she rejected me a couple of times I guess claiming she's really busy and stuffs. All i want to do is to let her know how i feel. I'll be lying if i say i m not afraid of rejection but i gotta take a risk. I don't know what she's really thinking and I believe she doesnt have any relationships before. I'm damn confused and I really really love her. Wad should I really do tomorrow? It's like a make or break day. And after tomorrow I think its harder to ask her out again as the tests are round the corner...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

You have already acknowlegde to her how you feel already.. there's no need for you to declare your love  to her.. Unless you are sure of getting her into your hands... then there's where you pop the ultimate one and for all quenstion.. that's the beginning of a new r/s..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Jus be normal.. treat as a friend.. since you already hinted her.. that you kinda of have feelings for her.. let her be more comfortable with you.. whenever you are out together.. dun ever let her feel so stressed so tensed up.. cos in her heart, her mind she knows that she's goin out with someone that likes her.. or she likes too.. she might feel pressurized on that..<br><br>if this you can even do it properly.. and you wan to ask her to be more than jus friends.. i guess.. the probability of you failing to get her will be great.. Take it easy.. Feed her slowly.. no point rushing.. you choke her to death.. till she cannot breathe and pass out... is that wat oyu wan?? i believe not..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So like what yunhaier said.. you show possessiveness and not love.. even before the r/s you are being like this.. i reeally wonder what will happen when you both are in the r/s.. will you still be so possessive over her.. this r/s might not long last...<br><br>Take care pal.. be sure of yourself.. be confident and have trust!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Girls ain't stupid. She definitely knows ur intentions and if shes ready to accept u she would be giving u hints already. Having doubts means u are highly likely to be rejected. But of course theres nothing wrong with taking that risk if shes worth it.

Then one day i pluck up my courage and ask her out during the school vacations and she agreed. I was damn happy. All the time I spent with her was really awesome and keeps me yearning for more and more.  I've asked her out for 7 times, and i will be meeting her tomorrow for the 8th time. I need to do something about it, I just wanna tell her I love her and wanna be more than friends. I don't wanna waste so much time and pain. She's like avoiding me a little after the 7th date as she knows what my intensions are. I believe that she feels for me a little but something is really stopping her. I aint sure what they are. Perhaps she fears of something? Studies or whatsoever? I have no idea and I wanna know so badly... I sms her sweet messages telling her how much i miss her and she gave me neutral responses which keeps me figuring out whether she likes me. You know something, I've a hard time asking her out again after the 7th date, and finally I will get to see her again tomorrow. Before that, she rejected me a couple of times I guess claiming she's really busy and stuffs. All i want to do is to let her know how i feel. I'll be lying if i say i m not afraid of rejection but i gotta take a risk. I don't know what she's really thinking and I believe she doesnt have any relationships before. I'm damn confused and I really really love her. Wad should I really do tomorrow? It's like a make or break day. And after tomorrow I think its harder to ask her out again as the tests are round the corner...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>Yo dude,<br><br>I went thru this b4. Around last yr October, I dated some girl. I brought this girl out a few times, sms her nice things and all that interested guy would do. Then suddenly, she no longer reply back my smses or answering my calls. When I was dating her, she told me that she's single and now I found out that she will be getting engaged to some joker NEXT MONTH. She invited me to come over for some ceremony VIA 3RD PARTY and I will not attend it... cos I'm NOT SINCERE to attend the function. For what?! Shite.. I'm still pissed off abt it<br><br>I had a shock when i first found out abt the engagement. It's quite fast cos the gap btwn the time i date her and her engagement is like less than a year and I'm sure that she has been seeing this joker for quite sometime. Why can't she jus be truthful to me??<br><br>Regarding abt yr problem, I can safely say that by this time, she knows yr intentions and i'm sure she's no longer sincere with you. Pull out and don't waste time on her but instead, widen yr social circle and I'm sure there are loads of girls who are sincere knowing u and all. If u go on.. it may cause u damage. Chances are that she may have a guy in mind. To change a girl's mind when she already aimed for a guy is very difficult.<br><br>Girls are like that one... always insincere and will not tell you her real intentions. All the best in yr aspirations..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U guys must learn that u need patience when courting girls. I'm sure she is aware of your feelings from your SMS &amp; she must like u or she won't be going out with u right? Just take it slowly, enjoy each other's company first. This is a chance to get to know each other better. Don't rush her or she will run away. If she is ready, I'm sure she will let u know</div>
