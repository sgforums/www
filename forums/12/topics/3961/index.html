            <div class='col-md body'>I used to haf similiar thinking as u. I used to think that musicians cannot make much in life. It's only until I got to find out there are musicaian that really get a lot. For instance they can teach piano, organ or guitar. And they are earning quite a lot, esp in this country, where education are very impt. Just look at the number of children taking music and art classes... They may not be very well-off like businessmen, but they are still of the middle-income class.<br><br>As for dancers or those actors from eg the necessary stage, etc, I'm not too sure though...<br><br>But if u were to compare them to those in the US or other countries, we still have a big gap. But they have come a long way.... They have formed their culture long b4, and has a history for at least 200 yrs. But I think we are still developing and things are going pretty well....

            <div class='col-md body'>eh Artists ? To me, i don't understand Art at all ! I just detest the subject. I find that Artistes do earn quite alot, Be it musicians (i remember a point that mothers are forcing their children to learn the piano, art, Guitar or anything. Just for the fact that they hope their child will learn what they never get to even touch in their life.) Artists, or popstars.<br>I find that be it artists, musicians, or even popstars, They are all quite famous and do earn quite alot, but Pop-stars are more generally appealing as they attract youngsters and teenagers, who would splurge on an Aaron kwok or Andy Lau concert ticket.<br>In short ... i find that no matter what you do, so long you have talent and work real hard at it, You'll Be highly paid and seeked after =)<br><br>------------------<br>The night is near and dawn is coming... I Lay awake on my bed thinking of you... I wonder ... when will we meet again ? When will we talk once more ? I Know my love to you is deep and true ... but i wonder how you feel for me ...</div>
