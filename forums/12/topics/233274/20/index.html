            <div class='col-md body'>this afternoon he called me n said the smses were never meant to be taken seriously tho he wants me to b his wife but he knows it can't be now. HA. HA. HA. i told him not funny don't try this again. not funny. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>today he went drinking with his friends and he reported to me via sms n phone call i told him it's okie just relax,enjoy himself take care n text me when he has gotten home safely. to me that's concern already i m not just a fan of tracking other ppl's movements even if that person is my bf. moreover, we r not really in a relationship yet so i think it's even more so we shd hav our personal freedom and space.<br><br>i've been rather encouraging bout him spending time with his frds or other ppl i even said i had no qualms bout him going out with girls too when he said he would to spike me. he often saw that as he didnt matter to me n that caused part of the tension in the last tiff. i told him i m just not the sort who's paranoid bout my guy going out with the opposite sex unless he tells me he's doing smt outrageous. given my nature, i won't restraint his movements generally n i cant b restrainted much as well. funny how he looks more like the insecure one now. or should i say funny for a very insecure girl why i dun seek physical possession of the person i want to be with.<br>think i hav just learnt that it's emotional support n security which really matters to me. should figure out a way to communicate bout it to him n hav him understand my viewpoints instead of feeling hurt..hmmm.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ytd when i asked him if he had a good time with his buddies after he came home he said he alr told me no wat n said i m feeling better after the revenge is it. wat revenge...he thinks going out with his buddies is revenge for me having a chit chat session with a guy frd at mac's a few days ago?-_-"<br><br>another issue i wish to ask for some opinions is that he has this strange theory he claims after reading books that if a guy can make a girl feel aroused she will want to stick with him. it seems to me that as we go on he desires more physical intimacy saying things like "i want to make out with u but i know it's hard lol" and he's a staunch believer that he wont touch any other girl but the one who he loves so he says he wont have this desire to get intimate with other girls even if they throw themselves at him. this is part of the underlying tension we hav in our "relationship" cos i keep holding back on it and he keeps wanting more cos he thinks he loves me only that's why he wants me and that if i hav greater physical intimacy with him he'd b able to keep me but i m not sure if that's greater lust than love. my guess he'd b mad if i said it may b lust cos he firmly believe it's love. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
