            <div class='col-md body'>Before doing my breakdown, let me share with you an article i read somewhere.<br><br>Finding your Soul Mate<br><br><strong>Why it's wise to temper your feelings and take things slowly </strong><br>Why do men and women fall head over heels in love with people they barely know - and why does this common occurrence fail to work most times? Members of the Mars Venus Message Board often share stories of meeting people and after a very short amount of time, report feeling like they have met their soul mate. While this scenario does work out for some couples, more often than not, instant relationships fizzle as quickly as they begin. This leaves people feeling hurt, bewildered and uncertain about their prospect of finding love in the future.<br><br>In this all-too-common dating scenario, there are a few common blueprints for this type of relationship:<br><br>1. A couple meets and there is instant chemistry. Very often there is a strong sexual connection and the couple may act on this on the first few dates. This causes the intimate connection to feel instantly stronger. This couple may feel that they are in love after only 2 or 3 dates.<br><br>2. A couple begins dating and the initial connection is felt more strongly by one person in the relationship. This person often takes the role of the pursuer and they work very hard in the beginning to "convince" their new date that this relationship has potential. <span style="color: red;"><strong>Often the pursuer will say things like, "we're meant to be" or that the "connection they feel is special, unique and doesn't happen very often." </strong></span><span style="color: blue;"><strong>The pursued, who doesn't feel the same spark but is honestly looking for love, may overlook their reservations and take a risk and jump into the relationship.</strong></span><br><br>These instant relationships become problematic when the chemistry fades or the illusion passes. Sometimes these feelings start to fade as the relationship deepens, but more often than not, one person abruptly comes to the realization that the initial sense of "intimacy" was nothing more than an illusion. For the new couple, the person who has the "realization" begins to pull away, poof, disappears or simply becomes less interested. For the person who is "unaware of the change" is often left feeling confused and bewildered about what went wrong.<br><br>After a few bad experiences like this one, many people fear they will never find their soul mate. Some even give up hope and stop looking all together.<br><br><strong>The cure for the instant relationship is <span style="color: red;">time. </span></strong>Real love takes time to grow and needs trust and understanding to help it reach its full potential. <strong>Although you may find yourself strongly attracted after a few dates, it is important to reflect upon your feelings and be careful <span style="color: red;">not to move too fast.</span></strong> <strong>The foundations of real love take time. Be honest with yourself when determining if your feelings are anything more than just a crush. </strong><br></div>

Friends who met up almost every single day for the past like 21 days. That's a bit hmmm huh. We are letting things cool these few days but agreed to continue with generally what we have now till the next month deadline i mentioned. He was a lil upset when i suggested we should meet less often but came to the consensus with me when i told him that meeting up too regularly is accelerating frustrations with our problems and magnifying the tension we face.</blockquote>It all begins from here.<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by MÂ©+square:<br><strong>Do you know that you have alot of insecurities?<br><br>Can you identify it?<br><br>Cheers</strong></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><strong>Originally posted by kuri:</strong></div><div class="quote_body"><strong>Yes i m aware of that and he is very aware of that.

This doesn't mean that a successful relationship between you and an Expressive or a Harmonizer is impossible. It simply means that those matches are a less natural fit for you, and those relationships will likely require more work to keep things going smoothly. Here's the complete rundown of how you get along with all the communication types:<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Diplomats</span></strong> with <strong><span style="color: blue;">Diplomats</span></strong>: This is your best match in terms of communication since another Diplomat will usually be happy to work through problems with you. As Diplomats, you'll both typically enjoy openly discussing your thoughts and feelings around issues and will each offer a sympathetic ear to one another.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Diplomats</span></strong> with <strong><span style="color: red;">Expressives</span></strong>: A Diplomat/Expressive pairing can work, but it will likely take some extra effort. Expressives tend to be quick to boil and can be single-minded when they get angry. As a result, their approach to tough conversations may make you feel like they are not listening to you. Before you can establish a truly productive relationship, these are some issues the two of you will want to work through.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Diplomats</span></strong> with <strong><span style="color: olive;">Harmonizers</span></strong>: This match can be successful with a little extra effort. For the most part, Harmonizers dislike discussing negative emotions and are comfortable ignoring some heated topics. This tendency runs quite opposite of your own need to get conflicts out in the open. The two of you may need to find a happy medium between these styles before your relationship can move forward.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Devil1976:<br><br>Don't take it too bad...
