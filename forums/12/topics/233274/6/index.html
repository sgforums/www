The time spent between you two could be short to other people (say 5 min?) but to you two its like an eternity.<br><br>Time has no relevance to the love you two have. You could spend years together and still feel its not enough. On the otherhand, you have only few seconds or not even one second to portray your love and it can feel like its there forever.<br><br>Even when that person has left you (for reasons unknown), you can still feel the love. The love which is supposedly past once you two are seperated but yet it is there. Its like getting 101/100 for some test.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </div></blockquote>that's sweet yet painful.<br><br>remb when he told me a few days ago that if one day i decided to leave him i could never come back to him he said once his love for somebody has been transformed to another form of love it could never revert back. just like he "loves" his ex in that he geninuely wishes her the best in life despite her betrayals but wants no contact with her and using the cliche if we would both fall into the sea analogy he'd save me first then figure out how to save his ex.<br><br>he asked me if i felt okie after he mentioned that i told him i did and i really did. that's why i was really stumped at his reaction ytd at the mention of my ex. but the difference is that he wasnt upset when he/me mentioned his ex. mayb he felt really terrible cos he thinks i still miss my ex he's really worried that i will run back to my ex or smt leaving him stranded in despair.</div>
