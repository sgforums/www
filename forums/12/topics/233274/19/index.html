If both still wanted to go into the relationship, there are bound to be alot of turmoils and waves. Unless both side HAVE faith in this relationship and made the decision and persevere no matter what, its hard to get a good ending out of it.<br><br>Opening up the can of worms now can go both ways as you have guessed, but since its already a can of worms... might as well settle it before it grows into a tub of worms. Kuri has to let the guy know he too has issues he thought he had left behind but never totally kicked it out. From how he is treating her, its unfair to her because he expected too much of her based on his past cruel relationships.<br><br>One thing though: These are only our suggestions and comments. You have to make your OWN DECISIONS.

If both still wanted to go into the relationship, there are bound to be alot of turmoils and waves. Unless both side HAVE faith in this relationship and made the decision and persevere no matter what, its hard to get a good ending out of it.<br><br>Opening up the can of worms now can go both ways as you have guessed, but since its already a can of worms... might as well settle it before it grows into a tub of worms. Kuri has to let the guy know he too has issues he thought he had left behind but never totally kicked it out. From how he is treating her, its unfair to her because he expected too much of her based on his past cruel relationships.<br><br>One thing though: These are only our suggestions and comments. You have to make your OWN DECISIONS. Perhaps you can read the <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=225405" rel="nofollow">guidelines</a> (its hyperlinked hor) so you know what I meant in this paragraph.</div></blockquote>Yes, more or less right. If TS really wants to keep this relationship, the can of worms would still have to be dealt with at the end of the day. It's just a matter of sharing it or leaving him to digest his own can of worms...?</div>
