We are letting things cool these few days but agreed to continue with generally what we have now till the next month deadline i mentioned. He was a lil upset when i suggested we should meet less often but came to the consensus with me when i told him that meeting up too regularly is accelerating frustrations with our problems and magnifying the tension we face.</div>

You think that if you throw tantrums and he gives in to you all the time, then that must mean he loves you a lot. Or maybe this is just one of your ways to demand and seek his attention...<br><br>There are many other ways to get your bf's attention and to get him to prove his love for you, but not in this way which will make both of you unhappy. You are not like this towards your other frens because you do not have this subconscious need to test them whether they love you or not. And notice you said you are like this only after you started to fall for him, in a way you are trying to find something that will convince you that he is really true towards you. So the root of this problem lies in your insecurities and also your uncertainty about whether he is really in love with you...<br><br>Look for the little things he has done for you, and in those you will truly find the proof of his love <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
