Your lack of confidence is mere reflection of your previous failure in relationship/s (or at least, it didn't turn out to something that you truly hoped it would be?). Somehow, your mind capture the essence of an 'unloving self', which is something you are unable to brush away unconsciously and provided the underlying root reason to reject him.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kuri:</div><div class="quote_body">Well,if i were to fall in love with him eventually it would be due to wat i said earlier i like him for,his patience with me. it is mainly that which attracts me to him.<br><br><span style="color: red;">But i dun see anything bout me that would interest him in the first place so i dun see why would he claimed to have fallen in love with me?</span><br>This is stirring up a lot of insecurities in me.<br><br>For starters, i am playful, quirky, unpredictable and perhaps immature, the definitely need to be coaxed all the time insecure kiddie. The kind who in his own words had considered a "dangerous girl" to him.<br>He was a serious young man with stable secure career and stuff who wanted a serious gf who would eventually be his life partner. I pointed out that difference to him and implied that perhaps he had thought he had fallen for me cos i m a new thrill, even asked him explicitly "are you sure it's not on impulse?" several times.<br>He told he's old enough and been thru sufficient experience to know how he feels and what he wants.<br><br>Cos this insecurity and the incompatiability which i pointed out, i m worried i would break his heart eventually or he would mine so i hav been pacing back and forth, cos i m unsure whether a relationship with him would have any chance of working out.<br><br>Also he's under a lot of stress lately, starting to show some signs of tireness towards having to be so sensitive to me and having to deal with my baby tantrums at times. </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Your above reply revealed some deep gnawing inferiority - your incessant suspicion and doubt about his feelings for you mirrors exactly how it appears inside your troubled emotions. This 'unloving self' creeps in from some unfortunate experience and mutated rampantly into your perception and attitude towards love.<br><br>It's so blatant whenever I come across such virulent mindset and that he/she believes, to certain great extend, that they are not 'entitled' any fulfilling relationship. And because the mind refuse to believe that they are 'lovable' and they are also have the prerogative to any fulfilling relationship, they will always behave and react in a manner to compensate this negative mindset.<br><br>This is shown through your pseudo-testing of his patience and intentional provocative attitude to create a self fulfilling prophesy - that you are indeed 'unlovable', immature and not able to make this love a reality because you want to coerce him to concede. When he finally gives this up altogether, your subconscious goes 'Ah... I knew it... I am this bad...' and reinforced whatever false belief you foolishly cling on.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In the end, you may regret... and probably live with it forever if things are irrevocable. </strong></span><br><br>Bear paints a likely scenario if your mindset continues to degenerate in this manner and it could possibly repeat onto the next guy and start another series of karmic cycle.<br><br>Your insecurity comes from yourself - resolve your negativity and mindset to gain clarity.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Try to get over your ex first before starting a new relationship first? It'll be fair for him and I do hope he's fair to you too.<br><br>No I can tell he's trying to rush you into a relationship. Be patient with yourself first. When you know you are secure, try to think about the relationship later. It's still not too late. Cos you know what? A relationship can make you more insecure when you are already not secure. It can cause a lot of problems in the future if you don't settle those insecurity issues.<br><br>doko</div>

I've known faster ones. But do slow it down. Right now, both your status are "friends".<br><br>There are a few questions:<br><br>How did you meet him?<br><br>There are many possibilities why he's hurt. It could be he's hurt by the many big/small tantrums you throw at him and he can't take it anymore. Seriously, I think you really need to control yourself. There are girls who throw tantrums a lot of times and there are girls who throw much lesser. Is this part of your character?<br><br>Then again, is this called patience? Patience is about getting to know each other slowly, even though the chemistry is there. When everything is too fast, you crash and burn fast.<br><br>How did your reply the sms?<br><br>He's complaining to you. He's not taking it easy. His patience is wearing thin.<br><br>doko<br></div>

Truly loving a person will make you a happier person. Your self-esteem is not at stake. You don't work your life around the person only. You see and accept the faults of the person, perhaps to like the faults too.
