            <div class='col-md body'>Just adding my 2 cents worth. Your story is certainly a very sad one and although I've not been in that kind of situation, I do have some friends who pine for a guy/gal for years and end up heartbroken.<br><br>Sometimes it is not about what you do for her or don't do. From what you described, she seems like a very confused individual. Maybe it will be wise not to get into a r/s with her, it may be a blessing in disguise that she did not reciprocate your feelings.<br><br>I guess she did try to like you back but feelings cannot be forced. Either it is there, or it is not. Both of you will end up being even more miserable if it is a one-sided love affair. Although it hurts a lot now, your emotional wounds will heal over time. It is better to cut your losses short now... and focus your energy on something more worthwhile.</div>

Put in so much effort but didn't get what he want. Actually, there is no explaination for the so call "feeling". It is a chemistry between 2 person. It cannot be explain, cannot be force. It just come naturally. Sometimes it is the not the problem with the person himself, not what it is done for that person and not even what the person look like or what you buy for that person. It is that kind of feeling where your heart beat faster whenever you see that person, your throat gets dry, you start to miss the person after 1 min not looking at that person. You want to look at that person with all the time you have. I think your guy friend should know what I meant here. Or i think people should have this kind of experience. They is someone you know who is so perfect, beautiful, nice, gentle, sensitive but you do not fall for her but for someone who is totally the opposite of her. I think you should ask your guy friend to not to be so stubborn about this relationship. He should actually wish her happiness with he guy the gal like. To think how hard it is for that gal to change from a Les to a normal gal and finally found someone she really like. He should feel happy for her if he really like her. Sometimes, ÃƒÃ£Ã‡Â¿ÃŠÃ‡Â²Â»Â»Ã¡Ã“Ã�Ã�Ã’Â¸Â£ÂµÃ„. Also, do not call him stupid lah. He is just trying hard for his own happiness only.</div>
