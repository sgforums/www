My fren waited for a gal for 4 yrs (similar case as U...) in da end did not get together coz of da same reason... no feelings... so he now bcame aloof... (sorta...) but 1 thing YOU have an advantage over my fren... U r young, he is like 24-5?<br>U still have other chances... but for him? I tink he needed more therapy from me &amp; my poly frens...<br>I too was in similar case as yrs... but never got to dat far as to do anything for her... I juz waited for da "right" opportunity b4 I finally gave up... (5+ yrs...) As long as she happy, I content... (cannot be she happy, I happy wat... she happy but not wif me, how can I be happy? thus can only be content...)</div>
