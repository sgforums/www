              <p>That is the way some teachers are. You throw questions as them, they throw questions back at you. This does not mean that they are lousy, as some teachers do so because they want you to think through about concepts yourself first.</p>
              <p>On the otherhand, there are of course some teachers who can't be bothered to answer your questions, hence they keep trying to interrupt you so as to shut your mouth up.</p>
              <p>There is nothing much you can do on your part except to listen to them, regardless of which category your teacher comes from. You can try telling your teacher next time to listen to what you have to say first before they talk, but note that you will have to put it in a polite manner. This is when you will figure out which category your teacher comes from.</p>
              <p>If it is the former, then good for you, he/she will listen to you, but if it is the latter, oh well, there is nothing much you can do.</p>

              <p>You are not the only one here who seems to have something against RP.</p>
              <p>I am not going to comment on RP since I am not from there, but I can tell you there is nothing much that you can do against a lecturor.</p>
              <p>Just be proud of the fact that you are one of the students who bothered to work hard and listen in classes, and since you are going to graduate soon, do continue working hard for the remaining period of time.</p>

              <p>replying to PedoBear's post, I did not even consider doing a bad job cause for most of my lessons in class, I put in a lot of effort to understand the concept well and I spend time during my breaks preparing myself on what to say. So that when I explain, it makes complete sense.</p>
              <p>and for marcteng's post, I don't normally SMS or email my concept to my faci. Twitter also not an option for me to consider.</p>

              <p><br>hey, i am from RP also haha.</p>
              <p>just wanna let u know that, what ever you prepare to say during your breaks, doesn't necessarily make sense to the other teams. different ppl, different understanding.</p>
              <p>you might have went too deep into the topic and that might make the faci's job harder since they have to clean up the possible confusion caused by you. so they step in.</p>
              <p>OR</p>
              <p>the way u explained only u understand, so the faci was trying to change the way of your explaination to one where the class can understand. The faci's job is to make sure the class got a general level of understanding.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>try explaning to your teams or to your faci first, if they give the green light then go ahead. use that during the 3rd meeting. drawing on board is a bad choice, trust me.</p>
              <p>instead use the ppt, circle or box the information, use animation to make it a step by step explaination.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>hope that helps. :)</p>
