            <div class='col-md body'>Need some sensible advise from all clear minded ones, on how to deal with this stupid office politics.<br><br>I am not the kind that like to be involved and I don't have the time for that.  I have goals and targets to meet and little help (basically very much on my own as my superior is also busy).<br><br>But hor.... got some bloody backstabber trying to play dirty behind my back.<br><br>The story goes like this....<br>Last Friday, apparently somebody called SPH to leak out something to them (company/project info that concerns my area).  He/She claimed to be a staff of my company.  After that, the SPH reporter called my ex-GM who was serving her last day there.  After that, that is today, the ex-GM called my new GM about this.  But she has, apparently, not mention who the reporter is (normally reporters will identify themselves, if I'm not wrong).<br><br>My new GM, who's not in town at the moment, angrily sent a very harsh email to my superior, telling him that the culprit has to be from my department and she wants the person to own up.<br><br>Somehow, I am sure that the culprit behind this are : my colleague (who is damn jealous that our new immediate superior is my ex boss) and the ex-GM who loves my this bloody colleague like hell.<br><br>What do you think I should do?  I am just afraid that if the new GM is someone who likes to anyhow jump into conclusion, likely she will conclude I'm the person.  I told my concern to my immediate superior, but he told me that I need not explain anything or speak with the new GM about this if I didn't do it.<br><br>How ah?<br><br>I damn du lan already.  I quiet quiet do my work, dun play politics and still that jealous colleague of mine and the ex-GM went around telling all other staff to be careful of me (like I'm going to play dirty behind their back).  The more quiet I keep, the more they say, cuz (I think) they are worried about what's going on in my mind and what game I am going to play.<br><br>Nabei!  Dun play with them also must drag me into it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>I hope they die faster!</div>

The f.ucker who did this balls drop man.<br><br>Also your willingness to go to higher authorities will prove your innocence and make your new GM scared also since prospect of going to CPIB or SGX will eventually bring to the attention of all the big big BIG bosses and directors may not be what the new GM wants to give an impression thatshe is unable to handle the new department. In the end the whole episode may even be hushed up but it's a plus point for you since your GM and all the bosses will know your integrity and nobody will ever dare to mess with you ever again when they know you are someone who goes for broke <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

But she has, apparently, not mention who the reporter is (normally reporters will identify themselves, if I'm not wrong).<br><br>My new GM, who's not in town at the moment, angrily sent a very harsh email to my superior, telling him that the culprit has to be from my department and she wants the person to own up.<br><br>Somehow, I am sure that the culprit behind this are : my colleague (who is damn jealous that our new immediate superior is my ex boss) and the ex-GM who loves my this bloody colleague like hell.<br><br>What do you think I should do?  I am just afraid that if the new GM is someone who likes to anyhow jump into conclusion, likely she will conclude I'm the person.  I told my concern to my immediate superior, but he told me that I need not explain anything or speak with the new GM about this if I didn't do it.<br><br>How ah?<br><br>I damn du lan already.  I quiet quiet do my work, dun play politics and still that jealous colleague of mine and the ex-GM went around telling all other staff to be careful of me (like I'm going to play dirty behind their back).  The more quiet I keep, the more they say, cuz (I think) they are worried about what's going on in my mind and what game I am going to play.<br><br>Nabei!  Dun play with them also must drag me into it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>I hope they die faster!</div></blockquote>if u didn't do it, no point explaining becuz it will make u even more suspicious. juz go as normal and insist ur innocence.. which is true. den look out for anybody suspicious.. becuz guilty people will might show signs.<br><br>now im wondering if ur immediate supervisor will tell yr new GM dat u spoke with him..</div>

The f.ucker who did this balls drop man.<br><br>Also your willingness to go to higher authorities will prove your innocence and make your new GM scared also since prospect of going to CPIB or SGX will eventually bring to the attention of all the big big BIG bosses and directors may not be what the new GM wants to give an impression thatshe is unable to handle the new department. In the end the whole episode may even be hushed up but it's a plus point for you since your GM and all the bosses will know your integrity and nobody will ever dare to mess with you ever again when they know you are someone who goes for broke <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>like hell it wld go this way.. she wasn't even accused (officially). looking to die. : <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
