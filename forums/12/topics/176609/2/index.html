At least he / she can understand and be on your side... You've yet to see politics where people stabs you and your superior just JOIN IN BLINDLY... That was somehow my past and currently there's still a 'pest boss' on our trail... Somehow I reckon I hold certain information which can just TWIST the TABLE AROUND.. The most I give up my job if I have to after I STAB him JIAKLAT JIAKLAT... He's a PROFESSIONAL and would lost his CAREER and REPUTATION ALTOGETHER... Ironically I just don't wish to go that far... Hence I often think people who plays 'politics' in such ways are just pushing the buttons and waiting for one to send them to their death...<br><br>I can teach you some ways to 'counter' if you like..? For suggestions...? But... Seriously... It's often a 'never ending story'... End of the day, the company suffers and everybody still in the company just suffers along with it...</div>
