              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> You attempt to use credits of the past to justify harboring excessive emotions into the now-defunct relationship. In Love's concept of time (CloUdiSm - Law of Time), I quote: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>'What's dead cannot be revived and what's revived will not be original. What's original will be in the past and what's passed will remain dead.'</strong></span></p>
              <p>Death is often misunderstood - often liken to a form of some massive evil that lurks in dark, abominable to all existence. In fact, it's like an entrance; when one pushes the door, the other side appeared to be pulling - creating one-effect-two-perception situation. This simple relation between life and death in relationship is but our quintessential cosmic growth that expands our higher learning in Love. Neither existence nor non-existence of a relationship contributes to the success/failure of relationship; it's merely a continous process.</p>
              <p>In fact, throughout the lifespan of a relationship - it could gone through several process of 'death and rebirth', as Love evolved through the vicissitude of a relationship, shaped by the couple themselves.</p>
              <p>Nobody says it's easy to move on; but the difference lies in our concept of acceptance, as well as our grieving process. Those that deny their circumstances often find it a struggle to cope with the demands of reality against incongruous delusion that they are trying to upkeep. Many times, the delusion is inherent and self generated, as our false belief strengthen to corroborate with the lies we have gorged ourselves till the point of insanity.</p>
              <p>You perpetually questioned yourself with all the mundane 'why', which incarcerate you with heaps of nonsense and fettered you from moving on. Allow me to shatter some zealous beliefs you have held so dearly - why must a four-and-a-half years of relationship be of something to him as well?</p>
              <p>You must understand that this value, in which you have emotionalize, is exclusive to your own personal belief and does not necessarily means the same on his side. His action suggested a strategy of hook-bait-reel-release technique in retention initiative and if you are foolish enough to buy the tale of the 'I-like-the-other-woman-but-I-love-you' crap - then don't weep if you ultimately realize the poignant truth that could ruin all good memories, which is probably all you have left right now. </p>
              <p>You cannot judge the future based on the rules of the past. You will always be miserable if you cling onto expired game rules that disallow you to unlock your gate to freedom. </p>
              <p>To move on, you don't have to run. You just need to draw your first step.</p>
              <p>Start walking: a step in a day will mean ten steps in ten days and a hundred steps in a hundred days.</p>
              <p>Remember, we are responsible for our own happiness and misery. If you choose to dwell, nobody can coerce you to climb out, other than yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>Basically you need to let go of this relationship and the memories of it so that you can move on to bigger and better things. I think you are at a stage whereby you know and want to let go but your feelings and memories of your ex is holding you back. You should be quite a sentimental person because it has already been a year since your breakup with him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only way you can "break free" me thinks is to detach yourself from him and memories of your past relationship. Get to know new ppl, have minimum communication with him or none if possible. Also think of why he broke up with you and ask yourself, is it worth it to get back into the same relationship with the possibility of getting hurt the same way again..</p>

              <p>I know very clearly myself that it's not worth it at all. I know myself that even if we can get back together there is always a barrier between us because of the hurt and all the heartless things he has once done. I know he's at no fault treating me like that cause when you don't love someone anymore it's like that but i can't help to feel disappointed with the way he's treating me. He keep trying to come back to my life after the breakup and now that i wanted him back in my life he's taking me like a fool telling me that things is already in the past ask me to move on to forget than why give me fake feelings in the first place.</p>

              <p>Donno why i keep having this thought that if he comes back and i have move on then he'll be left alone. Trying to accept other guys or going out with them makes me felt guilty. Thinking if i really accept this new guy and what if he comes back. I know these are rubbish thinking. I know why should i care and bothered about him but sometimes somethings are not within my control.</p>

              <p>Donno why i keep having this thought that if he comes back and i
              have move on then he'll be left alone. Trying to accept other guys
              or going out with them makes me felt guilty. Thinking if i really
              accept this new guy and what if he comes back. I know these are
              rubbish thinking. I know why should i care and bothered about him
              but sometimes somethings are not within my control.</p>

              <p>Why do you even care that he would be lonely? Lolz. If I were you, I would be damn happy if his current gf broke up with him. My ex broke up with the girl he got together with behind my back a year later, and when I found out, I was laughing my ass off. Yea, I am evil, but I don't even think about how he would be lonely, bla bla etc. I just see it as his retribution.</p>
              <p>The reason why you still feel guilty is because you allow yourself to be. You still think of you and him as an item. You have to get this fact into your head: There is no longer "US" between the two of you. The day he decided to go with the girl and left you behind, you are no longer in his life, you are no longer obliged to date him exclusively.</p>
              <p>So keep an open mind and go out with other guys. Don't feel guilty if you start to like one of them. You have the right to live freely and happily ever after without him.</p>
