              <p>It's been nearly a year since we broke off. But i am still struck here on the same point where he left me.</p>
              <p>He gave me all sorts of reason saying that he wants a breakup pushing all the blame to me. 2days later when i went to look for him again to try and save our relationship, i saw a lovebite on his neck. That kind of pain in my heart was undescrible. He already has a new gf.</p>
              <p>The reason we quarrel and ended breaking up was because i found out that he have been chatting with this gal. I didnt expect things to turn out like that. Moments before we quarrel he was still lovingly holding my hand.</p>
              <p>Being with him for 4 and a half year. We have even thought of starting our own family. We have even went to apply for a flat together. Little did i expect him to have a change of heart. Just moments after he break off with me. Maybe 4 years plus wasn't long but we have gone through so much ups and downs together, how would a guy say forget, let go and leave just like that?</p>
              <p>He's happily with the gal now but here i am couldnt move on. I thought i had already let go. Trying not to think but he kept calling me and ask me out. He doesnt have any intention in patching back. He just need someone's accompany when his gf is working. His calling and all, triggered the love i had for him that i had all along tried to hide and not to think, i kept telling everyone that i am oki and i have already forgotten him. In fact, i am just lying to myself.</p>
              <p>I cried everytime i think of him, everytime i thought of all our memories, all the promise that he has once made, everytime when i passby the places we have went to before. There is so much so much memories everywhere.</p>
              <p>I wanted to move on and forget about him but i just couldnt stop thinking. I donno if i am still waiting for him to come back. I am so confused myself. What a useless gal.</p>

              <p>You don't need a jerk-off like him.</p>
              <p>If 4 years together ends like this, he's a major waste of time. Take it in your stride, you are too good for someone like him.</p>
              <p>Talk it out to your friends, that's what they're for, bottling it up is unnecessary.</p>

              <p>Girl i think you should stop going out with him .</p>
              <p>Think of it this way . If he`s using u just to kill time while his other gf is working . And all the crap that he has done to you in the past . It` just not worth it babe.</p>
              <p>What u really need now is some one to pour your heart out to . Talk to some close friends or hack even ur parents about it . This way u`ll learn to forget him and move on . Although it`s easier said then done but it still has to be done .</p>
              <p>Do u want to still be like this 2 years down the road . Keeping him company when he dont even give a damn about you and let him use you forever ?</p>
              <p>U should also keep yourself occupied . Take up courses . Learn new things meet more people . That way you`ll find the guy who will really love you for who you are .</p>

              <p>Donno if he's really making use of me. Hmm maybe he is ba. Yes i have already shared with my friends, they dislike him alot since we break off cos he have done alot of things towards me. They don even like to hear about him.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Beginning of the breakup, i thought i could forget him. I took up courses keep myself very busyÂ but as time goes by and with all his calling my stand wasn't firm anymore. He gave me wrong signal again treated me very well and now when i realise that i still love him, he ask me to forget about him. Then why in the 1st place keep calling me for the smallest matter and insist in keeping contact.</p>

              <p>This relationship has come full circle.</p>
              <p>He cheated on you , now he cheats on her with you.. how wonderful !!!</p>
              <p>You've gotten the revenge on that woman you so deserve ! Do make sure his current girlfriend gets light on some of your sweet, mushy, steamy messages....</p>
              <p>Make him horny... on those nights you know she is with him..... let his thoughts be filled with you.. on the bed they share.</p>
              <p>Now.. this guy you so love.. must be sooo delirious...</p>
              <p>After all.. what else can he ask for ?Â  TWO stupid woman.. crying their eyes out for him.</p>
              <p>Now.. I wonder.. he got a big cock issit ? Don't forget.. good stuff are for sharing. EH ?</p>

              <p>Why should i?</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>I hate third party myself. I would not do such a thing. I hate that gal alot super lot. There's alot of things that she did which is unbelivable. She would have her retribution one day.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Or maybe she is really that good way better than me and my relationship just wasn't strong enough.</p>

              <p>He'll come charging back, begging for you to take him.</p>
