              <p><br>then is time for you to forget about him, why still think to much about him if you want to move on? To move on you have to completely forget about him, and not expecting him to come back to you.</p>

              <p>When we were together he was still serving NS, we gone through alot of difficult times. All the quarrel we had makes us stronger each time. I don understand why couldn't we go through this time.</p>

              <p>He was very good to me when we are together. Not that he did not care, i guess i just took him for granted at times. I regret my doings but i know there wun be such a time for me to make up my wrong doings.</p>

When i first break up with him i keep it away telling myself i should forget i even save all the photos from my com to a disc so that i wun get to see but i wanna keep as memories but again as time goes by it's back in my wallet, and now the ring he bought is back on my finger. I know i shouldn't but i tell myself i will remove it one day when i found a very good reason to.</p>

              <p>Dang.. I really feel ur pain.. Goosebumps as I read your post.. 4 years maybe just a time to some but it is long enough to filled your memories with such things. At my 5th year last year, I was almost in the same scenario as you but yours gotta hurt more because, he "cheated" on you. So I can really feel some of the pain your feeling and I know that some of the forumners here are willing to share the sorrow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your not a useless girl. For loving someone and be faithful, that is something which not many can achieve. As hard as it can be, you have to first convince yourself that memories are just memories and it should be worth just a reminiscing sigh. You gotta pick up the pieces of your life and move on. Fill your days with activities to keep your mind of him. Meet and make new friends. Spend more fun times with existing friends. Its the only way to help ease the pain. Time heals all wound eventually and that is a very true fact but problem is how long? Only yourself can decide. We can't decide for you. But do go out with friends and fill up ur time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I wish you all the best. God bless and be strong. Go for it! ^^</p>

              <p>Dang.. I really feel ur pain.. Goosebumps as I read your post.. 4 years maybe just a time to some but it is long enough to filled your memories with such things. At my 5th year last year, I was almost in the same scenario as you but yours gotta hurt more because, he "cheated" on you. So I can really feel some of the pain your feeling and I know that some of the forumners here are willing to share the sorrow.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your not a useless girl. For loving someone and be faithful, that is something which not many can achieve. As hard as it can be, you have to first convince yourself that memories are just memories and it should be worth just a reminiscing sigh. You gotta pick up the pieces of your life and move on. Fill your days with activities to keep your mind of him. Meet and make new friends. Spend more fun times with existing friends. Its the only way to help ease the pain. Time heals all wound eventually and that is a very true fact but problem is how long? Only yourself can decide. We can't decide for you. But do go out with friends and fill up ur time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I wish you all the best. God bless and be strong. Go for it! ^^</p>

              <p>No problem :) I used to be in this situation, my useless ex was flirting with another girl behind my back and broke up with me to get together with her a few days later. At first I had thought I would not be able to get over it, but I did, with the help of friends and the forumites here of course.</p>
              <p>What you need to do is to stay far, far away from him. Cut him out from your life altogether. If his number is still in your phone, erase it. Better still if you can change your phone number altogether and don't give him your new number. If he is in your MSN, block him. You get the idea.</p>
              <p>It is easier to get over someone if he is out of your sight. It might be painful to do in the beginning, but you will be thankful you did in the long run. If I didn't do all these last time, I would not be able to meet another guy who is much much better than my ex, and is also my husband now <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
