              <p>8 years later she married and have a child with other person.</p>
              <p>i still love her and miss her and even though its been 8 years , i still think of her and the happy time we have together.</p>
              <p>this 8 years isnt easy for me to pass by and sometimes its really hurts been alone.</p>
              <p>"time will heal" other say so. but 8 years didnt heal me.</p>

              <p>u are suffering now because u have became alone . that Y u are thinking of the happy past time u have with him</p>
              <p>but i know that once u have a new guy in yr life. u will be able to slowly forget the jerk that hurt u.</p>
              <p>it might not be possible for u to find 1 new guy now . but take yr time</p>
              <p>its ok to cry gal.</p>

              <p>It's been nearly a year since we broke off. But i am still
                          struck here on the same point where he left me.</p>
              <p>He gave me all sorts of reason saying that he wants a breakup
                          pushing all the blame to me. 2days later when i went to look for
                          him again to try and save our relationship, i saw a lovebite on his
                          neck. That kind of pain in my heart was undescrible. He already has
                          a new gf.</p>
              <p>The reason we quarrel and ended breaking up was because i found
                          out that he have been chatting with this gal. I didnt expect things
                          to turn out like that. Moments before we quarrel he was still
                          lovingly holding my hand.</p>
              <p>Being with him for 4 and a half year. We have even thought of
                          starting our own family. We have even went to apply for a flat
                          together. Little did i expect him to have a change of heart. Just
                          moments after he break off with me. Maybe 4 years plus wasn't long
                          but we have gone through so much ups and downs together, how would
                          a guy say forget, let go and leave just like that?</p>
              <p>He's happily with the gal now but here i am couldnt move on. I
                          thought i had already let go. Trying not to think but he kept
                          calling me and ask me out. He doesnt have any intention in patching
                          back. He just need someone's accompany when his gf is working. His
                          calling and all, triggered the love i had for him that i had all
                          along tried to hide and not to think, i kept telling everyone that
                          i am oki and i have already forgotten him. In fact, i am just lying
                          to myself.</p>
              <p>I cried everytime i think of him, everytime i thought of all our
                          memories, all the promise that he has once made, everytime when i
                          passby the places we have went to before. There is so much so much
                          memories everywhere.</p>
              <p>I wanted to move on and forget about him but i just couldnt stop
                          thinking. I donno if i am still waiting for him to come back. I am
                          so confused myself. What a useless gal.</p>

              <p>Death is often misunderstood - often liken to a form of some
                          massive evil that lurks in dark, abominable to all existence. In fact,

                          appeared to be pulling - creating one-effect-two-perception situation.
                          This simple relation between life and death in relationship is but our
                          quintessential cosmic growth that expands our higher learning in Love.
                          Neither existence nor non-existence of a relationship contributes to
                          the success/failure of relationship; it's merely a continous process.</p>
              <p>In
                          fact, throughout the lifespan of a relationship - it could gone through
                          several process of 'death and rebirth', as Love evolved through the
                          vicissitude of a relationship, shaped by the couple themselves.</p>
              <p>Nobody says it's easy to move on; but the difference lies in our
                          concept of acceptance, as well as our grieving process. Those that deny
                          their circumstances often find it a struggle to cope with the demands
                          of reality against incongruous delusion that they are trying to upkeep.
                          Many times, the delusion is inherent and self generated, as our false
                          belief strengthen to corroborate with the lies we have gorged ourselves
                          till the point of insanity.</p>
              <p>You perpetually questioned yourself
                          with all the mundane 'why', which incarcerate you with heaps of
                          nonsense and fettered you from moving on. Allow me to shatter some
                          zealous beliefs you have held so dearly - why must a four-and-a-half
                          years of relationship be of something to him as well?</p>
              <p>You must
                          understand that this value, in which you have emotionalize, is
                          exclusive to your own personal belief and does not necessarily means
                          the same on his side. His action suggested a strategy of
                          hook-bait-reel-release technique in retention initiative and if you are
                          foolish enough to buy the tale of the
                          'I-like-the-other-woman-but-I-love-you' crap - then don't weep if you
                          ultimately realize the poignant truth that could ruin all good
                          memories, which is probably all you have left right now. </p>
              <p>You
                          cannot judge the future based on the rules of the past. You will always
                          be miserable if you cling onto expired game rules that disallow you to
                          unlock your gate to freedom. </p>
              <p>To move on, you don't have to run. You just need to draw your first step.</p>
              <p>Start walking: a step in a day will mean ten steps in ten days and a hundred steps in a hundred days.</p>
              <p>Remember,
                          we are responsible for our own happiness and misery. If you choose to
                          dwell, nobody can coerce you to climb out, other than yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              which incarcerate you with heaps of nonsense and fettered you from
              moving on. Allow me to shatter some zealous beliefs you have held
              so dearly - why must a four-and-a-half years of relationship be of
              something to him as well?</p>
              <p>You must understand that this value, in which you have
              emotionalize, is exclusive to your own personal belief and does not
              necessarily means the same on his side. His action suggested a
              strategy of hook-bait-reel-release technique in retention
              initiative and if you are foolish enough to buy the tale of the
              'I-like-the-other-woman-but-I-love-you' crap - then don't weep if
              you ultimately realize the poignant truth that could ruin all good
              memories, which is probably all you have left right now. </p>
              <p>You cannot judge the future based on the rules of the past. You
              will always be miserable if you cling onto expired game rules that
              disallow you to unlock your gate to freedom. </p>
              <p>To move on, you don't have to run. You just need to draw your
              first step.</p>
              <p>Start walking: a step in a day will mean ten steps in ten days
              and a hundred steps in a hundred days.</p>
              <p>Remember, we are responsible for our own happiness and misery.
              If you choose to dwell, nobody can coerce you to climb out, other
              than yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
