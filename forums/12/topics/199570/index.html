            <div class='col-md body'>dreams are a figment of reality. its when ur sub concious mind comes in and what you have been thinking appear to you in the form of dreams... these dreams will not sprout out of nothing, there is bound to be something that has made ur sub concious mind so errrm demonic. i suggest clearing ur mind completely before sleeping. do not think of anything, think about your breathing... its like meditating before you sleep. when u finally do, most likely will have dreamless sleep which will mean a big relief for you. if it doesnt work, just cut down on ur demonic crap and seek solace in something more worthwhile...</div>
