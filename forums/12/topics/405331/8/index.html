              <p>Haha, I'm only 11 yrs older than u.</p>
              <p>Good luck for your Os. You can still go out with your group of friends, but please do not let them affect your O levels preparations. Stick more with those with the same goals of scoring well.</p>
              <p>Example:</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friends group 1</strong></span><br>Mei Ting: I want to score all A1s.<br>Friend: Siao ah. Don't be such a chao mugger la. Relax. Come out play with us. O levels only nia. Very easy one, no need to study so hard de. (But do they take the same paper as you?)</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Friends group 2</strong></span><br>Mei Ting: I want to score all A1s.<br> Friend: Me too! On, let work hard together to do well and score our A1s for O levels.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Get the gist?</p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>Was he protecting you, or was he really being possessive, telling other people to stay away from what is his? Lots of other guys do that, and there are also lots of guys are more easygoing and let other guys talk to you. There is nothing particularly special about it.</p>
              <p>A good boyfriend or girlfriend though will never emotionally blackmail you and encourage you to skive/<em>ponteng </em>to spend time <em>with him.</em> He'd want the best for you.</p>
              <p>I've read that all of us become the average of the 5 people we spend the most time with. Remember that: do you want to be as unsophisticated as your friends and partner are telling you to be, or do you want more?</p>
