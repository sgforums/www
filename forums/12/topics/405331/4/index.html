              <p>hellos :) its my first time posting here so pls go easy on me hahas</p>
              <p>  </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ever since im with my bf</span></strong>, my frens started to see my physical appearance started to change. I never pierce before only on my ear but now im with him, i started to pierce my tongue. ok its called culture to me, u all can say to me watever u want but to me its called culture. My bf appearance is quite an ah beng image becos he got a tattoo on his leg but he's a nice guy :). One day we were walking around in cineleisure my father saw me walking with him. When i got home he talked to me and at first he said is he your bf? then i shouldnt be with him and watever. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dont get it why people judge book by its cover? he IS a nice guy. ok <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one day i pon sch becos there's no lesson so no point me go mah. so my bf know abt this and he ask me to pon</span> and meet him and relax/sit around. So i did but that got me thinking with people passer by keep on looking at me wearing a sch uniform when i was suppose to be in sch since its sch hours, i was like stare at them back. i dont think im turning to a gangster it just irritates me when people look at me strangely. Its a reflex and i know u guys do it too</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dont know how but my teachers found out that i pon sch that day and was asked to call my parents. My parents quite flipped and i get hell of a scolding. But what they really flipped is when they saw a drawing (NOT A TATTOO) stick on my under forearm. it can be erase one but they really got mad over that. And they want to see my bf but i wont let them becos i know they want him to leave me alone which i dont want. And they call me a bad girl and my frens now seeing me as a gangster. I shout at my parents for scolding me but i had to, its natural right? we all do it. This is not wat i had in mind. i dont smoke but why they call me a gangster and see me as a bad person? just becos i did all those?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Am i really turning to a bad person?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">btw, i got suspended from sch for 2 weeks now</span></strong>. So im really bored here at home and i browse around just happen to see this site :)</p>

              <p>okies like u all said, i will study hard :). way beyond hard and if possible i try to change him but uh i think he's okay with wat he have now so far... well erm he's talented in something to do with pc. He taking private in psb design so i trust him can do well hahas and he got job experience if he leaves his job now so i think he have higher chance of getting another better job :)</p>
              <p>blurking&gt; NOOO i didnt. i was out yesterday and ty for the pregnancy warning tip hahas :). yup i try wont get pregnant then</p>
              <p>terminator, mlmers and mancha&gt; i learn my lesson. Although its hard to keep calm over such issues if they keep on nagging about the same thing over an over u know &gt;&lt;. yup but if u guys can do it so can i :). I really talk to him about all that and erm he doesnt look quite happy =_= .... im not sure we broke up but he didnt contact me for quite a while now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>littlemissbonkers&gt; ok i read quite a number of post here scolding me with such strong words and i accept that because i deserve it but your post really went overboard. Ur like some heyna joining in together with a pack of wolves. ---what kinda idiot at that age will say stupid
                                                  things like "oh pregnant only ma, what's the big deal? It's just a
                                                  baby"--- your version of saying it and my version of saying it is totally different. I'm just really curious... yes i know i got learn that thru sch but it still leaves some question mark in me so no harm of me getting some few more facts here right? and did i say it is fine of me to continue doing this? if i want to continue of wat im doing, i wouldnt waste my time typing this topic or return to this site to seek more answers. The words u said it out like as if u know that IM ALREADY PREGNANT. But even if i am, i dont want to do that. ur giving away a part of your life. My bf can run away all he wants but that still wont stop me for taking care of my baby. Sure of cos i dont know anything about being a parent but that doesnt mean i have to give away my baby. It really saddens me of wat i did, really regret to see my parents cry over me it is too painful for me. So i make a swear to never do this type of act again. now i know a thing or two about being a parent and guess wat, no matter wat they still support me if things gone worse include pregnancy (not that i want to make it worse or im getting pregnant but it really put a smile into me that they say so). So if u say ruin other peoples life, who's life im ruining? lee kuan yew? people for posting here for helping me? its only my life been ruined. yes my parents too but i swore i never do anything to hurt them but even if i did, MY LIFE AND ONLY MY LIFE is the most major part to get affected. Im not sure why u post that is it becos other people here scold me so u can join in the fun too so u can build your popularity her being bad or watever. Dont be dog within the pack that just bark ok. :)</p>

              <p>My point is, if you want to think very very far ahead, you have to think of financials as well. But right now, the most pressing subject matter is your coming O levels in late Oct, which is very soon. It's once in a lifetime, unless you want to spend extra years of your life to re-take it.</p>

              <p>What is he currently working as? Is he working in the designing industry? I've got this friend, she has a design something diploma from our local poly, yet she is going around asking for projects, and everything also will do because there is simply not enough of such jobs going around. And design is very subjective, from what I understand, most of the jobs are freelance/ project basis. Meaning to say, no fix income. </p>
              <p>I'm sorry that I don't really have a good impression on  your bf due to the things that you have described in this thread. You really got to know if his income is able to sustain you and your future family or not. Don't quote others saying that if that zhi char stall owner can raise 10kids, why not my bf? The quality of life would be very very much different. </p>
              <p>And anyway, bonkers is just saying, don't ruin your baby life if I didn't interpret wrongly.</p>
              <p>Don't be selfish. You WILL NOT be the only one ruined. Your parents, your baby, your family, your boyfriend, his family lives will be ruined. You think your parents won't help you to take care of the baby? Financially, you definitely got to seek their help, unless you are holding a stable job. Then put on the whos-gonna-look-after the kid part and all, you got a whole new mountain of problem. </p>
              <p>And even if you are, what about the baby? The baby won't be able to grow up in a functional family, which would most likely interfere with the child growing-up process. Your boyfriend won't have a great time either. He would be charged with statutory rape as you are under 16. After serving that 2 years in jail, and maybe some rotans involved, his job prospect would most likely to decrease drastically again, and I have yet to factor in those tattoos. </p>
              <p>Can you imagine, your baby would only be able to see his father after 2 years if you two really want to be together and get married? With such implications, his family would definitely be affected. So think twice! </p>
              <p>You asked for advice, and we gave. Whether you want to do it or not, its all up to you. We are definitely not scolding you, but to see a young life being ruin on false impression, it's really a huge waste. </p>

              <p>Eh, your role isn't to try and change him...  How much can
                  he take in per month from there? $1k? $2k? You think that's a
                  lot?</p>
              <p>This is Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My point is, if you want to think very very far ahead, you have
                  to think of financials as well. But right now, the most pressing
                  subject matter is your coming O levels in late Oct, which is very
                  soon. It's once in a lifetime, unless you want to spend extra years
                  of your life to re-take it.</p>

Look at your post, look at bear post, look at the people who insult me post, u guys dont go over the top and i bet they are way more experience then that bonkers person.</p>
