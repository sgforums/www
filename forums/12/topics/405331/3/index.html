              <p>The reason why everyone is telling you not to get pregnant is because there are lots of implications within it. I know it is a mindset to you that even if you get pregnant, you can get abortion... However, you need to think in a deeper aspect...</p>
              <p>First, when you are pregnant, you will have lots of hormonal changes... yr sense of dependence will increase and there will be up and down in yr emotional state... do not tell me that you are good-tempered or can control yr temper... it has nothing to do with that... there are womens who get depressions during pregnancy and anxiety problems... tons of issues i can name it out... For your info, i am a guy... u can rebuke that i do not understand since i am a guy...</p>
              <p>Second, let's say you have given birth... there are lots of financial issues that you need to handle and you need to be there 24/7 for the baby... just say when u r pregnant, u have to go for tests and ultrasound to make sure your baby is safe and normal... there are cases where the baby is deformed or the baby is tangled by the umbilical cord and strangled to death... okay that is for just during pregnancy... after u give birth, hospitilisation bills who will be paying? yr boyfriend? or yr parents? Baby food and products will be needed to purchase... milk powder, clothes, the toys, bed... many things need to take care of...</p>
              <p>Lastly, yes i agree with others that abortion is dangerous to your health... before abortion is done, a clip of the abortion process will be shown to you... it is part of the protocol... and again, there are cases where women become guilty over the abortion and have gone paranoid or developed depression...</p>
              <p>At your age, you can either study hard or go outside to work... but in a few years time, you will compare peers of your age who are doing better in their life... even for now, people with certs are having problem in finding or securing a job...

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>there's really a ton of good advice in this thread.</p>
              <p>There are quite a num of posts that doesn't put your bf in good light, and frankly speaking, I agree with them too. E.g. "Tattoo to remind himself not to do white collar work?" So what job does he want to do? It doesn't make sense because if he doesn't want to do a white collar job (but perhaps start a business?), why would your bf still want to go to a private school to continue studying? Something just doesn't sound right.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's ok to have a relationship, but remember, you are still young, and you still have a long path to go. As pointed out by some, you are smart enough to detect that something isn't quite right, which is why you posted here. And also, we are only giving our opinions, and not helping you make decisions which you should make yourself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During the honeymoon period, all is well, everyone is nice. Problem arises only when there are arguments. Think about this.</p>
              <p>Also, if you were to get pregnant, as many pointed out, the financials involved are tremendous. Marriage itself already require tremendous financial commitment, without including babies. I do have a female pri sch classmate who married young and had two children by the age of 22. But her husband can support them financially with ease. Can your bf? Think about how your parents is fretting over you; put yourself in their shoes, and you will know how hard and tough it is to be a parent.</p>
              <p>And as blurking123 puts in nicely:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>At your age, you can either study hard or go outside to work...
                                      but in a few years time, you will compare peers 
              of your age who are
                                      doing better in their life... even for now, 
              people with certs are
                                      having problem in finding or securing a job... 
              Right now, you can
                                      only do what u can do which is study hard... if 
              not, go outside and
                                      find a job... you will find that studying is 
              better than working
                                      outside...</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>We have been through secondary sch all the way to working life. The quoted advice meant well.</p>
              <p><br>Bear summarized the whole thing well, and it would also be my advice. Do not do anything that you will regret 30 years down the road. Your O levels are coming. If you are really going to be with your bf for the next 40 years and so on, you might one day need the ability to generate income using your certs.</p>

              <p>You're 16 NOT 6, what kinda idiot at that age will say stupid things like "oh pregnant only ma, what's the big deal? It's just a baby."</p>
              <p>Since you think it's fine for you to continue doing all these stupid things, then go ahead. Just don't come back crying when you realised that you've just fucked up own life up.</p>
              <p>And if you do get pregnant, please go for an abortion or give your baby up to some couple who would be better parents than you would be.</p>

              <p>if i found out  that my 18 yr old son made a 16 year old kid pregnant...i would have beaten his face with a fat stick until it gets deformed permananently.as a good father and a real man i demand son work hard for what he wants, collect his medals  earn his keep before having sex and kids.</p>
              <p>maybe i wouldnt bash his face.....to that extent,,,,probably just catch him and slap him  countless times from morning to midnight until he cry and struggle for not werking hard enough for things he want in life.maybe i might even tear off his tattoo from his skin in the process.....that is how u train a real man!</p>
