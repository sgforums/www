              <p>Let me just add on why you should continue to work hard in your studies.</p>
              <p>If you can get a good degree out of uni, your starting salary will be at least $2.5k per month. Even if you decide to go poly and not go uni, your starting salary will be about $1.2~1.5k per month.</p>
              <p>And, if you think your studies are great, why stop at poly? Complete a degree! You could consider the JC route too, as right now, policies are more geared towards JC students.</p>
              <p>$900 per month? If you go uni and take up an internship in the 3rd year in engineering, it's already 700 to 800 per month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really take it as the literal truth that you can do well for your studies. Please do not waste your talent and work hard to secure your A1s, preferably 6 crucial ones. You can decide on poly or JC after you finish your Os.</p>

              <p>Just to add on to that: go down to Orchard Road on a Sunday, and throw a pebble into the crowd. There's a 50% chance that it will hit someone with a university degree. Degree holders are really common these days, and it's getting harder and harder for them to find jobs.</p>
              <p>At this age, mei ting, you may think that earning $900/month is damn pro. But let me tell you something: your parents are the ones who pay for the house you live in, the utilities that you use, the food that you eat, and the clothes that you wear. Try fending for yourself on $900/month, and you'll cry at how impossible it is.</p>
              <p>My girlfriend and I have a combined income of over $6000++ per month, and we're finding it hard as hell to save up to get married and to set up a household. Go figure.</p>

              <p>Just to add on to that: go down to Orchard Road on a Sunday, and
              throw a pebble into the crowd. There's a 50% chance that it will
              hit someone with a university degree. Degree holders are really
              common these days, and it's getting harder and harder for them to
              find jobs.</p>
              <p>At this age, mei ting, you may think that earning $900/month is
              damn pro. But let me tell you something: your parents are the ones
              who pay for the house you live in, the utilities that you use, the
              food that you eat, and the clothes that you wear. Try fending for
              yourself on $900/month, and you'll cry at how impossible it is.</p>
              <p>My girlfriend and I have a combined income of over $6000++ per
              month, and we're finding it hard as hell to save up to get married

              <p>TS, i am glad that you know what we are trying to tell you... at first i thought u have given up hope on this forum... but glad that u did not... i am also glad that u listened to our advices... bear in mind, this forum is like a reflection of society... more or less... you will meet various kinds of people... some people can be harsh but listen carefully to what they are trying to say... they might be harsh yet do remember that they bother to bring up points to you... some people can be nice and put in words nicely yet in reality, the points they mentioned are hard to catch... It is like dropping hints to you, hoping that you will get it... Because they know that the more harsh they become, the more one will try not to understand... (Actually at this point of time, i cannot think well because it is 3.16am in Singapore... I am freaking tired, please pardon me if i am not making sense..) in the future, you have to open yr eyes wide to see this society... u are still in a growing stage... One cannot live a life without regrets but one can live a life with lessons learnt from regrets... Do not be like me in short...</p>
              <p>an advice: whether is he a good guy or a bad guy, we will not know but we can only assume from what you have told us... to change one person's life is difficult since the only person who can change him/her is himself/herself... one has to go through many hardships to become a better person... do not try to change him... i will not say it is impossible but it is not worth an effort... what you can do is to be there for the person, not change the person...The only way to see one's true character is when he is facing a crisis or a trial...</p>
              <p>currently, what Fudgester and Eagle are trying to do is to bring some financial sense into you... you might not understand now... U will definitely understand what we are talking when you look at the world in a bigger picture and experience the different aspects of it... Look at the world with different perspective... When you go outside work or study or even travel, you will know how vast and complex a human mind can be...Also, you will understand how this world works in terms of politics, finance, work, and education... When i am at your age, I also thought that earning $900 is like WOW! it is normal but soon you will know that money is never enough...</p>
              <p>Last advice: For every day you are growing older, so do your parents... One day, they will not be able to be like what they used to be... Take care of yrself meanwhile do take care of yr loved ones...</p>
              <p>Alright, i really need to get some sleep... Good nite everyone!</p>

              <p>i now sec 4 in express. Im not trying to hao lian hor but i did
              really well on my studies :). As usual in sch there's of cos gonna
              be some love, fight, frens here and there. I have a bf and its
              nearly going to be 4 months. This is where my problem slowly
              starts...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ever since im with my bf, my frens started to see my physical
              appearance started to change. I never pierce before only on my ear
              but now im with him, i started to pierce my tongue. ok its called
              culture to me, u all can say to me watever u want but to me its
              called culture. My bf appearance is quite an ah beng image becos he
              got a tattoo on his leg but he's a nice guy :). One day we were
              walking around in cineleisure my father saw me walking with him.
              When i got home he talked to me and at first he said is he your bf?
              then i shouldnt be with him and watever. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dont get it why people judge book by its cover? he IS a
              nice guy. ok one day i pon sch becos there's no lesson
              so no point me go mah. so my bf know abt this and he ask
              me to pon and meet him and relax/sit around. So i did but that
              got me thinking with people passer by keep on looking at me wearing
              a sch uniform when i was suppose to be in sch since its sch hours,
              i was like stare at them back. i dont think im turning to
              a gangster it just irritates me when people look at me
              strangely. Its a reflex and i know u guys do it too</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dont know how but my teachers found out that i pon sch that
              day and was asked to call my parents. My parents quite flipped and
              i get hell of a scolding. But what they really flipped is when they
              saw a drawing (NOT A TATTOO) stick on my under forearm. it can be
              erase one but they really got mad over that. And they want to see
              my bf but i wont let them becos i know they want him to leave me
              alone which i dont want. And they call me a bad girl and my frens
              now seeing me as a gangster. I shout at my parents for scolding me
              but i had to, its natural right? we all do it. This is not wat i
              had in mind. i dont smoke but why they call me a gangster and see
              me as a bad person? just becos i did all those?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Am i really turning to a bad person?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>btw, i got suspended from sch for 2 weeks now. So im really
              bored here at home and i browse around just happen to see this site

              <p>i dont see anything wrong with you.. maybe just a little rebellious.. it's okay one. girls shld be rebellious a bit. if not will bored ple to death. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>anyway, since ur parents know bout ur bf already, why not just tone down a little, guai a bit in front of them. and for the moment, make use of this time to study for ur O levels. when that damn thing is over, den can continue to hardcore pak tor again. but of course not askin u to study 24/7. still can go and see ur bf la. </p>
              <p>when ur parents ask u if your still seeing that dude, just say no, tell em he asked you to stay home to study. leave a lil good impression of him in front of them. </p>

              <p>Xiao Mei Mei,</p>
              <p>Wah you not do thing very smart leh. I was worse than you, in school I smoked, I go play snooker, play arcade while pon school and get involve in gang fights. But I do things smart. When I pon school, I fake my MC and pretend sick. When I get into gang fight and teacher caught me, luckily my class got gangster leader to protect me and teacher not dare to punish me. I was even caught plagiarising my exam, the teacher tried to have an investigation to scare me but in the end they had no proof, they let me go.</p>
              <p>Girl, you do things, you must do it smart also. But now you get 2 weeks suspension, sure your parents will freak out lar. When your father saw you with the boy, you should have said he is a friend, now you admit he is your boyfriend, they sure angry with you one lar. Any small thing happen to your study or your school, they will blame you one. Friend, now is time for you to lie low, tell your bf not to come for a while, pretend to be good girl to your parents for a while. Form 4, you got 2 more years to total freedom, so be patient, don't ruin everything.</p>
              <p>If you study hard and don't pon school get good grades, then your parents will start to slowly give you more freedom. Don't say anything to them about your bf, just tell them you with him are friends. Then when you get more freedom, you get more time to pak tor.</p>

              <p>Let me just add on why you should continue to work hard in your studies.</p>
              <p>If you can get a good degree out of uni, your starting salary will be at least $2.5k per month. Even if you decide to go poly and not go uni, your starting salary will be about $1.2~1.5k per month.</p>
              <p>And, if you think your studies are great, why stop at poly? Complete a degree! You could consider the JC route too, as right now, policies are more geared towards JC students.</p>
              <p>$900 per month? If you go uni and take up an internship in the 3rd year in engineering, it's already 700 to 800 per month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really take it as the literal truth that you can do well for your studies. Please do not waste your talent and work hard to secure your A1s, preferably 6 crucial ones. You can decide on poly or JC after you finish your Os.</p>

              <p>My whole class are gangsters lar. They protect me because I help them to do their homework. In my school, everybody pay homage to the gangsters, everybody is afraid of them.</p>
              <p>So I advice you, be smart, lay low. Study hard because you only have two more years before you enjoy full freedom. If you get good results then your parents got no excuse to split you from your bf. Don't pon school anymore ha, becuase your parents will sure blame your bf wan.</p>

              <p>That's where general opinions rule over you.</p>
              <p>In poly, if you are committed to do well no matter in poly or JC to go to uni, the amount of workload will not lose to that of a JC. I'm not saying which one is better, but pls do not get the opinion that poly is an easy way out.</p>
              <p>Of course, if you are committed to just get a diploma in poly or a pass cert in JC, there's no need to work super hard.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Media design like your bf? If it's your interest, I have nothing to add on. But if you are taking it just because he did it, think again. Do you really have interest in that? And in the long run, are you willing to make $1k per month like your bf, when another diploma could possibly make you $1.5k to $2k a month, or a uni degree from $2k to $3.5k to start?</p>
              <p>Singapore has no minimum wage law hor. If you think you are going to stick with him, I can assure you that even a 50% pay raise to $1.35k from $900 will not be enough to feed with ease. 100% pay raise to $1800 would barely be sufficient if you want to have kids. FYI, the median income in Sg in 2007 for professionals and managers:</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.salary.sg/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/median-income-by-age-group.gif" alt="Median monthly wage by age group"></p>
              <p>As you can see, 900 isn't even sufficient to be on the chart.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.salary.sg/2010/benchmark-your-household-income-2010/">http://www.salary.sg/2010/benchmark-your-household-income-2010/</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The average monthly household income of all householdsis 
              $7,549 in 2009. The median household income is $5,398.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You have the potential to fly further. Don't just look at absolute numbers (e.g. 900). It's very relative.</p>
              <p>Give it 10 years, when you reach my age (assuming you are 16) and you will understand what I mean.</p>

              <p>Just pick a course that you are interested for poly... Do not necessary follow your boyfriend... Do well in O level because the better you do, the more choices you have... I have friends who did not score well and have to pick some courses that they did not like... Do not need to picture yourself too far ahead... Even for me, I do not know if the job i do will be relevant to my degree...</p>
              <p>Do not need to be scared of those rumours... Know what is your weakness and strength... Compare between JC and Poly... For me, I did not enter JC becos I know my English sucks and my GP will suffer... So i pick poly and take biomedical science...</p>
              <p>Also, before i left army... someone told me this... the things you like to do in life is very different from the things you can do in life... you have to work hard or smart to get the things you like to do...</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>Don't be bothered by rumours. If you are eventually planning for uni, currently, the laws favour JC intake more than poly intake.</p>
              <p>I would suggest to give this serious thought, and visit the different polys and JCs during their open houses to have a better idea.</p>
              <p>Just because everyone around you says it is bad doesn't mean it is. Just because everyone around you says it is good doesn't mean it is either. In life, following the masses just makes you part of the masses. Forming your own opinions are usually way better.</p>
              <p>I went JC, I aced JC (year 2001). Yes, I was rather stressed in JC, but the soft skills I picked up... tenacity, self-motivation, stress and time management skills, ability to handle heavy workloads... all which are beneficial and aiding me in life now.</p>

              <p>As I have mentioned, 100% pay raise gives you $1.8k if you rise up in rank?</p>
              <p>It depends on companies. In the MNC I work at, poly grads have a limit on their salary cap and their rank. Uni grads start at a salary range and rank higher than poly grads who have worked here for 10 years.</p>
              <p>None of us discriminate them; some of the things they could do better than most of us. But it's the HR that is unwilling to pay much more than the market rate to them.</p>
              <p>And how much could the freelance job earn you? $200? $500? $1k more per month? Freelancing in media design? Why wouldn't companies outsource to India for a cheaper rate? There are uni grads there willing to do many jobs cheaper than a poly grad asks for here. We live in a global city, and the internet is the superhighway that shrinks the world even further.</p>
              <p>Do bear in mind that sidelines take up much of your free time too.</p>
              <p>If you are indeed planning for a freelance job as a sideline in the future to supplement your income, do think of these two options.</p>
              <p>1) Spend a lot time to play a lot now, go poly and score moderate enough to get a diploma, then when you go out to work, spend the time to do freelance jobs on top of your full time job to earn enough say a total of $3k/mth.</p>
              <p>2) Spend the time to study very hard, go either poly or JC and score very well, well enough to go into uni for the degree of your choice. Graduate, come out to work and start with around $2.8k/mth in full time job without doing freelancing. The spare time, you can choose to freelance or not.</p>
              <p>See the diff? It's a classic example of the chinese proverb å…ˆè‹¦å�Žç”œ. Or the classic wisdom of the west of delayed gratification.</p>
